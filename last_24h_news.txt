Social media companies face legal reckoning over mental health harms to children
Social media companies face legal reckoning over mental health harms to children
For years, social media companies have disputed allegations that they harm children’s mental health through deliberate design choices that addict kids to their platforms and fail to protect them from sexual predators and dangerous content. Now, these tech giants are getting a chance to make their case in courtrooms around the country, including before a jury for the first time.
Some of the biggest players from Meta to TikTok are facing federal and state trials that seek to hold them responsible for harming children’s mental health. The lawsuits have come from school districts, local, state and the federal government as well as thousands of families.
Two trials are now underway in Los Angeles and in New Mexico, with more to come. The courtroom showdowns are the culmination of years of scrutiny of the platforms over child safety, and whether deliberate design choices make them addictive and serve up content that leads to depression, eating disorders or suicide.
Experts see the reckoning as reminiscent of cases against tobacco and opioid markets, and the plaintiffs hope that social media platforms will see similar outcomes as cigarette makers and drug companies, pharmacies and distributors.
The outcomes could challenge the companies’ First Amendment shield and Section 230 of the 1996 Communications Decency Act, which protects tech companies from liability for material posted on their platforms. They could also be costly in the form of legal fees and settlements. And they could force the companies to change how they operate, potentially losing users and advertising dollars.
Here’s a look at the major social media harms cases in the United States.
The Los Angeles case centers on addiction
Jurors in a landmark social media case that seeks to hold tech companies responsible for harms to children got their first glimpse into what will be a lengthy trial characterized by dueling narratives from the plaintiffs and the two remaining defendants, Meta and YouTube.
At the core of the Los Angeles case is a 20-year-old identified only by the initials “KGM,” whose case could determine how thousands of similar lawsuits will play out. KGM and the cases of two other plaintiffs have been selected to be bellwether trials — essentially test cases for both sides to see how their arguments play out before a jury.
“This is a monumental inflection point in social media,” said Matthew Bergman of the Seattle-based Social Media Victims Law Center, which represents more than 1,000 plaintiffs in lawsuits against social media companies. “When we started doing this four years ago no one said we’d ever get to trial. And here we are trying our case in front of a fair and impartial jury.”
On Wednesday Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg testified, mostly sticking to past talking points, including a lengthy back-and-forth about age verification where he said "“I don’t see why this is so complicated,” reiterating that the company’s policy restricts users under the age of 13 and that it works to detect users who have lied about their ages to bypass restrictions..
At one point, the plaintiff’s attorney, Mark Lanier, asked Zuckerberg if people tend to use something more if it’s addictive.
“I’m not sure what to say to that,” Zuckerberg said. “I don’t think that applies here.”
New Mexico goes after Meta over sexual exploitation
A team led by New Mexico Attorney General Raúl Torrez, who sued Meta in 2023, built their case by posing as children on social media, then documenting sexual solicitations they received as well as Meta’s response.
Torrez wants Meta to implement more effective age verification and do more to remove bad actors from its platform.
He also is seeking changes to algorithms that can serve up harmful material, and has criticized the end-to-end encryption that can prevent the monitoring of communications with children for safety. Meta has noted that encrypted messaging is encouraged in general as a privacy and security measure by some state and federal authorities.
The trial kicked off in early February. In his opening statement, prosecuting attorney Donald Migliori said Meta has misrepresented the safety of its platforms, choosing to engineer its algorithms to keep young people online while knowing that children are at risk of sexual exploitation.
“Meta clearly knew that youth safety was not its corporate priority ... that youth safety was less important than growth and engagement,” Migliori told the jury.
Meta attorney Kevin Huff pushed back on those assertions in his opening statement, highlighting an array of efforts by the company to weed out harmful content from its platforms while warning users that some dangerous content still gets past its safety net.
School districts head to trial
A trial scheduled for this summer pits school districts against social media companies before U.S. District Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers in Oakland, California. Called a multidistrict litigation, it names six public school districts from around the country as the bellwethers.
Jayne Conroy, a lawyer on plaintiffs’ trial team, was also an attorney for plaintiffs seeking to hold pharmaceutical companies responsible for the opioid epidemic. She said the cornerstone of both cases is the same: addiction.
“With the social media case, we’re focused primarily on children and their developing brains and how addiction is such a threat to their wellbeing and ... the harms that are caused to children — how much they’re watching and what kind of targeting is being done,” she said.
The medical science, she added, “is not really all that different, surprisingly, from an opioid or a heroin addiction. We are all talking about the dopamine reaction.”
Both the social media and the opioid cases claim negligence on the part of the defendants.
“What we were able to prove in the opioid cases is the manufacturers, the distributors, the pharmacies, they knew about the risks, they downplayed them, they oversupplied, and people died,” Conroy said. “Here, it is very much the same thing. These companies knew about the risks, they have disregarded the risks, they doubled down to get profits from advertisers over the safety of kids. And kids were harmed and kids died.”
Resolution could take years amid dueling narratives
Social media companies have disputed that their products are addictive. During questioning Wednesday by the plaintiff’s lawyer during the Los Angeles trial, Zuckerberg said he still agrees with a previous statement he made that the existing body of scientific work has not proven that social media causes mental health harms.
Some researchers do indeed question whether addiction is the appropriate term to describe heavy use of social media. Social media addiction is not recognized as an official disorder in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, the authority within the psychiatric community.
But the companies face increasing pushback on the issue of social media’s effects on children’s mental health, not only among academics but also parents, schools and lawmakers.
“While Meta has doubled down in this area to address mounting concerns by rolling out safety features, several recent reports suggest that the company continues to aggressively prioritize teens as a user base and doesn’t always adhere to its own rules,” said Emarketer analyst Minda Smiley.
With appeals and any settlement discussions, the cases against social media companies could take years to resolve. And unlike in Europe and Australia, tech regulation in the U.S. is moving at a glacial pace.
“Parents, education, and other stakeholders are increasingly hoping lawmakers will do more,” Smiley said. “While there is momentum at the state and federal level, Big Tech lobbying, enforcement challenges, and lawmaker disagreements over how to best regular social media have slowed meaningful progress.”

Eric Dane, ‘Grey’s Anatomy’ star and ALS awareness advocate, dies at 53
Eric Dane, ‘Grey’s Anatomy’ star and ALS awareness advocate, dies at 53
Eric Dane, the celebrated actor best known for his roles on “Grey’s Anatomy” and “Euphoria” and who later in life became an advocate for ALS awareness, died Thursday. He was 53.
His representatives said Dane died from amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, known also as Lou Gehrig’s disease, less than a year after he announced his diagnosis.
“He spent his final days surrounded by dear friends, his devoted wife, and his two beautiful daughters, Billie and Georgia, who were the center of his world,” said a statement that requested privacy for his family. “Throughout his journey with ALS, Eric became a passionate advocate for awareness and research, determined to make a difference for others facing the same fight. He will be deeply missed, and lovingly remembered always. Eric adored his fans and is forever grateful for the outpouring of love and support he’s received.”
Dane developed a devoted fanbase when his big break arrived in the mid-2000s: He was cast as Dr. Mark Sloan, aka McSteamy, on the ABC medical drama “Grey’s Anatomy,” a role he would play from 2006 until 2012 and reprise in 2021.
Although his character was killed off on the show after a plane crash, Dane’s character left an indelible mark on the still-running show: Seattle Grace Hospital became Grey Sloan Memorial Hospital.
In 2019, he did a complete 180 from the charming McSteamy and became the troubled Cal Jacobs in HBO’s provocative drama “Euphoria,” a role he continued in up until his death.
Dane also starred as Tom Chandler, the captain of a U.S. Navy destroyer at sea after a global catastrophe wiped out most of the world’s population, in the TNT drama “The Last Ship.” In 2017, production was halted as Dane battled depression.
In April 2025, Dane announced he had been diagnosed with ALS, a progressive disease that attacks nerve cells controlling muscles throughout the body.
ALS gradually destroys the nerve cells and connections needed to walk, talk, speak and breathe. Most patients die within three to five years of a diagnosis.
Dane became an advocate for ALS awareness, speaking a news conference in Washington on health insurance prior authorization. “Some of you may know me from TV shows, such as ‘Grey’s Anatomy,’ which I play a doctor. But I am here today to speak briefly as a patient battling ALS,” he said in June 2025. In September of that year, the ALS Network named Dane the recipient of their advocate of the year award, recognizing his commitment to raising awareness and support for people living with ALS.
Dane was born on Nov. 9, 1972, and raised in Northern California. His father, who the actor said was a Navy veteran and an architect, died of a gunshot wound when Dane was 7. After high school, he moved to Los Angeles to pursue acting, landing guest roles on shows like “Saved by the Bell,” “Married...With Children,” “Charmed” and “X-Men: the Last Stand,” and one season of the short-lived medical drama “Gideon’s Crossing.”
A memoir by Dane is scheduled to be published in late 2026. “Book of Days: A Memoir in Moments” will be released by Maria Shriver’s The Open Field, a Penguin Random House imprint. According to Open Field, Dane’s memoir covers key moments in his life, from his first day at work on “Grey’s Anatomy” to the births of his two daughters and learning that he had ALS.
“I want to capture the moments that shaped me — the beautiful days, the hard ones, the ones I never took for granted — so that if nothing else, people who read it will remember what it means to live with heart,” Dane said in a statement about the book. “If sharing this helps someone find meaning in their own days, then my story is worth telling.”
Dane is survived by his wife, actor Rebecca Gayheart, and their two teen daughters, Billie Beatrice and Georgia Geraldine. Gayheart and Dane wed in 2004 and separated in September 2017. Gayheart filed for divorce in 2018, but later filed to dismiss the petition. In a December essay for New York magazine’s The Cut reflecting on Dane’s diagnosis, Gayheart called their dynamic “a very complicated relationship, one that’s confusing for people.” She said they never got a divorce, but dated other people and lived separately.
“Our love may not be romantic, but it’s a familial love,” she said. “Eric knows that I am always going to want the best for him. That I’m going to do my best to do right by him. And I know he would do the same for me. So whatever I can do or however I can show up to make this journey better for him or easier for him, I want to do that.”

Israeli settlers kill 19-year-old Palestinian American, officials and witnesses say
Israeli settlers kill 19-year-old Palestinian American, officials and witnesses say
MUKHMAS, West Bank (AP) — Israeli settlers in the occupied West Bank shot and killed a Palestinian American man during an attack on a village, the Palestinian Health Ministry and a witness said Thursday.
Raed Abu Ali, a resident of Mukhmas, said a group of settlers came to the village Wednesday afternoon where they attacked a farmer, prompting clashes after residents intervened. Israeli forces later arrived, and during the violence armed settlers killed 19-year-old Nasrallah Abu Siyam and injured several others.
Abu Ali said that the army shot tear gas, sound grenades and live ammunition. Israel’s military acknowledged using what it called “riot dispersal methods” after receiving reports of Palestinians throwing rocks but denied that its forces fired during the clashes.
“When the settlers saw the army, they were encouraged and started shooting live bullets,” Abu Ali said. He added that they clubbed those injured with sticks after they had fallen to the ground.
The Palestinian Ministry of Health confirmed Abu Siyam’s death from critical wounds sustained Wednesday afternoon near the village east of Ramallah.
Abu Siyam’s killing is the latest in a surge in violence in the occupied West Bank. Israeli forces and settlers killed 240 Palestinians last year, according to the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs. Palestinians killed 17 Israelis over the same period, six of whom were soldiers. The Palestinian Authority’s Wall and Settlement Resistance Commission said Abu Siyam was the first Palestinian killed by settlers in 2026.
Mukhmas and its surrounding area — most of which lies under Israeli civil and military administration — have become a hot spot for settler attacks, including arson and assaults, as well as the construction of outposts that Israeli law considers illegal.
The Israeli military said late Wednesday that unnamed suspects shot at Palestinians, who were later evacuated for medical treatment. It did not say whether any were arrested.
Abu Siyam’s mother told The Associated Press that he was an American citizen, making him the second Palestinian American person to be killed by Israeli settlers in less than a year.
A U.S. embassy spokesperson said they “condemn this violence.”
Palestinians and rights groups say authorities routinely fail to prosecute settlers or hold them accountable for violence.
UN says Israel’s acts in West Bank may be ethnic cleansing
The U.N. human rights office on Thursday accused Israel of war crimes and said practices that displace Palestinians and alter the demographic composition of the occupied West Bank “raise concerns over ethnic cleansing.”
The Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights, citing findings collected November 2024 to October 2025, said Israel was engaged in “concerted and accelerating effort to consolidate annexation” while maintaining a system “to maintain oppression and domination of Palestinians.”
Residents of Palestinian villages and herding communities have been increasingly displaced as Israeli settlements and outposts expand. Since the start of the Israel–Hamas war, the Israeli rights group B’Tselem says about 45 Palestinian communities have been emptied out completely amid Israeli demolition orders and settler attacks.
Additionally, the office said Israeli military operations in the northern West Bank “employed means and methods designed for warfare” including lethal airstrikes and forcibly transferring civilians from their homes. It also said Israel “forbade” residents from returning to their homes in northern West Bank refugee camps. The operation, which Israel said was aimed against militants, displaced tens of thousands of Palestinians.
The report also accused Palestinian security forces of using unnecessary lethal force in the same areas, killing at least eight people, and noted that the Palestinian Authority had engaged in “intimidation, detention and ill-treatment of journalists, human rights defenders and other individuals deemed critical of its rule.”
Neither Israel’s Foreign Ministry nor the Palestinian Authority responded to requests for comment. Israel has repeatedly accused the U.N. rights office of anti-Israel bias.
Last year, the U.N. human rights monitor warned of what it called “an unfolding genocide in Gaza” with “conditions of life increasingly incompatible with (Palestinians’) continued existence.” Their report on Thursday also warned of demographic shifts in Gaza raising concerns of ethnic cleansing.
Report finds imprisoned Palestinian journalists were tortured
The Committee to Protect Journalists said that dozens of Palestinian journalists who were detained in Israel during the war in Gaza experienced conditions including physical assaults, forced stress positions, sensory deprivation, sexual violence and medical neglect.
CPJ documented the detention of at least 94 Palestinian journalists and one media worker during the war, from the West Bank, Gaza and Israel Thirty are still in custody, CPJ said.
Half of the journalists, the report found, were never charged with a crime and were held under Israel’s administrative detention system, which allows for suspects deemed security risks to be held for six months and can be renewed indefinitely.
Israel’s prison services did not immediately respond to a request for comment about the report, but rejected a similar report in January about conditions for Palestinian prisoners as “false allegations,” contending it operates lawfully, is subject to oversight and reviews complaints.
UN development chief says removing Gaza rubble will take 7 years
The vast destruction across Gaza will take at least seven years just to remove the rubble, according to the United Nations Development Program.
Alexander De Croo, the former Belgian prime minister who just returned from Gaza, said that the UNDP had removed just 0.5% of the rubble and people in Gaza are experiencing “the worst living conditions that I have ever seen.”
De Croo said 90% of Gaza’s 2.2 million people live in “very, very rudimentary tents” in the middle of the rubble, which poses health dangers and a danger from exploding weapons.
He said UNDP has been able to build 500 improved housing units, and has 4,000 more that are ready, but estimates the true need is 200,000 to 300,000 units. The units are meant to be used temporarily while reconstruction takes place. He called on Israel to expand access for goods and items needed for reconstruction and the private sector to begin development.

Russian-run areas of Ukraine face water, heat and housing woes

Russian-run areas of Ukraine face water, heat and housing woes
Russian-run areas of Ukraine face water, heat and housing woes
TALLINN, Estonia (AP) — Nearly four years into its full-scale invasion, Russia controls about 20% of Ukrainian territory. Many of the estimated 3 million to 5 million people who remain in regions under Moscow’s control face housing, water, power, heat and health care woes.
Even President Vladimir Putin has acknowledged “many truly pressing, urgent problems” in the regions of Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson and Zaporizhzhia, which were illegally annexed by Moscow months after the all-out war began on Feb. 24, 2022.
Russian citizenship, language and culture is forced upon residents, including in school lesson plans and textbooks.
Some residents live in fear of being accused of sympathizing with Kyiv, according to Ukrainians who have left. Many have been imprisoned, beaten and killed, according to human rights activists.
Russia established a “vast network of secret and official detention centers where tens of thousands of Ukrainian civilians” are held indefinitely without charge, said Oleksandra Matviichuk, head of the Nobel Peace Prize-winning Center for Civil Liberties.
Russian officials have refused to comment on past allegations by U.N. human rights officials that it tortures civilians and prisoners of war.
One family’s plight
Inna Vnukova spent the first days of the Russian occupation in the Luhansk region hiding in a damp basement with her family. Outside in her village of Kudriashivka, soldiers bullied residents, set up checkpoints and looted homes. There was constant shelling.
“Everyone was very scared and afraid to go outside,” Vnukova told The Associated Press in Estonia, where she now lives. The troops sought out officials and civil servants like her and her husband, Oleksii Vnukov.
In mid-March 2022, she and her 16-year-old son, Zhenya, fled the village with her brother’s family, even though it meant leaving her husband behind temporarily. They risked a trip by car to nearby Starobilsk, waving a white sheet amid mortar fire.
Oleksii Vnukov, a court security officer, stayed for nearly two weeks. Russian soldiers twice threatened to kill him before he escaped.
“The people there aren’t living, they’re just surviving,” he said of the 150 people — including the couple’s parents — who still live in the village that once was home to 800.
Vnukova and her husband have a new life in Estonia, where she works in a printing house and he is an electrician. Their son is now 20, and they have a 1-year-old daughter, Alisa.
Life in shattered Mariupol
Russian forces besieged Mariupol for weeks before the port city fell in May 2022. The bombing of the Donetsk Academic Regional Drama Theater on March 16 of that year killed nearly 600 people in and around the building, an AP investigation found — the war’s single deadliest known attack against civilians.
Most of the population of about a half-million fled but many hid in basements, said a former actor who huddled for months with his parents.
The former actor, now in Estonia, spoke on condition of anonymity to not endanger his 76-year-old parents, still in Mariupol. They took Russian citizenship to get medical care and a one-time payment equivalent to $1,300 per person as compensation for their destroyed home, he said.
Housing remains a problem even though the population is about half of what it was before the war. New apartments are sold to Russian newcomers — not those who lost their homes, according to complaints sent by video to Putin.
Not everyone opposes the Russian takeover. The former actor says half of the members of his old troupe support the Kremlin. Still, he said his parents asked him not to send postcards in Ukrainian because “it could be dangerous.”
Crumbling infrastructure
Years of war and neglect have saddled many cities with crumbling municipal services.
In Alchevsk, a city in the Luhansk region, over half the homes are without heat in this bitterly cold winter. Five warming stations have been set up.
In the Donetsk region, water trucks fill barrels outside apartment blocks — but they freeze solid in winter, said a resident who spoke on condition of anonymity because she feared repercussions. “There’s constant squabbling over water,” she said.
Moscow encourages Russians to move to the occupied regions, offering various benefits. Teachers, doctors and cultural workers are promised salary supplements if they live there for five years.
The northeastern city of Sievierodonetsk, once home to 140,000 people, suffered significant damage and now has only 45,000 mostly elderly or disabled residents. Only one ambulance crew serves the city, and Russian medical workers rotate in to staff its hospital, said a 67-year-old former engineer who spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of retribution.
“I know how difficult it is now for the residents of the liberated cities and towns. There are many truly pressing, urgent problems,” Putin said in September. He cited the need for reliable water supplies and access to health care, and said he has launched a “large-scale socioeconomic development program” for the regions.
Living in fear
Stanislav Shkuta, 25, from Nova Kakhovka in the Kherson region, said he narrowly escaped arrest several times before reaching Ukrainian-controlled territory in 2023. He recalled being on a bus that was stopped by Russian soldiers, and “men and women were asked to strip to the waist to see if they had Ukrainian tattoos.”
Shkuta, now in Estonia, said he “turned white with fear, wondering if I’d cleared everything on my phone.”
Friends who stayed in Nova Kakhovka say life has worsened, with suspected Ukrainian sympathizers stopped on the street or in surprise door-to-door inspections, he added.
Mykhailo Savva of the Center for Civil Liberties in Ukraine said “Russian special services continue to identify disloyal Ukrainians, extract confessions, and continue to detain people,” with residents facing document checks and mass searches.
Human rights groups say Russia used “filtration camps” early in the war to identify potentially disloyal individuals, as well as anyone who worked for the government, helped the Ukrainian army or had relatives in the military, along with journalists, teachers, scientists and politicians.
About 16,000 civilians have been detained illegally, but that number could be much higher because many are held incommunicado, said Ukrainian Human Rights Ombudsman Dmytro Lubinets.

Russians attack energy infrastructure in Mykolaiv region, causing power outages
According to Ukrinform, Vitaliy Kim, the head of the Mykolaiv Regional Military Administration, reported this on Telegram.
According to him, in the evening, as a result of an attack by Shahed 131/136 UAVs in the Bashtanka district, 55 settlements were left without power.
As of 6:00 a.m., 6 settlements remain without power. Restoration work is ongoing.
Yesterday, the enemy also attacked the Snihurivka community with a combat drone, preliminarily of the Molniya type. There were no casualties.
In addition, during the day, the enemy launched a ballistic missile strike on open terrain in the Voznesensk district, presumably an Iskander-M missile. There were no casualties.
Yesterday, the enemy also attacked the Ochakiv community with an FPV drone. There were no casualties.
As reported by Ukrinform, flooding has cut off a village in the Mykolaiv region from the mainland, and food and medicine are being delivered by boat.

From the sky, NGOs search for migrant boats in distress as Europe looks away

Every hour is crucial when searching for distressed west African migrant boats in the Atlantic, where the long route and harsh weather easily spell disaster, a nonprofit that conducts aerial surveillance told AFP during a recent mission.
AFP rode along with the organisation Humanitarian Pilots Initiative (HPI) as it raced to locate several missing pirogues — long, rickety canoes — that had left The Gambia but never showed up at their final destination.
The mission: search an area larger than Switzerland, from hundreds of metres in the air, with an aim of rendering aid before it is too late.
"People could be dead or dying from dehydration, heat stroke or any other conditions," pilot Omar El Manfalouty told AFP.
Migrants departing from west Africa and travelling up the Atlantic are usually trying to reach Europe via the Canary Islands off northwest Africa.
The Spanish archipelago is the jumping off point for their continued journey onwards to the European continent.
The Atlantic migration route to Spain’s Canary Islands has become one of the world’s deadliest sea crossings.
With many recent departures taking place from further south in The Gambia and Guinea, migrants are now spending longer at sea and facing more hardships.
More than 3,000 migrants died in 2025 while attempting to reach Spain clandestinely, according to the Spanish NGO Caminando Fronteras. Many were on overcrowded wooden pirogues departing from Senegal, The Gambia and Guinea.
The route has grown more perilous in recent years as European Union enforcement in the Mediterranean has pushed departures further south and farther into the open Atlantic. Boats now travel up to 1,000 nautical miles or more, often without reliable navigation equipment, adequate fuel or sufficient water.
Human rights organisations say European authorities have shifted focus towards border enforcement and deterrence, limiting proactive, state-run search-and-rescue at sea and increasing reliance on NGO ships, passing fishing boats and merchant vessels to answer distress alerts, a strategy they argue has cost lives.
While HPI has operated since 2016 in the central Mediterranean, it is a relative newcomer to the Atlantic.
In the Mediterranean, it has already helped spot more than 1,000 boats, alerting international NGO rescue ships which then go and help.
AFP flew with HPI on its third mission in nine months in the Atlantic, riding for several days in the NGO's Beechcraft Baron 58 nicknamed "Seabird".
'Vast area'
"The Atlantic Ocean is huge. It's a vast area and it's impossible to cover it in its entirety," said El Manfalouty.
"We brought our longest-range aircraft here and we're focusing on the area which other actors cannot reach, approximately between 300 and 500 nautical miles from the Canaries," he said.
Once HPI spots a vessel, it sends an alert for emergency response to nearby merchant ships so that they can provide immediate support. From there, Spain's maritime safety and rescue authority, Salvamento Maritimo, takes over.
"Having an aircraft in the area to support from the air with 10 times the speed (of boats) makes a lot of sense," said Samira, the mission's tactical coordinator who asked not to use her last name due to threats the NGO receives in several European countries.
One morning in January the crew received an alert from another NGO that a boat which had departed The Gambia carrying 103 people, including nine women and three children, was missing. HPI quickly mobilised.
The trip from The Gambia to the Canaries is 1,000 nautical miles, meaning there is a vast region where the boat might be, Samira said. On her tablet, she plotted out several routes.
Eyes glued
Once the plane reached the patrol zone, the aircraft descended below cloud cover and followed straight, parallel trajectories. Three crew members kept their eyes glued to the windows for the pirogue.
While in the air they received word of another vessel: a second boat, which left The Gambia seven days earlier with 137 people on board.
With the strong winds and swell, "the boats may have drifted", Samira said.
Boats have previously drifted so far as to reach the Caribbean or South America without any survivors.
After three consecutive days of flying, the crew had covered nearly 3,800 nautical miles, but there was still no trace of the two boats.
Near a migrant reception centre in Las Palmas, a major city in the Canary Islands, Ousmane Ly, a recently arrived 25-year-old Senegalese man, gazed at the beach. Other migrants, also from Senegal, were taking advantage of the sunny day to take photos.
The joy of having made it outweighed the difficulty some were having walking after days crammed into a pirogue.
Their hands, arms and legs bore wounds caused by the salt water.
He recounted how once they boarded the pirogue, he and the other passengers were covered with a tarpaulin: "I closed my eyes and thought of my mother," he said.
The tarpaulin — used to protect them from the sun during the day and cold at night — was removed only 10 days later, when the boat was rescued by Salvamento Maritimo.
There were 108 people on board, two of whom were found dead during the rescue.

Russia has lost around 1,257,880 troops in Ukraine since the beginning of its full-scale invasion on Feb. 24, 2022, the General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine reported on Feb. 20.
The number includes 970 casualties that Russian forces suffered over the past day.
According to the report, Russia has also lost 11,684 tanks, 24,060 armored combat vehicles, 79,112 vehicles and fuel tanks, 37,387 artillery systems, 1,649 multiple launch rocket systems, 1,303 air defense systems, 435 aircraft, 347 helicopters, 138,881 operational-tactical drones, 29 ships and boats, and two submarines.
Ukraine's General Staff has not revealed its own losses during the full-scale invasion, citing operational secrecy.
While Ukrainian officials rarely disclose figures, President Volodymyr Zelensky told France TV on Feb. 4 that at least 55,000 Ukrainian soldiers have been killed in action since the beginning of the full-scale war, in addition to many more classified as missing in action (MIA).
The intensity of Russian drones and fighting has made it difficult for Ukraine to retrieve the bodies of fallen soldiers, which are needed for DNA confirmation.
Independent Western think-tank reports agree that the Russian casualties significantly surpass Ukraine's losses, with the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) estimating the ratio to be "roughly 2.5:1 or 2:1."
A January 2026 CSIS report said Ukraine has likely suffered between 500,000 and 600,000 casualties from February 2022 to December 2025, of which between 100,000 to 140,000 are thought to be killed in action (KIA).

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky expressed his frustration with Axios reporters Barak Ravid and Dave Lawler at the conclusion of the trilateral talks in Geneva last week when he stated: “We don’t have time for all this shit. We have to decide, and have to finish the war.”
On Wednesday he reiterated his non-negotiable bottom line. NO! – emphatically stating: “Ukraine will not cede territory to Russia or withdraw from land it currently controls… We have to understand that Donbas is a part of our independence. It’s a part of our values. It’s not about the land. It’s not only about territories. It’s about people.”

As Mark Toth and I wrote in The Hill on Thursday, Zelensky channeled 101st Airborne Division Commander Brig. Gen. McAuliffe at Bastogne, Belgium in Dec. 1944. It’s Nuts! all over again.
And yet the White House stubbornly continues to press ahead. Which makes us wonder: What part of NO! does Team Trump not seem to understand?
Prior to the Munich Security Conference, President Donald Trump told reporters “Zelensky is going to have to get moving. Russia wants to make a deal, and Zelensky is going to have to get moving otherwise, he’s going to miss a great opportunity. He has to move.”
During the conference, Zelensky said US officials told him, “an end [to the war in Ukraine could] come as quickly as possible if Kyiv withdraws from the Donbas.”
‘Negotiation Theatre’: European Intelligence Sees No Path to Peace in 2026
Then on Monday, as the President was returning to Washington, he reiterated, “Ukraine better come to the table fast.”
But ceding the Donbas to Russia will not be part of the solution – no matter how many times the White House repeats the narrative.
What will be part of the solution are security guarantees that provide a lasting peace for Ukraine and Eastern Europe. And that means skin in the game by the US, NATO, the European Union and the “coalition of the willing” – not just dried ink on a piece of paper.
Ukraine wants a treaty – a legally binding written agreement governed by international law. Once bitten, twice shy – they learned their lesson with the Budapest Memorandum in 1994.
In short, they want boots on the ground – shared risk – jet fighters in the sky, clearly established borders, weapons, munitions and a standing army to deter another invasion. They do not need a cheering section.
As Zelensky said: “When we speak about security guarantees, we mean strong guarantees that the rest of the world – or some countries – will be ready to respond if or when Putin returns with his aggression.”
It is unlikely that Russia will agree to any security guarantees currently on the table – specifically European peacekeepers in Ukraine.
The Kremlin is trying to set conditions to achieve their end game – the eradication of all things Ukraine.
So where is the pushback from the US negotiation team on Russia’s refusal to compromise on Ukraine’s position on the Donbas and security guarantees? Why is it that only Ukraine is expected to bend?
That’s the unfairness Zelensky eludes to.
As the Ukrainian President has so bluntly pointed out, “It is easier for Trump to pressure Ukraine than the much larger Russia.”
It also provides a bigger payday – if it pays out at all. Simply put – a $12 trillion economic cooperation package presented by Putin’s money man Kirill Dmitriev.
But on Wednesday Dmitriev reportedly upped the ante, telling Washington if they lifted sanctions on Russia, the US could gain access to joint projects with Moscow now worth more than $14 trillion.
Let’s be honest here – this is no longer about just stopping the killing. A ceasefire could do that. This has become about making money too, and to do that, the White House needs to get Zelensky to stop resisting and withdraw from the Donbas.
Stopping the killing has become a means to an end. Using Kremlin logic – the killing stops and peace begins when Ukraine capitulates to Russia.
Team Trump’s methods to get Ukraine to stop resisting and accept Russia’s maximalist demands have drawn ire though.
To actually stop the killing – Russia must stop attacking. Negotiations have not achieved that – they have only intensified the attacks and prolonged the killing.
As Mark and I have stated often, to get Russia to stop attacking will require blunt force. That means direct confrontation with the Russian military, and to date, there has not been enough calcium in Brussels or Washington to develop the backbone necessary to do that.
Fear of Russian escalation creates indecision, and Russia continues to play that card. Only that does not hinder Ukraine, which has inflicted over 1,256,950 casualties, and destroyed over 11,682 tanks, 24,054 armored fighting vehicles and 37,384 artillery systems. Their ability to strike deep within the Russian interior – targeting oil refineries, ammunition storage facilities, drone production facilities, airfields and government offices keeps “grandpa in his bunker.”
Little has been achieved in stopping Russia from striking Ukraine’s energy sector, critical infrastructure or residential neighborhoods with ballistic missiles and drones provided by their “arsenals of evil” – Iran and North Korea.
NASAMS and Patriot batteries reportedly sit empty in Ukraine.
A European-led Integrated Air Protection Zone (IAPZ) – Skyshield – remains in concept only.
Last March, the Trump administration suspended delivery of all US military aid to Ukraine, “blocking billions of dollars’ worth of crucial shipments, as the White House piled pressure on Kyiv to reach a peace deal with Russia.”
Zelensky’s approach to the Donbas and the end of the war is as clear as the US Army motto: “This we will defend.” He may very well have to do it alone as the US and Europe remain on the sidelines “appeasing the [Russian bear], hoping it will eat [them] last.”
The New York Times reported on Tuesday that, “Putin believes he is winning… and is convinced that even if it takes 18 months to two years to complete his hold on the Donbas region, each day of fighting and each night of Russian missiles and drones raining down on energy infrastructure and apartment buildings secure him more leverage.”
In an interview with Neue Berliner Redaktionsgesellschaft and Rheinpfalz on Thursday, German Chancellor Friedrich Merz said he thought the war would end “only when one of the two parties is exhausted, either militarily or economically.”
The West could make that happen – but it requires more than speeches.
Zelensky is not waiting for a Patton to come along and bail him out. What was true in February 2022 is just as valid in February 2026, “The fight is here; I need ammunition, not a ride.”
In what could be Zelensky’s 300 moment – a modern day Battle of Thermopylae where King Leonidas and 300 Spartans fought against Xerxes and his Persian army – the message to his valiant Ukrainian defenders is: “Come back with your shield – or on it.”

Frisian to be actively taught at schools in Friesland
From August, all students attending primary and secondary school in Friesland will “actively” use the Frisian language, according to new educational guidelines.
The measure setting out new core objectives for the Frisian language in schools passed the provincial council unanimously and will require both the oral and written use of Frisian in the school curriculum.
For the country’s other 11 provinces, educational standards are set in The Hague by parliament and the education ministry. The province of Friesland, however, has an exemption.
A report in 2016 found that the language could disappear. Some 30% of children spoke Fries at home and usage dropped to 22% outside of the home.
Frisian is the second national language of the Netherlands and has protected status.
In 2017, the language was used in EU parliament for the first time. Jan Huitema, an MEP from Makkinga for the VVD party, addressed his colleagues in Brussels in Frisian as part of a session dedicated to Europe’s minority languages.
Primary and lower secondary schools can begin implementing the new core objectives at the start of the 2026-2027 school year and have until the 2030-2031 school year to do so.

Former British MP and former deputy chairman of the Conservative Party Jack Lopresti has announced that he is joining the 12th Special Forces Brigade “Azov” of the National Guard of Ukraine.
On X, he wrote:

— Jack Lopresti (@JackLopresti) February 19, 2026
Lopresti previously served as an active member of the British Parliament’s Defence Committee and was a consistent supporter of providing military assistance to Ukraine.
It has not been specified what role Lopresti will perform within “Azov.”
Since the start of Russia’s full-scale invasion in February 2022, Lopresti has been vocal in his support for Ukrainian independence and sovereignty, repeatedly calling on the UK political leadership to take more decisive steps in assisting Kyiv. He visited Ukraine several times after the launch of the full-scale invasion.
After losing his seat in the 2024 UK general election, Lopresti, a former Afghanistan veteran, signed up with Ukraine’s International Legion in early 2025.
In an interview with Kyiv Post in July 2025, Lopresti said he first visited Ukraine on the invasion’s first anniversary as part of a parliamentary delegation.
While he said he understood “how vitally important it was for Ukraine to maintain its independence and its freedom and its status as a sovereign nation,” he was particularly struck by “the spirit of the Ukrainian people who were prepared to fight in very, very difficult circumstances alone to try and keep their country independent and free.”
How to Counter the Kremlin’s Maximalist Negotiating Strategy
After returning to London, he became closely involved in Ukraine-related work, forming an all-party parliamentary group on sovereign defence manufacturing and contributing to debates on military support.
Anticipating a difficult re-election battle, Lopresti told Kyiv Post that he decided in advance that if he lost his seat, “I would come to Ukraine.” Despite warnings from relatives - “family and friends said, it’s a war, it’s dangerous” - he said “they all understood why I wanted to come and help.”
Following the election, Lopresti volunteered online for Ukraine’s International Legion, outlining his limited prior military experience as a reservist. He said he received responses offering potential frontline or training roles.
However, after discussions with Ukrainian officials, he was asked instead to focus on areas where his political and defence background could be most effective.
“I mean, I wanted to be a soldier and ultimately I am,” he said.
He served with Defence Intelligence, where his work at that stage centered on “international relations, diplomacy, procurement, and veterans.”
Lopresti said he supported visiting delegations and trade missions, contributed to defence procurement efforts, and worked on veterans’ welfare initiatives - an area close to him as a former party spokesman for veterans and a patron of a UK charity operating a rehabilitation center in the Carpathians.
“I feel I absolutely made the right decision,” he told Kyiv Post.
“I feel very privileged that I’m able to help whatever I can do to help the cause and help Ukraine win,” he said, adding that he did not engage in Ukrainian domestic politics.

MOSCOW, February 20. /TASS/. The Russian special military operation in Ukraine has introduced new patterns in modern warfare, said Colonel General Sergey Rudskoy, Chief of the Main Operations Directorate, First Deputy Chief of the Russian General Staff.
"The experience of the special military operation has opened up new trends in modern warfare. First and foremost, this is a notable increase in the use of air, sea, and land-based robotic systems," he said in an interview with Krasnaya Zvezda.
Rudskoy noted that, in addition to firepower, the range of applications of robotic systems is being expanded in reconnaissance missions, counter-battery warfare, minelaying, delivery of ammunition and supplies to the front, as well as evacuation of the wounded from the battlefield.

Türkiye can help turn climate pledges into action at COP31, officials say
Antalya summit expected to translate climate promises into concrete projects with measurable impact
ISTANBUL
The COP31 summit, set for November in Antalya, Türkiye, could provide a critical opportunity to advance climate action, officials said at a Zero Waste Foundation retreat.
Officials met with the Turkish delegation during a three-day preparatory retreat in Istanbul on Feb. 6-8, organized by the Zero Waste Foundation, to exchange views ahead of COP31, this year’s most significant climate summit under the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, which will take place in Antalya on Türkiye’s Mediterranean coast under Türkiye’s presidency and hosting.
Chaired by Samed Agirbas, president of the Zero Waste Foundation and COP31 high-level climate champion, the meeting brought together senior advisers, members of the UN Zero Waste Advisory Board, and key COP31 stakeholders to chart a roadmap to the summit.
Lara van Druten, a member of the UN Zero Waste Advisory Board and CEO of the Netherlands-based Waste Transformers, Special Advisor for Cities and Local Governments to the COP31 High-Level Climate Champion Neil Khor, and COP31 Climate High-Level Champion Marketing, Communications, and Stakeholder Engagement Special Advisor Atif Ikram Butt spoke to Anadolu about their expectations for COP31.
Druten said the retreat gathered diverse perspectives to help ensure COP31 is as effective as possible.
She underscored the link between zero waste and climate change, saying efforts were underway to ensure the issue features prominently on the COP31 agenda.
Highlighting emissions linked to food waste, Druten said at least one-third of all food produced globally is wasted while millions go hungry. Reforming food value chains, she added, could both reduce greenhouse gas emissions and align with COP31 priorities on waste, water and resource management.
Druten also said Agirbas’ efforts to unite stakeholders from the private sector and civil society would be among COP31’s key strengths.
Sharing her outlook on COP31’s potential contribution to climate action, Druten said: “There have been many COP summits over the years, and one of their main vulnerabilities has been the difficulty of translating discussions into concrete, scalable projects with meaningful impact, ensuring real change on the ground rather than just talking about it.”
Neil Khor, former chief of staff of UN-Habitat, said discussions during the retreat focused on aligning the foundation’s goals with the COP process and identifying ways to support Agirbas ahead of COP31.
Having closely followed the COP process during his tenure at UN-Habitat, Khor said, “The key element of the process is translating climate policy into action on the ground.”
He added that the foundation aims to collaborate with local stakeholders worldwide to implement climate commitments, with zero waste serving as a driver of both mitigation and adaptation efforts ahead of COP31.
“Antalya is a beautiful city and provides a strong setting to bring together stakeholders, drawing on Türkiye’s long history and tradition of hospitality,” Khor said, referring to the country’s role as host.
Khor noted that while COP summits address issues affecting millions, not everyone can travel to Türkiye. A digital platform to be launched by Agirbas, he said, will enable broader participation and allow individuals worldwide to make climate commitments as part of COP31.
He also said Türkiye and Australia were discussing COP31’s agenda, adding: "I think Türkiye has an opportunity in the area of zero waste to bring a new way of thinking, a new way of working that will not only look at the environment from the perspective of nature, but more importantly highlight the philosophy and teachings of first lady Emine Erdogan -- that this is about living and life."
‘Türkiye can play a bridging role between North and South at COP31’
Khor urged cooperation and added: “No matter how strong, large or wealthy a country may be, it cannot tackle this challenge alone.”
Former chief of the Public Advocacy and Communication Section at the UN Environment Programme, Atif Ikram Butt stressed the need for “the entire global community” to find “common ground and agree that this is the time to turn our commitments and promises into action.”
Saying the world is moving into the decisive implementation phase of the Paris Agreement, a critical period to deliver transformative outcomes and stay aligned with 2030 targets, Butt said, “Türkiye can play a bridging role between North and South at COP31 by bringing parties together to agree on a course to achieve the goals set in Paris.”
Butt added that the COP31 process offers Türkiye an opportunity to showcase its leadership in zero waste at the international level and contribute meaningfully to climate action, given Agirbas’s dual role as high-level climate champion and head of the Zero Waste Foundation.

Japanese police arrest man after three people stabbed at library
Attack comes days after fatal stabbing of teenager in Osaka

Japanese police arrested a man in his 60s after three people were wounded in a knife attack inside a public library in Fukuoka on Thursday evening.
According to the Fukuoka Prefectural Police, an emergency call came in at around 7.50pm local time reporting that multiple people had been stabbed and that a security guard had managed to restrain a man armed with a knife.
Officers rushed to the scene and arrested Tatsuo Yoshii, 61, on suspicion of attempted murder.
Investigators claimed that Mr Yoshii admitted to attacking the victims and told authorities he didn’t know them. The stabbings occurred on the ground floor of the Fukuoka City General Library in the city’s Sawara area.
Police said an elderly man in his 80s suffered a serious stab wound to the abdomen.
A security guard in his 70s and a woman in her 50s were also injured, with wounds to their necks and hands, the police said.
All three were taken to nearby hospitals for treatment. Officials said they were conscious and their injuries were not believed to be life-threatening.
A knife was recovered at the scene and seized as evidence.
Police said that they were investigating the motivation behind the attack, The Japan Times reported.
The attack came days after a 21-year-old man was arrested after a fatal stabbing in Dotonbori area of Osaka.
Ryoga Iwasaki was accused of killing Ryunosuke Kamata, 17 and seriously injuring two other boys of the same age on the night of 14 February.
The Asahi Shimbun reported, quoting unnamed sources, that Mr Iwasaki had been harassing a woman at the scene and the teenagers stepped in to challenge him shortly before the stabbing.
In December, a 38-year-old man attacked workers at a tyre factory in Mishima, stabbing eight people and spraying seven others with a bleach-like substance. The man was later arrested on suspicion of attempted murder.
Violent crime is relatively rare in Japan. The country has a low homicide rate and its gun control laws are among the toughest in the world. However, isolated acts of violence do occur, including knife attacks and rare shootings, most notably the 2022 assassination of former prime minister Shinzo Abe.
In June last year, Japan executed a man known as the “Twitter Killer”, who had been found guilty of murdering and dismembering nine people after contacting them on social media. It marked Japan’s first execution in almost three years.
In July 2016, a 26-year-old man named Satoshi Uematsu carried out a mass stabbing at a disability care facility in Sagamihara, near Tokyo, killing 19 people and injuring 25 in one of Japan’s deadliest attacks in decades.

Rafah fighting drew 100 times more media attention than Iran protests, study shows

Media coverage and demonstrations related to the IDF’s entry into Rafah received approximately 100 times more attention than those addressing the Iranian protests, a Jewish People Policy Institute (JPPI) study released Thursday revealed.
The study examined the disparity between the global response to the scale of violence during the protests in Iran and the response to the Israel-Hamas war, particularly the IDF’s entry into Rafah, and was conducted by the Glazer Information Center at JPPI, with Shlomi Berznick, Eli Kanai, and Yaakov Katz serving as the responsible researchers.
JPPI President Prof. Yedidia Stern said the research aimed primarily to demonstrate that when Israel conducts a “defensive war against armed terrorist organizations that attacked it, it is judged harshly.”
By contrast, Stern noted that when the Islamic regime “massacred its own citizens, who are defenseless,” the response from the international community was relatively modest.
Among its findings, the JPPI study highlighted significant gaps in both the volume of international media coverage and the number of protests held in the United States surrounding each issue.
As part of the analysis, the number of protests in the United States related to Israel’s entry into Rafah was compared with protests addressing the suppression of demonstrations in Tehran. These figures were then cross-referenced with the volume of international media coverage in leading outlets focused on both events.
To ensure comparability, the researchers used two identical 22-day time windows. The analysis revealed substantially greater traction surrounding the Rafah case, a trend linked in part to the social media campaign “All Eyes on Rafah.” This period also coincided with a wave of protests on US college campuses.
To analyze protest activity, the study relied on the Crowd Counting Consortium, the largest database documenting protests in the United States, including their locations, organizers, and central messages.
Only 25 protests held in US over Iran crackdown
The findings showed that only 25 protests were held in the United States during the period of the Iranian protest crackdown. In addition, not all of these demonstrations expressed solidarity with the Iranian protesters, with some instead calling for avoiding American involvement in the unfolding violence.
In contrast, during the Israel-Hamas war, 476 protests against Israel were held, along with 2,120 protests in the United States during the 22-day period examined around the IDF’s entry into Rafah.
The JPPI study also examined the involvement of human rights organizations and women’s groups in both contexts. The data showed that during the Iranian demonstrations, organizations that led protests against Israel were absent from expressions of solidarity with the Iranian protesters.
Among the organizations examined were Codepink, Kalamazoo Nonviolent Opponents of War, and Geneva Women’s Assembly.
To assess media coverage, JPPI used the Lexis-Nexis database to review reporting in major international outlets, including Al Jazeera (English), CNN, CBC, NPR, Sky News, the Los Angeles Times, the Washington Post, the Chicago Tribune, Axios, Politico, the Times of India, the Irish Times, Time, and the Daily Telegraph.
The resulting data showed that, during the period of the IDF’s entry into Rafah, the coverage of the Palestinian issue was nearly twice as extensive as coverage of the Iranian protests during their violent suppression.
According to the authors of the JPPI study, conflicts involving Israel receive a particularly high level of attention, which may at times be disproportionate when compared with more severe events elsewhere. The researchers concluded that these findings point to a clear bias in the international discourse surrounding Israel.

Newly identified ancient Egyptian copper drill rewrites history of region’s craftsmanship
Unknown

16:39:10 KST

A small copper tool excavated from a cemetery in Badari, Egypt a century ago has been identified by researchers as the oldest known rotary drill from ancient Egypt, according to an early February statement from Newcastle University.
The complete findings have been published in a study titled “The Earliest Metal Drill of Naqada IID Dating” in the journal Egypt and the Levant.
The drill has been dated by researchers from the university and the Academy of Fine Arts in Vienna to the late 4th millennium BCE, before the first pharaohs unified Egypt under a single crown.
When it was first discovered and catalogued in the 1920s, the now-identified drill received the bare description of being “a little awl of copper, with some leather thong wound round it.”
Since then, it has been stored at Cambridge University’s Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology until researchers decided to further study the seemingly inconsequential artifact.
When the tool was placed under a magnifying glass, the statement revealed that wear and tear consistent with drilling was discovered, including “fine striations, rounded edges, and a slight curvature at the working end, all features that point to rotary motion, not simple puncturing.”
The statement added that the attached remnants of leather may have been remnants of a bowstring used to power a bow drill, the “ancient equivalent of a hand drill.”
Badari drill predates known drill sets by 2,000 years
“The ancient Egyptians are famous for stone temples, painted tombs, and dazzling jewellery, but behind those achievements lay practical, everyday technologies that rarely survive in the archaeological record," Dr. Martin Odler, a Visiting Fellow at Newcastle University and co-author of the study, said of the find.
The tool, he argues, suggests that Egyptian craftspeople mastered reliable rotary drilling more than two millennia before the best-preserved drill sets previously known to archaeologists.
Bow drills appear in New Kingdom tomb paintings from roughly the middle to late second millennium BCE, showing craftsmen drilling beads and woodwork, the statement explained, adding that the Badari drill predates those examples by approximately 2,000 years.
The drill’s chemical composition was also surprising, study co-author Jiří Kmošek noted, as it is made up of an unusual copper alloy containing arsenic, nickel, lead, and silver.
The presence of silver and lead may hint at deliberate alloying choices and “wider networks of materials or know-how linking Egypt to the broader ancient eastern Mediterranean in the fourth millennium BCE,” according to Kmošek.
The study, which was completed as part of the UKRI-funded EgypToolWear project, highlighted the untapped potential of museum collections, the statement explained.
“A small object, excavated long ago and described in a single line, turns out to preserve not only early metalworking but also a rare trace of organic material, evidence for how the tool was actually used.”

IDF cracks down on Palestinian incitement to violence across West Bank at start of Ramadan

As part of the effort to combat incitement, especially as Ramadan began this week, the IDF's Judea and Samaria Division, under the command of Brigadier General Kobi Heller, has carried out a series of operations to arrest inciters, with a focus on social media, alongside public relations efforts and discussions with senior Palestinian officials to prevent inflaming tensions.
According to Walla, the Judea and Samaria Division has arrested 17 key inciters in the past two weeks alone.
The IDF Central Command has been conducting a large-scale operation since October 7, 2023, against incitement figures throughout the West Bank, based on the assessment that words on social media, sermons in mosques, and speeches at ceremonies and in the streets are fueling the next attacks.
This is particularly important as the IDF and Shin Bet (Israel Security Agency) have succeeded in reducing the number of attacks carried out by organized infrastructures or institutionalized cells, but are still facing attacks by lone terrorists who wake up in the morning and decide to kill.
Additionally, it has been revealed to Walla that since the beginning of the war, more than 420 inciters have been arrested. In other cases, the inciters received warnings from security forces.
The main concern within the security establishment is from wild incitement designed to mobilize crowds to carry out attacks and to encourage lone attackers to target civilians and soldiers.
Mosques, Temple Mount, marked as security vulnerability during Ramadan
Meanwhile, security officials are marking prayers in mosques and on the Temple Mount as a potential security vulnerability on the first Friday of Ramadan. Accordingly, security forces, including the IDF, Shin Bet, Border Police, and Israeli Police, will reinforce friction points and the seam line with large forces on Friday.
In addition, the Civil Administration, under the command of Brigadier General Hisham Ibrahim, began a technological civilian preparedness alongside hardline actions against incitement in the last month, aiming to promote awareness of movements and crossings in the West Bank and the seam line, and to provide accessible information.
These measures included technological upgrades allowing the renewal of magnetic cards via an app, eliminating the need for physical presence, and increasing forces at the Qalandiya and Rachel’s Tomb crossings, which opened for pedestrians on Friday, to enable the flow of worshipers, prevent unnecessary friction, and solve real-time issues on the ground.
The security establishment has noted that there is also a real concern in Palestinian streets that extremist terrorist activities will lead to an escalation that will ruin the holiday atmosphere. The big test will be the ability to separate the normative population from those trying to turn Ramadan into a month of violence.

New blood test can predict when someone is likely to start showing Alzheimer’s symptoms
Researchers say test can help develop therapies to prevent or slow onset of dementia

- CommentsGo to comments
Scientists have developed a new blood test to predict when someone is likely to show symptoms of Alzheimer’s disease, an advance that may help speed up preventive treatments.
Some 55 million people worldwide live with dementia and Alzheimer's accounts for 60-70 per cent of the cases. The number of affected people is projected to double every 20 years and reach nearly 140 million by 2050.
In the absence of a cure, predictive models can help develop therapies to prevent or slow the onset of Alzheimer’s symptoms in those at risk.
A new model based on a blood test can predict the onset of Alzheimer’s symptoms within a margin of three to four years, researchers say in a new study.
“Our work shows the feasibility of using blood tests, which are substantially cheaper and more accessible than brain imaging scans or spinal fluid tests, for predicting the onset of Alzheimer’s symptoms,” Suzanne Schindler, an author of the study published in Nature Medicine, said.
“The goal is to be able to tell individual patients when they’re likely to develop symptoms which will help them and their doctors to develop a plan to prevent or slow symptoms,” Dr Schindler, from the Washington University School of Medicine in St Louis, said.
The model assesses levels of a protein called p-tau217 in an individual’s plasma, the liquid part of the blood, to estimate the age when they are likely to begin experiencing Alzheimer’s disease symptoms.
The protein’s levels are strongly linked to the accumulation of misfolded amyloid and tau protein clusters in the brain, which are key hallmarks of Alzheimer’s.
“Amyloid and tau levels are similar to tree rings – if we know how many rings a tree has, we know how many years old it is,” Kellen Petersen, another author of the study, explained. “It turns out that amyloid and tau also accumulate in a consistent pattern and the age at which they become positive strongly predicts when someone is going to develop Alzheimer’s symptoms. We found that this is also true of plasma p-tau217, which reflects both amyloid and tau levels.”
Researchers used their new model to predict the age of symptom onset within a margin of error of three-four years.
It showed that older individuals had a shorter time from when elevated p-tau217 appeared to the start of symptoms compared to younger participants.
If a person had elevated p-tau217 in their plasma at age 60, for example, they developed symptoms 20 years later.
“These clock models could make clinical trials more efficient by identifying individuals who are likely to develop symptoms within a certain period of time,” Dr Petersen noted. “With further refinement, these methodologies have the potential to predict symptom onset accurately enough that we could use them in individual clinical care.”

Journalist with Germany's Deutsche Welle detained in Turkey

FRANKFURT, Feb 20 - Turkish authorities have detained a veteran correspondent of German state-backed international broadcaster Deutsche Welle in Ankara, accusing him of "disseminating misleading information" and "insulting the president".
Istanbul Chief Public Prosecutor's Office said in a statement late on Thursday it detained Alican Uludag and launched a criminal investigation based on some of his social media posts. He will be brought before prosecutors on Friday.
Deutsche Welle, or DW, said the correspondent, who has been working for the broadcaster for several years, was arrested in Ankara and taken to Istanbul police on Thursday.
DW Director General Barbara Massing called the accusations baseless and said the arrest was "a deliberate act of intimidation and shows how severely the government is suppressing press freedom".
DW said the allegations against Uludag relate to his criticism of Turkish government measures that led to the release of suspected Islamic State militants in a post on social media platform X he made about a year and a half ago.
DW added that his apartment was searched and IT equipment was confiscated. REUTERS

Police search of Royal Lodge continues as Andrew released from custody – live updates

Police search to continue at Royal Lodge, Andrew's former home
A search at Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor’s former Berkshire home by UK police remains under way following the former prince’s arrest on Thursday.
Even though Thomas Valley police have concluded searches at Mountbatten-Windsor’s home on the Sandringham estate where he was arrested, the search continues at the Royal Lodge on the Windsor estate.
Mountbatten-Windsor, who has been arrested on suspicion of misconduct in public office, has consistently denied wrongdoing related to Jeffrey Epstein, the disgraced financier and convicted sex offender.
It is understood that neither the King nor Buckingham Palace had been informed before the arrest on Thursday morning. However, the Home Secretary was alerted to the arrest shortly before Andrew was taken into custody, it is understood.
Thames Valley Police denied briefing the Home Office before the arrest, but issued a statement from the National Police Chiefs’ Council to clarify that the NPCC did so.
The statement read: “In line with routine practice, the National Police Chiefs’ Council alerted operational colleagues within the Home Office of the arrest. This gave 30 minutes’ notice before Thames Valley Police made the arrest.”
When asked by reporters for his reaction, he said:
I’m the expert in a way because I’ve been totally exonerated so I can speak about it …
I think it’s a shame. I think it’s very sad. I think it’s so bad for the royal family. It’s very, very sad. To me, it’s a very sad thing. When I see that, it’s a very sad thing …
To see that and to see everything that’s going on with his brother, who is coming to our country very soon, the king … so I think it’s a very sad thing.
The arrest of Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor on suspicion of misconduct in public office in the UK has prompted calls from US lawmakers and survivors of Jeffrey Epstein’s abuse to demand accountability for those linked to the late sex offender across the Atlantic.
On Thursday, Kentucky’s Republican representative Thomas Massie – who co-sponsored legislation with California’s Democratic representative Ro Khanna to compel the justice department to release millions of files related to Epstein – called for action in the US.
“Prince Andrew was just arrested. This was the metric I established for success of the Epstein Files Transparency Act that @RepRoKhanna and I got passed,” Massie wrote on X.
He went on to urge US attorney general Pam Bondi and FBI director Kash Patel “to act”, adding: “Now we need JUSTICE in the United States.”
Robert Garcia, the ranking member of the House of Representatives’ oversight committee, issued a similar statement, saying: “Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor’s arrest is an enormous step forward in our fight to secure justice for the survivors of Jeffrey Epstein’s horrific crimes … Now it’s the time for the United States to end this White House cover up. President Trump and his Epstein administration are not above the law.”
Lawmakers have asked Mountbatten-Windsor to come to the US to testify about his ties to Epstein.
While Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor’s arrest by British police on Thursday came after years of uproar over his association with Jeffrey Epstein, documents show he had been on the radar of US law enforcement for nearly 15 years.
Mountbatten-Windsor’s name came up during a 2011 FBI inquiry into Epstein, investigative documents recently disclosed by the justice department reveal. Mountbatten-Windsor has denied all allegations of misconduct related to Epstein.
In March of that year, agents traveled to Australia after an Epstein victim contacted federal prosecutors in south Florida, saying she had “information pertinent” to the late financier and his accomplice, Ghislaine Maxwell.
The victim’s name is redacted from several documents chronicling the interview, but details closely track the public and legal claims made by Virginia Giuffre, a well-known Epstein accuser who died by suicide last year.

Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor has been released from custody by UK police on Thursday following his arrest on suspicion of misconduct in public office. No charges have been laid against him.
The arrest of the 66-year old former prince sent shockwaves through the UK and abroad, marking the first time a senior member of the royal family has been arrested in nearly 400 years.
Mountbatten-Windsor’s arrest follow the recent release of files related to Jeffrey Epstein, the disgraced financier and convicted sex offender.
The former prince has denied all allegations of wrongdoing related to Epstein, including that he allegedly shared sensitive information with Epstein while he was serving as a trade envoy.
Without referring to Mountbatten-Windsor as his brother, King Charles released a statement on Thursday in which he said “the law must take its course.”
Meanwhile, US president Donald Trump has called Mountbatten-Windsor’s arrest a “very sad thing,” adding that it is “a shame” as US lawmakers and survivors of Epstein call for justice in the US.
Mountbatten-Windsor remains under investigation. Stay tuned as we bring you the latest updates.

PM’s hard-line stance on ISIS brides leaves children to suffer
I wish to express my support for the opinion piece by Fionnuala Ni Aolain and Ben Saul to allow the Australian women and their children to return to Australia from Syria as soon as possible (“Bring these kids home, PM. They didn’t make their beds”, February 20). It is absurd for the prime minister to constantly argue “they’ve made their bed, they can lie in it”. I also heard my own mother argue this in the 1960s and ’70s. I thought it was unfeeling and unkind then and I still do, particularly in the context of Albanese’s stated wish before the 2022 election to do politics more kindly. The bottom line is that under Australian and international law these people have the right to return home, and that should be enacted. Australian law can then be applied as appropriate to deal with any security concerns. Kate Miller, Waverton
Thank you Fionnuala Ni Aolain and Ben Saul for your clear call to the Anthony Albanese to act humanely, morally and responsibly in relation to 34 Australian women and children who have been abandoned in Syria. There is only one word for abandoning Australian children to suffer in the Al Roj camp, and that is shameful. Those children are innocents in this disgraceful game of political cowardice. Australian citizens have a right to return home and the Australian government has the ability and obligation to deal with any offence committed. Why should we expect poorer nations to shoulder this burden? And surely, Pauline, even if you have no compassion for these children, you can understand that someone is probably saying to this group of women and children, “Why don’t you go back to where you came from?” Suzanne Young, Corindi Beach
Albanese’s refusal to repatriate the ISIS brides and their children is harsh and lacks compassion. The government, fearing the return of these women and children would not play well under the present social and political climate, has chosen to turn their back on them in an ignominious display of political cowardice. Some of these women were tricked and some were coerced into going to Syria.
As Australian citizens, the government has an obligation to repatriate these women, especially their innocent children. Their return can be carefully monitored and managed and charges can be laid if they have committed any crimes under Australian law. Albanese has embraced political expediency over moral imperative. The prime minister needs to show leadership and act according to the facts rather than pander to populist hyperbole.
Leo Sorbello, Leichhardt
So Albo has “nothing but contempt” for the women in Jordan ostensibly supporting ISIS. Just like Pauline, one assumes. When it comes to Australian values, what happened to the rule of law and looking after one another? If these women (and their children) have committed any crime, it is surely up to a judge to decide their fate, not politicians who seek political gain from being “tough” on people from parts of the world they don’t fancy. Tony Tucker, Leichhardt
I am disgusted with federal Coalition politicians such as Jonno Duniam trying to make a political point-scoring opportunity to bash the government over the ISIS brides issue. Are they really saying that these Australian citizens should not be allowed to return to Australia because they do not share the same views as the members of the Coalition? Are we not allowed, in a democracy, to hold differing opinions? How can this be a valid reason to deny an Australian citizen their birthright to a passport? The Coalition should be providing all the support it can to the government to navigate through this issue, rather than firing off cheap, Trumpian shots. Dale Bailey, Five Dock
It is hard to do anything but criticise the PM’s outburst against ISIS brides as being anything but intemperate, unprofessional and, at the least, misogynistic. Perhaps he was frustrated by knowing that Australia does have an obligation to all its citizens and the government of the day should not be discriminating on which citizens it does support on the basis of race, religion, gender or political leanings. To do this means simply that the value of ALL Australian passports is diminished in the process. Like most people, I am reluctant to accept responsibility for this benighted group of women and children, but they are an Australian problem and no amount of public venting by a probably exasperated PM will change that fact. So, PM, return to your appropriate demeanour and treat this matter properly – those in question are Australians with the same claim on their government as I have.
James Archibald, Enmore
The issues around the motives, morality, autonomy and stupidity of ISIS brides are complex. But what is simple is the law. If they are entitled to an Australian passport, they should have it. If they are entitled to consular or other support, they should have it. If they are suspected of an offence under Australian law, it should be investigated. If they have committed an offence under Australian law, they should be punished. If their children are citizens under Australian law, the same principles apply to them. As Australians, we must uphold the rule of law. To do otherwise is to support tyranny. Frank Argent, Gordon
I am thinking, sadly, that the ISIS brides and children stranded in Syria could quickly become Albanese’s Biloela moment. Shame. Cheryl Kay, Miranda
Children left languishing a Syrian refugee camp are more likely to grow up radicalised than if raised in Australia. It’s time to show compassion and forgiveness. Bring the Australian women and their kids home where the children can receive a decent education and chance in life. Anne Matheson, Gordon
Love for Lakemba
I am an elderly white Anglo woman and have lived in Lakemba for the past 55 years (“Pauline Hanson claims Lakemba is unwelcoming. Tell that to a million people about to visit”, February 20). My experience in this suburb is of a friendly and outgoing neighbourhood full of a wide variety of different cultures. I have kind and generous neighbours of Egyptian, Bangladeshi and Islander backgrounds, who have assisted me on many occasions. If you were to cast aside your racist prejudices and open your mind you might enjoy a trip to Lakemba, but try not to bring anger and racism with you. Pam Hawkins, Lakemba
Last year I attended the Lakemba Night Markets celebrating Ramadan. I am a small 74-year-old woman, born in the UK, and looking like the visitor I was. Despite wandering around by myself at one point, having left friends to pursue a camel burger, I enjoyed the warm and friendly atmosphere. At no time did I feel anything other than welcome. The evening was a lot of fun. I ate food on fire on its leafy bed, enjoyed my camel burger and will forever look out for the delicious knafeh desert. But the real treat was the welcoming atmosphere. We could learn from our Muslim Australians the art of generous hospitality. Pauline Hanson, with her blindfold, would, of course, never experience this. Sue Adams, Dulwich Hill
In my 80-plus years of living in Australia I have been privileged to meet, work with and count as valued friends, people from at least 17 different nations, races and cultures from all corners of the world, including Europe, Africa, South America, Israel and Iran, China, Asia, and First Nations Australians. Regardless of religious beliefs, we all have the same basic human needs and values. A desire for security, peace and friendship with our neighbours and colleagues, as well as safety, health and education for our children. The fact that certain members of our government are currently fanning the embers of intolerance and hatred in our community is frightening. Please let us all strive to keep Australia multicultural, an example to the rest of the world that we as a species can tolerate diversity and live in peace with each other. Lyndall Dawson, Austinmer
Clear goals needed on CGT reform
Shane Wright’s report on economists backing capital gains tax changes highlights a debate that is missing its most fundamental question: what problem are we actually trying to solve (“‘Do whatever is possible’: Top economists join forces to back capital gains tax changes”, February 20)? Before arguing about discount rates, we need clarity on the objective. Is CGT reform meant to improve equity, boost economic efficiency or expand housing access? Each goal demands a different policy design.
If equity is the target, we should question why someone flipping shares pays full tax on nine-month gains while property investors get a 50 per cent discount after 12 months. If efficiency matters most, distortions that channel investment towards tax-advantaged assets over productive enterprises need to be addressed. If housing affordability is the priority, incentives should reward supply expansion, not speculative holding.
Yet the economists Wright quotes are debating Band-Aid adjustments – whether discounts should be 50, 40 or 25 per cent. They ignore the fundamental flaw: why discount at all? Other countries index capital gains to inflation and tax the real gain at full rates. No arbitrary discounts, no cliff effects at 12 months, just taxation of actual purchasing power increases.
The US offers another lesson: capital gains on property are not realised when proceeds are reinvested in equivalent or higher-value housing. That supports housing market participation without rewarding speculation. Australia’s CGT debate would benefit from less tinkering with discount percentages and more attention to what we are trying to achieve – and how other advanced economies actually do it. Hyun Son, Rozelle
Andrew’s downfall
It was a shock to all of us that Andrew was arrested and the King and prime minister said, “No one is above the law” (“Will Andrew and Epstein finally bring down the monarchy?”, February 20).
Imagine the citizens of the US reading, listening or watching that Andrew had been arrested, the first royal since 1647, and asking themselves why is our president above the law? Time for the populace to act and have their members of congress change the law so any president is just an everyday citizen and can be charged and imprisoned for committing a crime. Robert Pallister, Punchbowl
Whenever the subject of the republic has been raised in the past, the response has usually been “now is not the time”. What about now? Andrew Morrisey, Cremorne
Has anyone else noticed that Andrew increasingly looks like Humpty Dumpty? Jo Rainbow, Orange
Barangaroo bangers
Planning Minister Paul Scully obviously agrees with Business Sydney executive director Paul Nicolaou’s claim that “If you choose to live in Barangaroo – in the heart of a global city – a level of noise should be expected” (“‘Extremely disappointed’: Minister defies residents’ noise complaints to dump Barangaroo curfew”, February 20). Let’s get the facts straight. It is not Barangaroo residents who are affected by 24/7 operating hours at the Cutaway arts and culture space. It is Millers Point residents who will be hit. And Millers Point has been a residential area for a very long time, way before the Cutaway was even a sparkle in business eyes. Accuracy and truth are important.
Please, minister and Mr Nicolaou, think beyond the big buck. People living in traditional residential areas expect, and deserve, reasonable night-time amenity. Harold Kerr, Millers Point
Heritage not in danger
I was not surprised that UNESCO has rejected the application to list the Fleet Street Heritage Precinct on the World Heritage List (“Housing v heritage: UN knocks back bid for historic Parramatta precinct”, February 20). Eleven Australian convict sites were previously listed on the World Heritage List, including Old Government House and Domain in Parramatta Park. The steering committee for this process said: “The 11 sites included in the inscription are the pre-eminent examples of Australia’s rich convict history, with more than 3000 convict sites remaining around Australia”. With these pre-eminent listings in place, it made no sense to make further applications based on parochial political considerations and a desire to game the planning system. It is wrong, however, to portray things as a choice between housing and heritage. The heritage core is already listed on the national and state heritage lists and is not in danger of becoming high-rise housing or anything else. We’ve had enough of the misrepresentation and fearmongering by a small group. Now it’s time to get on with the adaptive reuse of the site while protecting its unquestioned heritage values. Warren Gardiner, Granville
Long way to Scots for a sausage roll
Having attended Scots College as a pupil for more than 11 years (graduated in 1985), I read with great interest the future employment of a nutritionist for the suffering Scots pupils (“‘Not a school for everyone’: Scots principal warns parents over WhatsApp group chat”, February 20). Back in my day at the college, nutrition was confined to a jam donut for “little lunch” and the big guns came out for lunch – a sausage roll and tomato sauce from the tuck shop. Please note barbecue sauce was not available on the menu at that time. It’s true that pies were consumed as well but were only affordable for the cashed-up students from the eastern suburbs. More importantly, in the colder winter months, said sausage roll was often broken in half to feed to a starving, shivering and malnourished boarding pupil. Tristan Milani, Mosman
Surely in these more culinary sophisticated times, the mothers of Scots boys should be agitating for more air fryers rather than humble microwaves. Stephen Manns, Woollahra
The Scots College headmaster is correct that the school is not for everyone. Apart from the exorbitant fees it caters for boys only. Vicky Marquis, Glebe
Novelty values rise to surface
I agree, Jill Stephenson, I have been attending school swimming carnivals for more than 30 years and increasingly the novelties are the most popular events (Letters, February 20). It is concerning that over the years fewer children swim 50 metres. Equity is one of the issues, so too time spent at local pools for lessons or leisure. Gone are the days of children spending weekends in a pool, diving, jumping in and out, chasing each other, joining lessons or swimming laps. Water safety is everyone’s business. In our public schools we offer lessons, but sadly it’s only for two weeks a year for some. Should we make it compulsory and more regular? It would be a good start. Lisa Williams, Dulwich Hill
Off time, off budget
Which issue also deserves a royal commission? I think it should be the outrageous cost of getting a passport at $422, plus $25 for photos, a trip to the post office, and a six-week wait to receive it? Seems they deliver it on the back of a tortoise. Is this a joke? The whole process says everything about inefficiency in the public sector.
Mokhles Sidden, South Strathfield
Well may they naysay ...
It has been a week since Angus Taylor and Jane Hume took over the leadership of the Liberal Party (“Jane Hume’s straight talk can get her in trouble, but she says the ‘time for timidity is over’”, February 20). As expected, their natural reaction to any issue is to oppose any policy the government has, or even may have in the future. Mooted changes to the CGT have been criticised before even a nascent policy being announced. Their reaction to any suggested repatriation of the ISIS brides did not take into account that the women may have been victims of coercive control, that the children taken to Syria had no choice in the matter and some of the children were born in Syria and are Australian citizens as of right. Like Dutton before him, Taylor and Hume have displayed a disappointing, but expected, lack of nuance in their pronouncements. Have they already forgotten the lessons of last year’s federal election? Jack Amond, Cabarita
Angus Taylor is right. If the Liberals don’t change, they’ll die. He just doesn’t realise that he’s the newly appointed undertaker. Craig Jory, Albury
Mental health crisis
It’s too soon to be apportioning blame for the recent tragedies involving mental health patients (“The troubled hospital men escaped before alleged stabbing, deaths”, February 20). However, successive NSW governments own responsibility for the present parlous state of our mental health system. In recent times, pleas from public hospital psychiatrists for their wages to be brought into line with other states were denied, resulting in massive resignations and putting further stress on an already struggling system. Consequently, there remains a shortage of mental health workers.
The coroner’s report on the Bondi Junction attack was scathing (“Coroner urges shakeup of NSW mental health system”, February 6). It highlighted systemic failures, treatment gaps, homelessness and the lack of long-term accomodation for the mentally ill. The Minns government responded with the promise of increased funding, but much more than that is required.
Previous inquests highlighted the failure to take health worker safety and deaths in-custody seriously. It seems that these concerns were not adequately addressed. Governments usually respond to requests for more funding by pleading poor, while the abuse of taxpayer funds continue. Graham Lum, North Rocks

Russians strike transport infrastructure facility in Chernihiv region, one person injured
Ukrinform
Russian forces have struck a transport infrastructure facility in Snovsk, Chernihiv region.
According to Ukrinform, the Koriukivka District Military Administration reported this on Telegram.
“This morning, an enemy UAV struck a transport infrastructure facility in Snovsk,” said Pavlo Miroshnychenko, head of the Koriukivka District Military Administration.
According to him, three explosions were recorded in Kuchynivka on the evening of February 19. A 63-year-old man was wounded.
The day before, Miroshnychenko said, Velykyi Shchymel and Snovsk were repeatedly hit by Russian strikes.
As reported by Ukrinform, on February 18, the Russian troops struck civilian infrastructure in Nizhyn with ballistic missiles. A man was injured.

Russian attack on Jan 27 causes significant damage to Druzhba oil pipeline – Ukrtransnafta
As a result of a targeted Russian attack on January 27, significant damage was caused to the technological and auxiliary equipment of the Druzhba oil pipeline, Ukrtransnafta reported.
"Work is currently underway at various stages of defect assessment, stabilization of the system’s technical condition and elimination of the consequences of the enemy strike. Emergency restoration work is being carried out with the involvement of specialized technical units and equipment," the company said in an official comment to Interfax-Ukraine.
The operator stressed that Russia systematically attacks oil and gas infrastructure facilities and, since the start of the full-scale invasion, has carried out more than 400 attacks on Naftogaz Group facilities using more than 1,700 strike weapons. Since the start of 2026 alone, more than 20 attacks on the group’s infrastructure have been recorded.
"All of these massive Russian missile and drone attacks are aimed at destroying Ukraine’s oil, gas and energy infrastructure. Under such conditions, it is difficult for energy companies to ensure uninterrupted, safe and stable operations," Ukrtransnafta said.
The company clarified that it promptly notified the Hungarian and Slovak sides of the January 27 attack and its consequences through established channels.
"Company representatives are in constant dialogue with Hungarian and Slovak counterparts," Ukrtransnafta stressed.
As previously reported, Hungary halted diesel fuel exports to Ukraine on February 18 until transit of Russian crude oil through the Druzhba pipeline is restored, said Zoltan Kovacs, Hungary’s state secretary for public diplomacy and relations. In his view, Ukraine "unilaterally halted supplies on January 27 for purely political reasons, even though technical restoration is possible."
Statements about halting diesel exports to Ukraine also came from the Slovak side.
According to Slovak media, Prime Minister Robert Fico also said Slovakia could suspend emergency electricity supplies to Ukraine.

UK reports record-breaking budget surplus of £30.4bn in surprise boost for Rachel Reeves

The UK government has posted the biggest ever budget surplus, official figures show, after a large boost in self-assessment and capital gains tax receipts.
In a boost for the chancellor, Rachel Reeves, in the run-up to her spring statement next month, public sector finances recorded a surplus of £30.4bn at the start of the year, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS). This was £15.9bn higher than the surplus recorded in January 2025.
The figure is the largest January total since records began in 1993 and much higher than the forecast of £24bn made by the Office for Budget Responsibility, the government’s official forecaster, and a poll of City economists.
It marks a sharp reversal from December, when public sector net borrowing – the difference between spending and income – was £11.6bn.
Grant Fitzner, the chief economist at the ONS, said: “January – which is traditionally a strong month for self-assessed tax receipts – saw the highest surplus since monthly records began.
“Revenue was strongly up on the same time last year, while spending was little changed, due to lower debt interest payments largely offsetting higher costs on public services and benefits.”
The surplus meant that the deficit for the first 10 months of the year is £112.1bn, which is less than the £120.4bn the OBR had forecast, providing a bit more relief for the chancellor.
The government traditionally records a surplus in January, meaning it earns more in tax revenue than it spends, because of the recording of self-assessment tax receipts in the month.
However, this year has been boosted by a rise in capital gains tax receipts because of an increase in people disposing of assets ahead of what they predicted would be a rise in capital gains tax in the 2024 autumn budget.
In her budget in October 2024, Reeves announced increases in the lower rate of CGT, from 10% to 18%, and the higher rate of CGT, from 20% to 24%, with these rate increases taking immediate effect.
There has also been a freeze in income tax thresholds since 2022, meaning more people had been lifted into a higher tax bracket over time because of inflation.
On top of these two factors, there have also been increases in national insurance contributions introduced last April and higher wage growth.
James Murray, the chief secretary to the Treasury, said: “We have the right plan to build a stronger, more secure economy. We have doubled our headroom, we are bringing inflation down, we are making sure that taxpayers’ money is spent wisely, and borrowing this year is forecast to be the lowest since before the pandemic.
“We know there is more to do to stop one in every £10 the government spends going on debt interest, and we will more than halve borrowing by 2030-31 so that money can be spent on policing, schools and the NHS.”
Reeves has made reducing government borrowing a priority, with the national debt hitting 92.9% of gross domestic product in January, a level not seen since the early 1960s. The cost of servicing that debt is high, with £1 in every £10 spent by the government going on debt interest.

SEVASTOPOL, February 20. /TASS/. Air defense forces shot down 26 drones during a nighttime attack by the Ukrainian army on Sevastopol, Governor Mikhail Razvozhayev said on his Telegram channel.
"All night long, our air defense forces and Black Sea Fleet were fighting off attacks by the Ukrainian forces. In total, more than 26 UAVs were shot down," the message said.
Razvozhayev added that the Ukrainian armed forces used drones loaded with metal balls.
He previously explained that such components act as shrapnel, scattering at high speed upon detonation of an explosive device and significantly increasing the area of damage and the risk to people, vehicles and homes.

Government posts record borrowing surplus in boost for Chancellor
The Office for National Statistics (ONS) said there was a public sector net borrowing surplus of £30.4 billion in January.

Britain notched up a record Government borrowing surplus last month in a surprise boost for Chancellor Rachel Reeves ahead of the spring statement, according to official figures.
The rise was sparked by a jump in self-assessed tax payments and a fall in debt interest to the lowest level since March 2020.
The Office for National Statistics (ONS) said there was a public sector net borrowing surplus of £30.4 billion in January.
It is the highest borrowing surplus – when the Government receives more in tax and other revenues than it spends – for any month since records began in 1993.
The surplus was also £6.3 billion bigger than predicted by the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) and £15.9 billion higher than the same month a year ago.
It came after the Government received a record tax take for January.
ONS chief economist Grant Fitzner said: “January – which is traditionally a strong month for self-assessed tax receipts – saw the highest surplus since monthly records began.
“Revenue was strongly up on the same time last year, while spending was little changed, due to lower debt interest payments largely offsetting higher costs on public services and benefits.
“Across the first 10 months of the current financial year, borrowing is lower than the same period a year ago.”

Crews hope to resume recovery of 8 bodies from California avalanche after days of dangerous weather
Crews hope to resume recovery of 8 bodies from California avalanche after days of dangerous weather
SODA SPRINGS, Calif. (AP) — Crews hope to resume efforts Friday to recover the bodies of eight people killed and one still missing in an avalanche in California’s Sierra Nevada after days of dangerous weather that has hampered safe access to the area.
Six of the people who died were part of a close-knit group of friends who were experienced backcountry skiers and knew how to navigate the alpine wilderness, their families said Thursday. The three others who are dead or presumed dead were guides.
“We are devastated beyond words,” the families said in a statement released through a spokesperson. The women were mothers, wives and friends who “connected through the love of the outdoors,” they said, and were carrying avalanche safety equipment and prepared for backcountry travel.
The six were identified as Carrie Atkin, Liz Clabaugh, Danielle Keatley, Kate Morse, Caroline Sekar and Kate Vitt, and they lived in the San Francisco Bay Area, in Idaho and in the Lake Tahoe area. The families asked for privacy while they grieve.
The names of the other victims have not been released.
Two from the group of friends survived and were rescued along with four others, including a guide.
Avalanche warnings were set to expire early Friday, and dryer and milder conditions were predicted for the weekend, according to the Sierra Avalanche Center.
The slide is the deadliest in the U.S. since 1981, when 11 climbers were killed on Mount Rainier in Washington state.
The 15 skiers began their three-day trip Sunday just as warnings about the storm were intensifying. By early Tuesday, officials cautioned that avalanches were expected.
What the guides and their tour company knew about the warnings and why they pressed on is now part of investigations by local authorities and a state agency that regulates workplace safety.
Avalanche safety experts say it is not uncommon for backcountry skiers to go out when there is an avalanche watch or even a warning.
Blackbird Mountain Guides, which was leading the expedition, said the guides who were on the trek were trained or certified in backcountry skiing and instructors with the American Institute for Avalanche Research and Education. While in the field, guides “are in communication with senior guides at our base, to discuss conditions and routing based upon conditions,” founder Zeb Blais said in a statement.
California Gov. Gavin Newsom said some of his wife’s “old family friends” were on the trip. The Newsoms have a home in Marin County, where some of the people on the trip lived. His office did not immediately provide more details.
“These were some experienced guides that were out there, and that’s what’s even more concerning and disturbing,” he said at a news conference Thursday.
Sekar and Clabaugh were sisters, their brother, McAlister Clabaugh, told The New York Times. Sekar was a mother of two who lived in San Francisco, and Liz Clabaugh worked for St. Luke’s Health System in Boise, Idaho, according to her LinkedIn page.
Vitt lived in San Francisco and worked previously at SiriusXM and Pandora, according to her LinkedIn page. The Kentfield School District sent an email to families Wednesday saying that her two sons “are safe and are with their father, Geoff, as they navigate this profound loss,” according to The New York Times.
Atkin lived with her husband and two children and was a former corporate executive and Division I Track & Field athlete, according to her leadership coaching website.
Some members of the group had ties to the elite Sugar Bowl Academy, a private boarding and day school for competitive skiers and snowboarders whose former students include multiple Olympians.
One of the victims was married to a member of a backcountry search and rescue team in the area, Placer County Sheriff Wayne Woo said.

Indonesia’s president reaches a trade deal with US while in Washington for Trump’s Board of Peace
Indonesia’s president reaches a trade deal with US while in Washington for Trump’s Board of Peace
WASHINGTON (AP) — The White House announced a reciprocal trade agreement with Indonesia on Thursday while President Prabowo Subianto was in Washington to attend the first meeting of President Donald Trump’s Board of Peace.
Under the agreement, Southeast Asia’s largest economy will eliminate tariffs for 99% of American goods while the U.S. will maintain tariffs on most Indonesian goods at 19%, the White House said. That is the same rate the U.S. has set for Cambodia and Malaysia. Indonesia also agreed to address non-tariff barriers to U.S. goods and to remove restrictions on exports to the U.S. for critical minerals and other industrial commodities, the White House said.
Indonesian and U.S. companies also reached 11 deals this week worth $38.4 billion, including purchases of U.S. soybeans, corn, cotton and wheat, cooperation in critical minerals and oil field recovery, and joint ventures in computer chips.
“We have negotiated very intensively over the last few months, and I think we have reached solid understandings on many issues,” Prabowo told business executives Wednesday at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.
A White House statement called it a “great deal” and said it “will help both countries to strengthen economic security, promote economic growth, and thereby continuously lead to global prosperity.”
The agreement was later signed by U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer and his Indonesian counterpart, Airlangga Hartarto.
Hartarto told a news conference from Washington that both governments cast the agreement as marking the start of a “new golden age” in bilateral economic ties and Indonesia will introduce measures designed to keep trade flows secure and prevent misuse of sensitive goods.
Indonesia’s pledge for Gaza stabilization force
The agreement was announced the same day that Prabowo, leader of the world’s most populous Muslim country, reiterated his pledge at the Board of Peace meeting to send 8,000 troops or “more if necessary” for an international stabilization force in Gaza.
Indonesia was among the first to make a firm commitment to a critical element of Trump’s postwar Gaza reconstruction plan.
“President Prabowo of Indonesia, thank you very much,” Trump said at the Board of Peace meeting. “It’s a big country you have, and you do a great job.”
Prabowo praised Trump in return. “We are very optimistic with the leadership of President Trump, this vision of real peace will be achieved,” Prabowo said. “There will be problems, but we will prevail.”
Cambodia and Vietnam are the two other Southeast Asian countries that joined the board, which was originally envisioned as overseeing the Gaza ceasefire but has taken shape with wider ambitions to broker other global conflicts.
Their leaders also came to Washington for the inaugural meeting. Cambodia has already inked a trade deal with the U.S., while Vietnam has reached a framework agreement.
Critical minerals play into Indonesia deal
Indonesian companies agreed this week to buy 1 million tons of soybeans, 1.6 million tons of corn and 93,000 tons of cotton from the U.S. They also pledged to buy up to 5 million tons of U.S. wheat by 2030.
The countries agreed to cooperate on critical minerals, though details were not immediately available.
Washington is seeking Indonesia’s agreement to lift restrictions on critical mineral exports, which the Trump administration argues could safeguard U.S. manufacturers from supply‑chain disruptions. The administration has sought to defend against China’s stranglehold on the key elements needed for everything from fighter jets to smartphones.
At the Chamber of Commerce event, Prabowo said Indonesia can serve as a “bridge” and “honest broker” between great powers, apparently referring to the U.S.-China competition.
Vietnam’s leader makes first visit to the US since being reelected
At the Board of Peace meeting, Trump called Vietnam “incredible as a country and as a force” and told leader To Lam that it was “a really great honor to have you.”
Lam’s visit to the U.S. is his first since he was reelected as the head of Vietnam’s ruling Communist Party last month. Typically, China is an initial stop in a nod to the countries’ ideological ties and Beijing’s status as Vietnam’s largest trading partner. Lam did visit China in August 2024 before traveling to the U.S. during his first term.
Analysts say Lam’s visit to the U.S. before traveling to Beijing this time around is a notable shift in sequencing. Hanoi describes its foreign policy as independent and balanced among major powers.
Trade negotiations between Vietnam and the United States are ongoing following the Trump administration levying 20% tariffs on Vietnamese exports. The latest, sixth round of talks concluded in early February.

Kim lauds North Korea’s economy and regional standing as major party meeting opens
Kim lauds North Korea’s economy and regional standing as major party meeting opens
SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — North Korean leader Kim Jong Un lauded his nation’s improving economy and regional standing as he opened the country’s most important political event, where he is expected to set his domestic and foreign policy agenda for the next five years and further entrench his family’s authoritarian rule.
The Workers’ Party congress, which will likely run for days in Pyongyang, comes as Kim carves out a more forceful regional presence, leveraging an advancing nuclear arsenal and a growing alignment with Moscow that have deepened his standoffs with Washington and Seoul.
The meeting will likely provide the stage for Kim to unveil his key political and military objectives and further consolidate his authoritarian grip before thousands of ruling party delegates. Some analysts say Kim could also use the congress to position his teenage daughter — believed to be named Kim Ju Ae and about 13 — as a potential successor, formalizing the regime’s fourth-generation succession.
North Korea’s official Korean Central News Agency reported Friday the meeting began the previous day. It did not immediately report any direct comments from Kim on his standoffs with the United States and South Korea or his nuclear weapons program.
Brimming with confidence
Entering his 15th year in power, Kim is in a much stronger position than when he last convened the congress in 2021, when North Korea was experiencing a crippled economy worsened by the COVID-19 pandemic and the wreckage of his failed diplomacy with U.S. President Donald Trump.
Kim then made a rare admission of economic failures and issued a five-year development plan through 2025, urging economic self-reliance through mass mobilization. He doubled down on his nuclear ambitions and issued a long wish list of sophisticated weapons systems.
Kim now appears less isolated and more confident, buoyed by stronger ties with Russia and China, an extensive nuclear arsenal and what the outside world sees as a gradually improving economy.
In Thursday’s speech, Kim claimed the North has made significant progress since 2021, citing economic gains and a firmer regional footing that he said marked an “irreversible” strengthening of the state’s status.
Kim has capitalized on geopolitical turmoil, using Russia’s war in Ukraine as a window to accelerate weapons development and deepen ties with Moscow, providing thousands of troops and large munitions shipments to support President Vladimir Putin’s war effort, possibly in exchange for aid and military technology.
He’s cozying up to China, joining Putin at a World War II ceremony in Beijing last September and holding his first summit with Chinese President Xi Jinping in six years — events that backed his efforts to portray the North as part of a united front against Washington.
Kim’s strict information blockade obscures the full picture of North Korea’s economy, which remains in a largely impoverished state after decades of policy failures and sanctions.
Still, Lee Jong-kyu, an analyst at South Korea’s Korea Development Institute, estimates the North’s economy grew roughly 10% over the last five years, benefiting from a post-pandemic rebound in trade with China and arms exports to Russia.
“The past five years might be the most productive period for North Korean leadership since the 1950s and 1960s,” said Koh Yu-hwan, former president of Seoul’s Institute for National Unification. Reflecting Kim’s confidence, the new congress is unlikely to introduce major shifts in domestic policy and will continue to stress internal unity and self-reliance under another five-year economic plan, Koh said.
Bolstering both nuclear and conventional forces
North Korea has developed or tested much of the weapons Kim demanded in 2021, including solid-fuel intercontinental ballistic missiles and tactical nuclear systems. The country launched its first military satellite in 2023 and has recently claimed progress in building a nuclear-propelled submarine.
After prioritizing nuclear weapons and missiles, Kim is now putting more focus on conventional systems, launching new warships, anti-air weapons and attack drones, while outlining broader plans to integrate nuclear and conventional forces. Kim’s recent comments suggest he will use the congress to emphasize the parallel development of nuclear and conventional systems under a separate five-year plan for military development.
Kim could be drawing lessons from North Korea’s involvement in the conflict in Ukraine, now a conventional war of attrition in which Russia has avoided nuclear weapons. Conventional forces could become a key area of cooperation with Russia, such as improving the North’s aging air-defense systems, experts say.
North Korea has already adopted an escalatory nuclear doctrine that authorizes preemptive strikes if the leadership is deemed under threat. By pushing for the integration of conventional and nuclear forces, Kim aims to blur the distinction between them and signal a lower threshold for nuclear use, heightening the threat to South Korea, analysts say.
Keeping distance with Seoul and Washington
Kim has shunned talks with rival South Korea since 2019, when his diplomacy with Trump collapsed over U.S.-led sanctions. Ties worsened after Kim in 2024 discarded North Korea’s long-standing goal of a peaceful unification and declared Seoul a permanent enemy.
Kim is likely to entrench his hard-line view of the South at the congress, possibly by instructing changes to party rules to codify inter-Korean relations as between “two hostile states.” While South Korean President Lee Jae Myung desires engagement, it’s highly unlikely that Kim’s stance on Seoul would change anytime soon, Koh said.
It’s clear Kim no longer views Seoul as a useful middleman with Washington, but rather as an obstacle to his efforts to carve out a more assertive role in global affairs. He has also shown sensitivity to South Korean soft power, intensifying a campaign to stamp out the influence of South Korean culture at home to reinforce his family’s dynastic rule.
Kim may take a more measured approach toward Washington to preserve the possibility of future dialogue, with the long-term aim of securing U.S. sanctions relief and tacit recognition as a nuclear state. While Kim has been prioritizing Russia, it would make sense to keep his options open as Putin’s war in Ukraine could wind down, potentially making North Korea less valuable to Moscow, some analysts say.

Deadly California avalanche highlights inherent risks in the backcountry

Deadly California avalanche highlights inherent risks in the backcountry
Deadly California avalanche highlights inherent risks in the backcountry
The recovery of skiers killed in the deadliest U.S. avalanche in almost 45 years is dragging out because of what experts say is a prime rule for rescuers: Don’t make yourself a victim.
A storm that continued lashing California’s remote Sierra Nevada wilderness Thursday meant more avalanches were possible in the backcountry area where authorities said eight people died and one was still missing two days after their group was caught in the deadly slide. Six people survived.
Rescuers faced the same potential perils that killed the backcountry skiers and professional guides, as they pursued a sport with inherent risks that were compounded by several feet of new snow. Recovery efforts were set to resume Friday.
Last day of the trip
Backcountry winter travelers from skiers and snowboarders to snowmobilers and mountaineers lean on avalanche forecasts to help them gauge the danger. Yet conditions quickly shift because of turbulent mountain weather.
To supplement forecasts or if none is available, experienced skiers and guides will dig a pit in the snow to test how stable it is. They can also search out less-hazardous terrain, such as slopes that are not as steep or that are sheltered from known avalanche routes.
As the snow from the storm system hitting the Sierras this week piled up, the group of 15 skiers caught in Tuesday’s avalanche were on the last day of a multiday trip and heading for the trailhead.
“It was, quite likely, very necessary for them to leave the backcountry so their hazard wasn’t increased further,” said Anthony Pavlantos of Utah-based Prival USA, who makes avalanche safety equipment and runs mountain safety programs.
“What’s really hard to say is like ‘why were they moving?’ You can’t ever start placing blame on events like this because we can all be there.”
‘Luck runs out’
It’s not uncommon for people to venture into the backcountry to ski or snowboard during times of heightened danger: A dangerous storm also means lots of fresh snow that many skiers crave.
And because fatal accidents are rare, the risk takers most often survive, said Dale Atkins, who has been involved in mountain rescues and avalanche forecasting and research in Colorado for five decades.
“It’s not about not going; it’s about where and when you go,” Atkins said.
But Atkins added that coming out of the backcountry unscathed can create a false sense of security in a pursuit where luck – or not enough of it – also plays a role.
“It’s really easy to be fooled by the snow and avalanches,” he said. “We keep going out even in the worst of storms because that’s what we did last time, and then our luck runs out.”
Typically the best hope for someone to survive burial in an avalanche is to dig themselves out or be rescued by a companion. That is because slides often occur in remote areas.
It took rescuers six hours to reach the victims of Tuesday’s avalanche after the first report came in. By comparison, the chances of survival for someone buried for an hour is only about one in 10, Atkins said.
The surviving skiers in California found three of the victims while they awaited rescue. Authorities haven’t given a detailed account about how they located the other victims.
The probe line
A debris field from a major avalanche like the fatal one in California will stretch over a huge area, making it difficult to figure out where someone ends up if they are caught and dragged beneath the surface.
The first thing to look for is clues such as a glove or ski pole that could reveal a victim’s location, said Anthony Stevens, chief adviser for the search and rescue team in Teton County, Wyoming, home to Grand Teton National Park.
Skiers in guided groups typically carry transceivers, known as avalanche beacons, that send out signals showing where they are. The devices can also receive other signals, displaying the direction and approximate distance to a victim.
If that doesn’t work, rescuers can line up and use long, slender poles to probe into the snow in hopes of finding someone, said Ethan Greene, director of the Colorado Avalanche Information Center.
Time is of the essence throughout a rescue, and once someone is found they have to be dug out. The average depth of burial is roughly a meter, or just over 3 feet, Atkins said. And because snow and ice in an avalanche get heavily compacted, digging out someone from that depth requires moving at least a ton of material, he said.
Rarely will people survive being buried for long. Atkins said he knew of two people who survived being buried 22 and 24 hours respectively following an avalanche in the 1990s in Washington state. A third member of their party did not survive.
“It’s very unusual for a rescue team to find a buried person alive. But it happens, and that gives us hope,” he said.

Trump climate health rollback likely to hit poor, minority areas hardest, experts say

Trump climate health rollback likely to hit poor, minority areas hardest, experts say
The Trump administration’s revocation of a scientific finding that climate change is a danger to public health is likely to affect communities of color the most, public health experts say.
In a stretch of Louisiana with about 170 fossil fuel and petrochemical plants, premature death is a fact of life for people living nearby. The air is so polluted and the cancer rates so high it is known as Cancer Alley.
“Most adults in the area are attending two to three funerals per month,” said Gary C. Watson Jr., who was born and raised in St. John the Baptist Parish, a majority Black community in Cancer Alley about 30 miles outside of New Orleans. His father survived cancer, but in recent years, at least five relatives have died from it.
Cancer Alley is one of many patches of America — mostly minority and poor — that suffer higher levels of air pollution from fossil fuel facilities that emit tiny particles connected to higher death rates. When the federal government in 2009 targeted carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases as a public health danger because of climate change, it led to tighter regulation of pollution and cleaner air in some communities. But this month, the Trump administration’s Environmental Protection Agency overturned that “endangerment finding.”
Public health experts say the change will likely mean more illness and death for Americans, with communities like Watson’s hit hardest. On Wednesday, a coalition of health and environmental groups sued the EPA over the revocation, calling it unlawful and harmful.
“Not having these protections, it’s only going to make things worse,” said Watson, with the environmental justice group Rise St. James Louisiana. He also worries that revoking the endangerment finding will increase emissions that will worsen the state’s hurricanes.
The Trump administration said the finding — a cornerstone for many regulations aimed at fighting climate change — hurts industry and the economy. President Donald Trump has called the idea “a scam” despite repeated studies showing the opposite.
Growing evidence shows that poor and Black, Latino and other racial and ethnic groups are typically more vulnerable than white people to pollution and climate-driven floods, hurricanes, extreme heat and more because they tend to have less resources to protect against and recover from them. The EPA, in a 2021 report no longer on its website, concluded the same.
The finding’s reversal will affect everyone, but “overburdened communities, which are typically communities of color, Indigenous communities and low-income communities, they will, again, suffer most from these actions,” said Matthew Tejada, senior vice president for environmental health at the Natural Resources Defense Council and a former deputy with the EPA’s office for environmental justice.
Hilda Berganza, climate program manager with the Hispanic Access Foundation, said: “Communities that are the front lines are going to feel it the most. And we can see that the Latino population is one of those communities that is going feel it even more than others because of where we live, where we work.”
Research shows the unequal harms of pollution, climate change
A study published in November found more than 46 million people in the U.S. live within a mile of at least one type of energy supply infrastructure, such as an oil well, a power plant or an oil refinery. But the study found that “persistently marginalized” racial and ethnic groups were more likely to live near multiple such sites. Latinos had the highest exposure.
The EPA, in that 2021 report, estimated that with a 2-degree Celsius (3.6 Fahrenheit) rise in global warming, Black people were 40% more likely to live in places with the highest projected rise in deaths because of extreme heat. Latinos, who are overrepresented in outdoor industries such as agriculture and construction, were 43% more likely to live where labor hour losses were expected to be the highest because of heat.
Julia Silver, a senior research analyst at the University of California, Los Angeles’ Latino Policy and Politics Institute, found in her own research that California Latino communities had 23 more days of extreme heat annually than non-Latino white neighborhoods. Her team also found those areas have poor air quality at about double the rate, with twice as many asthma-related emergency room visits. Other research shows that Latino children are 40% more likely to die from asthma than white children in part because many lack consistent health care access.
“What we’re risking with a rollback like this at the federal level is really human health and well-being in these marginalized groups,” Silver said.
Experts say the disparate impacts will be significant
Armando Carpio, a longtime pastor in Los Angeles, has seen firsthand how vulnerable his mostly Latino parishioners are. Many are construction workers and gardeners who work outside, often in extreme heat. Others live and work near polluting freeways. He sees children with asthma and elders with dementia, both linked to exposure to air pollution.
“We’re regressing,” he said. “I don’t know how many years back, but all of this really affects us.”
It is difficult to quantify how much more communities of color could be impacted by the finding’s revocation, but experts who spoke with The Associated Press all said it would be significant.
“You will see statistically significant increases in excess morbidity and mortality when it comes to climate impacts and health impacts associated with co-pollutants” in communities of color, said Sacoby Wilson, a University of Maryland professor and executive director of the nonprofit Center for Engagement, Environmental Justice and Health INpowering Communities.
Beverly Wright, founding director of the Deep South Center for Environmental Justice in New Orleans, said at least four Black communities in Cancer Alley no longer exist because of the expansion of industrial facilities. The repeal will bring more pollution, higher cancer rates, more extreme weather and the disappearance of more historic communities, she said.
“It has us going in the wrong direction, and our communities are now at greater risk,” she said.

Ex-South Korean president remains defiant following life sentence for rebellion
Ex-South Korean president remains defiant following life sentence for rebellion
SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — Ousted South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol on Friday remained defiant in his first reaction to a life sentence for rebellion handed down by a Seoul court the previous day.
In a statement released by his lawyers, Yoon maintained that his abrupt and short-lived declaration of martial law in December 2024 was done “solely for the sake of the nation and our people,” and dismissed the Seoul Central District Court as biased against him.
Yoon, who was removed from office amid a political crisis set off by his unsuccessful power grab, has long rejected the eight criminal cases brought against him for what prosecutors described as a coup attempt and other allegations.
He barricaded himself in the presidential residence for weeks, stonewalled investigators following his arrest, and skipped court dates, while clashing with witnesses when he did appear.
In handing down his verdict on rebellion charges on Thursday, Judge Jee Kui-youn of the Seoul court said that Yoon has shown “no sign of apology for the staggering social costs incurred by the emergency martial law” and that he “refused to appear in court without any justifiable reason” several times.
Conservative supporters of the former president, who rallied near the court for hours ahead of the verdict, expressed disappointment and anger after it was announced, while his opponents cheered in nearby streets, the two groups separated by hundreds of police officers. There were no major clashes.
Yoon’s statement rejected the verdict as illegitimate.
“In a situation where the independence of the judiciary cannot be guaranteed and a verdict based on law and conscience is difficult to expect, I feel deep skepticism whether it would be meaningful to continue a legal battle through an appeal,” said Yoon, 65, who has been jailed since last July.
Yoo Jeong-hwa, one of Yoon’s lawyers, said Yoon was “merely expressing his current state of mind” and was not indicating an intention to waive his right to appeal. Yoon has seven days to appeal Thursday’s sentence.
In his statement, Yoon expressed sympathy to the families of soldiers, police officials and public servants facing investigations or indictment in connection with his martial law decree, saying he feels responsible for their suffering. But he also assured his supporters “our fight is not over.”
The court found Yoon guilty of orchestrating a rebellion by mobilizing military and police forces in an illegal bid to seize the liberal-led legislature, arrest political opponents and establish unchecked rule for an indefinite period. Yoon has described his authoritarian push as necessary to counter the opposition-controlled legislature, which he portrayed as made up of “anti-state” forces.
Yoon could also face an appeal brought by an independent counsel, who asked the court to sentence him to death and have the right to ask a higher court to change the sentence. Jang Woo-sung, a member of the investigation team, told reporters after the ruling that the team has “reservations” regarding the court’s factual findings and the severity of the sentence.
The Seoul court also convicted and sentenced five former military and police officials involved in enforcing Yoon’s martial law decree. They included ex-Defense Minister Kim Yong Hyun, who received a 30-year jail term for his central role in planning the measure, mobilizing the military and instructing military counterintelligence officials to arrest key politicians, including current liberal President Lee Jae Myung. Kim has appealed.
Jang Dong-hyuk, leader of the conservative People Power Party, said at a news conference Friday that the court failed to present a convincing case that Yoon’s martial law amounted to rebellion and, referring to a possible appeal, stressed that “the right to be presumed innocent applies to everyone without exception.”
Yoon’s martial law decree, announced late at night on Dec. 3, 2024, lasted about six hours, after a quorum of lawmakers broke through a military blockade and unanimously voted to overturn it, forcing his Cabinet to lift the measure.
Yoon was suspended from office on Dec. 14, 2024, after being impeached by lawmakers and was formally removed by the Constitutional Court in April 2025. He has been facing multiple criminal trials under arrest, with the rebellion charge carrying the most severe punishment.
While brief, Yoon’s martial law decree set off the country’s most severe political crisis in decades, paralyzing politics and high-level diplomacy and rattling financial markets. The power vacuum was resolved after Lee won an early election in June last year.

Venezuela grants amnesty that could release hundreds of political detainees
More than 600 people may be in custody for political reasons, one Venezuelan rights group estimates.
Venezuela’s acting president has signed into law an amnesty bill that could see hundreds of politicians, activists and lawyers released soon, while tacitly acknowledging what the country has denied for years – that it has political detainees in jail.
The law, signed on Thursday, in effect reverses decades of denials in the government’s latest about-face since the United States military’s January 3 attack in the country’s capital, Caracas, and the abduction of President Nicolas Maduro.

Opposition members, activists, human rights defenders, journalists and others who were targeted by the governing party over the past 27 years could benefit from the new law.
But families hoping for the release of relatives say acting President Delcy Rodriguez has failed to deliver on earlier promises to release prisoners. Some of them have been gathered outside detention centres for weeks.
Venezuela-based prisoners’ rights group Foro Penal has tallied 448 releases since January 8 and estimates that more than 600 people are still in custody for political reasons.
The new law provides amnesty for involvement in political protests and “violent actions” which took place during a brief coup in 2002 and during demonstrations or elections in certain months going back to 2004.
It does not detail the exact crimes which would be eligible for amnesty, though a previous draft laid out several, including instigation of illegal activity, resistance to authorities, rebellion and treason.
People convicted of “military rebellion” for involvement in events in 2019 are excluded. The law also does not return assets of those detained, revoke public office bans given for political reasons or cancel sanctions against media outlets.
Opposition divided
“It’s not perfect, but it is undoubtedly a great step forward for the reconciliation of Venezuela,” opposition politician Nora Bracho said during a debate on the bill in the legislature on Thursday.
But the law was criticised by other members of the opposition, including Pedro Urruchurtu, international relations director for opposition leader and Nobel Peace Prize laureate Maria Corina Machado.
“A true amnesty doesn’t require laws, but rather will, something that is lacking in this discussion,” he said on X on Thursday. “It is not only an invalid and illegitimate law, but also a trap to buy time and revictimize those persecuted.”
Since Madura’s abduction, US President Donald Trump has praised Rodriguez, Maduro’s former deputy, while downplaying the prospect of supporting the opposition.
For her part, Rodriguez has overseen several concessions to the US, including freezing oil shipments to Cuba and supporting a law to open the state-controlled oil industry to foreign companies.
The US has said it will control the proceeds from Venezuela’s oil sales until a “representative government” is established.

France to provide Ukraine with grant support of EUR 71 mln, incl for strengthening energy system – Shmyhal
France will provide Ukraine with grants of EUR 71 million, which will be used, among other things, to strengthen the energy sector, First Deputy Prime Minister, Minister of Energy Denys Shmyhal said following a meeting with French Minister of Economy, Finance, Industrial, Energy, and Digital Sovereignty Roland Lescure on Thursday.
"We also signed a document on cooperation in the field of nuclear energy. With this, we are laying a solid foundation for deepening the strategic partnership and forming a framework for the recovery and modernization of Ukraine’s energy sector," Shmyhal wrote on his Telegram channel Thursday.
He thanked French partners for 50 shipments of humanitarian energy aid, including more than 140 high-capacity generators.
"France has also directed EUR 5.7 million to the Energy Support Fund. Special thanks to the French government for its decision to supply an additional 150 generators to Ukraine in February. Together with France, we are implementing three important infrastructure projects to strengthen regional energy systems. We see the engagement and readiness of French companies to continue and deepen cooperation," Shmyhal added.

UN steps in to help governments regulate AI as fears grow over technology's misuse

The United Nations is moving to shape global rules for artificial intelligence as mounting concerns over economic disruption, misinformation and online abuse intensify pressure on governments to act.
Secretary-General Antonio Guterres on Friday said a newly confirmed international expert panel would help policymakers better understand the risks posed by rapidly evolving AI systems and design smarter regulation.
Speaking at a summit in New Delhi, Guterres warned that technological advances are outpacing the world’s ability to govern them, leaving societies exposed to unintended consequences ranging from job displacement to the spread of harmful content.
The Independent International Scientific Panel on Artificial Intelligence — modelled in part on the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change — is intended to provide science-based assessments that governments can rely on when drafting AI rules.
Guterres said clearer evidence about what AI can and cannot do would allow regulators to move beyond blunt restrictions toward targeted safeguards, ensuring innovation continues while risks are contained.
Among the panel’s members are Nobel laureate journalist Maria Ressa and Canadian AI researcher Yoshua Bengio. Its first report is expected ahead of a UN dialogue on AI governance in July.
World leaders are expected to issue a joint statement on the technology later on Friday, as the summit wraps up with growing consensus that global coordination will be essential to manage AI’s impact.

Hongkongers make 1.4 million outbound trips over Lunar New Year break, up 20% from 2019
Local tourism sector reports modest gains this year despite nearly 13 per cent drop in mainland Chinese arrivals from pre-pandemic levels
Hongkongers made more than 1.4 million outbound trips over the Lunar New Year holiday, up 20 per cent from 2019, while the number of arrivals over the same period remained lower than pre-pandemic levels.
Immigration Department data released on Friday showed that from Lunar New Year’s Eve to the third day of the holiday, residents made 1.44 million trips out of the city, about 20.4 per cent more than the 1.2 million recorded in the same period in 2019.
By contrast, mainland Chinese visitors made 629,340 trips to Hong Kong over the same four days, a 12.8 per cent drop from the 721,955 recorded before the pandemic in 2019.
The number of arrivals by non-mainland visitors also fell by about 4.4 per cent over the same period.
Despite robust cross-border activity this year – including a significant share of locals travelling out and returning from holiday – the local tourism industry reported a cautious recovery, even as some neighbourhood and mid-priced restaurants continued to struggle.
The government earlier estimated that around 9.52 million passengers would pass through Hong Kong’s land control points from February 14 to 23, a 29.7 per cent increase than last year’s projection of 7.34 million over the period.
The latest statistics came as Hong Kong’s retail sector returned to modest growth after a prolonged downturn.

German foreign minister warns against Europe turning away from US
Wadephul says greater European sovereignty should not mean separation
BERLIN
German Foreign Minister Johann Wadephul on Friday cautioned against Europe completely distancing itself from the United States, saying greater sovereignty should not mean severing transatlantic ties.
Europe must make stronger efforts to become more independent and sovereign, but not independent from the US, Wadephul told public broadcaster ZDF.
“That would be a separation, which nobody wants and which is also unnecessary,” he said.
Wadephul rejected framing the debate as a choice between Europe and the United States.
“Let’s have a debate in which we honestly say what we can and must do more of in Europe and, on the other hand, what we have in the US. This is a reliable alliance,” he said.
He stressed that the US remains fully integrated into NATO and plays a crucial role in Europe’s defense.
“Without the US, we would not have sufficient defense capabilities in Europe, neither nuclear nor conventional, nor in terms of intelligence information and work. That has to be said quite soberly,” he said.
Wadephul’s comments follow recent remarks by Chancellor Friedrich Merz at the 62nd Munich Security Conference, calling for a renewed transatlantic relationship with a strong and largely independent European pillar.
Merz has repeatedly warned that the United States is moving away from a rules-based international order toward power- and interest-driven politics and has urged Europe to assert itself.

Trump administration to release files related to aliens and UFOs
- Donald Trump has directed the release of government files related to alien and extraterrestrial life, unidentified aerial phenomena (UAP), and unidentified flying objects (UFOs).
- The announcement came hours after Trump accused Barack Obama of making a "big mistake" and sharing "classified information" by suggesting aliens are real on a podcast.
- Obama later clarified on Instagram that he saw "no evidence during my presidency that extraterrestrials have made contact with us."
- Officials like Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth and White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt reacted positively, while some, including Republican Representative Thomas Massie, suggested it could be a distraction from the release of Jeffrey Epstein files.
- The move follows comments from Trump's daughter-in-law, Lara Trump, who hinted that he had a prepared speech concerning extraterrestrial life.

Golly, what an incredible lifetime of devoted service
The bagpipes sounded, roads were blocked and applause echoed off the buildings as one of the nation’s most senior officers walked out of police headquarters for the last time.
It was a bittersweet moment as Queensland Police Commissioner Steve Gollschewski cut short his stellar career to focus on his family and his health.
Almost a year after a devastating cancer diagnosis, the deadly disease has ravaged the man who was once the picture of robust health.
The 66-year-old will never be cured, but his policing legacy will live on.
Brisbane’s police headquarters was crowded with friends, co-workers and admirers all wanting to bid farewell to “Golly”.
His last steps out of the building lacked the bounding enthusiasm of youth – the tread was heavy, more of a shuffle, but his head was held high.
It has been a stellar career for a man who has soared far higher than he could have dreamed as a fresh-faced recruit, with his modest ambition to one day become a detective sergeant.
“Everything else has been an accident,” he said when he announced his retirement earlier in February.
“And to be really honest, that was probably my favourite part of my career, was when I was out there locking up perpetrators and looking after victims.”
It was as the stoic face of Queensland’s COVID frontline that Gollschewski gained wider recognition on a national stage.
He took over as commissioner in 2024 amid a youth crime crisis, tasked with repairing the damage from a scathing commission of inquiry that revealed a “failure of leadership” over a culture of racism and sexism.
Gollschewski recently broke the news of his exit to Police Minister Dan Purdie over a coffee, advising him he would be fast-tracking the end of his term, originally set for 2029.
Purdie – himself a former officer – found it humbling handing Gollschewski back to his family, saying Queensland owed him a debt “we could probably never repay”.
“There’s nothing that Golly hasn’t done for this state,” he said.
“Whether it’s being a detective out in the regions, the years he spent managing disasters as the state disaster co-ordinator or when he was a deputy commissioner leading the response to COVID.
“But more recently, we know the work that he was able to do as the commissioner to turn the police service around on the back of the 100-day review while battling cancer, is really remarkable.”
Brett Pointing, who will take over as interim commissioner for 12 months, joined the loyal Queensland deputies to form a guard of honour as Gollschewski took his final steps in uniform.
By midnight, Pointing will officially be Queensland’s new top cop, but the Friday farewell was for Golly.
He shook every hand he could reach, shared a laugh and a smile, waving goodbye before performing his last official duty – a final salute with Deputy Cheryl Scanlon.
He was ushered into a waiting vehicle as the door closed on a glorious 46-year career.

Ukrainians mourn missing homes and loved ones after four years of war
Sign up now: Get ST's newsletters delivered to your inbox
DZENZELIVKA, Ukraine, Feb 20 - Sixty-five-year-old Halyna Popriadukhina has fled her home three times as Russian troops have marched deeper into eastern Ukraine during four years of war. Tired of running, she hopes Ukraine can somehow hold them back.
"I'm afraid there's nowhere else to escape," she said, the exhaustion apparent in her voice as she relates how one of her sons is missing in action, the other likely held by Russian forces.
Popriadukhina is among nearly 4 million people displaced within Ukraine, on top of more than 5 million who fled to Europe, as the war grinds into its fifth year next week. Many of them fear they will not see their homes, or loved ones, again.
Control of her homeland of Donbas - comprised of Ukraine's industrialised eastern regions of Donetsk and Luhansk - is at the heart of U.S.-backed peace talks to end the war, Europe's biggest conflict since World War Two.
Russia is demanding that Kyiv cede the remaining 20% of Donetsk that it has been unable to conquer - something Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy has refused even though he said U.S. mediators had advised him behind closed doors it would be enough to secure peace.
"We can't just withdraw," Zelenskiy said this week. "We have to understand that Donbas is a part of our independence ... It's not about the land. It's not only about territories: it's about people."
RUSSIA INVADED AS SHE WAS MILKING COWS
Popriadukhina said she had been milking cows with a friend when missiles began flying on Feb. 24, 2022 as the Russian invasion began. She reluctantly agreed to flee on her son's urging, leaving behind her home and livestock that had been critical to her survival.
"I tried to make it so that I had everything (in life)," said Popriadukhina, a former collective farmworker.
"I didn't take anything from there. Everything was lost."
After several months in western Ukraine, she returned to the Donetsk region in the summer of 2022 - only to leave again last March as Russian forces pressed forward. When they lurched further westward into the Dnipropetrovsk region, she moved again.
She now lives in central Ukraine, hundreds of kilometres away from her hometown of Vremivka in the east, which is now occupied by Russian troops. Ukrainian authorities allocated her an abandoned, ramshackle house in the village of Dzenzelivka.
Like countless other towns and villages across Ukraine, it features a so-called "Alley of Heroes" with portraits of fallen soldiers. Residents stop by every morning to honour them in a moment of silence.
Popriadukhina's trajectory reflects Russia's grinding advances over the years. It occupies about one-fifth of the country after what Ukraine says have been deeply costly assaults across a battle-scarred steppe that have wiped entire settlements off the map.
"I don't need their little Russia," she said, using a diminutive coined by Ukrainians to show derision for the territorial designs of their much larger neighbour.
While Kyiv's outmanned and outgunned troops have held back any potential breakthrough, the Norwegian Refugee Council has warned that internal refugees are finding it harder to survive as aid dwindles and their savings run out.
"Many families are now forced to live in precarious conditions, often resorting to risky or unsustainable solutions to cope, including reducing their health or heating expenses," it said on Thursday.
Popriadukhina said she had once been offered passage to Poland: "But I said I won't leave my country."
She is haunted by questions over the fate of her two sons.
One was being treated at a hospital in the besieged city of Mariupol when Russian forces swept in. The other enlisted in his son's footsteps, then went missing in 2023.
More than 70,000 Ukrainian soldiers and civilians remain missing in Vladimir Putin's war, Kyiv says, in addition to the tens of thousands of Ukrainian troops killed.
"Honestly, if I could, I would tear him apart with my own hands, that Putin," said Popriadukhina. "He brought suffering to so many people."
Sitting in her living room, she recalls a moment earlier in the war when she found a young man outside her home in Vremivka who had been killed by shrapnel. As a mother, it hit her particularly hard.
"Please tell me," she said. "How can you forgive this?" REUTERS

Sea Machines Robotics has announced that its STEAMRACER-class autonomous surface ship has advanced into the U.S. Navy’s final competitive evaluation phase under the Modular Attack Surface Combatant (MASC) programme.
In an update published on 18 February 2026, Sea Machines said it is positioned to provide a purpose-built autonomous vessel based on its existing autonomy technology, which it said has been developed and deployed over the past decade.
The company has invested more than $50 million in venture-backed capital since 2015 to develop and field a fully integrated autonomy stack, aimed at addressing what it described as one of the key technical challenges for unmanned surface vessels: reliable software and hardware integration at scale.
The STEAMRACER-class platform is designed to support fully unmanned maritime operations and is built around what it described as a hardened, AI-enabled remote command architecture. The company said the ship is intended to offer high speed, extended endurance, modular open-deck payload capacity and a secure onboard data environment to support distributed naval operations.
Sea Machines stated that while the vessel is designed for unmanned operations, it is also capable of operating in a limited manned configuration for short durations if required. The company said STEAMRACER is being developed through partnerships with multiple U.S. industrial firms, including St. Johns Ship Building, TOTE Services, Ring Power, Incat Crowther and EMI-W&O. It also said Sierra Nevada Corporation will provide its Maritime Advanced Secure Transmission (MAST) solution to support communications and cybersecurity requirements.
Sea Machines described the vessel as aligned with U.S. Navy efforts to expand unmanned surface vessel production and accelerate the fielding of maritime autonomous systems, stating that it is intended to provide what it called a “ready-now” solution.

Dummies’ guide to the main parties in local elections in March
Senay BoztasIf you muddle your VVD with your PVV, don’t be ashamed. Read the Dutch News 2026 dummies’ guide to the main political parties.
With local elections on March 18, political parties are waking up to the fact that thousands of people born outside the Netherlands have the right to vote.
Because the turnout is typically low in these local elections – just 50% last time – the international vote could be critical in areas with a large, mixed population.
Let’s say you have checked whether you have the right to vote in the local (and district) elections. The voting card has popped through your letterbox and you have stuck it carefully to the fridge. The next job is understanding what on earth is going on with Dutch local politics, when, every time you blink, a new party has been established.
Effort
If you come from a first-past-the-post system like the UK or the US, you should not feel embarrassed about how confusing you find Dutch proportional representation. When you have lived here for years, if you take an interest in politics, you will almost certainly know more than all of your Dutch friends.
“It requires a bit of extra effort,” says Verena Kitowski, a German who is standing for election for the Volt party in Amsterdam. “If people feel they are not informed and don’t feel the connection, it’s very easy [not to vote]. If you have always lived here, you have more peripheral knowledge.”
Floris Vermeulen, associate professor at the University of Amsterdam, specialising in the political participation of immigrants, believes that the Dutch should do more to explain the system to voters, regardless of where they were born.
“I think that it is the responsibility, partly of the political parties and of the system, to inform people properly: they have a right to vote, and that means the system has certain duties too,” he said. “But, on the other hand, they might be talking to a lot of people who feel that it is pretty complicated and they don’t know where to start. Every political system has its own complexities and political parties, and that means that you need to invest in it, read about it.”
Migrants unwelcome
The invitation for internationals to make sure their voices are represented in municipal politics – which has responsibilities for urban planning, youth care, infrastructure and local tax – is even more important when migration is a hot topic and foreigners are sometimes made the scapegoat for local problems.
“Migrants are interested in principle, but at the same time our interviews suggest they don’t feel so involved or welcome in Dutch politics,” said Vermeulen.
Local parties make up the largest share of votes, 31% in 2022. But Dutch News has summed up what the main parties standing nationally do (and don’t) stand for in local politics. In order of their national share of votes in 2022, the top 13 are:
VVD (People’s Party for Freedom and Democracy)
The centre-right party of former prime minister Mark Rutte is – says Daan Wijnants, VVD head in Amsterdam – comparable to the Conservatives in the UK. “We’re the party that wants the municipality to focus on basic affairs: building proper housing, especially [homes] that people can buy, reducing crime and lowering government taxes,” he said. “And we think it’s really important that the municipality aims to attract new industries and companies. We believe the international community is of great value, not only in an economic sense, but also in a cultural sense.”
CDA Christian Democratic Appeal
This centre-right party – which follows Christian democratic ideas but welcomes people with other religions or none – is one of the oldest in the Netherlands. It resembles the German CDU, the party of Ursula von der Leyen. It believes in facilitating business (including private landlords), with government promoting solidarity and setting norms like decency. “Where a socialist sees a problem and thinks, ‘how can the government solve it’, and a liberal thinks, ‘how can the market solve it’, the Christian Democrats say: how can society solve it?” said Rogier Havelaar, CDA councillor in Amsterdam. “I always call the CDA a moderately-progressive movement.” House building, clean streets, safety and good governance are key themes.
D66
The party of new prime minister Rob Jetten sits in the centre to centre-left of the spectrum and is similar to the British Liberal Democrats or US Democratic Party. It is liberal on economics and pro-Europe. “Amsterdam has grown because of immigration, and this is the DNA of the city,” said D66 Amsterdam councillor Erik Schmit. “We should not scapegoat internationals for the challenges we have in the city: we should welcome them, be open and integrate internationals into society.” The party promises to achieve housebuilding targets for all groups, is strong on education, women’s and sexual diversity rights, and promotes green cities.
GroenLinks
The green-left party was formed after a merger of left-wing parties including the Communist Party: it is a left-wing, progressive party that promotes green issues. Although it is campaigning separately in some cities, it is set to merge with the PvdA. “Houses are for living in, not to earn money,” is one of its mottos and it focuses on building affordable homes and promoting housing corporations. It advocates a so-called circular economy and “community wealth building”, wants to boost conditions for low-paid immigrant workers, and is vocal about scrapping the 30% tax break for highly-skilled migrants (although this is not a local power).
Partij van de Arbeid (PvdA)
The PvdA or labour party was established in 1946 in Amsterdam as a merger of three left-wing parties. It has traditionally played a strong role in local politics in areas such as the Dutch capital. “It’s a party that believes social security is important,” said Sofyan Mbarki, deputy mayor and head of the list in Amsterdam. “The government should play an important role in the core functions needed to keep a society running well, rather than leaving it to the market.” It aims to build affordable housing, share local wealth and ensure everyone participates. “My father was an international,” said Mbarki, whose parents emigrated from Morocco. “My father behaved differently, because he couldn’t participate in society as he had a different socio-economic position. Now internationals arrive who do have this [wealth] and who can participate.”
ChristenUnie and SGP
The ChristenUnie is a socially conservative and economically centre-left Christian party which follows “biblically inspired politics”. It opposes “bubbles, individualism and the pressure to perform”, focusing on protecting the weak and vulnerable. It won 3.9% of votes nationally in 2022 and is fielding candidates in 130 municipalities, although its performance has declined in recent years. The SGP is a hard-line, right-wing Christian party which does not allow women to stand for election nationally. It won 2.3% of the local vote in 2022, is standing in around 100 areas (sometimes on a shared ticket with the ChristenUnie) and promotes Biblical family values, solid financial policy and more independence from the EU.
SP
The SP or socialist party, another movement with its roots in Dutch communism, is standing in just over 100 municipalities. It won 2.79% of the local vote across the country in 2022 and does well in areas like North Brabant and Friesland. The SP has policies such as making public transport free, drastically reducing tourism, building affordable housing and “radically greening” municipalities. “We will encourage non-Dutch speakers (expats, labour migrants, and foreign family members) to learn Dutch as quickly and effectively as possible through municipal education programmes,” reads one of its policies in Amsterdam.
Partij voor de Dieren (PvdD)
The party for animals is a left-wing group promoting animal rights and green policies. It advocates better treatment for animals, a crackdown on polluting businesses and littering, policies to combat discrimination and better quality social housing. It opposes mass tourism and wants to replace hotels and offices with affordable homes.
DENK
This left-wing, pro-migrant party split from the labour party and particularly promotes the interests of people with an immigrant and Muslim background. The word, denk, reflects the Dutch word for “think” and the Turkish word for “equal” or “equivalent”. The party promotes inclusive policies, affordable housing, tackling racism and dialogue between different communities; you can see its programmes and candidates in the major cities here.
PVV
Geert Wilders’ far-right, anti-immigrant, anti-Islam Party for Freedom has a very low result in local elections because it often does not stand. It is taking part in 40 municipalities in 2026. “We will put the Dutch people number one everywhere because this is our country,” said Wilders in a tweet announcing the list in December.
Volt
Volt is a pro-European, liberal party created after Brexit and with 0.75% of the vote in local elections in 2022. It is vocally pro-international, and has already produced campaign material and an information evening in English. The party believes in affordable housing – especially for young people and students – safe streets and “liveable” cities. “We believe that good ideas know no boundaries,” according to its programme in Amsterdam. “What works in Copenhagen, Barcelona or Vienna in terms of affordable housing and safe streets, we want to apply in Amsterdam.”
BoerBuurBeweging (BBB)
The farmer citizen movement (BBB) promotes the interests of the agricultural community. It was created in 2019 and rose to prominence in provincial elections in 2023 at a time of farmer protests at proposals to cut pollution. It had roots in the CDA but moved to the right politically and is now considered a far-right party. It is standing in several areas, wants to reduce asylum and opposes efforts to regulate agencies employing labour migrants (who often work in agriculture).

Nasal spray vaccine could replace multiple jabs every year
- Scientists at Stanford Medicine have developed a universal vaccine formula, tested on mice, that offers broad protection against various respiratory threats.
- The vaccine, delivered as a nasal spray, could protect against cold, flu, Covid, allergies, respiratory viruses, sepsis-causing bacteria, and even house dust mites.
- It works by mimicking the signals immune cells use to communicate during an infection, rather than targeting specific parts of a pathogen.
- If developed for humans, this vaccine could replace multiple annual jabs for winter respiratory infections and potentially protect against new pandemic bugs.
- While lead author Dr Bali Pulendran estimates human availability within five to seven years, other experts caution that a truly universal vaccine is still some way off due to safety considerations and the diversity of the human population.

Venezuelan parliament approves amnesty law for prisoners

16:13:14 KST

Venezuela's National Assembly on Thursday unanimously approved a long-awaited amnesty law that could free hundreds of prisoners jailed for being government detractors.
But the law excludes those who have been prosecuted or convicted of promoting military action against the country — which could include opposition leaders like Nobel Peace Prize winner Maria Corina Machado, who has been accused by the ruling party of calling for international intervention like the one that ousted former president Nicolas Maduro.
The bill was signed by interim president Delcy Rodriguez, who pushed for the legislation under pressure from Washington, after she rose to power following Maduro's abduction during a US military raid on January 3.
"One must know how to ask for forgiveness and one must also know how to receive forgiveness," Rodriguez said at the Miraflores presidential palace in the capital Caracas, after signing the bill into law.
In one of the first releases after the bill passed, Machado ally and former National Assembly vice president Juan Pablo Guanipa announced his release from detention after about nine months in prison and under house arrest.
"After 10 months in hiding and almost nine months of unjust imprisonment, I confirm that I am now completely free," Guanipa wrote on social media, posting an image of him holding the country's flag.
He called for all other political prisoners to be freed and exiles allowed to return, criticising the law as not an amnesty but a "flawed document" that excludes some Venezuelans who remain behind bars.
"I thank all Venezuelans for fighting for my release and that of all political prisoners," he wrote.
The law is meant to apply retroactively to 1999 — including the coup against previous leader Hugo Chavez, the 2002 oil strike and the 2024 riots against Maduro's disputed reelection — giving hope to families that loved ones will finally come home.
Some fear, however, the law could be used by the government to pardon its own and selectively deny freedom to real prisoners of conscience.
Article 9 of the bill lists those excluded from amnesty as "persons who are being prosecuted or may be convicted for promoting, instigating, soliciting, invoking, favoring, facilitating, financing or participating in armed actions or the use of force against the people, sovereignty, and territorial integrity" of Venezuela "by foreign states, corporations or individuals."
Venezuela's National Assembly had delayed several sittings meant to pass the amnesty bill.
"The scope of the law must be restricted to victims of human rights violations and expressly exclude those accused of serious human rights violations and crimes against humanity, including state, paramilitary and non-state actors," UN human rights experts said in a statement from Geneva on Thursday.
Genuine will?
Hundreds, perhaps thousands, of Venezuelans have been jailed in recent years over plots, real or imagined, to overthrow the government of Rodriguez's predecessor and former boss Maduro, who was in the end abducted in the deadly US military raid.
Family members have reported torture, mistreatment and neglected health problems among the inmates.
The NGO Foro Penal says about 450 prisoners have been released since Maduro's ouster, but more than 600 others remain behind bars.
Family members have been clamouring for their release for weeks, holding vigils outside prisons.
One small group in the capital Caracas staged a nearly weeklong hunger strike, which ended on Thursday.
"The National Assembly has the opportunity to show whether there truly is a genuine will for national reconciliation," Foro Penal director Gonzalo Himiob wrote on Thursday on the US social media platform X ahead of the vote.
On Wednesday, the chief of the US military command responsible for strikes on alleged drug smuggling boats off South America held talks in Caracas with Rodriguez and top ministers Vladimir Padrino (defence) and Diosdado Cabello (interior).
All three were staunch Maduro backers who for years echoed his "anti-imperialist" rhetoric.
Rodriguez's interim government has been governing with US President Donald Trump's consent, provided she grants access to Venezuela's vast oil resources.

Hong Kong Observatory detects tremors felt by residents
Forecaster announced at 2.34pm that its seismic network picked up tremors after receiving over 100 reports from residents
The weather forecaster’s initial analysis indicated that the 4.0-magnitude earthquake occurred at 2.28pm in Guangdong’s Yangjiang, with the epicentre located about 260km (161.6 miles) west-southwest of Hong Kong.
The Observatory announced at 2.34pm that tremors had been detected by its seismic network.
“The epicentre is located near 21.75N, 111.77E, about 22km southwest of Yangjiang,” it said.
“The Observatory received over 100 locally felt reports of this earth tremor, the duration of which was a few seconds. Initial estimates gave a local intensity of [three] on the Modified Mercalli intensity scale, which is felt indoors. Vibrations like the passing of light trucks.”
Since the Observatory recorded locally felt tremors in 1905, a total of 176 of varying intensities have been registered.

India joins US-led initiative to build secure technology supply chains

India joined a U.S.-led initiative to strengthen technology cooperation among strategic allies in a move Friday that underscores the nations' warming ties after a brief strain over New Delhi’s unabated purchase of discounted Russian oil.
The decision aligns India closely with Washington’s efforts to build secure supply chains for semiconductors, advanced manufacturing and critical technologies at a time geopolitical competition with China is intensifying. It also signals a reset in relations following friction over energy trade and tariffs.
Nations that have joined the Pax Silica framework include Japan, South Korea, the U.K. and Israel.
"Pax Silica will be a group of nations that believe technology should empower free people and free markets. India’s entry into Pax Silica isn’t just symbolic. Its strategic, its essential,” U.S. Ambassador Sergio Gor said in a speech preceding the agreement signing.
Pax Silica is aimed at strengthening cooperation among partner countries on semiconductor design, fabrication, research and supply chain resilience. The initiative seeks to reduce dependence on China-dominated manufacturing hubs while promoting trusted production networks across democracies and strategic allies.
The development at the artificial intelligence summit in New Delhi comes weeks after India and the U.S. reached an interim trade framework to reduce tariffs and grant greater access to each other’s markets, easing tensions that had threatened to slow bilateral momentum.
President Donald Trump announced earlier this month that the U.S. would lower reciprocal import tariffs on India from 25% to 18% and also remove the additional 25% levy imposed earlier for buying Russian crude after Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi agreed to stop it.
India had ramped up Russian oil imports after Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine in 2022, drawing criticism from western partners even as New Delhi defended the purchases as necessary to manage inflation and protect its consumers.
India’s entry into Pax Silica, combined with trade concessions, marks a strategic convergence that extends beyond commerce into long-term technology and security cooperation, reinforcing India’s role as a key U.S. partner in the Indo-Pacific.
“From the trade deal to Pax Silica to defense cooperation, the potential for our two nations to work together is truly limitless,” Gor said.

Russian Woman, Who Allegedly Drunk-Texted FBI Agents, Pleads Guilty To Lying About FSB Ties

A Russian woman who was charged with lying to the FBI about her ties to Russia's main intelligence agency -- and then drunk-texted an FBI agent while out on bail -- has pleaded guilty.
Nomma Zarubina changed her plea on February 19, according to federal court filings, about two months after a judge revoked her bail for repeatedly messaging an FBI agent and ordered held in jail.
In addition to pleading guilty to the lying charge, she also admitted to a second charge related to her immigration status, court filings showed.
“Zarubina’s intentional concealment of her misconduct and her lies about her affiliation with Russian intelligence were an affront to law enforcement’s national-security efforts," the Justice Department said in a statement.
Her defense lawyer did not immediately return an e-mail seeking comment.
Zarubina was initially charged in December 2024 after being interviewed multiple times by FBI agents beginning in October 2020.
FBI Investigation
A native of the Siberian city of Tomsk, Zarubina moved to the United States in 2016 and built up a network of professional and personal connections among Russian emigre groups, as well as at American think tanks and activist organizations.
She was first approached by federal agents several weeks after the FBI searched the Manhattan apartment of another Russian woman, Elena Branson, and seized dozens of computers and other electronic devices.
Branson, who fled to Russia shortly after the raid, was later charged with being an unregistered foreign agent.
According to FBI affidavits, Zarubina allegedly lied about her communications with two officers from Russia's Federal Security Service (FSB) who had guided her networking, identifying people and organizations she was supposed to contact.
After being charged, Zarubina was released on bail.
However, in the months after, she allegedly sent scores of e-mails and photographs to FBI agents who had been interviewing her -- sometimes in the dead of the night.
Prosecutors, and her defense lawyer, told a federal court that Zarubina had a drinking problem, and she was ordered to seek mental health counseling.
In November 2025, a judge revoked her bail and ordered that she be sent to jail, pending trial.
Her sentencing is set for June.

Takaichi vows to make Japan ‘strong and prosperous’, rules out ‘reckless’ fiscal policy
The prime minister said Tokyo was facing ‘the most severe and complex security environment’ since World War II, citing China and Russia
“China is intensifying its attempts to unilaterally change the status quo by force or coercion in the East China Sea and the South China Sea, while also expanding and stepping up its military activities in the areas surrounding our country,” Takaichi told parliament in a policy address.
As a result, Takaichi said she will aim this year to revise Japan’s three major defence policy documents, as “changes in the security environment – such as the emergence of new ways of warfare and the need to prepare for prolonged conflicts – are accelerating across a wide range of fields”.
She added that she wanted to accelerate discussions on further loosening Japan’s self-imposed ban on the export of lethal weapons.
“This will contribute to strengthening the deterrence and response capabilities of our allies and like-minded partners, while also helping to reinforce Japan’s defence production base and its foundation of civilian technologies,” Takaichi said.

UK posts largest ever budget surplus of £30.4bn in January
Newsflash: The UK government has racked up a record-breaking budget surplus in January.
Britain’s public sector was £30.4bn in surplus last month, the Office for National Statistics reports, beating expectations of a surplus of around £24bn.
That’s double the surplus recorded in January – traditionally a strong month due to self-assessment tax bills – and is the highest surplus since monthly records began in 1993.
It’s a clear boost for the chancellor, RachelReeves, in the run-up to her spring statement next month,
ONS chief economist Grant Fitzner says:
“January – which is traditionally a strong month for self-assessed tax receipts – saw the highest surplus since monthly records began.
“Revenue was strongly up on the same time last year, while spending was little changed, due to lower debt interest payments largely offsetting higher costs on public services and benefits.
“Across the first ten months of the current financial year, borrowing is lower than the same period a year ago.”
The jump in tax receipts last month may show that UK government receipts are starting to get the boost from inflation and wage growth earlier in the year.
Nick Ridpath, research economist at the Institute for Fiscal Studies, says:
“Today’s data on the public finances is particularly important, given the outsized impact of January’s self-assessment returns on revenues and borrowing for the year as a whole.
Income tax receipts had been a little disappointing over 2025, lagging behind forecasts even as inflation and wage growth exceeded expectations. But today’s data shows that self-assessment revenues in January were almost £2 billion (6%) higher than forecast.
The government’s plan to run a current budget surplus from 2028-29 onwards is reliant on marked reductions in borrowing over the next few years – reductions that will be far easier to achieve if tax revenues continue to come in strongly.”
The surge in precious metals prices this year, and increased demand for sports supplements, both helped British retail sales last month.
The ONS reports:
Mail order retailers, which are predominantly online, experienced a boost from retailers selling sports supplements, as well as continued strong sales volumes by online jewellers. Comments from jewellers reported that demand had hit unprecedented levels.
The big reduction in public borrowing and surge in retail sales in January support other evidence that the economy started the year looking a lot healthier, says Paul Dales, chief UK economist at Capital Economics.
It will give the chancellor something positive to point to in her Fiscal Statement on 3rd March, he points out.
Dales also points out that fiscal drag helped to boost tax receipts, saying:
The freeze on income tax thresholds helped prompt a £29.4bn rise in self-assessment tax receipts, up £3.6bn from a year ago.
That said, January’s surplus was flattered by a £17.0bn surge in capital gains tax receipts in January this year as some taxpayers sought to benefit from lower CGT rates ahead of an anticipated CGT tax rise in the 2024 Budget. This is not a sustainable improvement. And the big picture is that borrowing has failed to come down much this year
Inheritance tax receipts have slightly risen this financial year.
Inheritance Tax receipts for April 2025 to January 2026 are £7.1bn, which is £100m more than the same period last year, HMRC data shows.
Under UK rules, the tax-free threshold for inheritance is £325,000, or £650,000 for a couple.
Isaac Stell, investment manager at Wealth Club, says the middle classes are increasingly facing death duties, saying:
“The government has made a pig’s ear of inheritance tax reform. Crackdowns on farmers and business owners proved unpopular and ultimately unworkable, forcing a partial retreat on relief thresholds. But years of frozen allowances, combined with new rules that will bring pensions into the scope of IHT, mean more ordinary families, not just the wealthy, are being pulled into the tax net.
At the same time, HMRC’s tougher enforcement is adding further pressure at what is already a difficult time for bereaved families. With the tax base widening and sharp ‘cliff edges’ in the relief system still in place, proactive planning and accurate reporting have never been more important.
Recent reporting also highlights growing public frustration that inheritance tax is increasingly affecting middle income households, particularly those whose main wealth is tied up in their home or retirement savings. Frozen thresholds, set against steadily rising asset values, mean many people who would not consider themselves wealthy are now facing significant tax bills.
Meanwhile, HMRC investigations are increasing. More than 14,000 bereaved families have been investigated for potentially underpaid inheritance tax since 2022–23, with the number of cases this year running well ahead of last year. These inquiries which are often prompted by data matching and valuation checks can last months or even years, and may result in additional tax, interest and penalties.
Taken together, rising asset values, static allowances and expanded reporting requirements are creating a situation where estates that previously fell outside the IHT net are now becoming liable, leaving many middle-class families caught off guard.
UK deficit on course to undershoot forecasts, in boost to Reeves
January’s blowout budget surplus may help the UK to undershoot borrowing forecasts this year!
With 10 months of the financial year behind us, the UK has run up a deficit of £112.1bn.
That’s £14.6bn less than at this stage a year ago, and £8.3bn less than the £120.4 billion forecast by the Office for Budget Responsibility..
MartinBeck, chief economist at WPIStrategy, says:
“Although January, traditionally a bumper month for self-assessment and capital gains tax, delivered a typical budget surplus, the £30.4bn excess of revenues over spending was much larger than the £24.1bn forecast by the OBR and a record high. That leaves year-to-date borrowing at £112.1bn, £8bn lower than the £120.4bn expected in November’s Budget forecast.
“With two months of the fiscal year remaining, the deficit is on course to undershoot the OBR’s full-year borrowing forecast of £138.3bn by around £10bn, a positive for a government trying to maintain fiscal credibility amidst recent political turbulence.
“Current borrowing, the measure relevant to one of the Chancellor’s key fiscal rules, also came in below expectations in the fiscal year to January, reaching £55.9bn against an OBR forecast of £59.3bn. The deadline for meeting the current budget rule may not be until 2029/30, but November’s headroom is now looking a little more robust than projected.
“Still, in absolute terms, borrowing on course to reach around £130bn this year is worrisome for an economy that both the OBR and the Bank of England judge to be close to full capacity. But it also reflects an uncomfortable reality: the private sector has been deleveraging for years and continues to prioritise saving over spending. The public sector deficit is not just a story about government choices, it is the mirror image of private-sector caution.
Chart: the largest UK monthly budget surplus on record
Looking back at this morning’s public finances, there was a significant jump in tax revenues from self-assessment taxpayers and from capital gains tax.
The ONS reports that the combined receipts from self-assessed Income and Capital Gains Tax receipts rose to £46.4bn in January, £10.5bn more than January 2025.
That’s the highest total for a January on record (not adjusted for inflation), helping the UK to post its biggest ever monthly budget surplus.
The latest retail sales figure are rather stronger than expected too!
British retail sales rose by 1.8% on a monthly basis in January, the ONS reports, smashing forecasts of a 0.2% rise. That’s the largest monthly rise since May 2024.
On an annual basis, retail sales volumes were 4.5% higher, again higher than forecast.
The ONS reports that growth in January 2026 was partly because of artwork and antiques sales, alongside continued strong sales from online jewellers.
However, over the last three months retail sales were only up by 0.1%, compared with the previous quarter (due to a fall of 0.4% in November).
Here’s ONS chief economist Grant Fitzner to explain:
“Retail sales rose slightly in the latest three months, as sales continued to pick up in the new year following a weak November.
“Motor fuel sales increased a little across the period, while sales of art works, tech retailers and furniture stores also performed well. These were partially offset by falls in supermarket sales.”

Introduction: Public finances and retail sales coming up...
Good morning. We’re about to get a new healthcheck on the British economy, with the latest public finances and retail sales data.
Economists predict that January was a bumper month for the public finances, as people rushed to pay self-assessment tax bills before the deadline at the end of the month.
The City expects January’s surplus could come in at a whopping £23.8bn, as the public sector received more in taxes and other income than it spent. That would be a record for any January – a welcome boost for the chancellor ahead of next month’s Spring economic forecasts.
Retail spending may have slowed in January, though. Economists predict monthly growth of just 0.2%, down from 0.4% in December, although the annual pace could pick up to 2.8% from 2.5%.

Trump climate health rollback likely to hit poor, minority areas hardest, experts say
The Trump administration’s revocation of a scientific finding that climate change is a danger to public health is likely to affect communities of color the most
- Bookmark
In a stretch of Louisiana with about 170 fossil fuel and petrochemical plants, premature death is a fact of life for people living nearby. The air is so polluted and the cancer rates so high it is known as Cancer Alley.
“Most adults in the area are attending two to three funerals per month,” said Gary C. Watson Jr., who was born and raised in St. John the Baptist Parish, a majority Black community in Cancer Alley about 30 miles outside of New Orleans. His father survived cancer, but in recent years, at least five relatives have died from it.
Cancer Alley is one of many patches of America — mostly minority and poor — that suffer higher levels of air pollution from fossil fuel facilities that emit tiny particles connected to higher death rates. When the federal government in 2009 targeted carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases as a public health danger because of climate change, it led to tighter regulation of pollution and cleaner air in some communities. But this month, the Trump administration's Environmental Protection Agency overturned that “endangerment finding.”
Public health experts say the change will likely mean more illness and death for Americans, with communities like Watson's hit hardest. On Wednesday, a coalition of health and environmental groups sued the EPA over the revocation, calling it unlawful and harmful.
“Not having these protections, it’s only going to make things worse,” said Watson, with the environmental justice group Rise St. James Louisiana. He also worries that revoking the endangerment finding will increase emissions that will worsen the state's hurricanes.
The Trump administration said the finding — a cornerstone for many regulations aimed at fighting climate change — hurts industry and the economy. President Donald Trump has called the idea “a scam” despite repeated studies showing the opposite.
Growing evidence shows that poor and Black, Latino and other racial and ethnic groups are typically more vulnerable than white people to pollution and climate-driven floods, hurricanes, extreme heat and more because they tend to have less resources to protect against and recover from them. The EPA, in a 2021 report no longer on its website, concluded the same.
The finding's reversal will affect everyone, but “overburdened communities, which are typically communities of color, Indigenous communities and low-income communities, they will, again, suffer most from these actions,” said Matthew Tejada, senior vice president for environmental health at the Natural Resources Defense Council and a former deputy with the EPA's office for environmental justice.
Hilda Berganza, climate program manager with the Hispanic Access Foundation, said: “Communities that are the front lines are going to feel it the most. And we can see that the Latino population is one of those communities that is going feel it even more than others because of where we live, where we work.”
Research shows the unequal harms of pollution, climate change
A study published in November found more than 46 million people in the U.S. live within a mile of at least one type of energy supply infrastructure, such as an oil well, a power plant or an oil refinery. But the study found that “persistently marginalized” racial and ethnic groups were more likely to live near multiple such sites. Latinos had the highest exposure.
The EPA, in that 2021 report, estimated that with a 2-degree Celsius (3.6 Fahrenheit) rise in global warming, Black people were 40% more likely to live in places with the highest projected rise in deaths because of extreme heat. Latinos, who are overrepresented in outdoor industries such as agriculture and construction, were 43% more likely to live where labor hour losses were expected to be the highest because of heat.
Julia Silver, a senior research analyst at the University of California, Los Angeles' Latino Policy and Politics Institute, found in her own research that California Latino communities had 23 more days of extreme heat annually than non-Latino white neighborhoods. Her team also found those areas have poor air quality at about double the rate, with twice as many asthma-related emergency room visits. Other research shows that Latino children are 40% more likely to die from asthma than white children in part because many lack consistent health care access.
“What we’re risking with a rollback like this at the federal level is really human health and well-being in these marginalized groups,” Silver said.
Experts say the disparate impacts will be significant
Armando Carpio, a longtime pastor in Los Angeles, has seen firsthand how vulnerable his mostly Latino parishioners are. Many are construction workers and gardeners who work outside, often in extreme heat. Others live and work near polluting freeways. He sees children with asthma and elders with dementia, both linked to exposure to air pollution.
“We’re regressing,” he said. “I don't know how many years back, but all of this really affects us.”
It is difficult to quantify how much more communities of color could be impacted by the finding’s revocation, but experts who spoke with The Associated Press all said it would be significant.
“You will see statistically significant increases in excess morbidity and mortality when it comes to climate impacts and health impacts associated with co-pollutants” in communities of color, said Sacoby Wilson, a University of Maryland professor and executive director of the nonprofit Center for Engagement, Environmental Justice and Health INpowering Communities.
Beverly Wright, founding director of the Deep South Center for Environmental Justice in New Orleans, said at least four Black communities in Cancer Alley no longer exist because of the expansion of industrial facilities. The repeal will bring more pollution, higher cancer rates, more extreme weather and the disappearance of more historic communities, she said.
“It has us going in the wrong direction, and our communities are now at greater risk,” she said.

Haredi parties accuse Knesset foreign affairs committee legal adviser of stalling draft bill

Senior officials in Israel’s ultra-Orthodox parties have accused Miri Frenkel-Shor, the legal adviser to the Knesset Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee, of blocking progress on the long-delayed conscription bill, Maariv reported on Friday.
The criticism came amid continued delays in advancing legislation meant to regulate the enlistment of haredi men, with ultra-Orthodox sources claiming the holdup stems from Frenkel-Shor’s demands rather than coalition politics.
According to senior haredi party figures quoted by Maariv, some of Frenkel-Shor’s conditions are not purely legal in nature but reflect “an ideological approach.” They pointed to her reported insistence on maintaining ongoing sanctions for individuals who do not enlist, even if the haredi public meets the law’s recruitment targets.
“Frenkel-Shor’s demands in the closed-door talks are tougher than the demands Yuli Edelstein presented. The sense is that Frenkel-Shor simply does not want this law to pass, and there is nothing legal about it,” a senior official in the ultra-Orthodox parties said.
Haredi Knesset members say she has 'forgotten her role'
“We did not want to pass a law ‘over the head’ of the Knesset’s legal counsel, but it is on the table. If the Knesset’s legal counsel decides to start acting politically, like the Attorney-General’s office, we will have to start treating the two bodies the same way,” another source added.
Another official argued that the committee’s legal adviser should provide only constitutional and legal guidance, not substitute for lawmakers’ discretion. The official cited as an example the reported view that sanctions should remain on Torah students who do not enlist even when targets are met, describing that rationale as “ethical” rather than “legal.”
“Value judgments are for the Knesset, not for a committee legal adviser, however important she may be, who has simply forgotten her role.”

Jewish Illinois rep. withdraws endorsement for congressional candidate over AIPAC ties
Unknown

07:02:50 UTC
16:02:50 KST

Rep. Jan Schakowsky withdrew her endorsement of a congressional candidate in a neighboring Illinois district on Thursday, citing the AIPAC pro-Israel lobby as a reason.
Schakowsky endorsed Donna Miller, the Cook County commissioner, in the 2nd Congressional District last month. Now, she said, she cannot let her endorsement stand.
“Illinois deserves leaders who put voters first, not AIPAC or out-of-state Trump donors,” said Schakowsky, who herself was an AIPAC stalwart early in her tenure. “I cannot support any candidate running for Congress who is funded by these outside interests.”
Schakowsky’s comments reflected the increasing toxicity of AIPAC’s brand in Democratic politics - and an acknowledgment that the pro-Israel group is in fact playing a role in the district ahead of next month’s primary election.
Like two other candidates in different Illinois races, Miller has received contributions from a number of AIPAC-affiliated donors. She has also gotten boosts from ads paid for by brand-new local groups that have been accused of being AIPAC shell organizations.
But AIPAC has not endorsed her, and it has not put its name, or that of its affiliated super PAC, United Democracy Project, on any of the ads.
The dustup comes as AIPAC prepares to hold a major convening behind closed doors.
Back in early 2020, nearly 20,000 people attended AIPAC’s policy conference in Washington, DC. When the group resumed in-person gatherings post-pandemic in 2023, it stuck with much smaller, closed-door affairs.
This week, after several years in which the lobby grew increasingly radioactive, fueled by backlash against the war in Gaza, the only public sign of its conference came from acknowledgement in Israeli media that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu had canceled his plans to attend in person.
An AIPAC source confirmed late Thursday that a conference was taking place Sunday to Tuesday and said it would feature US politicians from both parties as well as Israeli officials, including Netanyahu and opposition leader Yair Lapid, by video. The gathering would focus on “the evolving threats facing Israel; the negotiations with Iran; solidarity with the Iranian people seeking freedom from a brutal regime; continued US security assistance; and expanding joint defense cooperation,” according to the source, who said the conference was meant “to further accelerate the community’s political efforts this election cycle.”
Even before that cycle got underway, AIPAC was looming large. Having targeted progressive politicians like “Squad” members Jamaal Bowman and Cori Bush in 2024, AIPAC drew the ire of many on the left. And its public image has become increasingly scrutinized as it has supported unconditional military aid to Israel throughout its war in Gaza.
This month’s primary in New Jersey’s 11th Congressional District was a coming-out party for AIPAC’s current strategy. There, it spent more than $2 million to attack a progressive Democrat, Tom Malinowski, who had joined dozens of his colleagues in saying he would support conditions on military aid to Israel under certain circumstances. An anti-Israel progressive prevailed.
Now, the group has shifted its energies to Illinois, one of the next states to hold primaries, scheduled for March 17.
The United Democracy Project has so far spent more than $750,000 in support of Chicago City Treasurer Melissa Conyears-Ervin in the 7th Congressional District, according to its federal filings.
Conyears-Ervin, a former state representative, is up against a crowded field that includes state Rep. La Shawn Ford, who said he turned down support from UDP because he would not support unconditional military aid to Israel; Jason Friedman, a longtime Jewish federation leader and real estate developer; and Kina Collins, who protested for a ceasefire in Gaza in November 2023 with anti-Zionist groups Jewish Voice for Peace and IfNotNow.
In three other races, the group has been accused of covertly backing candidates. Former Rep. Melissa Bean, state Sen. Laura Fine and Miller have not been formally endorsed by AIPAC, but have all received contributions from a number of donors who have also given to AIPAC. Fine raised $1.2 million last quarter - $1 million of which came from donors who’ve given to AIPAC-affiliated groups, according to the Washington Post, mostly from outside Illinois. Bean and Miller have reported more than $400,000 and $875,000 in donations from AIPAC donors, respectively.
They’ve also gotten boosts from ads paid for by Elect Chicago Women and Affordable Chicago Now, a pair of new organizations that have been accused of being AIPAC shell organizations. Like the Malinowski attack ads and others from the UDP playbook, the ads did not mention Israel.
The Democratic Majority for Israel PAC, another pro-Israel advocacy group, jumped in on Thursday, endorsing both Bean and Miller.
Fine’s opponents include Kat Abughazaleh, a progressive 26-year-old Palestinian-American who has called for an end to US weapons sales to Israel and accuses Israel of committing genocide; and Daniel Biss, the Jewish mayor of Evanston who is the grandson of Holocaust survivors and supports the Block the Bombs Act that would limit some weapons from being sold to Israel.
One of Bean’s opponents in the 8th district, Junaid Ahmed, spoke against AIPAC at a joint press conference with Biss, plus candidates from the two other races where AIPAC is thought to have been spending. Ahmed’s platform includes ending all military aid to Israel and a right of return for Palestinians.
Schakowsky used to be AIPAC devotee
First elected in 1998, Schakowsky, who is Jewish, was once an AIPAC acolyte herself. Back in 2010, facing a challenger from the right who made Israel an issue in their campaign, she boasted of having a 100% record of voting with AIPAC; the lobby, meanwhile, said that it did not endorse candidates but noted that Schakowsky “has an excellent record on issues important to the pro-Israel community.” Over time, though, she emerged as a senior leader among the pro-Israel progressives, becoming a headliner at conferences of the liberal pro-Israel lobby J Street and protesting against Israeli government actions. She announced last year that she would not run again.
Responding to Schakowsky’s endorsement reversal, Miller did not mention AIPAC. Noting that she and Schakowsky had been friends for decades, she said her campaign would continue to focus on affordability issues.
Schakowsky added that she would continue to endorse Biss, who’s been outspoken against AIPAC amid reports of its involvement in Illinois’ congressional races, to replace her.
Biss responded enthusiastically on Thursday. “Proud to be endorsed by @RepSchakowsky,” he tweeted, “and proud to NOT be endorsed by AIPAC and MAGA donors.”

Why Israel is choosing calm over panic as Trump amasses forces for war with Iran

The departure hall at Ben-Gurion Airport on Thursday morning looked unremarkable.
No frantic lines. No families dragging suitcases toward self-imposed exile. Flights were arriving from Bucharest, New Delhi, and Naples, and departing for Athens, Krasnodar (Russia), and Berlin. Coffee stands were busy. Security lines moved at their usual pace.
Likewise, at supermarkets. No run on canned goods, bottled water, or toilet paper. No noticeable hoarding of batteries or baby formula.
What there was, instead, were conversations – the same conversations that have been held for weeks.
“When will [US President Donald] Trump attack?” - “Is it going to be this weekend?” - “Should we postpone our trip?”
On President Isaac Herzog’s recent visit to Australia, the two questions journalists most frequently asked him were whether he would pardon Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, and whether the delegation would be able to fly back to Israel or might it be stuck abroad because of an American strike on Iran.
Regarding the former, Herzog said the pardon process was following accepted procedure. As to the latter, he said he had no inside information about Trump’s war plans.
The Israeli reaction to the potential escalation
Israel is watching closely, assessing carefully, questioning – as the journalists did of Herzog – whether to adjust schedules and change plans.
But it is not panicking, and that distinction matters.
On paper, this moment is highly combustible. The latest round of US-Iran talks in Geneva this week ended inconclusively, with Tehran promising to return in two weeks with more detailed proposals.
At the same time, Trump has assembled what he once described as a “massive armada” – two aircraft carrier strike groups, dozens of destroyers and cruisers, submarines, refueling tankers, more than 50 additional fighter jets in recent days alone, and layered missile-defense systems deployed across allied bases in the region.
The USS Gerald R. Ford, fresh from operations in the Caribbean, is making its way toward the Mediterranean to join the USS Abraham Lincoln. American B-2 bombers and other long-range aircraft are on heightened alert. Patriot and THAAD batteries have been repositioned. The IDF is on high readiness.
If one were sketching a prelude to war, this outline would fit the bill: overwhelming force put into position, making numerous options available.
And yet, in Israel – which the ayatollahs have promised would come under attack in such a war – there was no run on the banks, no hoarding of canned corn, no scramble for the exit doors.
Concern, yes; hysteria, no – though concern did edge upward somewhat this week.
Former Military Intelligence chief Amos Yadlin contributed to that uptick, saying in a television interview that people “should think twice” about traveling abroad this weekend. He outlined the variables he is watching: whether Washington extends negotiations; the position of the USS Gerald R. Ford; whether street protests resume inside Iran; and even the weather, to see if conditions are conducive to sustained air operations.
For a day or so, Yadlin’s comment nudged the anxiety level upward. His remark made online headlines and set WhatsApp groups buzzing.
The comment did not trigger panic. But it did frame the week’s developments as more immediate – and that framing was reinforced by the defense establishment.
Israeli officials stress calm, say country is prepared
Defense assessments reported on KAN underscored the seriousness of the moment: if Washington decides to strike, Israel would likely receive advance warning – though the public would not be informed, in order to prevent leaks that could jeopardize operational success. Quiet preparations would follow, similar to those conducted ahead of last June’s campaign against Iran’s nuclear infrastructure.
This is the language of preparedness. At the same time, the IDF moved to steady the atmosphere.
IDF Spokesman Brig.-Gen. Effie Defrin said on Thursday the military is at “maximum defensive readiness.” If attacked, he said, Israel will respond with force. But there has been no change in the overall situational assessment.
“There is no reason for unnecessary panic,” he stressed.
That combination – serious preparation and controlled messaging – is shaping the mood. Israelis believe two things at once: escalation is possible, and the system is prepared.
There is another reason the public reaction remains measured, and it has less to do with US aircraft carriers and IDF preparedness, and more to do with memory.
This is no longer theoretical.
Last June’s 12-day campaign against Iran’s nuclear and military infrastructure was unprecedented. It was not shadow or proxy warfare; it was overt. Iran retaliated directly with large-scale missile and drone fire. Israel’s airspace closed temporarily. Iran’s missiles sent millions scurrying to safe rooms.
And then daily life resumed.
The aftermath of the 12-day-war
Iran’s nuclear program was significantly damaged during that war, though current negotiations over that same program in Geneva belie Trump’s claim afterward that the program was “obliterated.”
Israel’s air force and air defense systems performed exceptionally well. Iran was exposed, after years of bombastic threats, as largely a paper tiger – capable of inflicting harm through ballistic missiles, but nowhere near as powerful as it had long boasted.
Lived experience tempers abstract fear. The experience Israelis have had with Iranian attacks over the last two years is rendering this current period one of unease, but not of panic.
Israelis have heard Iranian threats before, seen them acted upon – and lived to tell the tale. They appear to trust that if escalation comes, the army is ready, warning systems will function, and disruption – while serious – will be temporary.
Much has been said about how, in the eight months since the 12-day war in June, the Iranians have continued to manufacture and rebuild ballistic missile capabilities. Yet at the same time, as Brig.-Gen. (res) Ran Kochav, a former IDF spokesman and head of the Air Defense Command, said in a television interview this week, Israel has not been sitting on its hands.
Rather, he said, Israel Aerospace Industries is working 24/7 producing Arrow 3 and Arrow 2 systems. “We also learned, investigated, improved, deployed, and have received assistance,” he stressed.
Israel has learned many lessons from that war, Kochav said. The lack of public panic now suggests the public believes that as well.
The current potential for escalation with Iran
The burning question now is not “Can this happen?” – because it has happened before – but whether it will happen, and when.
To answer that, it is worth looking at the buildup of American forces, and recalling that a few months ago a similar – though smaller – buildup took place in the Caribbean. This is not the first time Trump has assembled overwhelming force offshore.
Last month’s Operation Absolute Resolve in Venezuela began with the deployment of the USS Gerald R. Ford carrier strike group, guided-missile destroyers, thousands of troops and advanced aircraft. The buildup escalated over months – maritime interdictions, strikes on regime-linked targets, financial pressure – before culminating in a swift raid that captured Nicolás Maduro.
That deployment was significant. The current one is larger.
Venezuela was a short-range regime-capture mission. The weaponry arrayed now in the Mediterranean is sufficient for a prolonged operation.
What stands out is the pattern: when force of this magnitude is assembled, it is meant to be usable. Or, as Sen. Lindsey Graham, who visited Israel this week, told Sky News Arabic: “All these ships aren’t coming here just because the weather is nice this time of year.”
It is this awareness that fuels attentiveness among Israelis, though not hysteria.
The slow progress of US-Iran talks
Diplomacy, meanwhile, limps forward. Iranian officials speak of progress and “guiding principles.” American officials emphasize that Tehran has not acknowledged key redlines, particularly the demand for a halt to all uranium enrichment. Iran signals willingness to move stockpiles or pause enrichment temporarily, but resists abandoning the capability altogether. Washington signals skepticism.
Between those positions lies a chasm.
Some Israeli analysts ask whether Trump is waiting for a political catalyst – renewed unrest inside Iran, perhaps – to provide added justification for a strike. In January, he publicly linked potential military action to Tehran’s crackdown on protesters.
For now, however, the streets of Tehran are not ablaze. So the armada waits, functioning as leverage – visible, credible, deliberate. It also creates expectations. Once force of this magnitude is assembled, backing down without substantial concessions becomes harder.
For Israel, one significant element of this moment is not the hardware in the Mediterranean but the capital of trust in the IDF at home. After the colossal failure of October 7, that is no given.
When the IDF says there is no change in public instructions, the public listens. When it says preparations are under way quietly, Israelis assume that is so and carry on with life as usual.
Israelis are not dismissing Iran’s threats. Officials have repeatedly emphasized that even if Israel is not directly involved in a US strike, Tehran would likely respond by firing toward Israel.
Yet the public hears those assessments and continues with its routine. And that may be the most revealing signal of all.
The Mediterranean bristles with destroyers and carriers. Geneva hums with diplomacy. Tehran issues threats. Washington issues warnings.
In Israel, flights regularly depart and arrive. Supermarkets remain stocked. The country prepares for escalation and proceeds as usual. The risks are real. But so is the memory of having faced Iran before – and endured.

Eric Dane, 'Grey's Anatomy' and 'Euphoria' star, dies at 53
February 20, 2026Eric Dane, the actor known best for his roles on "Grey's Anatomy" and "Euphoria," died Thursday after battling amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS).
He was 53.
Dane announced his diagnosis last year in April and had become an advocate for ALS awareness before his death.
"He spent his final days surrounded by dear friends, his devoted wife, and his two beautiful daughters, Billie and Georgia, who were the center of his world," his representatives said in a statement.
"Throughout his journey with ALS, Eric became a passionate advocate for awareness and research, determined to make a difference for others facing the same fight," it said.
"He will be deeply missed, and lovingly remembered always. Eric adored his fans and is forever grateful for the outpouring of love and support he's received." it added.
What is ALS?
ALS, also known as Lou Gehrig's disease, is an incurable condition that affects nerve cells in the brain and spinal cord.
It interferes with a person's ability to walk, talk and eventually breathe without assistance. Most patients die within three to five years of diagnosis.
Dane was a passionate advocate for ALS research and funding, having traveled to Washington, DC, last year to meet with lawmakers.
Eric Dane's breakout role on Grey's Anatomy
Dane rose to fame in the mid-2000s as the handsome Dr. Mark Sloan on ABC's medical soap opera "Grey's Anatomy."
Nicknamed "McSteamy," Dane portrayed Sloan as the head of plastic surgery at the fictional hospital that forms the setting for the show.
That hospital was later renamed after his character, who died from injuries sustained in a plane crash in season 9 (2012) of the show. Dane reprised his role in 2021.
The show remains one of the longest-running scripted American television series and rolled out season 22 late last year.
In 2019, Dane also garnered global attention for his role as Cal Jacobs, a troubled father, on HBO's drama series "Euphoria." He is listed as set to appear in the show's long-awaited final season this year.
What to know about Eric Dane's personal life
Born in 1972, Dane was raised in Northern California. His father was a navy veteran and architect who died of a gunshot wound when Dane was just 7 years old.
He moved to Los Angeles after high school where he scored his debut role in a show called "Saved by the Bell." He later landed several smaller roles movies like "Bad Boys: Ride or Die,"'Marley & Me," and "X-Men: The Last Stand."
Dane's memoir is slated to be published in late 2026.
"I want to capture the moments that shaped me — the beautiful days, the hard ones, the ones I never took for granted — so that if nothing else, people who read it will remember what it means to live with heart," Dane previously said in a statement about his book.
"If sharing this helps someone find meaning in their own days, then my story is worth telling."

MOSCOW, February 20. /TASS/. Russia’s Uralvagonzavod Group, part of the state tech corporation Rostec, has delivered a batch of modernized BREM-80 armored maintenance and recovery vehicles to the troops, the state corporation's press service reported.
"On the eve of Defender of the Fatherland Day, Uralvagonzavod Group, part of the Rostec State Corporation, handed over a batch of BREM-80 armored maintenance and recovery vehicles to the Russian Defense Ministry. They have been upgraded based the special military operation experience," the ministry reported.
It added that the BREM-80 vehicle is based on the T-80 tank chassis and is equipped with a powerful gas turbine engine, providing it with high mobility.
"The vehicle’s key upgrade is increased crew protection. A key design feature is the mechanized coupling. This device allows the crew to evacuate damaged equipment without leaving the vehicle. The vehicle’s special equipment also includes hydraulic winches and a bulldozer-type coulter for clearing debris and securing the vehicle during operation. The manufacturer has now mastered serial production of the BREM-80," Rostec representatives said.
They noted that the vehicle can tow not only Russian or Soviet tanks, but also heavier Western tanks. During the international Rembat 2018 competition, the BREM-80 set a record, demonstrating its ability to evacuate six coupled T-80 tanks, weighing over 270 tons. "T-80-based maintenance and recovery vehicles can operate in any conditions and are also suitable for Arctic latitudes. The BREM-80, thanks to its gas turbine engine, can quickly start and begin operations even in the most extreme cold," the Uralvagonzavod press service added.

Crude oil has climbed more than $4 per barrel this week after the Iranian naval forces held two different drill in reaction to the US Navy military buildup.
20% of the 100 million barrels used globally each day passes through the narrow Strait of Hormuz that borders Iran. The IRGS Navy even blocked the strategic waterway for few hours during the drill on Wednesday.
Analysts predict that any military conflict will not be limited but it will last long, sending the oil prices as high as $120 bpd.
Iran and the Russian Federation held a joint naval drill which wrapped up yesterday in northern Indian Ocean and the Sea of Oman.

Charities fear millions in Ramadan giving will not reach crisis zones as UK Muslim groups ‘debanked’

Buckets passed around mosques, fundraisers shared on WhatsApp groups and televised appeals will raise hundreds of millions of pounds for charity over the coming weeks of Ramadan.
Much of the £2bn raised by British Muslims each year comes when giving surges during the holy month, but the full potential of that support – especially at a time of US, British and European government aid cuts – is being limited by challenges charities say they face in sending money abroad.
According to a 2025 report on “debanking” by the UK-based coalition, Muslim Charities Forum (MCF), more than two-thirds of Muslim charities face problems opening bank accounts and 42% have been had their banking services completely withdrawn, compared with 12% of charities generally.
Most of the charities also reported that aid payments to humanitarian projects had been delayed because of banking issues.
The issues stem from “derisking” – policies that banks employ to avoid the risk of falling short of regulations designed to prevent money laundering or terrorism financing. As legislation has tightened, banks have become so averse to risk that some will, directly or tacitly, avoid dealing with countries where there is conflict or disaster.
The MCF chief executive, Fadi Itani, said the humanitarian crisis in Sudan was an example of where charities struggled to get banks to send on the money to the countries in need.
“These obstacles disrupt essential charitable operations and undermine the delivery of life-saving humanitarian assistance,” he said.
“As part of wider derisking strategies, banks are becoming increasingly reluctant to serve charities – particularly those operating in perceived high-risk jurisdictions such as Sudan – leaving many organisations effectively excluded from the financial system,” said Itani.
According to MCF, Muslim charities are disproportionately falling foul of these banking policies. Organisations have had to wait up to three years to open a bank account; many have had accounts suddenly closed without explanation or appeal or have faced rigorous questioning about aid payments, particularly going to Palestine, Syria or Pakistan.
Muslims donate four times more than the average adult in Britain, according to a report by the thinktank Equi published in December. Much of this during the month of Ramadan, when they believe rewards for giving are multiplied.
Many use the month to make their annual zakat payment – a contribution of 2.5% of surplus wealth that must be used to support the poor.
While zakat is increasingly being used to help people in poverty in the UK, much of the money is also directed to the destitute in crisis zones.
One charity surveyed by MCF said simply using “Syrian refugees” as a reference led to transactions being frozen to an aid project supporting Syrian children receiving cancer treatment in Turkey.
In other cases, organisations were refused services after background checks used unverified articles as evidence of terrorism links, especially after the 9/11 attacks in 2001.
“Almost all the Muslim-led charities I have spoken to would not even try to obtain the special licence required to work in sanctioned states such as Afghanistan, despite often being areas most in need,” said Dr Samantha May, a senior lecturer at the University of Aberdeen.
“They would expect the licence not to be granted or that just applying for the licence could raise ‘red flags’ and create banking issues associated with derisking.”
May said these policies were not by design targeted at Muslim-led charities, but in reality they were often working in fragile states.
These problems can have an effect when donors become concerned about delays on projects to which they have contributed. Mosques are frequently wary, tending to stick with causes they know.
The administrator of one east London mosque, who did not want to be named, said they were very careful about the charities they supported, selecting four to support during Ramadan or at Friday prayers so they were able to directly monitor how the money was used.
They added that partners they had worked with had encountered problems because of the extra scrutiny they felt Muslim campaigns faced.
Razib Hasan, finance director at Muslim Aid, one of the largest Islamic charities in the UK, said one solution would be to adopt legislation already enforced in France and Belgium, which makes having a bank account a legal right.
Itani also believes this would mean charities having to spend less time and resources on administrative battles and more on humanitarian work.
“Muslim-led charities must be able to operate without undue hindrance. Only then can their capacity to support vulnerable communities – in the UK and globally – reach its full potential,” said Itani.
A spokesperson for the Financial Conduct Authority said it was aware of the problems faced. “We know that some charities face real difficulties opening and keeping bank accounts,” they said. “We’ve been clear in our expectations on banks for how they should handle charity accounts.”
The FCA said it expected banks to enforce policies to react proportionately to the risks posed by financial crimes and not apply a generic approach to all charities, adding that it had issued guidelines to that effect in 2024.

Winning tip: cycle the greenways of Annecy
Saint-Jorioz in Haute-Savoie will provide a springtime lift for your spirits. On the shore of Lake Annecy, it’s a short bus ride from the city of Annecy, but less busy and with superior lake and mountain views. Hike to the surrounding peaks, towards the lesser-known Col de l’Arpettaz, or cycle on the excellent greenways. Relax by the cool blue alpine water. Behind you lies the underrated Les Bauges Unesco Geopark. The department only joined France in 1860, and has its own Italian-influenced regional cuisine.

Naples is best in early spring
Although not the most traditionally beautiful city in Italy, Naples offers a glimpse of warmth in early spring. A world apart from Florence or Turin, Naples is a fascinating, lived-in city with a long history and a rich culinary tradition. The Spaccanapoli, which runs right through the core of the city, is a bustling place to walk along and experience Neapolitan life. The world-class sites of Pompeii and Herculaneum are nearby, as are Mount Vesuvius, Sorrento and the wonderful islands of Capri, Ischia and Procida. You can get to Naples by train from London via Paris and Turin or Milan in about 15 hours.

Take the ferry to Corsica
Eurostar from London via an easy connection at Lille or a change in Paris takes between six and eight hours to arrive in Marseille. After a shower at the station, refresh in Vieux Port before arriving for breakfast in Bastia, Corsica, via a comfortable night-ferry. From Bastia, catch the scenic mountain railway into this remarkably unspoiled island to explore its wild interior and coastal regions. Mid to late spring is best for southern Europe, when snow-melt replenishes streams and waterfalls that dry up in summer. The weather is sunny yet exceedingly pleasant, hillsides blanketed with wildflowers, wild animals nurturing their young and locals refreshed in mood.

Germany’s greenest, sunniest city
Take the Eurostar to Paris and continue east via Strasbourg by high-speed train through the rolling hills and vineyards of Alsace to Freiburg – Germany’s warmest, sunniest and greenest city. (Some routes go via Brussels and Cologne.) Feast on Swabian classics such as käsespätzle (cheesy egg noodles with caramelised onion), enjoy tacos at YepaYepa or drop into Hausbrauerei Feierling’s lively beer garden for a drink. From Freiburg, explore the Black Forest’s highlights, from Triberg’s cuckoo clocks and waterfalls to the treetop walk in Bad Wildbad. Opt to stay at a participating town and you’ll receive a Konus guest card, giving you free transport around the region for your entire stay.

Tiny beaches near Nice
I’ve spent many happy spring breaks in Villefranche-sur-Mer, just a few miles east of Nice. The charm of its historic heart, the beauty of its deepwater bay, the proximity to spectacular coast and mountains, plus excellent cafes and restaurants make it hard to beat. Take the TGV to Nice, then it’s just a few minutes on the local train (easy for day trips to Cannes and Menton, too). It should be warm enough for a dip at the tiny, secluded Plage de la Darse, or Plage de la Fosse on swanky Cap Ferrat ...

Lemons and light on the Côte d’Azur
My sister and I spent a beautiful sunny few days in Menton on the Côte d’Azur in early April. We spent our time meandering the cobbled streets with their pastel-coloured buildings, eating a mix of French and Italian meals (it’s the last French town before the Italian border) and paddling in the calm blue bay. We trekked in the hills north of the town, past stunning houses, pine trees and spring flowers to explore Maison Gannac, a citrus farm that grows the Menton lemon, which is renowned for its flavour and aroma.

A boat trip along the Moselle in Germany
The Moselle valley in April was stunning. Starting in the old Roman city of Trier, with its amazing Porta Nigra gate, we followed the river 30 miles north-west to enjoy the panoramic views from Burg Landshut. We took boat trips, including to Cochem, to take the chairlift opposite the castle up to the Pinnerkreuz viewpoint. Early April means wildflower-strewn meadows and fewer visitors. Castles, boats and cable cars kept the children entertained; the fresh Moselle valley rieslings kept the adults happy. We finished our trip in Koblenz, with its selection of traditional breweries where späzle and schnitzel pair well with any beer.
Kirsten Lowery
Coastal paths near Perpignan
Go south by train and resist the rush. Take the Eurostar to Paris, then a fast TGV to Perpignan in six hours, before a final 25-minute local train to Port-Vendres – about nine hours from London, end to end. Early spring suits this working harbour: many places are shut, the fish market is not. Lunch at its no-nonsense restaurant, then walk the coastal paths to Collioure, brighter and busier by comparison. The Pyréneés-Orientales coast is one of France’s sunniest areas, and even out of season the light does much of the work.
Becky
The hazily golden city of Avignon
En route to Sicily via ferry from Genoa, we stopped in Avignon. We got off the train in the early evening to find a hazily golden city with winding medieval streets full of small independent shops, the amazing Palais des Papes (Popes’ Palace), a beautiful shining Rhône river – and we explored the remaining four arches and gatehouse of the 12th-century Pont Saint-Bénézet. Everywhere was walkable, from the very comfortable and reasonably- priced Bristol Hotel. Warm in the evening, plenty of traditional restaurants, no crowds. In the off-season, Avignon relaxed us, warmed our bones and fed our souls.

EDF pledges fresh £15bn UK investment as nuclear outages drag on output
The company said nuclear output from its five active power stations decreased by 12% last year, compared with 2024.
- Bookmark
EDF has revealed that a fall in prices and a prolonged outage at one of its nuclear power stations dragged on UK profits last year, while the French energy giant plans to plug £15 billion of investment into the country over the next three years.
The company said nuclear output from its five active power stations decreased by 12% last year, compared with 2024.
Its Sizewell B facility in Suffolk and Torness in Scotland had a strong performance, but it was hit by an extended outage at the Hartlepool power station, according to the business.
The station, which is in Teesside, started generating power 43 years ago, and provides enough electricity to power around two million homes.
It was given a further one-year extension to generate electricity until March 2028, one year later than previously expected.
But outages affecting one of its two reactor systems was the main driver of the overall drop in nuclear output for EDF last year.
Furthermore, a decline in earnings was also down to the prices it charges for nuclear power being lower than in 2024.
It is understood that average prices were down by approximately 20%.
Energy prices in the UK have been gradually coming down after spiking in the aftermath of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in 2022.
EDF said that in its UK business, earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) were £1.9 billion for 2025, down about a third from £2.9 billion in 2024.
EDF’s nuclear fleet provided about 12% of the UK’s total power demand last year – which it says makes it Britain’s biggest generator of zero carbon electricity.
The company said it invested more than £5 billion in Britain over 2025, 30% more than the year before.
Over the next three years, it plans to plug a further £15 billion into the UK across its different businesses – which also incorporates wind and solar power generation.
A large portion of the funding will go towards the development of the Hinkley Point C power plant which is being built in Somerset.
EDF is separately an investor in the major Sizewell C project in Suffolk, which is backed by the Government.
The two developments are expected to provide low carbon electricity to meet 14% of UK demand and power around 12 million homes.
Simone Rossi, chief executive of EDF in the UK, said: “EDF is continuing to invest heavily in powering, supplying and building an electric Britain.
“Our UK strategy is to deliver a long-term nuclear and renewables generation business, and to meet the evolving needs of our customers as more and more transition away from fossil fuels to using cleaner, more secure and affordable electricity.”

In this episode of What Are You Doing in Denmark, Derek and Annie sit down with personal trainer and educator Mikkel Valgreen to unpack what’s happening, why it’s happening, and who’s most affected.
The change stems from an EU classification that defines fitness services as “commercial” rather than healthcare. That means higher prices for gym memberships, personal training, and classes… while taxes on things like sugar and alcohol are being reduced.
We break down:
– Why the VAT was introduced
– How gyms and trainers are responding
– Who is exempt (and who isn’t)
– The political debate around whether fitness should count as healthcare
– What it means for Denmark’s long-term public health
Plus, Mikkel shares practical advice for actually sticking to your fitness goals in 2026 without burning out by February.

Arrest another ugly chapter in royals running foul of law

Arrest another ugly chapter in royals running foul of law
Historically, the arrest or imprisonment of a member of the royal family would have involved battles for the throne of England or the treacherous intrigues of courtly life.
Thursday’s arrest of Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor in Sandringham may be less bloody than previous eras – involving fewer swords – but it does prove that, as in the past, a royal lineage does not protect against perceived wrongdoing.
The last king to be arrested was Charles I, who was tried in Westminster Hall in January 1649 after the royalists lost the Civil War.
Despite disputing the court’s authority, Charles was convicted of treason and tyranny. He was beheaded on January 30 that year outside the Banqueting House in Whitehall, central London.
It brought to an end the age when the threat of execution was never too far away for royalty. From the Stuart and Tudor eras, when Lady Jane Grey, Anne Boleyn, Mary Queen of Scots and Catherine Howard were also arrested and put to death on charges of treason, royalty remained above the law until the princess royal was caught going 37km/h above the speed limit in 2001.
Princess Anne was convicted of speeding in her Bentley after being caught driving at 150km/h in a 110km/h zone in Gloucestershire. She was fined £400, ordered to pay £30 in costs and given five penalty points on her driving licence.
The next year, she became the first member of the current royal family to be convicted of a criminal offence when she pleaded guilty to a charge under the Dangerous Dogs Act.
The princess was given a £500 fine and a criminal record in November 2002 after her English bull terrier, called Dotty, had bitten two children in Windsor Great Park. She was also ordered to pay £250 in compensation and £148 in costs at a magistrates’ court in Slough.
Three-year-old Dotty was granted a stay of execution but a contingent destruction order was placed on the dog, meaning it would receive an automatic death sentence if it attacked again.
The only other modern royal brush with the law came in January 2020, when Zara Tindall was handed a driving ban after speeding through the Cotswolds in her Land Rover.
Princess Anne’s daughter received a “totting up” ban, as she already had nine points on her licence. The additional four points were added for travelling at 146km/h on the A417 in Gloucestershire, which has a 110km/h limit, in November 2019.
Tindall was also fined £666 plus costs and a victim surcharge of £151.
When Prince Philip was involved in a crash that left two women in hospital with minor injuries in January 2019, he agreed to surrender his driving licence, but faced no further action.
Once the royal family was clear of the threat of a vengeful king or of parliament, all they had to worry about was scandal – not uncommon during the Georgian or Victorian eras.
In 1769, Lord Grosvenor sued the Duke of Cumberland, King George III’s brother, for damages after his butler had caught the Duke allegedly in flagrante with his wife, Lady Henrietta Grosvenor.
The secret rendezvous at a St Albans hotel caused a national scandal when the lovers’ correspondence was published in the press as part of the trial reports. A jury awarded Lord Grosvenor £10,000 for damage to his marital property.
In 1806, Caroline of Brunswick, accused of having a child out of wedlock, was barred from the coronation of her husband, George IV. After ascending to the throne in 1820, the king, who was already illegally married to Maria Fitzherbert, sought to divorce Caroline, from whom he was estranged.
The so-called Delicate Investigation uncovered no evidence for the rumours, but it caused rifts in the royal family that led to Caroline – then princess of Wales – being barred from her husband’s coronation in 1821. She died three weeks later.
The royal family was engulfed by rumours of murder in 1810 after the death of one of George III’s son’s valets.
Ernest Augustus was asleep at St James’ Palace when he was allegedly attacked with a sword. The culprit was presumed to be one of his valets, Joseph Sellis, who was found later that night with his throat cut. Although the wound was deemed to be self-inflicted, the circumstances of the death – in which Sellis’s head had almost been severed – caused rumour to spread throughout aristocratic circles that the duke had played a part.
The royal family was plunged into a scandal known as the Cleveland Street Affair in 1889 when the Duke of Clarence, the eldest son of Edward VII, was rumoured to have slept with a young boy.
After detectives uncovered a male brothel, frequented by aristocrats, near London’s Euston station, rumours soon spread that the duke, nicknamed Cuffs and Collars because of his extravagant dress sense, was a regular patron. Some biographers believe he was bisexual.
As the trial approached, the king-in-waiting, aged 25, was packed off on a lengthy tour of India. He died of pneumonia three years later, before any concrete evidence could be found.

Sweden Democrat leader willing to wait with PR revocation law until after election
The so-called Tidö parties ‒ the government and the Sweden Democrats ‒ have been in disagreement in recent weeks over a proposed law which would see permanent residence permits stripped from as many as 185,000 people and converted into temporary permits if it were to become law.
The Sweden Democrats believe that the four parties agreed in their coalition document, the Tidö Agreement, to enact the law, while the other three parties say they only agreed to investigate it.
Now, Sweden Democrat leader Jimmie Åkesson has said that he is willing to wait with the proposal until after the election.
"As long as we're in agreement that it will be carried out immediately after the election, then I could be convinced, absolutely," he told public broadcaster SVT's interview programme 30 minuter.
Swedish vocabulary: omedelbart ‒ immediately
Sweden to develop air raid warning app
Sweden's Civil Defence Agency is working on a new app which would warn people living in the country of a potential air attack, according to Swedish radio Ekot.
Ukraine has a similar app, used to warn the population of imminent attacks and tell people to seek shelter.
The Swedish app is expected to work alongside the Hesa Fredrik air raid siren system, as well as the VMA system used by Swedish radio.
Swedish vocabulary: luftangrepp ‒ air attack/air raid
Sweden unveils new prison conditions for teens
Sweden on Thursday revealed prison conditions that teens as young as 13 will face if convicted of a serious criminal offence, once a much-criticised juvenile judicial reform takes effect in July.
The government announced in January that it would reduce the age of criminal responsibility from 15 to 13.
Eight existing prisons have been tasked with preparing special sections for children, with three of them due to open by July 1st when the reform is scheduled to enter into force, the government said on Thursday.
The children will be kept separated from adult inmates, and will be locked in their cells for 11 hours at night instead of the 14 hours for adults, Justice Minister Gunnar Strömmer told a press conference.
In addition to attending school lessons during the day, the children will have their own cafeteria, recreation yard, gym and infirmary. (AFP)

Sweden pledges 12.9 billion kronor to Ukraine air defence
Sweden has plans to send 12.9 billion kronor ($1.4 billion) in military aid to Ukraine, focused primarily on air defence capabilities.
Defence Minister Pål Jonson told AFP that the military aid package was "the third largest so far that Sweden has delivered to Ukraine."
He added that the pledged aid package is based on needs communicated by Ukraine.
"That is to say, air defence and sustaining the platforms we have delivered with ammunition," Jonson said.
Some 4.3 billion kronor would go to delivering to Ukraine an "advanced short-range air defence capability," according to the government.
This would include additional units of the TRIDON Mk2 mobile anti-aircraft artillery system, which Sweden announced in early February it was supplying to Ukraine.
Jonson said the aim was to have the systems delivered to Ukraine within 24 months.
The remainder of the funds would go towards large quantities of ammunition, including long-range artillery shells, as well as training and the expansion of a cooperation project with Ukraine on long-range drones. (AFP)
Swedish vocabulary: stöd ‒ aid or support

Iran sends threatening letter to UN, vows decisive response but says it will not start a war

Iran sent a letter overnight Thursday to Friday to U.N. Secretary-General António Guterres warning that it would “respond decisively” to any attack against it, saying that “bases, facilities and assets of the hostile force will be legitimate targets.” The Iranians criticized threats by U.S. President Donald Trump, arguing that they pose “a real risk of attack.”
In the letter to Guterres, Iran said it “will not initiate any war,” but stressed that the United States would bear “full and direct responsibility for all the unforeseen and uncontrollable consequences” resulting from an attack against it — and from Iran’s response.
The Iranian threat came after The Wall Street Journal reported Thursday that Trump is considering launching an initial limited military strike on Iran to compel it to meet his demands for a nuclear agreement. According to the report, the move is intended to pressure Tehran into reaching a deal without resorting to a large-scale assault that could trigger a significant response. Officials familiar with the matter who spoke to the Journal said that if approved, the strike could take place within days and would target military or government sites.
The report said that if Iran continues to refuse to meet Trump’s terms for halting uranium enrichment, the United States will respond with a broader attack on regime facilities, possibly even with the aim of toppling it.
The impasse in negotiations, which U.S. officials say is unlikely to be resolved, and the American military buildup near Iran have increased the likelihood of a strike. The Journal noted that in Iran there are already concerns over a deadline set by Trump after he said last year he would give Tehran two weeks to reach a nuclear deal — but days later B-2 bombers struck three nuclear sites in the country.
Trump addressed the negotiations with Iran at the inaugural meeting of the Board of Peace on Thursday. He said the talks were “good,” but emphasized that a “meaningful agreement” must be reached. “Over the years it has been proven that it is not easy to reach a meaningful agreement with Iran, and we must reach a meaningful agreement. Otherwise bad things will happen,” he said. In what appeared to be an ultimatum to Iran, he added: “We may have to take it one step further, and we may not have to. Maybe we’ll make a deal — you’ll probably find out in the next 10 days.”

Jeffrey Epstein’s estate agrees to $35 million settlement in victim class action

Jeffrey Epstein’s estate agrees to $35 million settlement in victim class action
The estate previously set up a restitution fund that paid out $121 million to victims
- Bookmark
Jeffrey Epstein’s estate has agreed to pay as much as $35 million to resolve a class action lawsuit that accused two of the disgraced financier's advisers of aiding and abetting his sex trafficking of young women and teenage girls, according to a court filing on Thursday.
Boies Schiller Flexner, a law firm representing Epstein victims, announced the settlement in a brief filed in federal court in Manhattan.
The deal, if approved by a judge, would bring an end to a 2024 lawsuit filed against Epstein's former personal lawyer Darren Indyke and former accountant Richard Kahn, who are co-executors of Epstein's estate.
Epstein's estate previously set up a restitution fund that paid out $121 million to victims. The estate also paid out $49 million in additional settlements to victims.
Neither Indyke nor Kahn "made any admission or concession of misconduct" as part of the settlement made public on Thursday, their lawyer Daniel H. Weiner said.
"Because they did nothing wrong, the co-executors were prepared to fight the claims against them through to trial, but agreed to mediate and settle this lawsuit in order to achieve finality as to any potential claims against the Epstein Estate," Weiner said.
Weiner said the settlement would provide "a confidential avenue for financial relief" for Epstein victims who have not already resolved claims against the estate.
Epstein died in a New York jail in August 2019. His death was ruled a suicide.
In the 2024 lawsuit, lawyers at Boies Schiller Flexner said Indyke and Kahn helped Epstein create a complex web of corporations and bank accounts that let him hide his abuses and pay victims and recruiters, while leaving them "richly compensated" for their work.
The Boies law firm previously helped obtain $365 million of settlements with JPMorgan Chase and Deutsche Bank after accusing them of missing red flags about Epstein, once a lucrative client.

Venezuela congress poised to renew amnesty debate after delay: Report
Lawmakers in Caracas resume talks on sweeping measure that could free hundreds jailed for political reasons as disagreements persist over eligibility
ISTANBUL
Venezuela's National Assembly is set to resume debate in Caracas over a sweeping amnesty bill that could free hundreds jailed for political reasons, according to media reports.
The Washington Post reported Thursday that the measure, proposed by acting President Delcy Rodriguez, comes weeks after the US military captured President Nicolas Maduro in Caracas on Jan. 3 and transferred him to New York to face drug trafficking charges.
Under the proposal, the bill would grant “a general and full amnesty for crimes or offenses committed” since 1999, including “acts of politically motivated violence” tied to the 2024 presidential election.
More than 2,000 arrested amid protests
Nationwide protests erupted in the aftermath of the election, leading to the arrest of more than 2,000 people, including minors, according to previous reports. Lawmakers halted debate last week over whether exiled or fugitive suspects would qualify.
Lawmaker Nicolas Maduro Guerra argued that defendants must first appear in court.
Members of the ruling party have maintained that Venezuelan law does not permit trials in absentia, meaning those outside the country would need to return and submit to the justice system before qualifying.
Authorities in Caracas have long denied holding political prisoners, a claim disputed by rights groups.
Foro Penal, a Caracas-based prisoners’ rights organization, estimates that more than 600 people remain detained for political reasons, with 448 releases recorded since Nicolas Maduro's arrest.
Relatives of detainees have gathered outside prisons in recent days to demand faster releases, while a small group launched a hunger strike over the weekend, activists said.

NATO Allies including the United Kingdom have agreed to launch a new multinational project aimed at strengthening defence against ballistic missile threats, the alliance stated.
The initiative was announced on 12 February 2026 following a signing ceremony at NATO Headquarters, where NATO Deputy Secretary General Radmila Shekerinska said the projects represented a key step towards meeting commitments made at the NATO 2025 Summit in The Hague.
Under the new High Visibility Project, seven Allies, Belgium, Denmark, France, the Netherlands, Norway, Turkey and the United Kingdom, will cooperate on the development, acquisition and implementation of capabilities designed to enhance ballistic missile defence. NATO said this will include work on sensors, interceptors and tactical control systems, complementing existing Allied air and missile defence capabilities.
In an announcement, the Alliance stated the initiative responds to capability targets and national operational requirements within the Alliance’s Integrated Air and Missile Defence framework. The announcement formed part of a wider package of multinational capability cooperation initiatives, including a separate High Visibility Project involving Denmark, Lithuania, the Netherlands, Poland and Turkey focused on drone-based deep precision strike capabilities.
NATO also said fifteen Allies will explore multinational approaches to improving airworthiness resilience and interoperability during times of crisis or conflict, potentially covering design, modification, maintenance and repair solutions, as well as procedural adaptations to sustain air operations.
In addition, Sweden has joined NATO’s Air Battle Decisive Munitions High Visibility Project, bringing participation to 17 nations. NATO said the ABDM initiative supports the acquisition of essential air-launched munitions under more favourable conditions while improving interoperability among Allies.

Three aid workers killed, 4 wounded in RSF drone attack in Sudan’s Kordofan
The attack comes as the UN releases a report which found that RSF actions have hallmarks of genocide in el-Fasher.
At least three aid workers have been killed and four others wounded in a drone attack by the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) on an aid convoy in Sudan’s South Kordofan state, according to the Sudan Doctors Network, in the latest carnage against civilians caught up in the nation’s brutal civil war.
The convoy of trucks carrying food and humanitarian supplies was targeted by the RSF, and its ally, the Sudan People’s Liberation Movement–North, while travelling through the Kartala area on its way to the cities of Kadugli and Dilling on Thursday.

“The network strongly condemned the deliberate targeting of humanitarian convoys, describing it as a blatant violation of international humanitarian law and of all norms prohibiting attacks on humanitarian workers,” wrote the Sudan Doctors Network in a social media post.
The network said that this attack marked the “second such incident in less than a month, following the shelling of a United Nations aid convoy in the town of Al-Rahad,” adding: “this dangerous escalation threatens the safety of humanitarian operations and further exacerbates civilian suffering”.
The Sudan Doctors Network reiterated its call to the “international community, the United Nations, and human rights organisations to exert urgent and effective pressure on the leadership of the Rapid Support Forces to ensure the protection of aid convoys and their workers, to open safe and sustainable humanitarian corridors, and to hold those responsible for targeting aid accountable”.
Al Jazeera could not independently verify the latest RSF attack, which came a month after the government-aligned Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF) announced that it had broken a nearly two-year-long RSF siege on Dilling.
Dilling lies halfway between Kadugli – the besieged state capital – and el-Obeid, the capital of neighbouring North Kordofan province, which the RSF has sought to encircle.
The RSF and the SAF have been waging a brutal civil war for control of Sudan since April 2023, which has killed thousands of people and displaced millions.
After being forced out of the capital, Khartoum, in March, the RSF has focused on the Kordofan region and el-Fasher city in North Darfur state, which was the military’s last stronghold in the sprawling Darfur region until the RSF seized it in October.
Reports of the paramilitary carrying out mass killings, rape, abductions and looting emerged after el-Fasher’s takeover, and the International Criminal Court (ICC) launched a formal investigation into “war crimes” by both sides.
On Wednesday, the UN’s Independent International Fact-Finding Mission for the Sudan determined that the RSF carried out “a coordinated campaign of destruction” against non-Arab communities in and around el-Fasher during its 18-month siege of the city, the hallmarks of which amount to genocide.
The fact-finding mission, which was mandated by members of the UN Human Rights Council, said that the RSF had committed at least three out of the five criteria of what constitutes a genocide.
According to the report, they included killing members of protected ethnic groups (in this case, the Zaghawa and Fur communities), causing serious bodily and mental harm, and deliberately inflicting conditions of life calculated to bring about the group’s physical destruction in whole or in part.
Following the report’s release, the United States announced sanctions on RSF Brigadier-General Elfateh Abdullah Idris Adam, Major-General Gedo Hamdan Ahmed Mohamed and field commander Tijani Ibrahim Moussa Mohamed for their roles in the “horrific campaign” of the siege and capture of el-Fasher.

India joins US-led Pax Silica initiative at AI summit
Officials say pact aims to strengthen secure and resilient technology supply chains
NEW DELHI
India on Friday joined Pax Silica, a US-led international initiative launched last year to build what organizers describe as “secure, resilient, and innovation-driven supply chains.”
The signing ceremony took place during the ongoing AI Impact Summit in New Delhi.
US Ambassador to India Sergio Gor, who attended the event, said India’s entry into Pax Silica “isn’t just symbolic” but “strategic and essential.”
He described the initiative as “a coalition of capabilities that replaces coercive dependencies with a positive sum alliance of trusted industrial bases,” adding that it is “about whether free societies will control the commanding heights of the global economy.”
Gor said policies reinforcing US-India technology cooperation “will power AI innovation and adoption for years to come.”
“We can share trusted AI technology with the world, and especially with partners like India. And critically, India brings strength,” he said.
“Peace doesn’t come from hoping adversaries will play fair. We all know they won’t. Peace comes through strength…. that strength, sovereignty, is exactly what Pax Silica amplifies,” he added.
India’s Information Technology Minister Ashwini Vaishnaw said the pact will “greatly benefit India’s electronics and semiconductor industry.”
Pax Silica was launched in December 2025. Countries including Australia, the United Arab Emirates, Israel and Japan are among the signatories.

Russia Building ‘Parallel Force’ to Protect Putin, Analyst Warns

Russia is building a “parallel structure” of force outside its Defense Ministry that could be used not only on the battlefield in Ukraine but also to protect President Vladimir Putin from threats at home, analyst William James Dixon warned.
Dixon, a Senior Associate Fellow at the Royal United Services Institute (RUSI), which describes itself as the world’s oldest independent defense and security think tank and one of the UK’s leading institutions in that field, told TVP World’s Eastern Express that a recent Kremlin decree appears to strengthen the Russian National Guard, known as Rosgvardia, rather than fold it into the regular military chain of command.

Instead, he said, the decree elevates Rosgvardia into a system “outside of the Ministry of Defense,” with “overarching operational control” concentrated under its director, Viktor Zolotov, who reports directly to Putin. Dixon described the shift as evidence of a “parallel structure” being created within the Kremlin’s security architecture.
A force built for regime security
The interview focused on what the changes might signal about the Kremlin’s priorities as Russia’s full-scale war against Ukraine drags on. Dixon argued that autocratic systems tend to insulate the leader from both elite intrigue and public unrest, especially after moments that expose weakness.
EU Demands Russian Troop Withdrawal From Belarus, Georgia, Armenia and Transnistria in Ukraine Peace Framework
He linked Rosgvardia’s evolution to the shock of the 2023 Prigozhin mutiny, saying it highlighted that existing capabilities were insufficient to manage a serious internal challenge. Since then, he said, the force has been transformed from what was effectively a policing structure into something closer to a rival military, pointing to reports of specialized units and heavier equipment, including tank formations now being formed within Rosgvardia.
Dixon compared Rosgvardia’s role to Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, calling it a “praetorian force” aimed at protecting the regime. He also pointed to a wider tightening of internal controls, including heightened digital surveillance and measures aimed at fragmenting elites, an environment shaped, he argued, by the pressures of a long war.
Battlefield role and future risks
Rosgvardia has also been deployed in Ukraine, including in intense fighting and occupation duties in eastern regions such as the Donbas and in rear-area security roles.
Asked whether creating a privileged parallel force could deepen tensions inside Russia’s military, Dixon said it could become “a flashpoint for further division.” Looking beyond Putin, he warned that such structures may make any future succession more volatile, potentially creating competing power centers in the event of a leadership transition.

Over 1,000 Kenyans recruited to fight for Russia in Ukraine war: report
Russian embassy denied Moscow’s involvement in illegally recruiting, though it said foreign citizens could voluntarily join its forces
More than 1,000 Kenyans have been recruited to fight on Russia’s side in the war in Ukraine, according to a Kenyan intelligence report presented to lawmakers this week, five times more than authorities had previously estimated.
The Russian embassy in Nairobi denied on Thursday that Moscow was involved in illegally recruiting Kenyans to fight in Ukraine, though it said foreign citizens could voluntarily join its armed forces.
Reading the report of Kenya’s National Intelligence Service to lawmakers on Wednesday, Parliament Majority Leader Kimani Ichung’wah described a network of rogue state officials it said had colluded with human trafficking syndicates to recruit Kenyans to fight in Russia’s war in Ukraine.
The recruiters targeted former soldiers and police officers, as well as unemployed people, with promises that they would earn some 350,000 shillings (US$2,715) per month and get bonuses of up to 1.2 million shillings (US$9,309).
“So far over 1,000 Kenyans have been recruited and departed to fight in the Russia-Ukraine war,” Ichung’wah said. Kenya said in November that over 200 of its citizens were fighting for Russia in Ukraine. That same month Ukraine said some 1,400 citizens from three dozen African countries were fighting alongside Russian forces on its territory, with some recruited through deception.
As of February 2026, 89 Kenyans were on the Ukrainian front line, 39 were hospitalised, and 28 missing in action, the new report said.

Ukraine commemorates Heroes of Heavenly Hundred

Ukraine commemorates Heroes of Heavenly Hundred
According to Ukrinform, the day is marked annually on February 20 under the Decree of the President of Ukraine dated February 11, 2015 "On Commemoration of the Heroism of Participants in the Revolution of Dignity and Honoring the Memory of the Heroes of the Heavenly Hundred."
These dates in 2014 marked the peak of confrontation during the Revolution of Dignity between the Ukrainian people and the then-regime. On February 20, 2014, the largest number of people – 48 – were killed in the center of Ukraine’s capital. Along with 54 others who died or were fatally wounded during the winter protests of 2013–2014 and five activists who died in spring 2014 defending democratic values and Ukraine’s territorial integrity, they were named the Heroes of the Heavenly Hundred.
The name Heavenly Hundred comes from the structure of the Maidan Self-Defense units, organized in “hundreds.” It was first used during the farewell ceremonies for the fallen at Maidan Nezalezhnosti (Independence Square) in Kyiv on February 21–22, 2014.
Posthumously, 105 Heroes of the Heavenly Hundred were awarded the title Heroes of Ukraine, and three foreigners – a Belarusian citizen, Mikhail Zhiznevsky, and two Georgian citizens, Zurab Khurtsia and David Kipiani – were awarded the Order of the Heroes of the Heavenly Hundred.
The Heroes of the Heavenly Hundred were people of different nationalities, faiths, education, and ages. The youngest, Nazarii Voitovych, was 17 years old; the oldest, Ivan Nakonechnyi, was 82. Among the 107 Heroes, three were women: Antonina Dvorianets, Olha Bura, and Liudmyla Sheremet.
On February 17, 2021, the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine recognized the Revolution of Dignity as a key moment in Ukrainian statehood and an expression of the national idea of freedom.
As noted by the Institute of National Remembrance of Ukraine, Remembrance Day of the Heroes of the Heavenly Hundred is a day of mourning, reflecting the deaths of Ukrainians during the Revolution of Dignity and the early stages of Russian aggression in eastern Ukraine. At the same time, it honors struggle for a dignified and free life, sacrifice, and courage rather than death. The deaths of the Heroes of the Heavenly Hundred profoundly affected Ukrainian public consciousness, highlighting the importance of self-determination, dignity, freedom, state sovereignty, democracy, and the European choice.
This year, as part of the program of events, on February 19 in Kyiv, the Gallery of Protest Art opened the exhibition “People. Place. Presence,” dedicated to the fallen Heroes of Maidan.
On February 20 at 10:00, a ceremony to honor the Heroes of the Heavenly Hundred and participants of the Revolution of Dignity will take place at the Alley of the Heroes of the Heavenly Hundred, near the Ecumenical Church of Archangel Michael and Ukrainian New Martyrs.
At 11:30, the annual silent event Angels of Memory, initiated in 2014, will begin at the Alley. Everyone can participate by making a paper angel and placing it at a commemorative site in their city.
Also on February 20, at 12:00, an exhibition 40 Events of Maidan will open at Independence Square around the Independence Monument. At 17:00, the memorial-artistic event Territory of Dignity will honor the Heroes of the Heavenly Hundred.
At 18:00, a memorial march will take place along the Alley of the Heroes of the Heavenly Hundred.
Additionally, an information campaign marking Heroes of the Heavenly Hundred Day will feature the graphic image by artist Oleksandr Komiakhov, inspired by the famous image of raising a flag on Iwo Jima. It depicts Maidan protesters with wooden shields, symbolizing peaceful demonstrators during the mass shootings on February 20, and has been consistently used in campaigns for several years.
A detailed program and educational materials for Heroes of the Heavenly Hundred Day are available on the Museum of the Revolution of Dignity website.

Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor: What legal protections do the royal family have?
The monarch is protected by sovereign immunity, a wide-ranging constitutional principle that exempts them from all criminal and civil liability
- Bookmark
Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor has been arrested on suspicion of misconduct in public office. The arrest comes after the US government released files that appeared to indicate he had shared official information with financier and convicted child sex offender Jeffrey Epstein while serving as a trade envoy for the UK. But the police have not given details of exactly what they are investigating.
It is important to be clear that the arrest is not related to accusations of sexual assault or misconduct. In 2022, Mountbatten-Windsor reached a settlement with the late Virginia Giuffre for an undisclosed sum that did not include an admission of liability.
Being named in the Epstein files is not an indication of misconduct. Mountbatten-Windsor has previously denied any wrongdoing in his association with Epstein and has previously rejected any suggestion that he used his time as trade envoy to further his own interests.
What was Mountbatten-Windsor’s official role and why did he lose it?
In 2001, Tony Blair’s government made the then-prince the UK’s special representative for trade and investment. According to the government at the time, his remit was to “promote UK business internationally, market the UK to potential inward investors, and build relationships in support of UK business interests”. He did not receive a salary, but he did go on hundreds of trips to promote British businesses.
Members of the royal family are often deployed by the government on international missions to promote trade. When negotiating with other countries, particularly those which are also monarchies, sending a prominent figure like a royal may help seal the deal. Indeed, the then-government claimed that the former Duke of York’s “unique position gives him unrivalled access to members of royal families, heads of state, government ministers and chief executives of companies”.
It is not unusual for members of the royal family to be deployed by the government for diplomatic missions. Royals often host incoming state visits and lead similar visits abroad, and can be deployed to lead delegations on more specific missions.
However, Mountbatten-Windsor had an official role as trade envoy. He stepped down from this role in 2011 following reports about his friendship with Epstein, who was convicted of sex offences in 2011.
Are royals protected from prosecution?
The monarch is protected by sovereign immunity, a wide-ranging constitutional principle exempting him from all criminal and civil liability. According to the leading 19th century constitutionalist Alfred Dicey, the monarch could not even be prosecuted for “shooting the Prime Minister through the head”. The Prince of Wales also enjoys immunity as Duke of Cornwall, which protects him from punishment for breaking a range of laws.
The State Immunity Act 1978, which confers immunity on the head of state, also extends to “members of the family forming part of the household”. However, this phrase has been interpreted narrowly to apply to a very tight circle of people and does not appear to apply to the monarch’s children in general. For example, in 2002 Princess Anne was prosecuted (though not arrested) for failing to control her dogs in Windsor Great Park after they bit two children.
Nevertheless, there has often been a perception that members of the royal family are held to a different standard when it comes to the law. In 2016 Thames Valley Police were criticised by anti-monarchy groups for not prosecuting the then-prince after newspaper reports alleged he had driven his car through the gates of Windsor Great Park. In 2019 the Crown Prosecution Service declined to prosecute Prince Philip for causing a car crash which injured two people.
The monarch also cannot be compelled to give evidence in court. For example, prosecutors were unable to summon the late queen to give evidence in the trial of Princess Diana’s former butler, who was accused of stealing her jewellery.
In response to Mountbatten-Windsor’s arrest, the king said: “What now follows is the full, fair and proper process by which this issue is investigated in the appropriate manner and by the appropriate authorities. In this, as I have said before, they have our full and wholehearted support and co-operation. Let me state clearly: the law must take its course.”
When was the last time a royal was arrested?
You have to go back quite a long way to find the last time that a member of the British royal family was arrested. This was during the English Civil War, when Charles I was taken prisoner for treason before being found guilty and ultimately executed in 1649.
A number of royals, including Princess Anne, have committed driving-related offences, including speeding. But this arrest makes Mountbatten-Windsor the first member of the royal family to be arrested in modern times, though it should be noted that he is no longer a royal – he was stripped of all his official titles in October 2025 as his friendship with Epstein came under even more scrutiny.
What limits do police have on investigating royal estates?
Sovereign immunity also prevents police from entering private royal estates to investigate alleged crimes without permission. This can, theoretically, protect members of the royal family from arrest and prosecution. The Cultural Property (Armed Conflicts) Act 2017 also bans police from searching royal estates for stolen or looted artefacts.
In 2007, two hen harriers were illegally shot at Sandringham estate. However, Norfolk Police first needed to ask Sandringham officials for permission to enter the estate, by which time the dead birds’ bodies had been removed. Police questioned Prince Harry, but did not bring charges.
Other incidents have allegedly led to Sandringham being accused of becoming a wildlife crime hotspot, with at least 18 reported cases of suspected wildlife offences taking place between 2003-23 – yet only one resulting in prosecution.
Another longstanding legal precedent is that no one may be arrested in the presence of the monarch or within the precincts of a royal palace. It was thought that this rule could protect other members of the royal family and royal employees. However, Mountbatten-Windsor’s arrest at Sandringham suggests that this antiquated principle may no longer hold true today.

Sky News’ new name and brand revealed at gala event

Sky News’ new name and brand revealed at gala event
Updated ,first published
Sky News Australia has used a star-studded event at News Corp’s Australian headquarters to unveil its new brand as News24 in front of guests including Prime Minister Anthony Albanese.
The Murdoch-owned news and conservative opinion channel was forced to rebrand ahead of the December expiry of its current 10-year licensing deal with Britain’s Sky News, which is owned by American media conglomerate Comcast.
The new brand poses a major challenge for Sky, which will have to convince casual viewers to recognise its fresh name and win audiences’ trust without the association with its less-politicised British namesake. It will come into effect later this year.
The name aligns the company more closely with its parent company, News Corp, and its logo uses a script that combines the handwriting of both Rupert Murdoch and his father, Sir Keith Murdoch.
The function, scheduled a day after Sky’s 30th birthday, is also doubling as a launch of Sky’s new studios in the inner-city suburb of Surry Hills, near Central Station.
Albanese arrived early, but was hard to spot in his government Comcar as he entered through the Holt St offices’ back door, as did investigative reporter and presenter Sharri Markson, who drove herself in.
Significant no-shows were News Corp chair Lachlan Murdoch and newly minted Opposition Leader Angus Taylor. One Nation leader Pauline Hanson, who triggered outrage this week when she suggested there were no “good” Muslims, was invited but also did not attend. Sky has increasingly given airtime to One Nation figures.
Peta Credlin, who took a taxi, was shortly followed by on-air talent Andrew Bolt, and Kieran Gilbert. Liberal politicians Melissa McIntosh – who, at the time of her invite, was federal opposition communications spokeswoman – and NSW Opposition Leader Kellie Sloane arrived at the same time, though separately through the front door.
Former Murdoch consigliere and (until December) chair of Sky News Siobhan McKenna was a surprise arrival at the same time as Qantas boss Vanessa Hudson. The pair were followed shortly after by newly minted Liberal communications spokesperson and agitator Sarah Henderson, and former prime ministers Tony Abbott and John Howard.
Commonwealth bank CEO Matt Comyn arrived through the front, as did Rich Lister Solomon Lew, while state premier Chris Minns, like his only other fellow Labor representative Albanese, went through the back door.
News Corp company man Hamish McLennan, who is chair of its majority owned real estate listings platform, REA Group, arrived at 5pm on the dot.
Sports powerbroker and reportedly “best mate” of Sky News boss Paul Whittaker, Peter V’landys was a late arrival. It is a starkly similar guest list to that of Lachlan and Sarah Murdoch’s annual Christmas party.
Confirmation of the forced name change was first reported by this masthead in August. Sky said the change reflects its evolution from a “traditional linear Australian television channel to a globally ambitious multiplatform news business with a growing international audience”.
Established in 1996, Sky was founded as a joint venture between Sky UK, Channel Seven and Channel Nine as an upstart news brand, broadcasting through cable television company Foxtel. In 2016, when it was sold to News Corp, the company secured a 10-year extension of its naming rights deal.
The sale began the shift from relatively centrist news broadcaster, akin to its British namesake, toward the slate of conservative opinion hosts it broadcasts each evening in its current incarnation.
Sky still broadcasts to a modest audience on Foxtel (now under new ownership) whose household subscribers have been declining for a decade. But Sky has found new audiences online by repackaging and posting thousands of clips from its daily programming to digital platforms such as YouTube.
Much of Sky’s online audience is now based overseas and its content has a heavy focus on popular culture wars topics related to US politics and the British royal family. It has posted 213,000 videos to its YouTube account, where it has 6.1 million subscribers.
Locally, the Sky’s so-called “after dark” programming has played a role in shaping the conservative politics in Australia.

The next interface race: how AI is bringing smart glasses into focus
LLVision CEO Wu Fei explains how advances in AI and hardware are pushing smart glasses closer to everyday use
The artificial intelligence boom has swept through consumer electronics – from smart wearables and AI-powered home devices to voice-interactive toys and robotic pets – but its most significant impact may be on the interface itself.
Technology is moving off the screen and onto the face, with smart glasses increasingly seen as the next frontier.
“The next interaction revolution will happen right in front of our eyes – driven by AI agents and the inevitable miniaturisation of hardware,” said Wu Fei, founder and CEO of Beijing-based augmented reality (AR) glasses maker LLVision.
Wu traces his thinking back to around 2010, when Apple’s roll-out of the iPhone left him both awed and unsettled – a device that redefined interaction through touch and swipe and began shifting daily life into software.
Reflecting on what might follow prompted him to launch his own company in 2014.
“The essence of interaction is to serve people,” Wu said. “The next generation of devices must align more closely with human cognitive instincts.”

Argentina approves Milei's radical labour reform amid nationwide strike, clashes

The lower house of Argentina’s Congress has approved a contentious labour reform bill backed by libertarian President Javier Milei, despite a nationwide strike by unions opposing the changes that had brought parts of the country to a halt.
Investors have been closely watching the legislation, passed by 135 votes in favor with 115 against on Friday, to see whether Milei has the power to continue implementing his free-market agenda.
The government says the bill, approved last week by the Senate with support from the ruling party and its centre-right allies, will spur investment and boost formal employment.
Lawmakers were debating modifications in the early hours on Friday before sending the bill back to the Senate for a final vote to become law. Among the changes was the removal of an article that reduced sickness-related benefits for employees.
"What good is an entire library of labour legislation if, at the end of the day, the system it establishes doesn’t serve to create jobs?" ruling party lawmaker Lisandro Almiron asked during the debate on the bill.
Nationwide strike
Unions say the proposed overhaul threatens long-standing worker protections, including the right to strike. In protest, the powerful CGT union called a 24-hour stoppage on Thursday by transport workers, public sector staff, and bank employees.
Dozens of flights were cancelled, and train stations were left deserted with only a handful of buses running. On roads leading into the capital Buenos Aires, small groups of protesters blocked traffic.
Later in the day, several thousand demonstrators gathered outside parliament, where a few dozen participants engaged in running battles with police, throwing bottles and stones. Officers replied with tear gas, water cannons, and rubber bullets to clear the area. Police were observed making about a dozen arrests.
The CGT labour federation said more workers adhered to the walkout call than during any of the previous three strikes.
"It has levels of compliance like never before under this government," union leader Jorge Sola told Radio con Vos, claiming that "90 percent of activity had stopped."
The contested reforms pushed by budget-slashing Milei, an ideological ally of US President Donald Trump, would make it easier to hire and fire workers in a country where job security is already hard to come by.
It would also reduce severance pay, limit the right to strike, increase work hours, and restrict holiday provisions.
Almost 40 percent of Argentine workers lack formal employment contracts, and unions say the new measures will make matters worse.
Massive job cuts
The labour action comes as Argentina's economy is showing signs of a downturn in manufacturing, with more than 21,000 companies having shuttered in two years under Milei.
He had come to power after wielding a chainsaw at rallies during the 2023 election campaign to symbolise the deep cuts he planned to make to public spending.
Unions say some 300,000 jobs have been lost since Milei's austerity measures began.
Most recently, Fate — Argentina's main tyre factory — on Wednesday announced the closure of its plant in Buenos Aires, prompting some 900 job cuts.
The last general strike in Argentina was on April 10 2025, but adherence was uneven as workers in the public transport system did not join.
Last week, thousands of people demonstrated in Buenos Aires as senators debated the reform bill, and clashes with police resulted in about 30 arrests.
On Tuesday, the government issued an unusual statement warning reporters about the "risk" of covering protests, and announced it would establish an "exclusive zone" from which the media can work.

Russian Decision Is a Betrayal: Ukrainian Paralympics Chief

The President of the Ukrainian Paralympic Committee told AFP he feels the International Paralympic Committee (IPC) have betrayed Ukraine by permiting Russian athletes to compete under their own flag at the Milan-Cortina Games.
Valeriy Sushkevych compared the decision to the one four years ago just after Russia invaded Ukraine when both they and ally Belarus were barred from competing in the Beijing Paralympics.

Follow our coverage of the war on the @Kyivpost_official.
Sushkevych, who has been affected by the war with he and his family fleeing their home at one point because of incessant shelling, did not mince his words.
“The IPC, with its latest concrete decision, has given the possibility to raise this same flag, soaked in Ukrainian blood, on the territory of the 14th Winter Paralympic Games,” he said in a phone interview on Tuesday.
The IPC decision to allow six Russians and four Belarusians to compete in the Games, which begin on March 6, has sparked a boycott of the event by Ukrainian officials as well as the EU Commissioner for Sport.
The Italian government voiced their disapproval of the decision as well.
Sushkevych said the Ukrainian team’s motto at the 2022 Games “Peace for all”, which had been displayed throughout the event, had not been reflected this time round by the IPC.
“I would like to stress that at that time the IPC leaders supported our fight against the war,” he said.
“Today, the IPC has changed its position and failed to adhere to the values of humanity, democracy, and the philosophy of the international Paralympic movement, precisely in accordance with the slogan “Peace for all”.
EU Demands Russian Troop Withdrawal From Belarus, Georgia, Armenia and Transnistria in Ukraine Peace Framework
“But we will continue to fight in order to unite nations in the struggle against war.”
Despite the worries about the safety of their families back home the Ukraine team performed superbly at the Beijing Games, finishing second in the medals table behind the hosts.
Sushkevych, who is celebrating his 30th year at the helm of the Paralympic Committee, said the team at these Games would be competing under vastly different circumstances.
“As of today, the team is in a very difficult situation compared to Beijing,” said the 71-year-old, who is wheelchair bound.
“At that time, the team was preparing for the Paralympics in peaceful conditions, and we had more opportunities and significantly better funding, which has now been reduced by more than half.
“However, all this does not mean that the desire to win inside each of us has diminished.”
- ‘Constant shelling’ -
Sushkevych, a former deputy in the Ukrainian Parliament, said for many it was a miracle Ukraine had been able to assemble a team -- 36 athletes, 22 coaches and others such as medical staff will be in Italy -- to compete.
“My colleagues in the Paralympic movement -- many countries -- were concerned that Ukraine might not be present in Paris (2024 Summer Paralympics) or Milan,” he said.
“We are here! and we remain a powerful part of the international Paralympic movement, and this in itself is our victory -- the victory of the Ukrainian people!”
Sushkevych said sporting success does wonders for morale in Ukraine, especially disabled veterans.
“Today’s victories of Ukrainian Paralympians are stories that are especially important for our people affected by the war,” he said.
“Especially for soldiers who have lost their sight, lost their arms or legs, and are forced to use wheelchairs.
“These stories of our Paralympians give them an example and the opportunity to return to life.”
Sushkevych, who claims more than 800 sports people have been killed during the war a significantly higher number than Sports Minister Matviy Bidny told AFP earlier this month, said it was unimaginable the circumstances the team had prepared under.
“For four years, under bombs and constant shelling, they continued to train, risking their own lives, and understanding that the lives of their mothers, sisters, husbands, and children were also at risk,” he said.
Sushkevych, though, holds out hope there will be a fight back against Russia and their reintegration.
“It is necessary to stop Russia’s political aggression, which is carrying out the occupation of Paralympic sport,” he said.
“Including through the integration of Russian killers as Paralympic subjects with disabilities into the wider Paralympic family.
“I believe that the international Paralympic movement will realise this.”

ISTANBUL
Albanian Prime Minister Edi Rama dismissed concerns that the Board of Peace is intended to replace the United Nations, saying instead it could help “shake” the global body into action as leaders convened for the first meeting of US President Donald Trump’s initiative Thursday.
Rama thanked Trump for including Albania in the project, and praised his “decisive role in bringing a halt to the heartbreaking conflict in Gaza.”
He underscored Albania’s support for the initiative, citing a “fully aligned bipartisan vote” in parliament as evidence of the country’s commitment to being a founding member.
Addressing criticism in Europe, Rama said, “Many in Europe say the Board of Peace is meant to substitute the United Nations. It does not look to me like an attempt to replace the UN, but if it helps shake that agonizing giant and wake it up, then God bless the Board of Peace.”
Albania “has confirmed its participation in the stabilization force with our troops,” the premier added, urging the board to encourage direct national contributions to humanitarian efforts, including the establishment of a dedicated public facility for Palestinian children.
Rama said Albania’s initiatives are focused on protecting children in the Gaza Strip.
- Albanian PM urges Trump to act over Thaci trial, warns of regional risks
Turning to international legal proceedings, Rama criticized the ongoing trial of former Kosovo President Hashim Thaci in The Hague, where Thaci and three other former Kosovo Liberation Army commanders face war crimes charges related to the 1998-99 conflict.
He argued that prolonged judicial processes risk undermining regional stability and appealed directly to Trump, saying, “… Let’s do something before, as you say, very bad things might happen again.”
Last week, prosecutors requested a 45-year prison sentence for Thaci after a nearly three-year trial. Rama added, “At this moment, only a few months stand between a man who rose from resistance to ethnic cleansing to become a peacemaker and the potentially devastated outcome in a court that has so far failed at every step to uphold the standards of democratic justice.”

UN calls for scam centre clampdown amid ‘staggering’ abuses like ‘water prisons’, starvation

GENEVA – The UN human rights agency on Feb 20 called on governments to clamp down on scam centres
The agency released a report documenting torture, sexual abuse, forced abortions, food deprivation, solitary confinement and other abuses.
“The litany of abuse is staggering and at the same time heartbreaking,” UN Human Rights high commissioner Volker Turk said, calling on governments to act against corruption that was “deeply entrenched in such lucrative scamming operations, and to prosecute the criminal syndicates behind them”.
The UNHCR agency had already said in a 2023 report that hundreds of thousands of people were forced to work in the centres that other investigations have found are responsible for billions of dollars of online fraud.
The new report said satellite imagery and on-ground reports show that nearly three-quarters of the scam operations are in the Mekong region and have spread to some Pacific Island countries, South Asia, Gulf States, West Africa and the Americas.
Based on accounts from victims, the police, and civil society groups, the report said forced labourers had described being held in immense compounds resembling self-contained towns, made up of heavily fortified multi-storey buildings with barbed wire-topped walls and armed guards.
The report into forced labour at scam centres in Cambodia
“A victim from Sri Lanka related how those who failed to meet monthly scamming targets were subject to immersion in water containers (known as ‘water prisons’) for hours,” said the report.
“Victims also recounted being forced to witness or even conduct grave abuse of others as a means to ensure compliance; one Bangladeshi victim said that he was ordered to beat other workers and a victim from Ghana recounted being forced to watch his friend being beaten in front of him.”
A Vietnamese woman told how she was starved for a week after trying to escape.
People said that the police and border guards were sometimes complicit in the scam centres.
The UN said that many of the forced labourers were wrongly treated as criminals once freed.
The victims “require coordinated timely, safe and effective rescue operations, respect for the principle of non-refoulement, as well as available support mechanisms to ensure torture and trauma rehabilitation and address risks of reprisals or re-trafficking”, said Mr Turk. AFP

‘I have a crazy job’: Meet the architect of Trump’s war on the world

‘I have a crazy job’: Meet the architect of Trump’s war on the world
On January 26, 2025, Jamieson Greer was teaching Sunday school to a group of nine-year-olds when one of his phones started blowing up with calls from the White House. Six days into the new administration, President Donald Trump was already deploying his favourite weapon: the threat of crippling tariffs to bend countries to his will.
Greer would not join the Trump administration for some time yet, but he was already a key adviser on trade.
“Why do you have two phones?” a student asked him.
“I have a kind of crazy job,” Greer replied.
As the United States trade representative, Greer, 45, has been a powerful but behind-the-scenes force in transforming the global economy. Few have done more in Trump’s second term to put into practice the president’s vision of altering the system governing how trillions of dollars of goods move around the world.
Greer has provided the legal and policy framework to overhaul a global system Trump slams as unfair. He has helped the president raise tariffs to their highest levels in nearly a century while simultaneously leading negotiations with all of America’s biggest trading partners.
Interviews with Greer make clear that he is a true believer in Trump’s plan to use tariffs to revitalise the US manufacturing sector. He and other advisers have ushered in steep import taxes to try to protect manufacturers from foreign competition, coax more factories into the US and create more good-paying factory jobs.
It’s not yet clear those initiatives will work. Manufacturing employs less than 10 per cent of Americans, and the number of factory workers has been dwindling. While some manufacturers support protectionism, others say it raises their costs and makes US industry less competitive. Consumers are also concerned about tariffs causing price increases, and polls show Trump losing support for his handling of the economy.
Although Greer credits the president’s tariff threats with giving him leverage in negotiations, Trump’s penchant for brinkmanship has clearly added uncertainty and complications to how countries deal with the US.
This year seems likely to bring more tumult, as the Supreme Court reviews whether to overturn many of these tariffs. The administration is also preparing for high-stakes meetings with China, and negotiations with Canada and Mexico that could transform or dissolve the North American trade deal.
Greer is often seen as a source of stability in the chaos. A former Mormon missionary and military lawyer, he has quietly navigated the demands of an unpredictable president, other big personalities in the cabinet, and dozens of foreign leaders and company executives. Friends say he has followed the advice of his mentor and former boss, Robert Lighthizer, who served as the US trade representative in Trump’s first term: “You can get a lot done in Washington if you don’t care who gets the credit.”
Greer was set on a path towards his future role as the architect of Trump’s trade strategy by what he called a “serendipitous” interview with Lighthizer for a job in Washington at the law firm, Skadden Arps. Lighthizer said Greer had impressed him as someone with “brains and values”, and hired him in 2012 to help the firm defend US Steel and other American companies in trade cases.
That work gave Greer an advance look at what US industries would face in the coming years, as Chinese exports heavily subsidised by Beijing flooded global markets.
Greer saw the influx of cheap goods as a national security issue, but few agreed. That changed with Trump’s election in 2016, when Lighthizer became US trade representative and appointed Greer as his chief of staff.
Greer became Lighthizer’s shadow. To the surprise of foreign bureaucrats, Lighthizer sent the then-30-something Greer in his place to high-level meetings with the World Trade Organisation, South Korea and Mexico. Together, they waged a trade war against China and reworked the North American Free Trade Agreement.
The administration had done as much as it could in the first term, Lighthizer said, but since then, the country’s views on trade have shifted, and the president now has an even stronger mandate.
“The president is taking the next logical steps and Jamieson is the best possible person to implement it,” he said.
After Trump left office, Greer went into private practice. And when the president won in 2024, Greer helped compile lists of trade loyalists for the new administration and drafted a trade memo that the president issued on his first day back in office, which teed up the possibility of tariffs to address more than a dozen trade issues.
Lighthizer threw his weight behind Greer’s appointment. The decision was supported by Jared Kushner, Trump’s son-in-law, and others who thought the president would be better served by a trade expert in cabinet than another billionaire.
By the time Greer was confirmed on February 26, 2025, Trump was already wielding tariffs with abandon, in ways that were more chaotic than Greer might have preferred.
Out of all the options he could have used to impose tariffs, Trump chose an international emergency law that would let him immediately raise or lower tariffs, and keep them in effect as long as he liked.
But the law, the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, was vulnerable to legal challenges, which was one reason Lighthizer had not used it in Trump’s first term. Greer also saw it as more legally vulnerable than other options, but he had included it in the options he presented to Trump, and said Trump chose it because of its flexibility.
In February 2025, Trump used the law to declare inflows of fentanyl a national emergency, and to deploy tariffs against Canada, Mexico and China, the largest trading partners of the US.
In April, Trump used the same law to declare trade deficits an emergency. He announced sweeping global tariffs as high as 50 per cent, including tariffs of 34 per cent on China, a move that set off a trade clash that remains unsettled.
The trade representative’s office was immediately inundated by requests from foreign officials seeking to avoid the tariffs. That kicked off months of furious negotiations for Greer, who flew more than 160,000 kilometres in 2025 and sometimes met representatives of more than half-a-dozen countries each day.
Given the hurried timeline, Greer created a template of issues for countries to negotiate on. The resulting deals involved countries dropping their tariffs on US agriculture and industrial goods, and the adoption of other policies aimed at non-market economies like China.
Many of the agreements ended up vague and high level, reflecting the rushed pace of the talks. Governments would later clash with the US over the exact details.
Few have done more in Trump’s second term to put into practice the president’s vision of altering the system governing how trillions of dollars of goods move around the world.
Talks were also complicated by the fact that countries were subject to another set of national security-related tariffs that were the domain of Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick. Those tariffs affected sectors such as cars, pharmaceuticals and steel. Foreign countries complained that negotiations proceeded smoothly with Greer, but hit roadblocks with the Commerce Department.
Greer said in an interview that “tensions” was “not a word I would ever use” but acknowledged the national security tariffs had added “an extra layer of complexity”.
The coming year could bring more challenges for Greer.
If the Supreme Court strikes down Trump’s tariffs, Greer will be the one responsible for instituting other tariffs to replace them. He will also need to ensure trade arrangements struck with Japan, El Salvador, Switzerland and other countries don’t unravel if the tariffs that undergird those deals temporarily disappear.
With midterm elections approaching and concerns about affordability growing, it also remains to be seen if the administration walks back more tariffs.
Trump seems as insistent about tariffs as ever, and as impulsive in their use. Last month, he threatened tariffs against European nations unless Denmark gave him Greenland. The Europeans responded by angrily pausing work on their trade deal, which Greer and his deputies had spent many months negotiating.
Like Trump, Greer dismisses the idea that tariffs burden poorer Americans. He argues, instead, that the cost of tariffs is being spread through foreign supply chains, something many economists dispute. He also defended the idea of “managed trade”, saying that the more secure supply chains were, the less the government needed to intervene. “But we’re not really there yet,” he said.

A macabre dispute has kept the body of Zambia's former president unburied for months

A macabre dispute has kept the body of Zambia's former president unburied for months
A bitter feud in Zambia has left former President Edgar Lungu’s body unburied in a South African funeral home for more than eight months
- Bookmark
More than eight months after his death, former Zambian President Edgar Lungu's remains are still in a South African funeral home, the subject of a macabre fight between his family and the longtime rival who succeeded him.
A graphic symbol of the dispute: an unfilled, coffin-size hole in a cemetery in Zambia’s capital, Lusaka, where the current president, Hakainde Hichilema, had hoped Lungu would be buried in a state funeral. But Lungu, in his last days, told his family members that Hichilema, even as a mourner, should never go near his body.
The matter has gone to the courts, which have repeatedly sided with Zambian authorities over Lungu’s wishes. Lungu’s family persists in seeking a burial that sidelines Hichilema.
So the body lies frozen in South Africa, where Lungu died, while Zambia endures a scandalous saga that offends traditional beliefs and raises many questions in a country where it is taboo to fail to bury the dead promptly and with dignity.
Behind the impasse is a long-running feud between two political rivals. It also reflects a spiritual contest between Hichilema, who is up for reelection in August, and Lungu, who is said to be fighting back from the dead, according to scholars and religious leaders who spoke to The Associated Press.
A spiritual battle
“It has shifted from the physical, it has shifted from politics, and it is now a spiritual battle,” said Bishop Anthony Kaluba of Life of Christ congregation in Lusaka.
Hichilema’s supporters see Lungu’s will as casting a curse, while they say a state funeral attended by Hichilema would be an act of generosity toward Lungu and his family.
The fight over a corpse can seem bizarre to others, but Lungu’s directive resonates with many Zambians.
Some have barred their enemies from attending their funerals, often blaming them for misfortune. Those quarrels are usually more private, not like the public drama of a former president who, facing death, retaliates against his rival in the harsh language of his ancestors.
Across Africa, last words are a “vital force” to enhance life or block it, said Chammah J. Kaunda, a Zambian professor of African Pentecostal theology who serves as academic dean of the Oxford Center for Mission Studies.
Elders facing death can impose curses or give blessings, and Lungu’s case shows that curses “can acquire a life of their own,” he said.
A vibrant democracy with traditional beliefs
Zambia is a vibrant democracy. Its founding president was the genial, handkerchief-waving Kenneth Kaunda, who was voted out of power in 1991, despite his status as an independence hero.
Like Kaunda, subsequent presidents have been civilians lacking the military strength of various authoritarians elsewhere in Africa, giving Zambia’s presidential hopefuls the opportunity to run on their own merits.
Even so, there’s a perception that some political leaders — like many of their compatriots — worry they might be bewitched. The feeling is widespread in a country where traditional religion thrives alongside Christianity, and a spoken curse is dreaded by many as spiritually enforceable if provoked by injustice.
“It is a weapon,” said Herbert Sinyangwe of WayLife Ministries in Lusaka. “We believe in our culture that curses work.”
In the case of three recent presidents — Michael Sata, Lungu and Hichilema — suspicion was rampant. The official presidential residence is now thought by many to be under a deadly spell because all the six former presidents are now dead. Hichilema works there but sleeps elsewhere.
Sata, who was president from 2011 to 2014, worried that Hichilema, then an opposition figure, was victimizing him even as he asserted that charms from his own region were stronger. Zambian authorities last year had two men convicted and jailed for allegedly plotting to kill the president by magic. Lungu’s family doesn’t trust Hichilema.
An empty tomb
The spot in Lusaka that would be Lungu’s tomb was quickly dug and built before it was known that Lungu’s family had objections, said cemetery caretaker Allen Banda. He warned that a tomb without a corpse was akin to digging “your own grave.”
“If nobody goes there, culturally it’s your body that’s going to go there,” he said.
That Hichilema is willing to risk public anger in opposing Lungu’s family has reinforced the views of those who see a spiritual battle between him and Lungu.
“On the one hand, nearly everything done by the Lungu family so far seems to have been designed to deny Hichilema access to Lungu’s body,” said Sishuwa Sishuwa, a Zambian historian who is a visiting scholar at Harvard. “On the other, Hichilema’s conduct so far suggests that he will do whatever it takes to secure access to Lungu’s corpse, perhaps because the president sees the issue as a matter of life and death.”
Lungu died June 5, 2025, after surgery-related complications. He was 68, and was treated for a narrowing of the esophagus.
A fight in court
To organize a state funeral, Zambian authorities would need to take custody of Lungu’s remains until they were interred. But Lungu’s family resisted Hichilema’s plans during negotiations over funeral proceedings.
They preferred to transport the corpse by private charter and had hoped to keep it at Lungu’s residence at night. They picked three people to look after it during the state funeral that never happened.
When Lungu’s family concluded that their wishes were not likely to be followed, they opted for a private funeral in South Africa. They were moving ahead with that ceremony when they found out that Zambian authorities had blocked it.
A South African court ruled in August that Zambian authorities could take Lungu’s body home for burial.
Bertha Lungu, the former president’s sister, was inconsolable in the courtroom after the ruling, wailing and cursing at Mulilo Kabesha, Zambia’s attorney general, who said it was time to take the corpse home. She asserted that Hichilema wanted the corpse for ritual purposes.
Hichilema denies malice toward Lungu, and has said his Christian faith forbids belief in traditional religion.
A bitter rivalry
Lungu rose to power after Sata’s death in 2014. Sata’s vice president, Guy Scott, was ineligible to seek the presidency in a 2015 vote and Lungu was picked to finish Sata’s term.
His main opponent was Hichilema, a wealthy businessman. It was a close race — Lungu won by under 28,000 votes.
After the 2016 election, won again by Lungu, Hichilema faced treason charges and was jailed for four months for allegedly failing to yield to the presidential motorcade.
Five years later, Lungu lost to Hichilema and said he would retire from politics. He changed his mind in 2023, and Zambian authorities withdrew Lungu’s retirement benefits.
Lungu faced more pressure after his wife and daughter were arrested in 2024 over fraud allegations tied to property acquisition.
When he fell sick, Lungu found it hard to leave Zambia. The government restricted his travels. He managed to slip away to South Africa early in 2025, buying a ticket at the airport counter. The incident was reported by the local press as a security lapse over which an airport manager was fired.
Lungu is “still influencing our politics from the grave,” said Emmanuel Mwamba, a Zambian diplomat who speaks for Lungu’s party. “His issues remain. How he was treated in life and how he was treated in death.”

Venezuelan parliament unanimously passes amnesty law
France

15:33:12 KST

Venezuela's National Assembly on Thursday, February 19, unanimously approved a long-awaited amnesty law that could free hundreds of political prisoners jailed for being government detractors. But the law excludes those who have been prosecuted or convicted of promoting military action against the country – which could include opposition leaders like Nobel Peace Prize winner Maria Corina Machado, who has been accused by the ruling party of calling for international intervention like the one that ousted former president Nicolas Maduro.
The bill was signed by interim president Delcy Rodriguez, who pushed for the legislation under pressure from Washington, after she rose to power following Maduro's capture during a US military raid on January 3. "One must know how to ask for forgiveness and one must also know how to receive forgiveness," Rodriguez said at the Miraflores presidential palace in the capital Caracas, after signing the bill into law.
In one of the first releases after the bill passed, Machado ally and former National Assembly vice president Juan Pablo Guanipa announced his release from detention after about nine months in prison and under house arrest. "After 10 months in hiding and almost nine months of unjust imprisonment, I confirm that I am now completely free," Guanipa wrote on social media, posting an image of him holding the country's flag.
He called for all other political prisoners to be freed and exiles allowed to return, criticizing the law as not an amnesty but a "flawed document" that excludes some Venezuelans who remain behind bars. "I thank all Venezuelans for fighting for my release and that of all political prisoners," he wrote.
The law is meant to apply retroactively to 1999 – including the coup against previous leader Hugo Chavez, the 2002 oil strike and the 2024 riots against Maduro's disputed reelection – giving hope to families that loved ones will finally come home.
Some fear, however, the law could be used by the government to pardon its own and selectively deny freedom to real prisoners of conscience. Article 9 of the bill lists those excluded from amnesty as "persons who are being prosecuted or may be convicted for promoting, instigating, soliciting, invoking, favoring, facilitating, financing or participating in armed actions or the use of force against the people, sovereignty, and territorial integrity" of Venezuela "by foreign states, corporations or individuals."
Venezuela's National Assembly had delayed several sittings meant to pass the amnesty bill. "The scope of the law must be restricted to victims of human rights violations and expressly exclude those accused of serious human rights violations and crimes against humanity, including state, paramilitary and non-state actors," UN human rights experts said in a statement from Geneva Thursday.
Genuine will?
Hundreds, perhaps thousands, of Venezuelans have been jailed in recent years over plots, real or imagined, to overthrow the government of Rodriguez's predecessor and former boss Maduro, who was in the end toppled in the deadly US military raid. Family members have reported torture, mistreatment and neglected health problems among the inmates.
The NGO Foro Penal says about 450 prisoners have been released since Maduro's ouster, but more than 600 others remain behind bars. Family members have been clamoring for their release for weeks, holding vigils outside prisons. One small group in the capital Caracas staged a nearly weeklong hunger strike, which ended Thursday.
"The National Assembly has the opportunity to show whether there truly is a genuine will for national reconciliation," Foro Penal director Gonzalo Himiob wrote on X Thursday ahead of the vote.
On Wednesday, the chief of the US military command responsible for strikes on alleged drug-smuggling boats off South America held talks in Caracas with Rodriguez and top ministers Vladimir Padrino (defense) and Diosdado Cabello (interior). All three were staunch Maduro backers who for years echoed his "anti-imperialist" rhetoric.
Rodriguez's interim government has been governing with US President Donald Trump's consent, provided she grants access to Venezuela's vast oil resources.

'Extraordinary Threat' - Trump Extends Sanctions on Russia Over Ukraine War by One Year

The US President Donald Trump has extended sanctions against Russia for another year, citing Moscow’s annexation of Crimea, its war in Donbas, and its full-scale invasion of Ukraine.
A presidential notice dated Feb. 18 - set for publication in the Federal Register on Feb. 20 - ensures the measures remain in force beyond March 6, 2026.

“I am continuing for 1 year the national emergency declared in Executive Order 13660,” the document states.
The sanctions regime was first introduced in 2014 under the Obama administration in response to Russia’s illegal annexation of Crimea. It has since been expanded through subsequent executive orders.
In its latest notification, the US government said Russia’s actions continue to pose “an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security and foreign policy” of the United States.
Executive Order 13660 forms the legal foundation of Washington’s sanctions architecture against Moscow. Additional measures - including Executive Orders 14065 and 14068 issued in 2022 - broadened restrictions following the launch of Russia’s full-scale invasion.
The sanctions include personal measures targeting:
- associates of Russian President Vladimir Putin, oligarchs and senior officials;
- sectoral restrictions limiting access to Western technology, capital and energy equipment;
- bans on the import and export of strategic goods;
- and constraints on transactions involving Russian sovereign debt.
Russian Decision Is a Betrayal: Ukrainian Paralympics Chief
The annual renewal is required to prevent the restrictions from expiring automatically.
According to United24, sanctions pressure has pushed Russia’s trade exposure to its lowest level in more than three decades, with figures comparable to the final years of the Soviet Union.
Exports accounted for 17.8% of Russia’s GDP in 2025, down from 22.2% the previous year, while imports fell from 17.8% to 15.2%.
Economist Olga Belenkaya of Finam described the export share as an “absolute minimum” in modern Russian history.
The European Union’s sanctions envoy also said Western measures are having a “significant impact” on the Russian economy.
David O’Sullivan, the EU’s special envoy for sanctions, cautioned that restrictions are “not a silver bullet” and remain vulnerable to circumvention, but added that he is increasingly confident they are weakening Russia’s economic foundations.
Meanwhile, two intelligence officials told Reuters that Moscow is attempting to separate peace negotiations into two tracks - one focused on ending the war and another on bilateral economic cooperation with the US, potentially including sanctions relief.
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has previously said intelligence indicated US and Russian negotiators discussed potential cooperation deals worth up to $12 trillion, allegedly proposed by Russian envoy Kirill Dmitriev.
European officials suggested such proposals could be designed to appeal both to US political leadership and to sanctioned Russian business elites.
Despite intensive diplomacy, European intelligence leaders told Reuters they see little sign that Moscow is prepared to compromise on its core objectives in the near term.
One official described Russia as resilient, while another warned of significant financial risks in the second half of 2026, citing limited access to capital markets, high borrowing costs and the shrinking liquid portion of Russia’s sovereign wealth fund.

Trump says he's ordering release of data on UFOs and aliens

U.S. President Donald Trump said Thursday he is ordering federal agencies to begin "identifying and releasing" government files related to UFOs and aliens, a move sought for decades by some Americans.
"Based on the tremendous interest shown, I will be directing the Secretary of War, and other relevant Departments and Agencies, to begin the process of identifying and releasing Government files related to alien and extraterrestrial life, unidentified aerial phenomena (UAP), and unidentified flying objects (UFOs)," Trump posted on his Truth Social platform.
While he did not specify whether classified documents would be released to the public, Trump added that the files should include "any and all other information connected to these highly complex, but extremely interesting and important, matters."
Earlier in the day the Republican president claimed that one of his Democratic predecessors, Barack Obama, had revealed "classified" information in his recent viral podcast remarks about the existence of extraterrestrial life.
"They're real, but I haven't seen them and they're not being kept in... Area 51," Obama told host Brian Tyler Cohen, referring to the top-secret U.S. military facility in Nevada at the heart of many UFO conspiracy theories.
"There's no underground facility. Unless, there's this enormous conspiracy and they hid it from the president of the United States."
Asked on Thursday about the comments, Trump told reporters that Obama "gave classified information, he is not supposed to be doing that."
The president did not specify what part of Obama's remarks were classified, but claimed "he made a big mistake."
For his own beliefs about aliens, Trump, 79, said "I don't know if they are real or not."
No evidence has been produced of intelligent life beyond Earth.
Interest in UFOs and UAP has been renewed in recent years as the U.S. government probed numerous reports of seemingly supernatural aircraft, amid worries that adversaries could be testing highly advanced technologies.
In March 2024, the Pentagon released a report saying it had no proof that UAP were alien technology, with many suspicious sightings turning out to be merely weather balloons, spy planes, satellites and other normal activity.

Trump orders Pentagon, federal agencies to release files on UFOs and aliens
US president’s announcement comes amid a surge of interest following comments on aliens by ex-President Barack Obama.
United States President Donald Trump said he is directing federal agencies, including the defence department, to begin “identifying and releasing” government records related to unidentified flying objects (UFOs) and alien life forms.
Trump did not specify whether classified documents would be released to the public, but added that the files should include “any and all other information connected to these highly complex, but extremely interesting and important, matters”.

“Based on the tremendous interest shown, I will be directing the Secretary of War, and other relevant Departments and Agencies, to begin the process of identifying and releasing Government files related to alien and extraterrestrial life, unidentified aerial phenomena (UAP), and unidentified flying objects (UFOs),” Trump said late on Thursday in a post on his Truth Social platform.
The move appears to stem from a surge in public attention following recent comments by former US President Barack Obama, who suggested in a podcast interview that aliens are “real”, but that he had not personally seen one, and none were being kept in secret government facilities.
On Sunday, Obama released a statement on Instagram, clarifying what he meant by his comments, which have since gone viral.
“Since it’s gotten attention let me clarify. Statistically, the universe is so vast that the odds are good there’s life out there,” he said.
“But the distances between solar systems are so great that the chances we’ve been visited by aliens is low, and I saw no evidence during my presidency that extraterrestrials have made contact with us. Really!”
Earlier on Thursday, Trump had criticised Obama for his remarks regarding aliens, telling reporters that Obama “was not supposed to be doing that” and implying that the former president’s comments bordered on classified information.
“He made a big mistake,” Trump said of Obama.
No evidence has yet been produced of intelligent life beyond Earth, and the Pentagon in 2024 released a report stating that it had no proof that UFOs were alien technology, most being spy planes, satellites and weather balloons.
Nevertheless, messages of support poured in swiftly on social media and from Capitol Hill following Trump’s announcement to release all documents.
“Thank you POTUS!” wrote Republican Congresswoman Anna Paulina Luna, who chairs a congressional task force on unidentified aerial phenomena.
“As the Chairwoman of the Task Force that investigates these subjects, we are incredibly grateful for you doing this! I look forward to going through all the footage, photos, and reports with the public!” she wrote.
Democratic Senator John Fetterman also voiced support during an appearance on Fox News, calling Trump’s decision “fantastic” and saying that “America and the world deserve this”.

Venezuela's interim president Delcy Rodriguez receives the amnesty law from the president of the National Assembly Jorge Rodriguez at the Miraflores Palace in Caracas on Feb. 19, 2026.
Venezuela's National Assembly on Thursday unanimously approved a long-awaited amnesty law that could free hundreds of political prisoners jailed for being government detractors.
But the law excludes those who have been prosecuted or convicted of promoting military action against the country — which could include opposition leaders like Nobel Peace Prize winner Maria Corina Machado, who has been accused by the ruling party of calling for international intervention like the one that ousted former president Nicolas Maduro.
The bill was signed by interim president Delcy Rodriguez, who pushed for the legislation under pressure from Washington, after she rose to power following Maduro's capture during a U.S. military raid on January 3.
"One must know how to ask for forgiveness and one must also know how to receive forgiveness," Rodriguez said at the Miraflores presidential palace in the capital Caracas, after signing the bill into law.
In one of the first releases after the bill passed, Machado ally and former National Assembly vice president Juan Pablo Guanipa announced his release from detention after about nine months in prison and under house arrest.
"After 10 months in hiding and almost nine months of unjust imprisonment, I confirm that I am now completely free," Guanipa wrote on social media, posting an image of him holding the country's flag.
He called for all other political prisoners to be freed and exiles allowed to return, criticizing the law as not an amnesty but a "flawed document" that excludes some Venezuelans who remain behind bars.
"I thank all Venezuelans for fighting for my release and that of all political prisoners," he wrote.
The law is meant to apply retroactively to 1999 — including the coup against previous leader Hugo Chavez, the 2002 oil strike and the 2024 riots against Maduro's disputed reelection — giving hope to families that loved ones will finally come home.
Some fear, however, the law could be used by the government to pardon its own and selectively deny freedom to real prisoners of conscience.
Article 9 of the bill lists those excluded from amnesty as "persons who are being prosecuted or may be convicted for promoting, instigating, soliciting, invoking, favoring, facilitating, financing or participating in armed actions or the use of force against the people, sovereignty, and territorial integrity" of Venezuela "by foreign states, corporations or individuals."
Venezuela's National Assembly had delayed several sittings meant to pass the amnesty bill.
"The scope of the law must be restricted to victims of human rights violations and expressly exclude those accused of serious human rights violations and crimes against humanity, including state, paramilitary and non-state actors," UN human rights experts said in a statement from Geneva Thursday.
Hundreds, perhaps thousands, of Venezuelans have been jailed in recent years over plots, real or imagined, to overthrow the government of Rodriguez's predecessor and former boss Maduro, who was in the end toppled in the deadly U.S. military raid.
Family members have reported torture, mistreatment and neglected health problems among the inmates.
The NGO Foro Penal says about 450 prisoners have been released since Maduro's ouster, but more than 600 others remain behind bars.
Family members have been clamoring for their release for weeks, holding vigils outside prisons.
One small group in the capital Caracas staged a nearly weeklong hunger strike, which ended Thursday.
"The National Assembly has the opportunity to show whether there truly is a genuine will for national reconciliation," Foro Penal director Gonzalo Himiob wrote on X Thursday ahead of the vote.
On Wednesday, the chief of the U.S. military command responsible for strikes on alleged drug smuggling boats off South America held talks in Caracas with Rodriguez and top ministers Vladimir Padrino (defense) and Diosdado Cabello (interior).
All three were staunch Maduro backers who for years echoed his "anti-imperialist" rhetoric.
Rodriguez's interim government has been governing with U.S. President Donald Trump's consent, provided she grants access to Venezuela's vast oil resources.

The Government has outlined the scale of uncrewed systems ordered and delivered for both Ukraine and the British armed forces, while declining to provide a detailed breakdown of long range one way attack drones on operational security grounds.
In a written answer to former Defence Secretary James Cartlidge, Defence Minister Luke Pollard responded to questions on how many long range one way attack drones had been ordered since 5 July 2024 for Ukraine and for UK forces.
Pollard pointed to a statement made at the Ukraine Defence Contact Group in October 2025, where the Defence Secretary confirmed that 600 million pounds had been invested by the UK during the year to accelerate drone deliveries to Ukraine.
He said that more than 85,000 military drones had been delivered between April and October 2025, against an annual target of 100,000 for the financial year.
Turning to UK forces, Pollard stated that the Ministry of Defence had taken delivery of nearly 10,000 uncrewed systems since July 2024.
However, he declined to provide further detail on specific types or quantities of long range one way attack drones. He said: “Due to operational security considerations, it is important to guard against the threat of adversary data aggregation regarding the specific detailed breakdown of UK military capability, including platform numbers and types, so would be inappropriate to comment further.”

Book compiles Ayatollah Khamenei decades of Ramadan guidance

A significant new publication titled Adab-e Roozedari, Ahwal-e Roozehdaran (The Rules of Fasting and Spiritual Experiences of the Fasting Person) from the statements of Leader of the Islamic Revolution Ayatollah Seyyed Ali Khamenei offers an invaluable collection of spiritual insights into the holy month of Ramadan, shared by one of the contemporary Muslim world’s most prominent figures.
Meticulously compiled by Alireza Mokhtarpour Ghahroodi, this work brings together a carefully selected array of sermons, advice, analyses, and exhortations delivered by Ayatollah Khamenei over a period of more than two decades, spanning from 1990 to 2011.
These addresses were originally presented to a wide range of public audiences—including Quran reciters, government officials of the Islamic Republic of Iran, Friday prayer congregations, university professors, students, and poets—all during the blessed days of Ramadan and Eid al-Fitr.
For readers unfamiliar with this central Islamic observance, the book provides a meaningful entry point into understanding Ramadan.
This ninth month of the Islamic lunar calendar is deeply revered by the world’s nearly two billion Muslims as a sacred time dedicated to fasting, prayer, reflection, and community.
The beginning of Ramadan depends on the physical sighting of the new crescent moon, which means its start date shifts each year and may vary slightly across regions based on local observations.
This year, in 2026, Ramadan began on February 19th in Iran.
Ramadan commemorates the month in which the Quran, Islam’s holy book, was first revealed to Prophet Muhammad.
Observant adult Muslims fast from dawn to sunset each day, abstaining from food, drink, smoking, and marital relations.
Yet Ramadan encompasses far more than physical restraint—it is a comprehensive spiritual workshop for personal and communal growth.
Each day begins with a pre-dawn meal called Sahari and concludes with Iftar, the meal at sunset that breaks the fast.
It is common to start Iftar with dates and water, following the tradition of the Prophet Mohammad (PBUH), and many gatherings bring together families, friends, and community members, reinforcing social and spiritual bonds.
The ultimate aim of fasting is to cultivate taqwa, or God-consciousness—a state of constant awareness that inspires piety, self-discipline, and moral integrity.
By restraining physical desires, Muslims seek to deepen their spiritual focus, purify their hearts, and empathize with those who regularly experience hunger and hardship.
Evenings during Ramadan are often devoted to special prayers, and it is common for the entire Quran to be recited in mosques over the course of the month.
The final ten nights hold particular significance, as they include Laylat al-Qadr (the Night of Decree), believed to be holier than a thousand months and marking the inception of the Quran’s revelation.
The month concludes with the joyous festival of Eid al-Fitr, a day marked by celebration, feasting, new clothing, gift-giving, and special prayers.
It is also obligatory to give Zakat al-Fitr, a charitable donation, before the Eid prayer to ensure that everyone, including those in need, can share in the festivities.
As Mokhtarpour explains in the book’s introduction, the compilation was guided by two central criteria: first, the content must focus directly on Ramadan, the knowledge and etiquettes of fasting, the practice of supplication, and the duties of believers from individual, social, and political viewpoints; second, the statements selected were delivered exclusively during the period from the eve of Ramadan through the end of Eid al-Fitr each year.
The book powerfully illustrates how the spiritual teachings of Ramadan extend beyond personal devotion to help shape an ideal Islamic society.
It repeatedly encourages virtues such as awareness of the deprived, care for the impoverished, kindness to orphans, and support for the vulnerable, while discouraging wrongs like wastefulness and extravagance.
In this way, the pursuit of goodness and the rejection of wrongdoing become hallmarks of the community.
According to the compiler, the unifying theme across all the discourses is the knowledge of pure Muhammadan Islam, drawn from the two everlasting sources for Muslims: the Book of God (the Quran) and the Ahl al-Bayt (the Prophet’s progeny).
Studying this book also offers a unique glimpse into Ayatollah Khamenei’s personal conduct during Ramadan.
As highlighted in the introduction, his traditions include emphasizing Quranic recitation gatherings, focusing on faith-based and ethical self-improvement, engaging in dialogue with diverse groups such as professors and students, participating in Friday prayers and among worshippers, underscoring the importance of the Nights of Decree and the days commemorating Imam Ali’s martyrdom, and reflecting on the state of the Muslim world while encouraging broad participation in International Quds Day rallies.
Published by the Islamic Revolution Institute of the Office for the Preservation and Publication of the Works of the Islamic Revolution Leader, the book is organized chronologically and includes a detailed subject index to support both casual readers and researchers in navigating its themes.
In summary, this thoughtfully curated volume is more than a compilation of sermons—it is a bridge to the profound spiritual and ethical teachings that define Ramadan.
By presenting Ayatollah Khamenei’s insights in a structured, accessible format, the book serves as both a practical guide and a source of inspiration for Muslims and non-Muslims alike.
It emphasizes how Ramadan’s principles of empathy, discipline, and community can transcend individual practice to foster a more compassionate and just society.
A timely and enduring contribution, this work enriches understanding and observance of one of Islam’s most sacred traditions.

Crews hope to resume efforts Friday to recover the bodies of eight people killed and one still missing in an avalanche in California's Sierra Nevada after days of dangerous weather that has hampered safe access to the area.
Six of the people who died were part of a close-knit group of friends who were experienced backcountry skiers and knew how to navigate the alpine wilderness, their families said Thursday. The three others who are dead or presumed dead were guides.
“We are devastated beyond words,” the families said in a statement released through a spokesperson. The women were mothers, wives and friends who “connected through the love of the outdoors,” they said, and were carrying avalanche safety equipment and prepared for backcountry travel.
The six were identified as Carrie Atkin, Liz Clabaugh, Danielle Keatley, Kate Morse, Caroline Sekar and Kate Vitt, and they lived in the San Francisco Bay Area, in Idaho and in the Lake Tahoe area. The families asked for privacy while they grieve.
The names of the other victims have not been released.
Two from the group of friends survived and were rescued along with four others, including a guide.
Avalanche warnings were set to expire early Friday, and dryer and milder conditions were predicted for the weekend, according to the Sierra Avalanche Center.
The slide is the deadliest in the U.S. since 1981, when 11 climbers were killed on Mount Rainier in Washington state.
The 15 skiers began their three-day trip Sunday just as warnings about the storm were intensifying. By early Tuesday, officials cautioned that avalanches were expected.
What the guides and their tour company knew about the warnings and why they pressed on is now part of investigations by local authorities and a state agency that regulates workplace safety.
Avalanche safety experts say it is not uncommon for backcountry skiers to go out when there is an avalanche watch or even a warning.
Blackbird Mountain Guides, which was leading the expedition, said the guides who were on the trek were trained or certified in backcountry skiing and instructors with the American Institute for Avalanche Research and Education. While in the field, guides “are in communication with senior guides at our base, to discuss conditions and routing based upon conditions,” founder Zeb Blais said in a statement.
California Gov. Gavin Newsom said some of his wife's “old family friends” were on the trip. The Newsoms have a home in Marin County, where some of the people on the trip lived. His office did not immediately provide more details.
“These were some experienced guides that were out there, and that’s what’s even more concerning and disturbing,” he said at a news conference Thursday.
Sekar and Clabaugh were sisters, their brother, McAlister Clabaugh, told The New York Times. Sekar was a mother of two who lived in San Francisco, and Liz Clabaugh worked for St. Luke’s Health System in Boise, Idaho, according to her LinkedIn page.
Vitt lived in San Francisco and worked previously at SiriusXM and Pandora, according to her LinkedIn page. The Kentfield School District sent an email to families Wednesday saying that her two sons “are safe and are with their father, Geoff, as they navigate this profound loss,” according to The New York Times.
Atkin lived with her husband and two children and was a former corporate executive and Division I Track & Field athlete, according to her leadership coaching website.
Some members of the group had ties to the elite Sugar Bowl Academy, a private boarding and day school for competitive skiers and snowboarders whose former students include multiple Olympians.
One of the victims was married to a member of a backcountry search and rescue team in the area, Placer County Sheriff Wayne Woo said.

Ukraine’s 2026 defence exports could hit ‘several billion dollars’, official says
Sign up now: Get ST's newsletters delivered to your inbox
KYIV – Ukraine could export several billion dollars of military goods and services in 2026 after authorising its first wartime foreign sales and is considering introducing a tax on those exports, a senior Ukrainian defence official said.
Earlier in February, the state commission handling related licences in wartime approved the majority of 40 applications from defence sector producers for exports of materiel and services, Mr Davyd Aloian, deputy secretary of Kyiv’s National Security and Defence Council, told Reuters in an interview.
Ukraine halted weapons exports following Moscow’s February 2022 invasion
At the same time, Kyiv poured resources into developing its armaments industry, particularly drones and missiles. Leveraging its vast battlefield experience, Ukraine has in recent years experienced a defence technology boom.
Asked about export potential for 2026, Mr Aloian said: “Taking into account ready-made products, spare parts, components, and services that can be provided, it amounts to several billion dollars.”
Overall, the potential is “significantly higher” than pre-war exports, he said.
But Mr Aloian, who is a member of the commission authorising exports, played down talks of an immediate export boom for weapons producers and developers.
Ukraine’s own military needs must come first, he said, as Russian troops advance in the country’s east and airstrikes hit towns and cities far from the frontline.
US-brokered peace talks are stalling due to Russian demands for territorial concessions.
Foreign interest
Ukraine’s allies have expressed interest in obtaining its cutting-edge defence technology, Mr Aloian said, naming Germany, Britain, the US, Nordic countries, three Middle East nations and at least one Asian country as among the keenest.
One of the Middle East countries, which has a long history of arms trade with Ukraine, is exploring opportunities in drones and heavy vehicles, Mr Aloian said, declining to name the country.
Priority will be given for exports to countries that are Kyiv’s strongest backers in the war, Mr Aloian said.
Kyiv also aims to prioritise joint ventures and other forms of cooperation with foreign countries to attract financial resources, create new arms supply chains to the frontline and have access to new technologies. That is more important than the simple export of ready-to-use products, he added.
Defence manufacturers have been pressing Ukraine to resume exports, saying it risks losing opportunities on the global arms market. Some have already created subsidiaries to operate overseas.
“There is no desire or goal to lock all manufacturers in here and just keep our own... There is an approach, and it is focused on making a system that prioritises the frontline and national interests,” Mr Aloian said. “And then come commercial interests.”
Ukraine is also considering an export tax for defence producers, he said.
While no final decision has been made, he believes this measure would justify for the state the decision to resume exports, as Kyiv could use the revenues to spend on its own underfinanced military needs.
Among the applications approved by the commission, none involve the export of ready-to-use weapons, Mr Aloian said, and the majority are aimed at reimporting arms to Ukraine for use on the frontline.
But some are related to equipment for the Ukraine-US FrankenSAM programme, which is developing surface-to-air missile systems by combining Soviet systems owned by Ukraine with Western missiles. REUTERS

UN panel aims for 'human control' of AI: Guterres

U.N. chief Antonio Guterres called on Feb. 20 for "less hype, less fear" over artificial intelligence as he said that a new expert panel aimed to "make human control a technical reality."
Guterres said the United Nations General Assembly had confirmed the 40 members proposed for the group, called the Independent International Scientific Panel on Artificial Intelligence.
"Science-led governance is not a brake on progress" but can make it "safer, fairer, and more widely shared," he said at the AI Impact Summit in New Delhi.
"The message is simple: Less hype, less fear. More facts and evidence."
The advisory body, aiming to be to AI what the U.N.'s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) is to global warming, was created in August.
Its first report is expected to be published in time for the U.N. Global Dialogue on AI Governance in July.
It aims to help governments discuss AI as the fast-evolving technology sparks global concern over job losses, misinformation and online abuse among other problems.
Guterres this month gave a list of experts he had proposed to serve on the U.N.'s AI panel.
"AI innovation is moving at the speed of light -- outpacing our collective ability to fully understand it -- let alone govern it," Guterres said Friday.
"We are barrelling into the unknown."
"Our goal is to make human control a technical reality -- not a slogan," he said.
"That requires meaningful human oversight in every high-stakes decision" and "requires clear accountability -- so responsibility is never outsourced to an algorithm."

D’oh! Comic books, wedding invites allegedly used to hide $15m Simpsons LSD haul
A Mornington Peninsula couple are accused of operating a $15 million LSD drug trafficking operation by posting the substance hidden inside wedding invitations and comic books.
Melbourne Magistrates’ Court heard drugs stamped with Homer Simpson prints led police to Kamini Joseph, 44, and her partner Denis Petrovai, 35, who were allegedly operating the trafficking scheme from inside their $5500 a month Mount Martha rental home.
Detective Acting Sergeant Jay Hinsley told the court police launched an investigation in August into a suspected international drug trafficking operation using Australia Post’s express service to distribute LSD to local addresses and international dark web buyers.
Hinsley said his team discovered parcels with LSD, MDMA and cocaine featuring the Simpsons character, in June 2024, hidden inside wedding invitations.
Soon after, Hinsley said police began tracking Petrovai driving a white Toyota Kluger and visiting a roadside postbox at Altona North. Police allege drugs were concealed in gold wedding cards found in the postbox.
Further drugs were allegedly found in parcels sent in September and October, with the couple also seen visiting an Officeworks to buy a laser printer, glue and staplers. Drugs sent in September were allegedly hidden inside other wedding cards, comic books and purporting to be from a man living at a Wollert retirement home.
During a search of the pair’s home this month, Hinsley said police found a drug lab set up across two rooms, with drugs stored in a fridge that also contained dog food for the accused woman’s beloved bulldog.
A bare-foot Joseph gave evidence in her own bail application, telling the court she needed to be released because of health conditions and sobbed at her conditions in custody.
Joseph said she had a nervous system condition, diabetes and long-COVID, which she was treating with medication including cannabis oil and Ivermectin.
Police opposed bail, arguing Joseph was at risk of committing further offences or interfering with witnesses, with $600,000 of cryptocurrency in 12 accounts still unaccounted for.
Hinsley said police seized 750,000 LSD tabs, believed to be among the largest seizures of its type in Australian history. Chemicals with the ability to produce a further 600,000 LSD tabs were also found at the home, the officer said.
This, he said, was akin to trafficking 125 kilograms of heroin. The total amount of LSD seized equates to 1.5 million individual hits, with a combined worth of $15 million, police said.
The court heard police also seized a computer that had encryption software that rivalled the army, about $45,000 in cash, a $50,000 cryptocurrency wallet and $250,000 in bitcoin in Canada.
“A large commercial quantity is 3000 tabs. We’ve seized 750,000,” Hinsley said.
“My taskforce only deals with the highest-level drug trafficking and I say this is among one of the most sophisticated set-ups out of residential premises we’ve ever seen. A pack and send distribution set-up in study.”
The court heard Joseph wanted to be released to live with her mother, who believed her daughter’s partner had won the money they were living on playing roulette at Crown Casino.
Defence lawyer Thibaut Clamart said his client had only become an interest to police during the raid on her home.
He said she had no prior convictions and was cooperating with police.
“Ms Joseph has nothing to hide,” Clamart said.
Petrovai is due to face court next week. He is charged with exporting a commercial quantity of a border-controlled drug, trafficking a large commercial quantity of a drug of dependence, possessing precursor substances, equipment and material to manufacture a drug of dependence and possessing proceeds of crime.
Joseph is charged with trafficking a large commercial quantity of LSD, possessing precursor substances, equipment and material to manufacture a drug of dependence, and possessing proceeds of crime.
Magistrate Leon Fluxman granted Joseph bail with conditions including a $100,000 surety, reporting to police three times a week, living with her mother, surrendering any passports, not leaving the country, abiding by a nightly curfew and that she not use drugs or the internet.
Fluxman ordered Joseph to return to court in June.

India chases 'DeepSeek moment' with homegrown tech models

Fledgling Indian artificial intelligence companies showcased homegrown technologies this week at a major summit in New Delhi, underpinning big dreams of becoming a global AI power.
But analysts said the country was unlikely to have a "DeepSeek moment" — the sort of boom China had last year with a high-performance, low-cost chatbot — any time soon.
Still, building custom AI tools could bring benefits to the world's most populous nation.
At the AI Impact Summit, Prime Minister Narendra Modi lauded three new models released by Indian companies, along with other examples of the country's rising profile in the field.
"All the solutions that have been presented here demonstrate the power of 'Made in India' and India's innovative qualities," Modi said on Feb. 19.
One of the startups making a buzz at the five-day summit attended by world leaders and top technology CEOs was Sarvam AI, which this week released two large language models it says were trained from scratch in India.
Its models are optimised to work across 22 Indian languages, says the company, which received government-subsidised access to advanced computer processors.
The five-day summit, which wraped up on Feb. 20, was the fourth annual international meeting to discuss the risks and rewards of the fast-growing AI sector.
It is the largest yet and the first in a developing country, with Indian businesses striking deals with U.S. tech giants to build large-scale data centre infrastructure to help train and run AI systems.
Another Indian company that drew attention with product debuts this week include the Bengaluru-based Gnani.ai, which introduced its Vachana speech models at the summit.
Trained on more than a million hours of audio, Vachana models generate natural-sounding voices in Indian languages that can process customer interactions and allow people to interact with digital services out loud.
The government-supported BharatGen initiative, led by a group based at a university in Mumbai, also released a new multilingual AI model this week.
So-called sovereign AI has become a priority for many countries hoping to reduce dependence on U.S. and Chinese platforms while ensuring that systems respect local regulations including on data privacy.
AI models that succeed in India "can be deployed all over the world", Modi said on Feb. 19.
But experts said the sheer computational might of the United States would be hard to match.
"Despite the headline pledges, we don't expect India to emerge as a frontier AI innovation hub in the near term," said Reema Bhattacharya, head of Asia research at risk intelligence company Verisk Maplecroft.
"Its more realistic trajectory is to become the world's largest AI adoption market, embedding AI at scale through digital public infrastructure and cost-efficient applications," she said.
Nanubala Gnana Sai, a MARS fellow at the Cambridge AI Safety Institute, said that homegrown models could bring other benefits.
Existing models, even those developed in China, "have intrinsic bias towards Western values, culture and ethos, as a product of being trained heavily on that consensus," Sai said.
India already has some major strengths including "technology diffusion, eager talent pool and cheap labour", and dedicated efforts can help startups pivot to artificial intelligence, he said.
"The end-product may not 'rival' ChatGPT or DeepSeek on benchmarks, but will provide leverage for the Global South to have its own stand in an increasingly polarised world."

US threatens to leave IEA if net zero focus remains

The United States has stepped up pressure on the International Energy Agency to drop net zero from its agenda, giving it a year to do so or risk Washington exiting the organisation.
Speaking on the last day of an IEA ministerial meeting in Paris on Feb. 19, U.S. Energy Secretary Chris Wright said the 52-year-old agency should return to its founding mission of ensuring energy security.
The Paris-based IEA was created to coordinate responses to major disruptions of supplies after the 1973 oil crisis, but it has broadened its focus to include renewable energy and net zero goals under Executive Director Fatih Birol.
"The U.S. will use all the pressure we have to get the IEA to eventually, in the next year or so, move away from this agenda," Wright said in a news conference, calling net zero a "destructive illusion."
"But if the IEA is not able to bring itself back to focusing on the mission of energy honesty, energy access and energy security, then sadly we would become an ex-member of the IEA," he added.
The net zero emissions target is crucial to meet the Paris climate agreement's goal of limiting global warming to 1.5 degree Celsius from pre-industrial levels.
But Wright, a former fracking executive, said there was a "0.0 percent chance" that net zero would be achieved.
Wright praised Birol for reinserting in last November's annual outlook a Current Policies Scenario in which oil and gas demand would grow in the next decades. That scenario had been dropped for the past five years.
But the report still included a scenario where the world reaches net zero emissions by mid-century.
In a closing press conference, Birol said the IEA would "continue to have multiple scenarios" that look at investments, capital needs and resulting emissions from all of them.
But he also said he had yet to talk to colleagues about what would go into the next annual outlook which will be published later this year.
Birol's current four-year term ends next year but Wright demured when asked who he would like to head the IEA, which has over 30 member nations.

Michael Oren: Israel’s historic Iran moment

Welcome to The Times of Israel’s Lazar Focus. Each Friday, join host diplomatic correspondent Lazar Berman for a deep dive into what’s behind the news that spins the globe.
Israel has never been stronger. Since October 7, 2023, Israel has steadily rolled back its enemies in Gaza, Lebanon, and Iran. A staunch friend of Israel is in the White House, and he might well launch a second wave of strikes on Israel’s archenemy in Tehran.

More from Lazar Focus
Or is Israel historically vulnerable? None of the adversaries it has taken on since the Hamas invasion has been defeated. US President Donald Trump is an ally, but both the Democratic and Republican parties have influential and growing wings that are hostile to Israel, if not antisemitic.
To make sense of this moment, one needs a grasp of military strategy, Middle East geopolitics, and the workings of the US-Israel relationship.
Michael Oren, Israel’s former envoy in Jerusalem and a leading Middle East historian, says that the post-October 7 wars represent “one of the greatest military victories in modern history, perhaps in all history.” However, it remains to be seen whether Israel can translate the military victories into permanent strategic and diplomatic gains.
On the potential for a US strike in Iran, Oren stresses the importance of missile defense for the US Navy, as Iran’s greatest achievement would be the sinking of an American aircraft carrier. He predicts that after Trump issued clear threats and put his reputation on the line, he is not going to back down and leave a legacy that could be compared to that of Barack Obama.
Looking at the future of the US-Israeli relationship, Oren notes that the US is going through domestic processes that Israel has no control over, but often uses Israel to score political points. Given those trends, Israel should diversify its diplomatic relationships, but there will never be a replacement for American support.
Oren firmly supports Israel moving off of US military aid and transforming its relationship with Washington into one of equal partners working together to develop capabilities.

Japan's PM reaffirms intent to sign peace treaty with Russia

TOKYO, February 20. /TASS/. The Japanese government's position on resolving the "territorial issue" and concluding a peace treaty with Russia remains unchanged despite the current state of bilateral relations, Japanese Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi said in her inaugural address to parliament.
"Although Japan-Russia relations are in a tough spot, the Japanese government’s position remains unchanged, aiming to resolve the territorial issue and conclude a peace treaty," she stressed.
The Japanese prime minister also criticized Russia's actions in Ukraine, calling for an immediate end to the conflict.
Since the mid-20th century, Moscow and Tokyo have been negotiating a peace agreement following the end of World War II. The main obstacle remains the dispute over sovereignty of the southern Kuril Islands. After the war, the entire archipelago was incorporated into the Soviet Union, but Japan contests sovereignty over Iturup, Kunashir, Shikotan and some other small uninhabited islands. The Russian Foreign Ministry has repeatedly stressed that Moscow's sovereignty over these territories, backed by international law, is not subject to question.
In March 2022, the Russian Foreign Ministry announced that Moscow was suspending peace treaty negotiations with Tokyo in response to Japan's unilateral restrictions against Russia over the Ukraine crisis. Moscow also withdrew from talks with Tokyo on establishing joint ventures in the southern Kuril Islands.

Argentina’s lower house approves Milei-backed labor reform after tense session
Lawmakers pass sweeping overhaul 135-115 amid nationwide strike and clashes near Congress, sending amended bill back to Senate for final approval
BUENOS AIRES
Argentina’s lower house of Congress approved a sweeping labor reform bill early Friday backed by President Javier Milei, advancing a key piece of the government’s economic agenda despite fierce opposition protests and a national strike.
The bill passed the Chamber of Deputies of Argentina with 135 votes in favor and 115 against after hours of debate.
Because lawmakers introduced modifications, the legislation will now return to the Senate of Argentina for final approval.
The session unfolded amid a nationwide strike called by the country’s main labor federation, the General Confederation of Labor (CGT), and a protest march by left-wing groups to Congress.
Clashes were reported near the legislative building, and several people were detained, local media said.
House Speaker Martin Menem hailed the vote as a historic step.
“This is not just another law,” Menem said in a post on social media. “Argentina begins to close a wound that had been open for decades.”
He described the measure as a modernization of the labor framework, arguing that the existing system had pushed millions into informal employment, discouraged hiring and turned formal work into a privilege.
“For years, every attempt at reform ran into the same interests that preferred to preserve their privileges rather than create jobs,” he added.
‘Savage bias against labor’
Senior government officials attended the session, including Presidential Secretary General Karina Milei, Cabinet Chief Manuel Adorni, Interior Minister Diego Santilli and presidential official Eduardo “Lule” Menem.
Opposition lawmakers strongly criticized the reform, calling it harmful to workers and small businesses.
Victoria Tolosa Paz, a deputy from the Peronist bloc Union por la Patria, said the legislation represented “a regressive step” and would not improve conditions for informal workers.
“It goes against industry, production and workers, and it has a savage bias against labor,” she told the broadcaster Todo Noticias.
After the article-by-article vote concluded, Menem declared the bill approved with amendments and formally adjourned the session.
The labor reform is a central component of Milei’s broader economic overhaul, which aims to deregulate markets, reduce state intervention and encourage private-sector job creation.
The Senate will now decide whether to endorse the revised version and send it to the president for enactment.

Paraguay's president thanks Trump for bringing ‘hope’ at Board of Peace meeting
President Pena says his country ‘ready to collaborate’ at 1st meeting in Washington
MEXICO CITY
Paraguayan President Santiago Pena on Thursday thanked US President Donald Trump for launching the Board of Peace, two years after Israel began its military offensive against Palestinians.
Among a small group of Latin American signatories, Pena praised Trump for presiding over the US-led initiative to intervene in Gaza and the broader region, thanking the Republican leader for “bringing hope again.”
During the Board’s inauguration in Washington, Pena described it as an effort to strengthen global stability and criticized what he called a broken international system unable to deliver solutions to global crises.
The South American nation, home to 6.1 million people, has firmly backed Trump’s initiative, although Pena clarified that Paraguay will not contribute financial resources to the Board.
“That’s why Paraguay is so proud to be a founding member of the Board of Peace. And we’re here to collaborate. Maybe we are not going to be the country that brings the most money or the largest security forces, but I think there is a lot that all countries can bring to the table to solve these issues,” he said during the meeting, and expressed support for Israel.
Initially conceived as a mechanism to stabilize and reconstruct the Gaza Strip after two years of sustained Israeli attacks and widespread destruction of infrastructure, the Board, viewed by some as operating parallel to the United Nations, has since expanded the scope of its mission.
“And today it is Gaza. Tomorrow it will be another crisis. There will be another conflict area in the world, but we need to solve each of these conflicts. And I really appreciate the leadership that you have taken, President. Paraguay stands ready to collaborate,” Pena added.
Other Latin American leaders aligned with US policy also joined the Board, including El Salvador’s President Nayib Bukele and Argentina’s President Javier Milei.
The Board of Peace was established within the framework of efforts toward a peaceful settlement in the Gaza Strip. It seeks to promote peacemaking around the world. Washington has said additional states have since joined the initiative.
A US-backed ceasefire agreement has been in place in Gaza since Oct. 10, halting Israel’s two-year onslaught that has killed more than 72,000 victims, mostly women and children, and injured over 171,000 since October 2023.
Despite the ceasefire, Israeli forces have committed hundreds of violations through shelling and gunfire, killing 611 Palestinians and injuring 1,630, according to Gaza’s Health Ministry.

'You cannot bury the truth in the sand': Families of Oct. 7 victims set up Tel Aviv beach exhibit

Eyal Eshel, father of surveillance soldier Roni Eshel, who was killed on the day of the massacre at the Nahal Oz base, said: “This installation is not a symbol, it is a cry: You cannot bury the truth in the sand.”
The October Council is campaigning for the establishment of a state commission of inquiry into the circumstances of the massacre. Its members have protested a move led by the Prime Minister’s Office to remove the word “massacre” from legislation commemorating the deadly terror attack.
During a recent discussion in the Knesset’s Education, Culture and Sports Committee, Yoel Elbaz, a representative of the Prime Minister’s Office, said that instead of the word “massacre,” the law should use the term “events,” similar to how the 1929 riots are referred to in Hebrew, “because memory builds resilience.”
“We don’t need to be reminded — we live October 7 every minute,” Eshel said. “But a state that tries to move on without investigating, without taking responsibility and without providing answers betrays its citizens once again. Only a state commission of inquiry will say who failed, who concealed and who allowed this to happen.”
Menashe Mantzuri, father of Norel and Roya, who were killed at the Nova music festival, said: “There are those who are trying to turn October 7 into just another chapter to move on from — without stopping, without asking, without investigating. But we will not let that happen. You don’t sweep a massacre under the rug, you don’t cover up a failure and you don’t silence the truth. A state commission of inquiry is not revenge and not politics. It is the minimum a state owes its families, the captives and the survivors, and every citizen who wants to know that tomorrow this will not happen again.”
Reut Recht Adari, mother of Ido, who was also killed at the Nova festival, said: “My Ido was not murdered only by terrorists. He was also killed by a system that collapsed and by leadership that to this day refuses to look us in the eye. When they try to make people forget the massacre, they are trying to make people forget us, our pain and their duty. We are here to say clearly: There will be no forgiveness without truth. There will be no renewal without a state commission of inquiry.”
Yoram Yehudai, father of Ron, who was killed at the festival, said: “There are those who think Oct. 7 can be whitewashed with spin, headlines and distractions. But we, the families, will not be silent and we will not disappear. Every day without a state commission of inquiry is another day of a cover-up, another day that endangers the lives of the next children. Ron will not return, but responsibility must be investigated and the truth must be revealed.”
The October Council said in a statement: “The installation is a painful reminder from those who paid the heaviest price in the deadliest massacre of the Jewish people since the Holocaust. Unfortunately, in recent weeks we have witnessed a systematic attempt to make people forget the massacre, to evade a genuine investigation and to avoid providing answers to the many unanswered questions that continue to accumulate. The full truth about all those involved will be investigated and revealed only through the sole legal, appropriate and relevant tool: a state commission of inquiry.”

NT hit-and-run driver avoids jail again after prosecutors appeal 'inadequate' sentence

Warning: This content is distressing and contains the names of Aboriginal people who have passed away.
A 25-year-old man who called his Aboriginal victims "dogs" and an "oxygen thief" has had his home detention sentence increased to two years on appeal.
In September, Jake Phillip Danby, who was 24 at the time, was sentenced by the Northern Territory's Supreme Court to five months in home detention and a 12-month community corrections order.
Danby pleaded guilty to charges related to failing to stop a vehicle at the scene of an incident, which resulted in death, after hitting two Aboriginal pedestrians with his car in Darwin's northern suburbs in June 2024 and fleeing the scene.
A 39-year-old man — known as 'Mr Whitehurst' for cultural reasons — died from his injuries in Royal Darwin Hospital when his family withdrew life support.
The NT's Court of Criminal Appeal judgement handed down on Friday said the offence at hand did "not involve criminal liability for causing the death of the person".
The incident was captured on CCTV, which shows bystanders rendering assistance and calling emergency services.
NT prosecutors filed an appeal after the sentence last year, following public outcry, saying the original 12-month community corrections order was "manifestly inadequate".
Three judges from the Court of Criminal Appeal in Darwin on Friday upheld the application and increased Danby's home detention period from five months to two years under an extended community corrections order.
That means Danby will now return to home detention. Delivering their decision, Chief Justice Michael Grant said Danby was also required to wear an electronic monitoring device.
The prosecution argued on appeal on 11 December that the text messages elevated Danby's crime to the aggravated level.
Prosecutor Pat Williams said a jail term of more than two years was required, given the seriousness of the offending and public expectations.
The lack of jail time triggered outrage from the victim's family and wider First Nations communities in September, who say it was inconsistent with the "tough on crime" approach of the Country Liberal Party government.
Matthew Connop, the deputy chief executive officer of the North Australia Aboriginal Justice Agency (NAAJA), told SBS News in September 2025 that Danby's text messages were shocking and racist.
"In terms of this case, it demonstrates the broader systemic issues that exist in the Northern Territory. You look at the comments and the language used by the offender, the racist comments and dehumanising comments. It's a total disregard for human life.
"NAAJA has been contacted by many Aboriginal people who have said that the sentence did not reflect the seriousness of the offending, nor did it value the life that was lost."
Defence counsel Jon Tippett in December 2025 argued that the sentencing judge had taken note of Danby's text messages and, while being appalled by them, gave them appropriate weight.
Tippett said Justice Sonia Brownhill had given his client a chance of rehabilitation and counselling, and he was abiding by his corrections order amid public condemnation of his actions.
Tippett also said in December 2025 that courts shouldn't sentence people on the basis of their stupidity or vile comments.
Danby was not in court on Friday, and Tippett declined to comment on the revised sentence outside court.
In the judgement delivered on Friday the NT's Criminal Court of Appeal further explained: "The sentencing Judge expressly acknowledged the vile and abhorrent nature of the respondent’s communications, but he did not stand to be sentenced on the basis that the collision with the victims was racially motivated."
NT Attorney-General Marie-Clare Boothby also came under fire over the Danby case, accused of not reporting a conflict of interest after it emerged he was her sister's stepson.
Boothby said in September 2025 that she never attempted to hide the fact Danby was an extended family member, and at no time was she or her office involved in the criminal matter.

Financial incentives for Turkish TV series energize exporters

15:07:57 KST

Culture and Tourism Minister Mehmet Nuri Ersoy’s recent announcement of financial incentives for Turkish dramas broadcast abroad has energized the country’s exporters.
Earlier this week, Ersoy introduced a program that will provide up to $100,000 per episode in support of productions reaching international audiences.
The country’s booming television industry already reaches audiences in 170 countries and attracts more than one billion viewers worldwide.
The initiative is designed to strengthen the global presence of Turkish productions.
Industry leaders welcomed the move as a strategic step that could accelerate growth not only in television exports but also in related sectors.
Şekib Avdagiç, President of the Service Exporters’ Association, described the incentive as “a timely and strategic measure” that could foster integrated growth across industries. He emphasized that the program could open the door to new promotional agreements between drama producers and brands, creating opportunities for cross-sector collaborations in fashion, food and beyond.
Kazım Taycı, President of the Turkish Exporters Assembly’s Food Industry Board, noted that production companies had already begun approaching them with partnership proposals. He said discussions with the Trade Ministry were underway to explore how part of these costs could be included within the scope of incentives.
Similarly, Mustafa Paşahan, Vice President of the Istanbul Apparel Exporters’ Association, highlighted the potential for Turkish fashion brands to benefit from product placements and visibility in international dramas. “We produce world-class brands, but global recognition remains limited. Collaborating with Turkish series could give us a major boost,” he said.
“Product placement could be integrated into the series, with even our factories appearing in the background. We plan to meet with Avdagiç, and we must seize this momentum,” Paşahan said.
In 2024, Türkiye exported more than 300 productions, generating revenues exceeding $500 million. With the new incentive program, industry stakeholders believe the sector is entering a new era — one that could see Turkish dramas not only expand their global reach but also serve as a powerful promotional vehicle for the country’s broader export economy.

ASX Runners of the Week: Recharge Metals, Cosmos & King River
Brought to you by BULLS N’ BEARS
Bull’s back on the menu, boys... and girls.
After a brief period of playing dead and toppy tech talk, the ASX has strung together two straight weeks of gains, led by the big boy miners, banks and a buffet of solid Wall Street earnings.
BHP’s copper arm has overtaken iron ore as its top earner for the first time, generating 51 per cent of earnings and helping deliver a stronger US$5.6 billion (A$7.9 billion) half-year profit.
Goldies are killing the pig, with South African giant Goldfields reportedly eyeing off Western Australia’s consolidating gold sector from atop its mountain of $2.5 billion cash at bank.
The US economy flexed unexpectedly, with January jobs blowing past forecasts, prompting the White House to crow about “defeating Biden’s inflation crisis” while the Fed’s minutes hinted at a longer pause on rate cuts.
The US economic dream is still holding up better than expected, pegging last year’s closing growth numbers at a zippy 3.7 per cent.
Factories are producing more, and recent data suggest businesses and consumers are still active. Hot inflation readings have pushed the Federal Reserve to shelve rate-cut talk, with policymakers signalling they need firmer evidence that price pressures are easing before lowering borrowing costs.
Perhaps the only dampener on markets this week is the never-ending ego battle between the US and Iran, which looks like it might finally spill over.
Trump is mulling strikes as the Islamic Republic of Iran flexes its military muscles alongside Russia in the Strait of Hormuz,
The channel that controls 20-25 per cent of the world’s oil and gas trade is looking increasingly like it could be closed for business, and not surprisingly, oil has jumped 2 per cent to close the week, as analysts warn of a spike in crude prices to $100 a barrel if war breaks out.
Our Runners roundup this week was awash with gold and a little lithium as the pack of juniors flashed their fancy new projects and fresh discovery stories at the RIU explorers conference down at Fremantle in Western Australia.
In a flourishing late finish, our Bulls N’ Bears Runner of the Week has pulled a Steven Bradbury to take out gold with a last-minute project acquisition.
RECHARGE METALS LTD (ASX: REC)
Up 123% (2.2c – 4.9c)
Finishing with a surge and living up to its namesake, the Bulls N’ Bears Runner of the Week is Recharge Metals, which inked a deal to snap up the Sunset Well gold project smack in the middle of Western Australia’s thriving Leonora district.
The broader tenement package covers 181 square kilometres and is located 10km east of Leonora township and within 100km of seven operating gold processing facilities, with good road access.
The prime WA real estate encompasses the flagship Prospero deposit, which already packs a shallow resource of 2.87 million tonnes at one gram per tonne (g/t) gold for a handy 94,500 ounces.
Despite its address, Recharge says no one’s poked a hole in the project since the 1990s. The gold at Prospero remains wide open along strike and down plunge, with the Prospero Shear Zone stretching a lazy 10 kilometres along strike, littered with old drill hits that have easily become walk-up targets at today’s gold price.
The company says only a handful of holes have dipped below 100m across the tenure, leaving plenty of promise for expansion and follow-up drilling.
Near-surface results include 36m at 2.73 g/t gold from 32m (including 16m at 5.39 g/t from 36m), while only a limited number of holes have tested below 100m vertical depth, indicating potential for extensions.
Recharge has secured $3.75 million through an accompanying placement and plans a $2 million pro rata rights issue to fund all foreseeable drilling at the new project.
The acquisition has easily recharged the company’s batteries in a location surrounded by some of the industry’s heaviest weights.
COSMOS EXPLORATION LTD (ASX: C1X)
Up 105% (8.1c – 16.5c)
Snagging second place on the week is South American lithium hopeful Cosmos Exploration, which has hit the major league through its private company EAU Lithium, partnering up with state-owned Yacimientos de Litio Bolivianos (YLB) to develop industrial lithium production facilities for the country.
The proposed development pathway hinges on major lithium producer Vulcan Energy’s VULSORB direct lithium extraction technology, over which EAU holds exclusive rights for use in South America.
The DLE technology, already tested on brines from several Bolivian salt flats, has the potential to unlock some of the world’s largest lithium resources in Bolivia. An estimated 23 million metric tonnes of lithium lies locked away within the country’s Uyuni, Coipasa, Empexa and Pastos Grandes salt flats, accounting for roughly 22 per cent of known global supply.
The government is obviously very keen to develop these assets as lithium prices bounce back into relevance, presenting a huge new opportunity for the Bolivian economy.
Cosmos has locked in an option to fully acquire EAU into the company’s broader portfolio of lithium projects back in December and this week, its shares more than doubled.
With lithium prices also doubling in recent months, dipping its toes into the Lithium Triangle and being parked right in the thick of South America’s brine bonanza is paying early dividends for Cosmos.
KING RIVER RESOURCES LTD (ASX: KRR)
Up 56% (2.3c – 3.6c)
Rounding out our runners is the locked-on gold junior King River Resources, which is dusting off its newest Mindoolah gold project 70 kilometres northwest of Cue in Western Australia’s Murchison belt – a region that’s spat out over 35 million ounces.
Historic mining at Mindoolah dates back to the early 1900’s and delivered an eye-watering average grade of 19.02 grams per tonne (g/t) gold for more than 5700 ounces.
Back then, miners were stymied by water and depth, pulling up stumps around 20 metres. They barely scratched what today’s rigs and algorithms are built to chase.
The ground spans about 100 square kilometres of prospective greenstone, much of it under shallow cover and largely ignored.
Management reckons the real source of the old high-grade reefs has never been subjected to modern geophysics, ultra-sensitive soils, or systematic drilling, meaning there’s plenty left in the tank.
There’s no shortage of walk-up targets either, with gold in rock chips and quartz veins marching along strike from the old Mindoolah pits.
Drilling in the 1980s at Excelsior clipped 4m at 9.3g/t from 33m and 4m at 8.85g/t from 32m, lurking beneath historic workings. The lodes didn’t stop where the old-timers did.
The new addition rounds out King River’s gold hand across Mt Remarkable in the Kimberley and its Tennant Creek ground in the Northern Territory, where gold and copper exploration rolls on.

King Charles' brother Andrew released after arrest over misconduct relating to Epstein

King Charles' younger brother, Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor, was released from police custody on Thursday evening after being arrested on suspicion of misconduct in public office over allegations he sent confidential government documents to Jeffrey Epstein.
Mountbatten-Windsor, who turned 66 on Thursday, had been questioned all day by detectives from Thames Valley Police. Earlier this month, the police force said it was looking into allegations that he had passed documents to the late convicted sex offender while working as a trade envoy.
The arrest of the senior royal, eighth in line to the throne, is unprecedented in modern times.
"I have learned with the deepest concern the news about Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor and suspicion of misconduct in public office," King Charles said in a statement.
A Reuters witness saw the former prince leaving a police station in Aylsham, eastern England, where he was met by a small group of photographers and television crews, just after 1900 GMT.
A Reuters photograph taken after his release shows him seated inside a car, appearing visibly shaken.
Thames Valley Police said later on Thursday that "the arrested man" had been "released under investigation."
'The law must take its course'
Although Buckingham Palace was not informed in advance about the arrest, Charles said the authorities had the family's "full and wholehearted support and cooperation."
"Let me state clearly: the law must take its course," the monarch said in his statement.
"Meanwhile, my family and I will continue in our duty and service to you all."
The king visited a fashion show in London on Thursday, making no further public comment.
Mountbatten-Windsor, the second son of the late Queen Elizabeth, has always denied any wrongdoing in relation to Epstein and said he regrets their friendship.
His office did not respond to a request for comment, and he has not spoken publicly since the release of more than 3 million pages of documents by the US government relating to Epstein, who was convicted of soliciting prostitution from a minor in 2008.
Those files suggested Mountbatten-Windsor had, in 2010, forwarded to Epstein reports about Vietnam, Singapore, and other places he had visited on official trips as the government's Special Representative for Trade and Investment.
He was forced to step down from that role in 2011 after his close links to Epstein first emerged.
"Following a thorough assessment, we have now opened an investigation into this allegation of misconduct in public office," Thames Valley's Assistant Chief Constable Oliver Wright said in a statement.
"We understand the significant public interest in this case, and we will provide updates at the appropriate time."
The arrest marks a new low for the former prince, who was forced to quit all official royal duties in 2019 over his ties to Epstein and was then stripped of his titles and honors by his older brother last October amid further revelations about their relationship.
Unmarked police cars
Earlier, six unmarked police cars and around eight plain-clothed officers were pictured at Wood Farm on the Sandringham estate in eastern England, where Mountbatten-Windsor now resides.
Thames Valley Police officers were also searching the mansion on the king's Windsor estate, where Mountbatten-Windsor lived until he was forced out amid anger at the Epstein revelations.
While being arrested means that police have reasonable suspicion that a crime has been committed and that the person is suspected of involvement in an offense, it does not imply guilt.
A conviction for misconduct in a public office carries a maximum sentence of life imprisonment, and cases must be dealt with in a Crown Court, which deals with the most serious criminal offenses.
Police have previously said misconduct in public office, which is a 'Common Law' offense and is not covered by written statute legislation, involved "particular complexities."
Giuffre lawsuit
In 2022, the king's brother settled a civil lawsuit brought in the United States by the late Virginia Giuffre, who accused him of sexually abusing her when she was a teenager at properties owned by Epstein or his associates.
The current police investigation is not related to this or any other allegation of sexual impropriety.
"Today, our broken hearts have been lifted at the news that no one is above the law, not even royalty," the family of Giuffre, who died by suicide last year, said in a statement.
In response to Mountbatten-Windsor's earlier arrest, US President Donald Trump said it was a "shame."
"I think it's very sad. I think it's so bad for the royal family," Trump told reporters. "It's very, very sad to me... to see what's going on with his (King Charles') brother."
Were Mountbatten-Windsor to ultimately face criminal charges, he would join a very small group of senior British royals who have formally been accused of offenses.
His elder sister, Princess Anne, was fined for speeding in 2001, and the following year became the first royal to be convicted of a criminal offense in 350 years when she appeared in court to plead guilty to failing to stop one of her dogs, named Dotty, biting two children.
King Charles I was tried for treason in 1649, towards the end of the English Civil War, found guilty, and beheaded.
The misconduct investigation is not the only accusation against Mountbatten-Windsor into which police are looking.
Anti-monarchy campaign group Republic has reported him over allegations he was involved in the trafficking of a woman to Britain for sex in 2010. Thames Valley Police said it was assessing allegations that a woman had been taken to an address in Windsor, where the former prince lived until recently.
US lawmakers have also said he should testify before committees in the United States over what he knew about Epstein.
Meanwhile, former British Prime Minister Gordon Brown has also called for a police investigation into the extent of Epstein's trafficking of women without proper checks by the authorities through London's Stansted Airport, saying this had been overlooked by previous inquiries into Mountbatten-Windsor.
Essex Police said on Wednesday it was looking into the issue.

Despite leading in votes, Netanyahu lacks power to form coalition - poll

Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s coalition is still far from the numbers needed to form a government, but a lack of a true opposition leader and public sparring among party chiefs is fueling shifts within the anti-Netanyahu camp, according to a Maariv poll released on Friday.
Even as Israel remains uncertain regarding the Iranian front and following the public uproar in the wake of the attack on two female soldiers in Bnei Brak, the poll found that the balance between the blocs remained largely unchanged.
Former IDF chief of staff Gadi Eisenkot, however, continued a steady rise, reaching a new high of 13 seats for his “Yashar!” party.
Other opposition parties also saw movement this week, but without the same consistent trend. The Democrats gained two seats to 11, Naftali Bennett slipped by one to 20, and both Yesh Atid and Yisrael Beytenu fell by one seat each to eight.
In Netanyahu’s coalition, changes were limited. Likud rose by one seat to 26, while Otzma Yehudit dropped by one to nine. Religious Zionist Party, Blue and White, the Reservists, and Balad all failed to pass the electoral threshold, the poll found.
When asked which party they would vote for if the following lists ran in the next Knesset election, respondents gave the following results: Likud 26, up from 25; Bennett 20, down from 21; Yashar! 13, up from 12; The Democrats 11, up from nine; Otzma Yehudit nine, down from 10; Yisrael Beytenu and Yesh Atid at eight, both down from nine; Shas eight, unchanged; United Torah Judaism 7, unchanged; Hadash-Ta’al and Ra’am both unchanged at five.
Blue and White (2.9%), the Reservists (1.3%), Religious Zionism (2.6%), and Balad (1.8%) did not cross the threshold.
In bloc terms, Netanyahu’s coalition stood at 50 seats (unchanged from the previous poll), the opposition bloc at 60 (unchanged), and Hadash-Ta’al plus Ra’am at 10 (unchanged).
Rising crime in Israel’s Arab society
The survey also examined public perceptions around the high number of murders in Arab society.
A majority of Jewish respondents (56%) said the main reason was a “cultural problem” within the sector, while a similar majority of Arab respondents (57%) blamed police inaction.
Overall, about half of Israelis pointed to cultural factors as the primary cause, 31% cited police inaction, 12% blamed restrictions imposed by the judicial system on police and security agencies, and 8% said they did not know.
Regarding handling violent demonstrations, 69% of respondents, particularly opposition voters (78%), said authorities should use the maximum force legally possible.
Some 17% said the events should be contained as much as possible, and 14% said they did not know.
The poll was conducted by Lazar Research under Dr. Menachem Lazar in cooperation with Panel4All on February 18–19 among 501 respondents, a representative sample of Israel’s adult population aged 18 and over, Jewish and Arab. The maximum margin of sampling error was 4.4%.

'Unprofessional behavior': NASA report rips into astronaut-stranding Starliner mission
Unknown

15:07:16 KST

NASA on Thursday released a sweeping report on Boeing's botched Starliner mission that kept two astronauts stuck on the International Space Station for nine months, detailing communication breakdowns and "unprofessional behavior" as the agency and its longtime contractor struggled to agree on how to safely return the crew to Earth.
NASA Administrator Jared Isaacman ripped into Boeing and agency leadership for their handling of the Starliner mission during a news conference timed with the release of a 300-page report detailing technical and oversight failures behind the spacecraft's first crewed mission, which concluded last year.
"Starliner has design and engineering deficiencies that must be corrected, but the most troubling failure revealed by this investigation is not hardware," Isaacman wrote in a letter to NASA employees, which he posted in full on X.
"It is decision making and leadership that, if left unchecked, could create a culture incompatible with human spaceflight," he added, echoing findings in the report's "cultural and organizational" section.
Starliner's technical failures kept NASA astronauts Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams on the ISS for nine months in a high-stakes test mission initially planned to last roughly a week.
On Earth, according to the report, Boeing and NASA officials sparred in tense meetings on how best to bring the crew home, with "unprofessional behavior" and yelling matches that countered the agency's norms of healthy technical debate and crisis management.
The report, completed in November and citing interviews with unnamed NASA officials, said "numerous interviewees mentioned defensive, unhealthy, contentious meetings during technical disagreements early in the mission."
"There was yelling in meetings. It was emotionally charged and unproductive," one official reported. "It was probably the ugliest environment that I’ve been in," another said.
"There wasn’t a clear path for conflict resolution between the teams. That led to a lot of frayed relationships and emotions," said another.
Boeing said in a statement that it was "grateful to NASA for its thorough investigation and the opportunity to contribute to it." The company, it added, has made progress on fixing Starliner's technical issues and has made organizational changes.
Wilmore and Williams, both veteran test pilots and astronauts, launched as Starliner's first test crew in June 2024. Five of the spacecraft's maneuvering thrusters failed roughly 24 hours into flight as it was approaching the ISS for an autonomous docking, prompting the crew to manually intervene.
The thruster issues were among four primary technical flaws Starliner experienced during the mission that set off months of debate and ground tests as "Butch and Suni" stayed on the ISS. They returned to Earth last year on a SpaceX craft after NASA opted to return Starliner to Earth empty.
"They have so much grace, and they're so competent, the two of them. And we failed them. The agency failed them," NASA Associate Administrator Amit Kshatriya told reporters.
Williams, now 60, retired from NASA in December, logging 608 days in space across three missions in her 27-year NASA career. Wilmore, now 63, retired in August after spending 25 years at the agency, clocking 464 days in space across three missions.
The report also describes a "fragile partnership dynamic" between NASA and Boeing, in which agency officials' concerns that Boeing could drop out of NASA's Commercial Crew Program influenced officials' decision-making on critical mission issues.
"This reluctance to challenge Boeing's interpretations and failure to act on engineering concerns has contributed to risk acceptance and a fragile partnership dynamic."
Starliner mission classified in most severe mission failure category
NASA retroactively classified the Starliner mission as a "Type A" mishap, the agency's most severe category of mission failure, triggered by factors such as damage to a spacecraft exceeding $2 million or a crew member's death or permanent disability.
Boeing has spent tens of millions of dollars on efforts to fix Starliner following the mission,. The company has taken roughly $2 billion in charges so far on the program since 2016.
But NASA last year reduced the contract's total value to $3.7 billion and cut the number of planned Starliner flights from six to four, as Boeing's engineering struggles inch closer to 2030, the planned retirement of the ISS.
NASA's decision to release a redacted version of its investigative findings was praised by former NASA officials and astronauts and marked a rare move for an agency office that has often sought to portray its collaboration with Boeing's Starliner unit as positive and constructive.
"It isn't easy, but if previous Admins had done same, safety & public trust would be higher," Lori Garver, former Deputy NASA Administrator and a key architect of the agency's commercial-focused contracting model, said of Isaacman's decision to release the report.
NASA's Commercial Crew Program seeded development of Boeing's Starliner and SpaceX's Dragon capsule. The agency has made an imperative of having two US vehicles for transporting its astronauts to the ISS in case one encounters issues.
The Dragon capsule has flown over 13 crews for NASA since 2020 with no mission failures, helping position Elon Musk's SpaceX as the US space program's most prominent contractor.
Isaacman, a former customer of SpaceX's Dragon program who spent millions of dollars commanding two private missions in orbit, has long been critical of Boeing and other giant government contractors involved in delayed and over-budget programs, a view that has been shared by the Pentagon. Isaacman's ties with Musk concerned lawmakers during his confirmation hearings.

Private equity firms are ‘cashing in’ on broken Send system, Lib Dems say
Lib Dems leader Sir Ed Davey has called for the Send sector to be given legal protections
- Bookmark
- CommentsGo to comments
Vulnerable children are being treated as "cash cows", the Liberal Democrats have said, as they push for the special educational needs and disabilities (Send) sector to be granted legal protections.
The party is advocating for Send to be designated as critical national infrastructure, a status currently afforded to essential services like health, energy, transport, defence, and water.
Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey criticised the current system, stating that "taxpayers’ money is being spent lining the pockets of private firms."
This call for reform comes amid reports that the government is considering reassessing children with Education, Health and Care Plans (EHCPs) upon their completion of primary school.
Further changes are anticipated in the forthcoming Schools White Paper, which is expected to introduce Individual Support Plans (ISPs) with legal standing for all children with Send.
Sir Ed, whose 18-year-old son John has severe disabilities, said: “I know what it’s like to have to navigate the bureaucratic quagmire of the Send system all too well.
“No parent wants to see their child’s education suffer while private equity firms cash in on a broken system.
“Liberal Democrats would introduce new protections to ensure taxpayers’ money is spent on frontline services for children, not lining the pockets of offshore investors.
“We cannot allow this rigged racket to drag on any longer. Our children and parents deserve better.”
The party also proposes to subject Send acquisitions to public interest tests under the Enterprise Act, allowing the Secretary of State to intervene if needed.
It argues this is necessary as a result of local authorities spending significant amounts on private providers, with public money being diverted.
Under the proposed protections, foreign firms would find it much harder to buy Send schools for profit, the Lib Dems said.
The party’s education spokesperson Munira Wilson said: “It is a scandal that our most vulnerable children are being treated like cash cows by offshore investors.
“Send provision deserves to be treated as essential national infrastructure, to ensure our children’s education is prioritised and prevent public money being funnelled away to offshore companies.
“The current system simply fails to prioritise the very children it is designed to help, all while private SEND providers rake in record profits and squeeze council coffers dry.”

Epstein's estate settles class action lawsuit for 35 million dollars, denies all wrongdoing

Jeffrey Epstein’s estate has agreed to pay as much as $35 million to resolve a class action lawsuit that accused two of the disgraced financier's advisers of aiding and abetting his sex trafficking of young women and teenage girls, according to a court filing on Thursday.
Boies Schiller Flexner, a law firm representing Epstein victims, announced the settlement in a brief filed in federal court in Manhattan.
The deal, if approved by a judge, would bring an end to a 2024 lawsuit filed against Epstein's former personal lawyer Darren Indyke and former accountant Richard Kahn, who are co-executors of Epstein's estate.
Epstein's estate previously set up a restitution fund that paid out $121 million to victims. The estate also paid out $49 million in additional settlements to victims.
Epstein estate refuses to admit wrongdoing
Neither Indyke nor Kahn "made any admission or concession of misconduct" as part of the settlement made public on Thursday, their lawyer Daniel H. Weiner said in an emailed statement.
"Because they did nothing wrong, the co-executors were prepared to fight the claims against them through to trial, but agreed to mediate and settle this lawsuit in order to achieve finality as to any potential claims against the Epstein Estate," Weiner said.
Weiner said the settlement would provide "a confidential avenue for financial relief" for Epstein victims who have not already resolved claims against the estate.
Epstein died in a New York jail in August 2019. His death was ruled a suicide.
In the 2024 lawsuit, lawyers at Boies Schiller Flexner said Indyke and Kahn helped Epstein create a complex web of corporations and bank accounts that let him hide his abuses and pay victims and recruiters, while leaving them "richly compensated" for their work.
The Boies law firm previously helped obtain $365 million of settlements with JPMorgan Chase and Deutsche Bank after accusing them of missing red flags about Epstein, once a lucrative client.

Editor's Notes: Why Saudi Arabia's crown prince MBS will never join Abraham Accords - comment
Unknown

We allowed ourselves to believe it. After everything – the sirens, the shelters, the grief that has no bottom – we allowed ourselves to believe that something larger was being built from the rubble.
When the last Israeli hostages came home, when the ceasefire held, when the guns finally went quiet enough to hear something other than the echo of the October 7 massacre, a quiet consensus formed among Israelis across the political spectrum: The Saudi deal was next. It was inevitable. It was the reward at the end of the longest, most terrible tunnel.
Boy, were we wrong.
The normalization of Saudi-Israeli relations, that enormous diplomatic prize dangled before us like a carrot on a stick for the better part of a decade, is not merely delayed; it is now in doubt. It is structurally, politically, and perhaps generationally foreclosed.
The conditions that once made it seem inevitable have not only disappeared; they have been replaced by countervailing forces so powerful and so entrenched that analysts are no longer debating when the deal might happen but whether the framework that would produce such a deal still exists at all.
Why did things turn out this way?
Understanding why requires us to dispense with the comfortable narrative that Saudi reluctance is simply about Gaza, or about Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman (MBS) needing political cover, or about American pressure not being applied forcefully enough.
Those explanations are correct to some extent. They are simply insufficient. The truth is deeper, more structural, and considerably more unsettling for those of us who spent the post-October 7 massacre years telling ourselves that Israel’s military transformation of the Middle East would ultimately be rewarded with the one thing it has always wanted: acceptance.
The architecture of the grand bargain was always predicated on a simple transactional logic: Saudi Arabia would normalize with Israel, and in exchange, Washington would deliver a mutual defense treaty, advanced weapons platforms, and civilian nuclear cooperation. Israel was the key that unlocked Washington’s vault for Riyadh.
That framework is now obsolete, because Saudi Arabia captured most of the prize without paying the price.
In late 2025, during MBS’s visit to Washington, the Trump administration finalized what amounted to a sweeping bilateral upgrade for the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, entirely decoupled from Israeli normalization.
The White House Fact Sheet on the agreement confirmed Saudi Arabia’s designation as a Major Non-NATO Ally, advanced the sale of F-35 fifth-generation stealth jets, and established what officials described as a “Joint Declaration on the Completion of Negotiations on Civil Nuclear Energy Cooperation,” the very civilian nuclear program that was supposed to be Israel’s bargaining chip.
Multiple senior Israeli officials have indicated that Washington explicitly dropped its long-standing demand for Saudi Arabia to recognize Israel as a prerequisite for the nuclear deal.
From Riyadh’s perspective, the change is not a setback; it is a masterstroke. MBS secured access to advanced American military platforms, nuclear technology transfers, and the formal reaffirmation of the US security umbrella without making a single concession to Jerusalem. The marginal utility of normalization has evaporated. The Kingdom already has what it came for.
The Saudi crown prince under pressure
The crown prince is governing under genuine economic pressure. Vision 2030, the ambitious modernization project intended to transform Saudi Arabia into a post-oil global powerhouse, is straining under the weight of its own ambitions.
The Saudi Finance Ministry projected a budget deficit of 101 billion Saudi Riyals (about $27 billion) for 2025. Independent analyses from the Arab Gulf States Institute suggest that if oil prices remain around $65 per barrel, which the US Energy Information Administration projected as a realistic trajectory for 2026, the deficit could balloon to $56b., or roughly 5.2% of GDP.
The flagship mega-projects are cracking. NEOM’s “The Line,” the futuristic 170-kilometer linear city that was supposed to house up to 1.5 million residents by 2030, has been radically scaled back to a target of 300,000 – triggering layoffs, contract cancellations, and humiliating headlines.
The Public Investment Fund, which anchors the entire Vision 2030 strategy with roughly $925b. in assets under management, was forced to mandate a 20% spending reduction across its portfolio and wrote off $8b. in project losses at the end of 2024. Saudi Arabia attracted only $32b. in foreign direct investment in 2024, despite a $100b. target, a failure so stark it led to the dismissal of the investment minister.
A leadership navigating this kind of visible economic retrenchment, a leadership whose entire legitimacy contract with its young population was built on the promise of transformational prosperity, cannot absorb the political cost of an unpopular foreign-policy move. Normalization with Israel is currently the most politically toxic option available to Saudi Arabia.
Saudi public opinion numbers don't lie
Before October 7, 2023, there were genuine signs of movement in Saudi public opinion. A Washington Institute for Near East Policy survey from August 2023 found that 43% of Saudi citizens supported establishing business and economic ties with Israel, even without formal diplomatic relations.
The Israel-Hamas War in Gaza destroyed it.
By November and December 2023, the Washington Institute’s follow-up polling found that support for informal business contact with Israelis had collapsed to just 17%. More strikingly, 96% of Saudi respondents agreed that Arab countries should immediately sever all diplomatic, political, economic, and other contacts with Israel. Ninety-six percent.
The Arab Barometer documents the broader regional picture across 15 Arab countries in 2024 and 2025, confirming that this decline is not exclusively a Saudi phenomenon. In Morocco, a country that formalized ties with Israel in 2020 under the Abraham Accords, support for normalization fell from 31% in 2022 to 13% following the war. The 2025 Arab Opinion Index found that 87% of citizens across the Arab world completely oppose recognition of Israel.
For MBS, these numbers signify a political threshold he cannot cross without provoking the kind of widespread, coordinated domestic unrest that jeopardizes the regime’s stability. This is exactly what he told American policy-makers.
According to multiple sourced reports, he explicitly cited hostile Saudi public opinion in rejecting pressure to join the Abraham Accords, insisting that normalization required a concrete, irreversible pathway to Palestinian statehood. Whatever one thinks of the sincerity of that demand, its political function is unmistakable. It is a wall that protects the crown prince from his own people.
There is a final, deeper obstacle that gets less attention than it deserves: the shifting regional power balance that has transformed Israel from Saudi Arabia’s natural ally against Iran into something more like Saudi Arabia’s most formidable competitor for regional leadership.
This should be a moment of Israeli-Saudi celebration. It is not, because in a post-Iran Middle East, the shared threat that bound Riyadh and Jerusalem together dissolves, and what remains is a question of who leads the region.
Israel, with uncontested multi-domain military superiority, is the obvious answer in kinetic terms. MBS, who views Saudi Arabia as the economic, diplomatic, and spiritual hub of the Islamic world, finds this answer unacceptable.
The response has been predictable and swift. Last September, Saudi Arabia and Pakistan signed a mutual defense pact explicitly mirroring NATO’s collective defense principles. Turkey is in advanced discussions to join the framework.
Saudi Arabia is negotiating the purchase of up to 100 KAAN fifth-generation stealth jets from Turkish Aerospace Industries, a deal that US officials have described as alarming – precisely because it represents a deliberate effort to build strategic independence from both Washington and Jerusalem.
The contours of what some are calling an “Islamic NATO” are emerging in real time – not as a response to Israel’s enemies, but as a response to Israel’s dominance.
Why MBS won't join the Abraham Accords
One final, underappreciated obstacle: MBS will never join the Abraham Accords. Not because he opposes normalization in principle, he might not, but because the Abraham Accords are irreversibly associated with the United Arab Emirates. The UAE took the political risk in 2020. The UAE built the commercial infrastructure, the tech partnerships, and the defense cooperation.
Lebanese commentator Nadim Koteich, the former general manager of Sky News Arabia, has written extensively about what he calls the “Two Middle Easts,” arguing that the UAE now holds at least a decade’s technological and economic advantage over Saudi Arabia, specifically because of its unencumbered cooperation with Israel’s start-up ecosystem.
Joining a framework architected by Riyadh’s chief intra-Gulf rival, a framework already branded with Abu Dhabi’s fingerprints, is not something the “king of the Middle East” can accept. Any future normalization will require an entirely Saudi-authored architecture, almost certainly anchored in the 2002 Arab Peace Initiative’s demand for an independent Palestinian state with east Jerusalem as its capital.
We wanted to believe the deal was coming. It was a reasonable thing to want, the notion that October 7’s darkness might ultimately produce a transformed, more stable Middle East, with Israel finally accepted by its most important neighbor. That hope was not naive; it was human.
But in the bleak light of 2026, hope that the Saudi-Israeli deal is imminent amounts to little more than wishful thinking. The Saudi-Israeli deal may not be visible from this vantage point.

Actor Eric Dane, who played the handsome Dr. Mark Sloan on the hit television series Grey's Anatomy, died on Thursday aged 53, his family said, less than a year after revealing that he suffered from amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, or ALS.
For 15 years, Dane played a plastic surgeon nicknamed "McSteamy" by female characters in the show. He also starred in the series Euphoria, and said after the diagnosis he would still return to the set for its third season.
"Eric Dane passed on Thursday afternoon following a courageous battle with ALS," his family said in a statement, according to People magazine and other media.
"He spent his final days surrounded by dear friends, his devoted wife, and his two beautiful daughters, Billie and Georgia, who were the center of his world."
ALS is a progressive disease in which a person’s brain loses connection with the muscles. It is also known as Lou Gehrig's disease after the Hall of Fame baseball player who died from it in 1941 at age 37.
"Throughout his journey with ALS, Eric became a passionate advocate for awareness and research, determined to make a difference for others facing the same fight," Dane's family added.
Dane's wife seeks to dismiss divorce petition
Dane and his wife, actor Rebecca Gayheart, the mother of their two children, separated in 2018 after 14 years of marriage.
But last March, just before Dane announced his diagnosis, Gayheart sought to dismiss her petition for divorce, People said, citing court documents.
Eric William Dane, the older of two brothers, was born on November 9, 1972, in San Francisco, to an architect father and homemaker mother, his biography on IMDB.com shows.
His first television role was in The Wonder Years in 1993, while 2005 brought his big break with Grey's Anatomy. His big screen credits include Marley & Me and X-Men: The Last Stand.

US, Chinese fighter jets face off near Korean Peninsula, report says
Aircraft monitored each other over Yellow Sea, no clash reported
ISTANBUL
Fighter jets from the United States and China were involved in a brief standoff earlier this week over waters near the Korean Peninsula, South Korean media reported Friday, citing military sources.
The incident followed a rare US Air Force operation, prompting China to scramble its own aircraft, according to Yonhap News.
Several F-16 fighter jets assigned to United States Forces Korea (USFK) took off late Wednesday from Osan Air Base in Pyeongtaek, south of Seoul, Yonhap reported.
The aircraft flew over international waters in the Yellow Sea, a strategically sensitive area bordered by China and the Korean Peninsula.
The F-16s reportedly operated in airspace between the air defense identification zones of South Korea and China.
In response, the Chinese military dispatched fighter jets to monitor the US aircraft.
No shots were fired, and the encounter ended without a clash.
Sources said United States Forces Korea informed South Korea’s military in advance of the flight activity but did not disclose details, including its purpose.
South Korea and US forces have yet to comment on the report.
A South Korean Defense Ministry official said, “The USFK, alongside our military, maintains a strong combined defense posture,” adding that Seoul does not confirm operational details involving US military assets.
More than 28,500 US troops are stationed on the Korean Peninsula under a mutual defense treaty between Washington and Seoul.

Special carpet produced for Selimiye Mosque

A specially woven carpet faithful to the original has been laid at the Selimiye Mosque, regarded as the pinnacle of Turkish-Islamic architecture.
Comprehensive restoration works launched in November 2021 by the General Directorate of Foundations have largely been completed. The mosque is set to reopen for worship with the first tarawih prayer of Ramadan, as final touches are being made.
Under the supervision of a scientific committee, each section of the mosque was meticulously restored. Structural reinforcements were carried out on the main dome and the lead coverings were renewed. Later, cement-based interventions were removed. Glass and wooden window frames were fully replaced, while decay and material losses in the original wooden shutters and doors were repaired.
Of the 264 interior plaster window panels, those replaced with flat glass or plexiglass during a 1983 repair were reconstructed in line with the original using a stainless steel structural system and bottle-bottom glass. Exterior elements made of white cement were replaced with water-resistant special mortar and stainless steel equipment. Reinforcement and maintenance of the four minarets were completed. Decorative painting and plaster ornaments in the main prayer hall and porticoed courtyard domes were also restored.
While most of the restoration has been finalized, work continues in the burial area, along with tile cleaning and landscaping.
Extra care for the carpet
The new carpet was woven in the Demirci district of Manisa, taking as a reference the mosque’s original carpet preserved at the Istanbul Museum of Turkish and Islamic Arts.
Produced for the mosque’s approximately 3,000-square-meter usable area, the carpet remains faithful to the original design and draws inspiration from traditional Anatolian handwoven prayer rug motifs. A prayer rug layout was preferred in the front section, while the main prayer hall features the original pattern woven in a tone-on-tone technique using “Edirne red,” the city’s internationally recognized color.
Mustafa Özkul, owner of Kalida Carpet, said they carried out a special project for the mosque, which architect Mimar Sinan described as his “masterpiece” and which is listed as a UNESCO World Heritage List site.
Özkul noted that the carpet was produced from 100 percent domestic wool and woven at a density of 729,000 knots per square meter.
“While the thickness of the carpet may vary, the number of knots per square meter matches the ratio and characteristics of the original carpet kept in the museum,” he said.

Turkish ‘kadayıf’ craze sweeps South Korea as demand surges across East Asia

Turkish “kadayıf” has emerged as an unexpected powerhouse in South Korea’s import market as social media trends and K-Pop stars transform the global "Dubai chocolate” hype into a uniquely reimagined sweet sensation.
Kadayıf is a traditional pastry consisting of finely shredded, needle-thin strands of crispy pastry dough.
In South Korea, the craze for the "Dubai chocolate,” filled with pistachio cream and crunchy kadayıf, has evolved into this new phenomenon known as “Dubai chewy cookie” and a pistachio and marshmallow product called “Dubai pistachio marshmallow ball,” locally known as Du-Jjonku.
These kadayıf-based sweets have gone viral on social media platforms, triggering an unprecedented rise in import requests from Türkiye.
Since June last year, demand has risen so sharply that Turkish producers are struggling with supply shortages, while major Korean food companies have begun visiting Türkiye to secure long-term contracts.
According to data shared by an Istanbul-based exporters' association, İHBİR, Türkiye’s kadayıf exports reached $145 million last year, marking a 40 percent increase compared to the previous year.
Meanwhile, figures from South Korea’s Food and Drug Safety Ministry show that imports of Turkish-origin dried food products — including kadayıf — rose from 9,098 tons in 2024 to 10,826 tons last year.
This surge in demand coincided with the Islamic holy month of Ramadan, intensifying pressure on supply chains as domestic consumption and export demand overlapped.
Many Turkish producers have faced stock shortages since mid-2025, said Nisa Özlem Şahin from a shipping company that specializes in East Asia routes.
"Korean buyers have intensified the competition by offering significantly higher prices, with some firms reportedly securing long-term supply agreements of up to two years or even purchasing entire existing stocks to dominate the market,” Şahin told daily Hürriyet.
Several Korean companies have also traveled to Türkiye to establish direct relationships with manufacturers.
According to Şahin, the number of Turkish producers actively exporting kadayıf to South Korea has reached 21.
As popularity grew, retail prices in South Korea climbed sharply.
Dubai chewy cookie, which initially sold for $2–$2.5, is now priced between $4.5 and $5.5.
Şahin noted that the main reason is cost: Key ingredients such as pistachios and kadayıf are fully imported.
İHBİR president Kazı Taycı noted that syrup-based Turkish desserts, particularly baklava and kadayıf, have gained popularity not only in South Korea but also in the United States and Japan.
To support this growth, some Turkish companies send pastry chefs abroad for training purposes, while others bring foreign staff to Türkiye, according to Taycı.

Live: Iran warns US bases, assets 'legitimate targets' if it attacks

Iran has warned that US bases, facilities and assets would be "legitimate targets" if the US follows through on its military threats and attacks. President Donald Trump has given Iran “probably 10 days” to reach a nuclear deal amid a massive US military buildup in the region. Follow our liveblog for the latest updates.
Trump’s terms ‘completely unacceptable to Iran’
President Donald Trump has given Iran 10 to 15 days to make a “meaningful” nuclear deal. But Barbara Slavin from the Washington DC-based Stimson Center says a breakthrough in the latest talks, which began in Oman on February 6, is unlikely since the US terms are “completely unacceptable” to Iran.
“The Iranians could postpone or have a moratorium on uranium enrichment for a few years,” said Slavin. “But they will not give up what they consider to be their right to enrich uranium on their own soil. That's something that they have always refused to do.”
Responding to a report that Trump is weighing an initial strike on Iran, Slavin says the US goal in Iran remains unclear. “The United States is not going to be able to bring regime change from the air. It's not going to be able to destroy all of Iran's missile facilities or its relationship with proxies. I'm very worried that groups like the Houthis will begin to attack shipping in the Red Sea again,” she said. “We will see other responses from other Iran-backed groups and this could rapidly escalate. Trump doesn't like long wars, so I hope he knows what he is doing.”
Iran warns US bases, assets 'legitimate targets' if it attacks
Iran on Thursday warned that US bases, facilities and assets would be "legitimate targets" if the United States follows through on its military threats and attacks.
Amir Saeid Iravani, the Iranian ambassador to the United Nations, made the remarks in a letter to UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres and the president of the Security Council that was seen by AFP.
President Donald Trump has deployed warships, fighter jets and other military hardware to the Middle East as he seeks to block Iran from building a nuclear bomb, something Tehran says it is not pursuing.
The letter cited a social media post by Trump on Wednesday, where he said the United States may need to use UK military bases, including one on an Indian Ocean island, "should Iran decide not to make a deal."
"Such a belligerent statement by the President of the United States...signals a real risk of military aggression, the consequences of which would be catastrophic for the region and would constitute a grave threat to international peace and security," Iravani wrote in the letter.
Yesterday's key developments:
US President Donald Trump said Thursday he believes 10 to 15 days is “enough time” for Iran to reach a deal. But the talks have been deadlocked for years, and Iran has refused to discuss wider US and Israeli demands that it scale back its missile program and sever ties to armed groups.
Iran has agreed to draw up a written proposal to address US concerns raised during this week’s indirect nuclear talks in Geneva, according to a senior US official who was not authorised to comment publicly and spoke on the condition of anonymity.

Turkish and Bulgarian geologists participating in Türkiye’s 10th Antarctic Science Expedition have launched a joint research initiative to uncover Antarctica’s geological history and assess its implications for future climate change.
Researchers are examining what they describe as Antarctica’s geological memory to understand how the continent transformed from a temperate landmass into a frozen environment over millions of years.
Göksu Uslular, deputy leader of the expedition, is working alongside Stoyan Georgiev, an associate professor at the Bulgarian Antarctic Institute, on geological fieldwork on Horseshoe Island, where Türkiye’s Antarctic research camp is located.
According to Uslular, the joint effort focuses on mapping the island’s magmatic history, which she said would significantly advance understanding of Antarctica’s geological evolution and the long-term effects of climate change.
“Horseshoe Island, located in West Antarctica, hosts rocks from different magmatic phases that bear the races of this long geological evolution,” Uslular said. “Jurassic-Cretaceous magmatic rocks are especially widespread on the island.”
Uslular said these rock formations offer important paleoclimatic evidence and help experts understand the large-scale glaciation process that began about 34 million years ago.
Georgiev said that he joined the Turkish research team to examine mineralization patterns on the island, adding that his fieldwork identified notable gabbro outcrops containing copper mineralization.
The project’s findings are expected to contribute to understanding long-term climate change by reconstructing past environmental conditions.
Samples collected during the expedition will undergo detailed analysis through international collaborations to refine the geological timeline of the region.

Greece seeks UNESCO status for tripe soup central to Turkish cuisine

Greece has launched a formal UNESCO recognition bid for tripe soup, a staple deeply rooted in Ottoman and Turkish culinary traditions known as “işkembe çorbası,” rekindling the long-standing "gastro-diplomacy" rivalry between the two nations.
Known as "patsas" in Greece, the soup is a cornerstone of late-night dining culture in the Balkans and the Levant region.
According to local media reports, Greek authorities have prepared a nomination file for patsas and submitted it to the Culture Ministry.
If approved domestically, the application will be forwarded to UNESCO for consideration under its Intangible Cultural Heritage framework.
This application has revived a familiar discussion between the two neighbors over shared foods and cultural ownership.
Many dishes across the Aegean basin are prepared in near-identical ways, reflecting centuries of intertwined histories under the Ottoman Empire.
These debates are often described as symbolic or “soft” cultural tensions, centering on heritage and representation.
Whether it is “baklava” or “yoğurt,” the question of "who owns the recipe" often sparks passionate national debates.
Historical records suggest that tripe soup has been part of Anatolian food culture for centuries.
Evliya Çelebi, a 17th-century Ottoman traveler, refers to tripe and trotters vendors while describing daily life in Istanbul in his renowned work “Seyahatnâme,” indicating the dish’s long-standing presence in urban cuisine.
This tension over culinary ownership extends beyond the Aegean.
A comparable debate involving Germany and Türkiye over “döner kebab” has persisted for years, particularly regarding standards, naming rights and cultural association within European regulatory frameworks.

Argentina’s president reiterates support for Board of Peace, offers to send peacekeeping forces to Gaza
Javier Milei also pledges support of Argentina’s ‘White Helmets,’ an agency responsible for providing international humanitarian assistance
MEXICO CITY
Argentine President Javier Milei reiterated his backing for the US-led Board of Peace on Thursday while offering to deploy peacekeeping forces in the Gaza Strip.
“We believe in diplomacy that takes risks to achieve peace. We believe in leadership that confronts complex challenges with determination, such as that of President Donald Trump, and we believe that the only peace worth building is one founded on the inalienable rights of man. The Board of Peace offers a framework to move in that direction,” Milei said during the board’s inaugural meeting in Washington, DC.
Argentina was one of the initial signatory nations to the Board of Peace, an international governing body established by Trump to oversee the reconstruction, stabilization and long-term governance of the Gaza Strip following the Israel-Hamas war.
During his remarks, Milei also pledged the support of Argentina’s “White Helmets,” or "Los Casco Blancos,” an agency under the remit of the Foreign Ministry that is responsible for providing international humanitarian assistance based on cooperation and community participation. Since its establishment in 1994, it has carried out actions in more than 80 countries.
"In this initial stage. Argentina is ready to contribute. We are offering the collaboration of our White Helmets. Our track record in peace operations is proven capital that we place at the service of the stabilization force,” he said.
Milei is deepening his alliance with the US and support for Israel as a founding member of the board.
He has consistently expressed his support for Israel and his admiration for Trump, describing his membership in the board as an honor.
“We need institutions with both the will and the capacity to enforce the rules. Lasting peace is not built on compromises that yield on fundamental principles; it is built on the determination to defend them,” he added.

Rising waters of Uluabat Lake reach homes in Türkiye’s ‘Little Venice’

After weeks of heavy rainfall across northwestern Türkiye, the water level of Uluabat Lake has risen by nearly 5 meters, pushing lake water up against the walls of homes and businesses in Gölyazı, a historic settlement popularly known as “Little Venice.”
Located in the northwestern province of Bursa, Gölyazı sits on a small peninsula that transforms into an island when water levels rise in Uluabat Lake.
Uluabat Lake is protected under the Ramsar Convention, an international agreement aimed at conserving wetlands of global importance.
It is considered one of Türkiye’s richest ecosystems, home to diverse fish species, aquatic life and large populations of migratory birds.
In recent years, prolonged drought and environmental pressures have caused the lake’s water level to drop significantly.
This winter’s rainfall, however, has revitalized the ecosystem and restored the lake to levels not seen since 2014.
The recent surge in the neighborhood has flooded coastal roads, pedestrian paths and many trees along the shoreline.
A bridge that connects the island section of Gölyazı to the mainland, dry in recent years due to drought, is now completely surrounded by water, with its underside submerged.
Local shopkeeper Mustafa Kesimci said the rising waters have added a unique beauty to Gölyazı.
“Last year, there was no water under the bridge at all — cars could pass beneath it,” he said. “Now, even small boats can’t pass under the bridge. When the wind blows, the waves grow larger, and visually it’s stunning.”
Gölyazı has previously drawn international attention after being listed among “Europe’s 30 most beautiful towns” by the Japan Association of Travel Agents.
Residents believe the renewed presence of water may boost tourism, attracting more domestic and international visitors.

Türkiye's U.N. envoy urged a permanent ceasefire and an inclusive political process in Sudan on Thursday, stressing that any resolution must be Sudanese-led to ensure lasting stability.
"Türkiye is gravely concerned regarding the ongoing conflict and the humanitarian situation in Sudan," Ahmet Yıldız said during a Security Council session on Sudan.
Reaffirming Ankara's support for Sudan's territorial integrity, he said Türkiye supports "Sudan's unity, sovereignty and territorial integrity, which we consider very important for the stability of Sudan and the whole region."
Pointing to the role of external actors in prolonging the fighting, he said, "We also note with grave concern the negative impact of foreign interference in Sudan and its implications on the continuation of the conflict, as well as the potential spillover risks it creates on the wider region."
"Türkiye is of the opinion that the most effective way for ending the conflict is dialogue and diplomacy," he noted.
Emphasizing the need for a meaningful outcome of peace talks, he said Türkiye believes "that this outcome cannot be achieved if the dialogue is not owned and led by Sudan."
Calling on international partners to support a comprehensive solution, Yıldız added, "The efforts of the international partners should turn into an inclusive peace process that will enable a permanent ceasefire, followed by a comprehensive political process and accountability."
He also noted that Türkiye continues to provide humanitarian assistance and urged the Security Council to prioritize the humanitarian situation and facilitate Sudanese-led dialogue efforts.
UN Sudan probe finds 'hallmarks of genocide' in El-Fasher
In another development, the U.N.'s independent fact-finding mission on Sudan said on Feb. 19 that the paramilitary siege and capture of El-Fasher bore "the hallmarks of genocide".
Its investigation concluded that the Rapid Support Forces's seizure of the Darfur city in last October had inflicted "three days of absolute horror", and called for those responsible to be brought to justice.
"The scale, coordination, and public endorsement of the operation by senior RSF leadership demonstrate that the crimes committed in and around El-Fasher were not random excesses of war," said the mission's chairman Mohamad Chande Othman.
"They formed part of a planned and organized operation that bears the defining characteristics of genocide."
Since April 2023, the conflict between Sudan's army and the paramilitary RSF has killed tens of thousands, and forced 11 million people to flee their homes. It has triggered what the U.N. calls one of the world's worst humanitarian crises.
The U.N. Human Rights Council established the Independent International Fact-Finding Mission for the Sudan in October 2023, to begin gathering evidence of violations.
After the RSF captured El-Fasher - following an 18-month siege - the council tasked the mission with probing alleged atrocities surrounding the takeover.
Its investigation concluded that thousands of people, particularly the Zaghawa, "were killed, raped or disappeared".
The Zaghawa is the non-Arab ethnic group to which Chadian President Mahamat Idriss Deby Itno belongs.

Do you remember your first crappy job? Today’s young people would wish for half your luck | Gaby Hinsliff

When Keir Starmer was 14 years old, he got a part-time job clearing stones from a local farmer’s field. At 16, Kemi Badenoch was flipping burgers and cleaning toilets in McDonald’s. Me, I waitressed at weekends from the age of 15 in an Essex pub owned by an ex-paratrooper with two formidable rottweilers roaming behind the bar, which was a life lesson all of its own.
But whatever your first job may have been, there’s a reasonable chance it combined the thrill of hard cash with several mortifying mistakes and a crash course in handling stroppy customers, taking criticism more or less gracefully and moaning about it only out of earshot. Though teenage starter jobs have been in decline for decades – for reasons varying from academic pressures on sixth-formers to the rise of side hustles on Vinted that don’t show up in official statistics – everyone still has to start somewhere, even if it’s now more likely at 18 than 14. But getting that start is becoming harder than it was.
This week, unemployment rates for 18- to 24-year-olds hit a high not seen outside the pandemic since 2015. School leavers are now competing for work stacking shelves or pulling pints with overqualified new graduates who can’t find graduate jobs, at a time when pubs, shops and cafes don’t seem to be hiring. Even those employers strong enough to have survived lockdown routinely complain that it’s getting too expensive to hire staff – especially young ones.
The Centre for Policy Studies thinktank calculates that it will cost 26% more to hire an 18- to 20-year-old by this spring than it did in 2024. That reflects government decisions taken for perfectly good reasons, including hiking employers’ national insurance to fund the NHS, plus two chunky rises to the minimum wage for the under-20s (now £10 an hour) in line with manifesto promises to level it up with the higher adult rate (now £12.21) over the course of a parliament. No matter how noble the motive, once it costs the same to hire four teenage Starmers as it once did to hire five, there are likely to be consequences. Yet until this week, when an internal Labour argument about whether they could be inadvertently pricing young people out of work spilled on to newspaper front pages, political debate over why so many young people don’t have jobs has mostly involved blaming them for being anxious snowflakes. Injury, meet insult.
So in some ways it was refreshing to hear the former minister Alan Milburn, charged with reviewing why record numbers of 16- to 24-year-olds are neither earning or learning, finally concede this week that this complex puzzle isn’t simply explained by a teenage mental health crisis. Anxiety, ADHD and autism diagnoses are rising worldwide, he told the BBC, but elsewhere that doesn’t seem to be driving teenagers out of work: our rates of young people not in education, employment or training (Neet) are treble those of the Netherlands. (Incidentally, Dutch teenagers have a significantly lower minimum wage than Dutch adults.) His review is now considering economic factors. At least everyone can now be honest about what may or may not be going on.
But with candour comes risks. The politics of watering down a manifesto pledge on the youth minimum wage would be hideous, and not just because it would be the latest in a painful run of U-turns. Dumping or delaying it would put Starmer in direct conflict not only with trade unions but with Angela Rayner, a more formidable political organiser than anyone in No 10.
Give an inch on minimum wage, meanwhile, and the fear is that business will try to take a mile, pushing to delay the rollout of Rayner’s broader flagship package of workers’ rights until the economy is stronger.
We have, of course, been around this block many times before. Every time new employment rights are introduced, employers claim they’ll cost jobs, and in a growing economy they often turn out to be crying wolf. But this time it’s not just the usual suspects howling.
George Bain, who led the low pay commission that pushed through the original minimum wage against considerable corporate opposition, now believes a rising youth minimum wage is pushing up youth unemployment. I’ve heard the same from other veterans of the era. Gordon Brown, as chancellor, set a lower rate for the young precisely to encourage employers to take a risk on people needing first jobs. If you’re a pub landlord choosing between a gawky sixth former with no experience who will need closely supervising, and a seasoned 27-year-old with good references, who would you hire? Especially if the older one needs the job to pay their rent while the younger is mostly trying to save up for Reading festival tickets.
For the lower rate also tacitly recognised that most under-20s aren’t wholly supporting themselves. Today, that’s if anything more true, with almost three-quarters of 19-year-olds and 61% of 20-year-olds still living with their parents, in homes where someone else probably fills the fridge. The vulnerable teenagers for whom that’s sadly not true, including those estranged from their families, meanwhile need the kind of intensive support that comes most reliably from in-work benefits.
Almost 27 years on from its introduction, the minimum wage has drifted from its original purpose of ending exploitation. The idea was to create a decent floor from which people could rise into better jobs, helped by a booming economy: it was never the sole lever for raising living standards. But as successive governments struggled to reignite that boom, the minimum wage had to do more and more of the heavy lifting. There was always going to be a ceiling on how much employers could reasonably afford to pay, and now we may be hitting it.
One cynical view of what’s happening is that the Treasury is privately prepared to see unemployment rise and some zombie businesses go to the wall in return for transitioning to a more productive hi-tech economy. If so, good luck selling that to a country that never voted for a re-run of the 1980s.
But in the altogether less dramatic event that ministers conclude they’ve simply got the balance wrong for young people, as one minister hinted to the Times this week, then any tinkering is best done under cover of a broader rethink of how working poverty has changed since 1999. The worst option of all, meanwhile, would be to plough stubbornly on with something everyone worries might be making young people’s lives harder, just to avoid the embarrassment of admitting that for once your enemies might be right.

Wood burning pollution leads to 8,600 premature US deaths a year, study finds

Air pollution from home wood burning is estimated to lead to 8,600 premature deaths in the US each year, according to research.
Just 2% of US homes use wood for primary heating. Another 8% burn wood for pleasure, aesthetics or supplementary heating, but combined they produce 21% of the country’s wintertime particle pollution.
Prof Daniel Horton, of Northwestern University, who led the new study, said: “We frequently hear about the negative health impacts of wildfire smoke, but we rarely consider the consequences of burning wood to heat our homes.”
Kyan Shlipak, first author of study said: “I was shocked by the percentage of particle pollution coming from residential wood burning. There were big evidence gaps on the continental US-wide air quality effects – where the pollution is, and who is most affected by it.”
The research team divided the continental US into 839,000 grid squares. Hourly pollution was calculated for for each square, once with residential wood combustion and once without.
Shlipak said: “We had the preconceived notion that residential wood combustion was predominantly a rural phenomenon, but we found that it has a substantial impact on urban and suburban populations in and around many of the US’s largest cities.”
Owing to cold night-time temperatures, wood burning also affected places considered to have warm climates, including Los Angles. In parts of the US, the wood-burning pollution is trapped locally by valleys and mountains. Examples include the Rocky Mountains west of Denver, the Cascade Range to the east of Seattle, and the San Gabriel mountains north of Los Angeles.
Next, the researchers looked at who was doing the burning and who was most affected. They found that particle pollution from residential wood combustion spread from suburbs with high rates of burning to affect people in densely populated parts of cities. This has environmental justice implications.
Shlipak said: “We were surprised by the result. Although people of colour burn less wood, they experienced higher exposure and greater harms from wood-burning pollution.”
The impact on people of colour was compounded by increased vulnerability owing to longstanding health inequalities.
Horton said: “Only a small number of homes rely on wood burning for heat. Facilitating a home-heating appliance transition to cleaner burning or non-burning heat sources could lead to outsized improvements in air quality.”
The UK also experiences the negative health effects of residential wood and coal burning.
UK wide, air pollution from homes that burn wood or coal contributes to almost 2,500 avoidable deaths a year. A recent study in Wales found that heating with a wood stove or fireplace tripled the particle pollution breathed by children at home.
Analysis of 26m home energy performance certificates found that 10.4% of homes in England and Wales had wood heating in 2024, and it is increasing. The charity Global Action Plan estimates that if trends continue, nearly 1m wood-burning stoves could be installed in the UK over the course of the current parliament.
The greatest density of wood stoves and fireplaces is in urban areas outside the main cities, including Worthing, Norwich, Reading, Cambridge and Hastings councils. This wood heating is predominantly in homes in wealthier neighbourhoods but spreads to cover larger areas, raising questions of environmental justice.
The UK government is now consulting on health warnings for new stoves and solid fuels.

France and Germany agreed to build the fighter jet of the future. Now they can’t agree who is in charge

France and Germany’s plan to build a fighter jet of the future, planned to come with a swarm of drones and a “combat communications cloud”, is collapsing.
Friedrich Merz, the German chancellor, said this week that the €100bn programme no longer worked for him. He insisted it was “not a political dispute”, but a technical one. France needs a jet that can carry nuclear weapons and launch from aircraft carriers, while Germany does not. However, the problems go back much further.
Known as the Future Combat Air System (FCAS), the programme was announced to great fanfare in 2017 by the French president, Emmanuel Macron, and then German chancellor, Angela Merkel. Spain joined in 2019.
The jet was meant to replace France and Germany’s existing fighters by 2040, equipped with stealth capabilities and surrounded by drones scouting ahead or drawing enemy fire, all sharing data in real time.
Europe already fields three competing fighter jets – the Eurofighter Typhoon, France’s Rafale and Sweden’s Gripen. Successive chief executives of the pan-European aerospace company Airbus have warned the continent must consolidate these projects. Yet the collapse of FCAS would do the opposite, with a British-Italian-Japanese Tempest project and a mooted Gripen successor already in the mix.
For a bloc that collectively spent €381bn (£333bn) on defence last year but struggles to turn that into military capability, the stakes are high. Threats from Russia are mounting and Donald Trump has told Europe it is time to pay for its own security.
But for years, the companies building the Franco-German jet have not been able to agree who is in charge.
Dassault Aviation, France’s storied jet maker, insists on leading the fighter part of the project. The family-controlled company and its chief executive, Éric Trappier, have fought to keep control despite opposition from Airbus’s German-based defence arm, the other lead partner on the project.
A former senior French official, who asked to remain anonymous, said the project appeared to have been conceived “at a very high political level”, without wider discussions in the ministry of defence about whether the countries had the same needs. “We do not have the same way of doing war, Germany and France,” they said. “I was quite troubled by this.”
An unwilling Dassault
Trappier made the company’s position clear at a factory inauguration last year. “If they [the Germans] want to do it on their own, let them do it on their own,” he told reporters. “We know how to do everything from A to Z.”
The Rafale remains hugely successful on the export market, with orders stretching into the mid-2030s, underscoring Dassault’s leverage over the other players – including the French government.
“Dassault is not easy,” said the former senior French official. “They have got amazing engineers … but on the political side they behave how they want. And now they don’t even need this programme, they have many export sales coming from Rafale. So they are very comfortable, and their collaborative spirit is not good. They piss me off.”
The dynamic was on full display this week, as Macron flew to Delhi to push India to buy more than 114 Rafales – essentially acting as Dassault’s salesman – while back home, the company refuses to cooperate on its replacement.
Dassault also has form on this. The company walked away from the Eurofighter programme in the 1980s because it wanted to be in charge. That jet was eventually built by the UK, Italy, Germany and Spain – without France.
The problem is that Trappier might have a point. Of the three countries involved, only France had the proven capability to design a fighter jet alone from scratch, said Francis Tusa, a defence analyst.
“Dassault is absolutely correct,” he said. “But if you’re going to cooperate and collaborate, you shouldn’t rub other people’s noses in the dirt.”
The dysfunction is not only on the French side. Bertrand de Cordoue, Airbus’s former head of EU and Nato public affairs, said tensions had existed between the two companies from the start, with Airbus engineering teams regarding Dassault as the competition.
“For the German part of Airbus, it was not natural to accept coming out of the existing Eurofighter scheme,” said de Cordue, who is now an adviser at the Jacques Delors Institute, a thinktank. “The teams working on Eurofighter were not spontaneously accepting the idea to totally change their mindset and work with a French company that, on the export market, was a competitor, not a partner.”
Dassault, in turn, has resisted handing over its fighter-building know-how to Airbus, fearing a competitor would acquire French expertise. De Cordoue argued that since the technology was funded by French taxpayers, it should be “more the ownership of the French authorities” – and that Dassault should cooperate.
A growing divide
Even if the French and German governments could control their respective companies, the political will to do so appears to be fading – symptomatic of a growing rift between the two countries on defence.
Earlier in February Johann Wadephul, Germany’s foreign minister, suggested France needed to spend more on its military. Nato member states last year committed to spend 5% of GDP on defence and security by 2035, but Wadephul said French efforts had been “insufficient to achieve this so far … France, too, needs to do what we are doing here with difficult discussions.”
Germany’s more assertive approach is partly a result of a shifting power dynamic. When the FCAS programme started in 2018, its defence spending was modest. Now, after the decision to rearm following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, Berlin expects to spend €150bn by 2029 – nearly twice France’s budget – after a historic deal last year to loosen its “debt brake”.
“France has 60 years of being the accepted leader,” said Tusa. “Suddenly Germany is saying: ‘We don’t have to be deferential.’”
In reality, going it alone with a fighter jet would be difficult for Germany, Tusa added. Despite Airbus’s expertise in commercial jets, building a fighter from scratch would be “their equivalent of the Manhattan Project” because of the lack of experience in doing so, he said.
Even the Eurofighter was a joint project with Britain’s BAE Systems and Leonardo. Germany would be “really starting from ground zero and mobilising every single resource”, he added.
A ‘two-fighter solution’
What happens next remains unclear. Germany could try to join the rival British-Italian-Japanese Global Combat Air Programme (GCAP), dubbed Tempest, which is due to enter service by 2035 – five years earlier than FCAS is nominally due to arrive – though it would probably be accepted only as an observer rather than a full partner.
But Airbus has not given up yet. Guillaume Faury, its chief executive, signalled a potential route forward on Thursday, suggesting France and Germany could each develop separate jets, but link them through the shared combat cloud and drone systems.
Speaking as the the company’s annual results were annonced, he said the deadlock “should not jeopardise the entire future of this high-tech European capability, which will bolster our collective defence”.
“If mandated by our customers, we would support a two-fighter solution and are committed to playing a leading role in such a reorganised FCAS delivered through European cooperation.”
While FCAS was at a “difficult juncture”, he added, “we continue to believe that the programme as a whole makes sense.”
Failure would leave Europe fragmented. Instead of one next-generation fighter, the continent could end up with three or four separate programmes – between FCAS if it survives, GCAP, potentially separate French and German national efforts and the mooted successor to Sweden’s Gripen fighter.
“I think they should have kept going with a single aircraft,” Tusa said. “They [Airbus and Dassault] need to go to counselling and basically be told: ‘Come on guys, play nice.’”
Dassault declined to comment.
Macron, meanwhile, has continued to insist publicly that the project can be saved, telling the Munich Security Conference this month: “It’s hard for me to understand how we will build new common solutions if we destroy the few ones that we have.”
The former French official was more downbeat, pointing to Macron’s presidency ending in May 2027. His possible successor, Marine Le Pen’s far-right National Rally party, is softer on Russia and may abandon the project entirely.
“My feeling is that this project was born with Macron,” the official said, “and could die with Macron.”

‘Very dangerous’: a Mind mental health expert on Google’s AI Overviews

A year-long commission has been launched by Mind to examine AI and mental health after a Guardian investigation exposed how Google’s AI Overviews, which are shown to 2 billion people each month, gave people “very dangerous” mental health advice.
Here, Rosie Weatherley, information content manager at the largest mental health charity in England and Wales, describes the risks posed to people by the AI-generated summaries, which appear above search results on the world’s most visited website.
“Over three decades, Google designed and delivered a search engine where credible and accessible health content could rise to the top of the results.
“Searching online for information wasn’t perfect, but it usually worked well. Users had a good chance of clicking through to a credible health website that answered their query.
“AI Overviews replaced that richness with a clinical-sounding summary that gives an illusion of definitiveness.
“It’s a very seductive swap, but not a responsible one. And this often ends the information-seeking journey prematurely. The user has a half answer, at best.
“I set myself and my team of mental health information experts at Mind a task: 20 minutes searching using queries we know people with mental health problems tend to use. None of us needed 20.
“Within two minutes, Google had served AI Overviews that assured me starvation was healthy. It told a colleague mental health problems are caused by chemical imbalances in the brain. Another was told that her imagined stalker was real, and a fourth that 60% of benefit claims for mental health conditions are malingering. It should go without saying that none of the above are true.
“In each of these examples we are seeing how AI Overviews are flattening information about highly sensitive and nuanced areas into neat answers. And when you take out important context and nuance and present it in the way AI Overviews do, almost anything can seem plausible.
“This process is especially harmful for people who are likely to be in some level of distress.
“A multi-billion-dollar company like Google that profits from AI Overviews should have more resources dedicated to providing accurate information. The extent of their concern seems limited to reactively retraining or removing AI Overviews when individuals, organisations or indeed journalists flag new insights. This ‘whack-a-mole’ style of problem-solving feels unserious and not scaled to the size and resource of the company profiting from them.
“Search engines have evolved to make access to the most harmful search results, like suicide methods, less immediately available. But if you search as an unwell person might search, the risk remains that you will be served harmful inaccuracies and half-truths, presented in calm and confident copy as uncontroversial neutral facts with the stamp of approval from the world’s biggest search engine.
“In a search for crisis information, the AI Overview haphazardly collaged various contradictory signposts in long lists.
“Perhaps AI has enormous potential to improve lives, but right now, the risks are really worrying. Google will only protect you from the potential faults of AI Overviews when it thinks you’re in acute distress. People need and deserve access to constructive, empathetic, careful and nuanced information at all times.”

Mind launches inquiry into AI and mental health after Guardian investigation

Mind is launching a significant inquiry into artificial intelligence and mental health after a Guardian investigation exposed how Google’s AI Overviews gave people “very dangerous” medical advice.
In a year-long commission, the mental health charity, which operates in England and Wales, will examine the risks and safeguards required as AI increasingly influences the lives of millions of people affected by mental health issues worldwide.
The inquiry – the first of its kind globally – will bring together the world’s leading doctors and mental health professionals, as well as people with lived experience, health providers, policymakers and tech companies. Mind says it will aim to shape a safer digital mental health ecosystem, with strong regulation, standards and safeguards.
The launch comes after the Guardian revealed how people were being put at risk of harm by false and misleading health information in Google AI Overviews. The AI-generated summaries are shown to 2 billion people a month, and appear above traditional search results on the world’s most visited website.
After the reporting, Google removed AI Overviews for some but not all medical searches. Dr Sarah Hughes, chief executive officer of Mind, said “dangerously incorrect” mental health advice was still being provided to the public. In the worst cases, the bogus information could put lives at risk, she said.
Hughes said: “We believe AI has enormous potential to improve the lives of people with mental health problems, widen access to support, and strengthen public services. But that potential will only be realised if it is developed and deployed responsibly, with safeguards proportionate to the risks.
“The issues exposed by the Guardian’s reporting are among the reasons we’re launching Mind’s commission on AI and mental health, to examine the risks, opportunities and safeguards needed as AI becomes more deeply embedded in everyday life.
“We want to ensure that innovation does not come at the expense of people’s wellbeing, and that those of us with lived experience of mental health problems are at the heart of shaping the future of digital support.”
Google has said its AI Overviews, which use generative AI to provide snapshots of essential information about a topic or question, are “helpful” and “reliable”.
But the Guardian found some AI Overviews served up inaccurate health information and put people at risk of harm. The investigation uncovered false and misleading medical advice across a range of issues, including cancer, liver disease and women’s health, as well as mental health conditions.
Experts said some AI Overviews for conditions such as psychosis and eating disorders offered “very dangerous advice” and were “incorrect, harmful or could lead people to avoid seeking help”.
Google is also downplaying safety warnings that its AI-generated medical advice may be wrong, the Guardian found.
Hughes said vulnerable people were being served “dangerously incorrect guidance on mental health”, including “advice that could prevent people from seeking treatment, reinforce stigma or discrimination and in the worst cases, put lives at risk”.
She added: “People deserve information that is safe, accurate and grounded in evidence, not untested technology presented with a veneer of confidence.”
The commission, which will run for a year, will gather evidence on the intersection of AI and mental health, and provide an “open space” where the experience of people with mental health conditions will be “seen, recorded and understood”.
Rosie Weatherley, information content manager at Mind, said that although Googling mental health information “wasn’t perfect” before AI Overviews, it usually worked well. She said: “Users had a good chance of clicking through to a credible health website that answered their query, and then went further – offering nuance, lived experience, case studies, quotes, social context and an onward journey to support.
“AI Overviews replaced that richness with a clinical-sounding summary that gives an illusion of definitiveness. They give the user more of one form of clarity (brevity and plain English), while giving them less of another form of clarity (security in the source of the information, and how much to trust it). It’s a very seductive swap, but not a responsible one.”
A Google spokesperson said: “We invest significantly in the quality of AI Overviews, particularly for topics like health, and the vast majority provide accurate information.
“For queries where our systems identify a person might be in distress, we work to display relevant, local crisis hotlines. Without being able to review the examples referenced, we can’t comment on their accuracy.”

Helen Goh’s recipe for rhubarb, pear and hazelnut crumble with browned butter | The sweet spot

Rhubarb brings its late-winter brightness to this favourite pudding, while ripe, buttery pears soften the edges and add a gentle creaminess. Instead of the traditional rubbing-in method, the crumble is made by pouring warm browned butter straight into the dry ingredients, creating a pebbly topping with a deeper toasted flavour. Leave out the crushed fennel seed, if you prefer, but this small addition, bloomed briefly in the butter, gives the whole thing a subtle aromatic lift.
Rhubarb, pear and hazelnut crumble with browned butter
Prep 15 min
Cook 1 hr 15 min, plus cooling
Serves 6
80g caster sugar
Finely grated zest of 1 orange, plus 1 tbsp juice
1½ tbsp tapioca flour, or cornflour
500g rhubarb, trimmed and cut into roughly 2cm pieces
2 large, ripe pears, peeled, cored and cut into 2cm pieces
1 tbsp orange juice
1 tsp vanilla bean paste
Pouring cream, vanilla ice-cream or thick yoghurt, to serve
For the crumble topping
130g unsalted butter, plus 10g extra, softened, for greasing
1 tsp fennel seeds, lightly crushed (optional)
130g plain flour
80g light brown sugar
70g rolled oats
70g toasted blanched hazelnuts, roughly chopped
¼ tsp fine sea salt
Start by making the topping: put the butter in a small saucepan over a medium heat, swirling the pan occasionally until the butter has completely melted. Keep cooking until the butter smells nutty and turns golden; it will splutter and hiss at first, then quieten as the foam subsides. When dark brown specks form on the bottom of the pan, take the pan off the heat, stir in the crushed fennel seeds, if using, and leave to “bloom” for a couple of minutes.
Meanwhile, in a medium bowl, stir the flour, brown sugar, oats, hazelnuts and salt to combine. Pour over the warm browned butter (including the brown sediments – they have great flavour) and stir until irregular clumps form; you want a mixture of both rubble and fine crumbs. Put the crumble mix in the fridge for now.
Heat the oven to 180C (160C fan)/350F/gas 4 and lightly grease an oval ovenproof dish (I used a 28cm x 16cm one) with the extra 10g softened butter.
For the filling, put the sugar and orange zest in a large bowl and rub firmly until it smells fragrant and the sugar is tinged orange. Stir in the tapioca flour, then add the rhubarb, pears, orange juice and vanilla. Toss gently to combine, then tip into the buttered baking dish. Scatter the crumble mix evenly on top, then bake for 45-50 minutes, until the fruit juices are bubbling up around the edges and the top is golden brown. Remove and leave to stand for at least 15 minutes, then serve with pouring cream, vanilla ice-cream or thick yoghurt.

How ‘smog capital of Poland’ saved 6,000 lives by cutting soot levels
Unknown

As a child, Marcel Mazur had to hold his breath in parts of Kraków thick with “so much smoke you could see and smell it”. Now, as an allergy specialist at Jagiellonian University Medical College who treats patients struggling to breathe, he knows all too well the damage those toxic gases do inside the human body.
“It’s not that we have this feeling that nothing can be done. But it’s difficult,” Mazur said.
Kraków, long known as the smog capital of Poland, is proof that politicians wield the power to save lives by cleaning the air. A drop in soot levels since 2013, when the city announced it would ban coal and wood in home heating, has averted nearly 6,000 early deaths over a decade, according to an expert assessment shared exclusively with the Guardian.
Mazur’s research has separately shown that there were 17% fewer cases of asthma and 28% fewer cases of allergic rhinitis in children in 2018 than in 2008.
Anna Dworakowska, a co-founder and director of Polish Smog Alert, said: “It’s a huge improvement.”. Polish Smog Alert is a network of campaign groups that began in Kraków and led a nationwide push to improve the quality of Poland’s air. “Little more than 10 years ago, we had about 150 days a year with too-high concentrations of particulates in Kraków. Now it’s down to 30,” Dworakowska added.
Kraków’s ban on burning solid fuels came into effect in 2019, by which point most of the tens of thousands of dirty stoves and boilers had been replaced. The local government subsidised the switch to cleaner forms of heating, sometimes paying the full cost, and restricted which fuels could be burned in the years leading up to the ban.
The reduction in soot – known as black carbon – saved 5,897 lives over a decade, according to the European Clean Air Centre. The researchers used established methods to calculate the death toll and relied on a special station in Wrocław to estimate the fraction of black carbon in the tiny particulate matter (PM2.5) they measured in Kraków.
Łukasz Adamkiewicz, the president of the European Clean Air Centre, said the progress was a result of rare consensus from parties of all political stripes. “Green, red, black, right, left, up, down – everyone said ‘OK, this is a problem we need to tackle’.”
Black carbon is a superpollutant more powerful than carbon dioxide that is released during the incomplete burning of fossil fuels and biomass. At the UN climate summit in November, nine countries announced first-of-their-kind plans to cut black carbon emissions as part of efforts to stave off global heating and save local lives from bad air.
Rachel Huxley, the head of mitigation at the health charity Wellcome, said: “It’s a big deal. If we take action to tackle superpollutants, we can have this huge impact on global warming and also on all of these premature health impacts.”
Early deaths from fine particulates in Poland fell by 18% between 2005 and 2022, the latest data shows, and across the EU they plunged by 45%.
Kraków, the capital of the coal-rich Małopolska region, has witnessed perhaps the most dramatic turnaround in air quality in Poland. In 2024 it recorded no breaches of daily limits for benzo(a)pyrene, another cancer-causing pollutant from burning wood and coal, for the first year since measurements began, according to Polish Smog Alert.
Pollution is expected to fall further due to the introduction of a low emissions zone – restricting the types of vehicle that can drive in about 60% of the city – at the start of the year.
Experts say more needs to be done. In late January, Kraków briefly became the most-polluted major city in the world, ahead of Lahore in Pakistan and Kolkata in India, according to a ranking of 120 global cities by IQAir. Smog floats into Kraków from surrounding towns and villages, where coal and wood dominate home heating and the city has little say over policy.
Things are not going as well elsewhere in Poland, said Mazur, who has a house in Szczawnica, a small town in the south of the country. Before he replaced the coal boiler, he had to fill it with fuel three times a day in winter and clear it of ash just as often. The switch to a heat pump and a gas boiler has been “incomparably more convenient, and much more eco-friendly”, he said.
“What happens in the towns and villages surrounding Kraków has a direct impact on the air quality in our city,” Mazur said.
The reverse may also be true. The ban in Kraków has spurred similar policies across Poland, with pressure from citizens and campaign groups driving political enthusiasm to adopt anti-smog measures and restrict the burning of the most polluting fuels.
Experts say its success could guide polluted cities across eastern Europe and further afield, where death tolls from air pollution are high but public discontent rarely rises to the level of protests or organised campaigns.
Huxley said: “My experience of working with cities is you can’t do it without public support. That will either drive it, or without it you’ll be hamstrung.”

Social media companies face legal reckoning over mental health harms to children
For years, social media companies have disputed allegations that they harm children’s mental health through the way they design their platforms, deliberately addicting kids and failing to protect them sexual predators and dangerous content
- Bookmark
For years, social media companies have disputed allegations that they harm children’s mental health through deliberate design choices that addict kids to their platforms and fail to protect them from sexual predators and dangerous content. Now, these tech giants are getting a chance to make their case in courtrooms around the country, including before a jury for the first time.
Some of the biggest players from Meta to TikTok are facing federal and state trials that seek to hold them responsible for harming children's mental health. The lawsuits have come from school districts, local, state and the federal government as well as thousands of families.
Two trials are now underway in Los Angeles and in New Mexico, with more to come. The courtroom showdowns are the culmination of years of scrutiny of the platforms over child safety, and whether deliberate design choices make them addictive and serve up content that leads to depression, eating disorders or suicide.
Experts see the reckoning as reminiscent of cases against tobacco and opioid markets, and the plaintiffs hope that social media platforms will see similar outcomes as cigarette makers and drug companies, pharmacies and distributors.
The outcomes could challenge the companies’ First Amendment shield and Section 230 of the 1996 Communications Decency Act, which protects tech companies from liability for material posted on their platforms. They could also be costly in the form of legal fees and settlements. And they could force the companies to change how they operate, potentially losing users and advertising dollars.
Here's a look at the major social media harms cases in the United States.
The Los Angeles case centers on addiction
Jurors in a landmark social media case that seeks to hold tech companies responsible for harms to children got their first glimpse into what will be a lengthy trial characterized by dueling narratives from the plaintiffs and the two remaining defendants, Meta and YouTube.
At the core of the Los Angeles case is a 20-year-old identified only by the initials “KGM,” whose case could determine how thousands of similar lawsuits will play out. KGM and the cases of two other plaintiffs have been selected to be bellwether trials — essentially test cases for both sides to see how their arguments play out before a jury.
“This is a monumental inflection point in social media,” said Matthew Bergman of the Seattle-based Social Media Victims Law Center, which represents more than 1,000 plaintiffs in lawsuits against social media companies. “When we started doing this four years ago no one said we'd ever get to trial. And here we are trying our case in front of a fair and impartial jury.”
On Wednesday Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg testified, mostly sticking to past talking points, including a lengthy back-and-forth about age verification where he said "“I don’t see why this is so complicated,” reiterating that the company’s policy restricts users under the age of 13 and that it works to detect users who have lied about their ages to bypass restrictions..
At one point, the plaintiff’s attorney, Mark Lanier, asked Zuckerberg if people tend to use something more if it’s addictive.
“I’m not sure what to say to that,” Zuckerberg said. “I don’t think that applies here.”
New Mexico goes after Meta over sexual exploitation
A team led by New Mexico Attorney General Raúl Torrez, who sued Meta in 2023, built their case by posing as children on social media, then documenting sexual solicitations they received as well as Meta’s response.
Torrez wants Meta to implement more effective age verification and do more to remove bad actors from its platform.
He also is seeking changes to algorithms that can serve up harmful material, and has criticized the end-to-end encryption that can prevent the monitoring of communications with children for safety. Meta has noted that encrypted messaging is encouraged in general as a privacy and security measure by some state and federal authorities.
The trial kicked off in early February. In his opening statement, prosecuting attorney Donald Migliori said Meta has misrepresented the safety of its platforms, choosing to engineer its algorithms to keep young people online while knowing that children are at risk of sexual exploitation.
“Meta clearly knew that youth safety was not its corporate priority ... that youth safety was less important than growth and engagement,” Migliori told the jury.
Meta attorney Kevin Huff pushed back on those assertions in his opening statement, highlighting an array of efforts by the company to weed out harmful content from its platforms while warning users that some dangerous content still gets past its safety net.
School districts head to trial
A trial scheduled for this summer pits school districts against social media companies before U.S. District Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers in Oakland, California. Called a multidistrict litigation, it names six public school districts from around the country as the bellwethers.
Jayne Conroy, a lawyer on plaintiffs’ trial team, was also an attorney for plaintiffs seeking to hold pharmaceutical companies responsible for the opioid epidemic. She said the cornerstone of both cases is the same: addiction.
“With the social media case, we're focused primarily on children and their developing brains and how addiction is such a threat to their wellbeing and ... the harms that are caused to children — how much they're watching and what kind of targeting is being done,” she said.
The medical science, she added, “is not really all that different, surprisingly, from an opioid or a heroin addiction. We are all talking about the dopamine reaction.”
Both the social media and the opioid cases claim negligence on the part of the defendants.
“What we were able to prove in the opioid cases is the manufacturers, the distributors, the pharmacies, they knew about the risks, they downplayed them, they oversupplied, and people died,” Conroy said. “Here, it is very much the same thing. These companies knew about the risks, they have disregarded the risks, they doubled down to get profits from advertisers over the safety of kids. And kids were harmed and kids died.”
Resolution could take years amid dueling narratives
Social media companies have disputed that their products are addictive. During questioning Wednesday by the plaintiff’s lawyer during the Los Angeles trial, Zuckerberg said he still agrees with a previous statement he made that the existing body of scientific work has not proven that social media causes mental health harms.
Some researchers do indeed question whether addiction is the appropriate term to describe heavy use of social media. Social media addiction is not recognized as an official disorder in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, the authority within the psychiatric community.
But the companies face increasing pushback on the issue of social media's effects on children's mental health, not only among academics but also parents, schools and lawmakers.
“While Meta has doubled down in this area to address mounting concerns by rolling out safety features, several recent reports suggest that the company continues to aggressively prioritize teens as a user base and doesn’t always adhere to its own rules,” said Emarketer analyst Minda Smiley.
With appeals and any settlement discussions, the cases against social media companies could take years to resolve. And unlike in Europe and Australia, tech regulation in the U.S. is moving at a glacial pace.
“Parents, education, and other stakeholders are increasingly hoping lawmakers will do more," Smiley said. "While there is momentum at the state and federal level, Big Tech lobbying, enforcement challenges, and lawmaker disagreements over how to best regular social media have slowed meaningful progress.”

‘She’s the queen of Ireland’: Inside the first ever Marian Keyes TV show
The Irish literary treasure has sold more than 35 million books worldwide and yet it has taken nearly three decades for any of her beloved tales to reach the screen. Annabel Nugent hears from the author and cast about how ‘The Walsh Sisters’ finally came to be
- Bookmark
- CommentsGo to comments
When Marian Keyes introduced the Walsh sisters to the world in 1995, the five siblings arrived bound in a pretty pastel book jacket and marketed under the somewhat patronising label of “women’s fiction”. What readers found instead was a novel full of hard truths about marriage, motherhood, addiction, depression, abuse, and loss – all told with Keyes’ trademark warmth and wit.
Across seven books and three decades, the Walsh sisters and their creator have worked their way into the hearts of millions of readers around the world. The question “Which Walsh sister are you?” has become a sort of Rorschach test of its own in certain circles: there is the adrift Claire, chaotic Rachel, goody two-shoes Maggie, wry Anna, and lovely Helen. Beyond the fab five are, of course, favourites like dozy Daddy Walsh and Mammy Walsh, who never cooks but always keeps the freezer stocked wall-to-wall with Magnum ice creams. Plus, dishy Luke in the too-tight leather trousers.
Now, a new six-part series is bringing these beloved characters to the screen with Derry Girls’ Louisa Harland, alongside Caroline Menton, Danielle Galligan, Mairead Tyers and Stefanie Preissner, taking on the lead roles. It is the first ever Marian Keyes novel to make the leap to telly, if you can believe it. A second one, Grown Ups, is already on the way from Netflix, with Aisling Bea and Adrian Dunbar attached. “My novels have been optioned over and over but nothing has been made for 27 years. I just got used to it,” says Keyes at an early London screening of the series. “My hopes were zero! And then things started happening… very slowly.”
Already out in Ireland, The Walsh Sisters started gathering real pace when Stefanie Preissner (of the hit RTE show Can’t Cope, Won’t Cope) came aboard as the show’s writer alongside Kefi Chadwick (Rivals). Needless to say, it was a big job – and a big responsibility. “Our country is not a monarchy but Marian Keyes is our queen,” jokes Preissner. “We have a portrait of her in our national museum. Her fans are evangelists and I knew if I got this wrong, they would come for me at nighttime.” On top of the writing, Preissner also plays Maggie. How did she do it all? “Antidepressants, painkillers and a childminder!”
Preissner noticeably shares Keyes’ sense of humour: the kind of self-deprecating candour that fosters an intimate, immediate connection with anyone listening. Both are like that kindly stranger you pour your heart out to in the bathroom of some random bar and never see again. Getting that tone right was essential in appeasing the Keyes acolytes, says Preissner, a group in which she counts herself.
“I needed to capture the sense of what it feels like to read a Marian Keyes book – where you feel so seen and accepted through these characters,” she says. “You’re laughing out loud and then you’re crying on the Tube and you don’t know why – we wanted to capture all of that.” It’s a very Irish sensibility, she and Keyes agree, that happy-sad balance founded on the belief that the best comedy is rooted in despair. “I was very clear to our British producers that [death and addiction] can’t be too sad – Irish people are not allowed to be sad for too long. After a while it’s like, come on! Up you get!”
Feeling seen is part of the appeal of any Marian Keyes book, of which close to 40 million copies have been sold worldwide. The author has a knack for shining a light on your deepest insecurity, most deeply held shame and making you feel OK about it. There is, for example, Maggie’s IVF journey, depicted as gruelling and expensive and lonely. It was important to Preissner, who had undergone treatment and had multiple miscarriages herself, to show how isolating a process it can be. “I think about Gogglebox a lot when writing: what are people on the couch going to be talking about?” she says. “And I think there will be women watching and really relating to Maggie sitting on couches alongside people who don’t know what they’re going through. And that’s what really upsets me.”
Take Claire’s character too, whose experience of being a mother is complicated, controversial even, but by no means singular. She loves her daughter, but she also loves to go out and have fun. In one scene, she lies about having a child to a man she meets. “The dichotomy is handled really well,” says Galligan, who plays her. “She has a really strong, loving relationship with her child but her relationship to motherhood is tenuous and difficult and that’s OK. I think a lot of women have probably felt that in their lives, so to be able to give a voice to that stigma felt important.”
“The expectations on motherhood and fatherhood are not the same, and it is so unfair and unjust. You know, I’ve said in the past, ‘I just want to be a dad! Why can’t I be a dad?’” says Preissner, who recalls plenty of people in Ireland criticising Claire for her actions as a mother. “But I’m happy to fight that fight. I’ll take anybody on.”
While the books treat the sisters like a revolving door of protagonists, the series zeroes in on Rachel as her addiction to drugs and alcohol spins her life out of control. All the while, she bats it off as the average life of any party-loving twentysomething. Menton’s performance here is visceral and naturalistic, ironically driven by what sounds like a fastidiously academic approach. “She arrived at the audition and it was like she had been studying for a PhD,” says Preissner. “It was a brilliant audition.” After securing the part, Menton went on to meet with psychologists who specialise in addiction, and had the chance to speak with someone who was in treatment in real-time. Her key takeaway? “Don’t ask, ‘Why the addiction?’ Ask, ‘Why the pain?’” she says.
Casting Menton was, Keyes adds, the final piece of “the big jigsaw” they had created with the rest of the actors. “The chemistry was indescribable. You’d swear they had come from the same gene pool,” says the author. It comes through on screen, too, that sense of complete comfort and steadfast love, but also the underhanded jibes and devastating cruelty you’d never dream of inflicting on anyone but your sister.
The cast and creators hope the series will go some way in redressing that age-old sexist chatter surrounding Marian Keyes books – that hers are guilty pleasures meant solely for the beach and the airport. It’s a process that has already started, in fact. “Men tend to bond by doing ‘men things’ like golf and Everton and fixing stuff, but my uncle and his son sat down every Sunday when The Walsh Sisters was on in Ireland and watched it together,” says Galligan. “It was their father-son bonding activity of the week. And I love the journey that these books have taken from being ‘fluff’ to being the thing that my uncle Michael and little cousin Michael Jr use to bond over.”
As for Keyes, she is delighted with this first adaptation of her work. “I cried a phenomenal amount and it was this cleansing crying. It was like something left me and became something else,” she says. “And that feeling had nothing to do with me – this was Stephanie’s version – but also at the same time, it had a lot to do with me.” It’s no small feat making Marian Keyes, patron saint of the cathartic cry, tear up herself. “I can die happy,” says Preissner. “Marian Keyes liked it: put that on my grave.”
All episodes of ‘The Walsh Sisters’ will be available on BBC iPlayer on 21 February, and BBC One will air the series weekly starting 9.15pm the same evening

How the climate crisis threatens our food — and the people that grow it
Data shows why NGOs, politicians, and businesses are urgently calling on the government to introduce legislation that will shore up supply chains as the climate crisis escalates, Nick Ferris writes

- CommentsGo to comments
All across the world, harvests that we have long depended on to provide the foods that we know and love are faltering. Spanish olives, Floridian oranges, Ghanaian cocoa beans and Costa Rican pineapples are among the harvests impacted by climate shocks over the past few years, which have impacted the supplies – and prices – of food on supermarket shelves.
This escalating climate risk is one of many reasons why NGOs and ethical investors are campaigning hard for the UK to introduce mandatory checks on the environmental impact and human rights in supply chains, as part of a campaign that is being described as a “once-in-a-decade” opportunity to clean up the UK’s footprint on the world.
As things stand, the lack of due diligence law means that there is a lack of clear data on just how many companies are effectively monitoring and responding to risks in supply chains in the UK. But the indicators we do have suggest it is very few, with a recent assessment finding that food and drinks companies scored an average of 15/100 in their labour standards monitoring efforts.
Introducing a new supply chain law would mean that measures can be put in place to ensure that the foods we love remain available year-round and at a fair price, according to campaigners.
It would also help ensure that the farmers and suppliers at the other end of the chain receive a fair deal, which will in turn allow them to better adapt to the climate crisis.
Evidence for why we need bolster up our food systems against the climate threat can be found in the many months of high inflation that the UK has experienced recently, which the Bank of England’s Monetary Policy Committee warned in an August report was at least in part driven by extreme weather around the world pushing up the cost of certain foods.
Among the crops pushing up the price was coffee, with data showing prices in commodity markets – including Arabica beans from Brazil and Robusta beans from Vietnam – rising sharply through 2023 and 2024, after unusually hot and dry weather in both countries.
These rises were followed by a notable rise in the Consumer Price Inflation (CPI) of coffee in the UK.
Data also shows that inflation of beef and dairy products in the UK was also particularly high. Successive years of weather extremes – including summer droughts, unseasonal rainfall, and flooding – reduced pasture productivity and disrupted grazing patterns across much of the UK. Droughts in the Brazilian Amazon and pasture fires in Australia pushed up the price of beef imports from those markets at the same time.
Climate extremes also hit dairy outputs, pushing the inflation rate for butter up to 18.9 per cent year-on-year across 2025. Without action, such situations will become more common in the future, experts warn.
"These climate-related food price risks could get significantly worse,” says Christian Jaccarini, from the Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit. “We’ve already crossed one climate tipping point – the point of no return for warm water coral reefs – with major implications for fisheries worldwide. And as the government's own recent national security assessment says, every critical global ecosystem is now on ‘a pathway to collapse’”.
“This would have would have profound consequences, including water insecurity, reduced crop yields, loss of arable land, fisheries collapse, heightened disease risks, and accelerating climate change,” he adds.
For the time being, wealthier countries that supply Britain’s food, like Brazil and Australia, are able to invest in new technologies to hedge against climate risks.
“There’s been a lot of progress in farming technologies that has continued to drive yield improvements,” explains Sabine Altendorf, an economist at the UN Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO). “New machinery like drones, the precision application of pesticides and fertilisers, and technologies like drip irrigation [involving the slow, even application of low-pressure water] are all driving improvements.”
These technologies are “very expensive”, however, Altendorf adds. For the small-scale farmers in developing countries that supply around one-third of the world’s food - and a large share of tea, coffee, cocoa, and tropical fruits that we consume in the UK - they remain largely out of reach for now, leaving them struggling to adapt in the face of climate shocks.
“While agriculture yields have so far held up globally, among small-holder farmers we are seeing climate and adverse weather conditions lead to really dire consequences,” explains Altendorf.
The difficulties they are facing are made worse by pricing from Global North retailers, which has left “bananas and pineapples often-times cheaper than domestic fruits like cherries or apples,” says Altendorf.
What’s more, aid programmes that have historically supported farmers adapt to climate change are increasingly under threat as countries like the US and UK reduce their overseas spending. US funding for the Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO), which runs a lot of climate adaptation programmes in developing countries, more than halved year-on-year, for example.
The decline in public money for aid programmes is another reason why campaigners are suggesting mandatory supply chain due diligence in the UK is important, as it will help ensure that UK trade and investment abroad actually brings fair profits for those supplying our food.
"With the reductions in official development assistance by the UK and globally, and the ongoing climate emergency, we should be viewing ethical trade including through mandatory Human Rights and Environmental Due Diligence (HREDD) as a cost-effective way to put our principles into practice,” Martin Rhodes, the Labour MP and chair of the All-Party Parliamentary Group on Fairtrade, tells The Independent.
“The Government’s recent trade strategy contains very welcome and strong commitments to embedding human rights and environmental standards into trade policy. I hope the responsible business conduct review builds on this and leads to a clear commitment to introduce HREDD in the next Parliamentary Session."
News on whether the UK will introduce a mandatory supply chain law is currently expected in March, according to campaigners.

You’re probably brushing your teeth wrong – these changes that could save your life
Experts say that the perks of better brushing extend beyond a winning smile and could lead to improved heart health and reduced inflammation
- Bookmark
- CommentsGo to comments
Experts suggest brushing your teeth three times a day and improving your oral health could help you live longer and reduce your risk of a raft of health conditions.
“Processed food, a soft diet, lack of exercise and obesity” have predisposed the UK to a state of poor oral care, according to Professor Alpdogan Kantarci from the University of Minnesota, who was speaking at the recent American Association for the Advancement of Science annual conference.
Further experts linked poor oral health to several health conditions. For example, the idea that oral bacteria can impact our gut microbiome, increasing the risk of colorectal cancer and inflammatory bowel disease.
“We now think that maintaining your teeth in health may be associated with a reduced risk of more than 50 systemic conditions,” Professor Kantarci said. “Research is now showing that, in people with mild or moderate diseases, those who are brushing and taking care of their teeth, or seeing a dentist and having advanced cleanings, are showing much better cognitive responses.”
So, should you schedule a lunchtime brush into each day? I asked a couple of dental experts, then quizzed them on how to fix a few commonplace brushing mistakes.
Should you brush three times a day?
The body is not a collection of separate parts, but rather a series of interconnected systems. So looking after your oral health can have a positive impact on the many other systems it is linked to.
For this reason, Professor Kantarci’s advice around brushing three times each day – after sticky or sugary foods in particular – could be worth considering. Pre-bedtime brushing should also be prioritised, he says, as should regular trips to the dentist.
“Maintaining good oral health is strongly linked to overall health,” says Dr Abdul Dalghous, principal dentist at Yorkshire Dental Suite. “Brushing at least twice a day is essential, and a third brush after meals can provide additional protection.
“Regular dental check-ups allow early detection and treatment of cavities, gum disease and other issues, preventing them from contributing to wider health problems.”
However, Chelsea Dental Clinic owner Dr Rhona Eskander says that quality is more important than quantity when brushing your teeth.
“Brushing properly twice a day with a fluoride toothpaste, especially before bed, is the foundation of good dental care,” she says. “For some people, adding a lunchtime brush can be helpful, particularly if they are more prone to decay or gum issues.
“Regular dental check-ups are also very important. They allow us to identify small problems early and address them before they become more complex. Prevention and early intervention are crucial when it comes to protecting both oral and overall health.”

What’s the link between oral health and disease?
“Healthy teeth and gums reduce harmful bacteria and inflammation in the body,” Dr Dalghous explains. “Gum disease, for example, can allow bacteria to reach the bloodstream, affecting blood vessels and the heart. Chronic oral inflammation may also contribute to cognitive decline. By maintaining oral hygiene, the risks of these systemic health issues are lowered.”
“There are also growing discussions around links between poor oral health, cognitive decline and some forms of arthritis,” Dr Eskander adds. “Good oral care aims to keep inflammation as low as possible. Healthy gums bleed less, harbour fewer harmful bacteria and place less strain on the immune system. It is only one part of overall health, but it is an important one.”
This does not mean brushing your teeth will prevent every illness. But by looking after your oral health, you are looking after your general health too – not just your pearly whites.
“It is about reducing risk rather than making guarantees, and oral health plays a meaningful role within that bigger picture,” Dr Eskander concludes.
5 mistakes to watch out for
Don’t brush too hard or too quickly: it is not about scrubbing, and brushing aggressively can lead to gum recession and enamel wear.
Don’t miss the gumline, which is where plaque tends to accumulate.
Clean between your teeth using floss or interdental brushes to avoid plaque being left behind.
Don’t neglect the back teeth
Also avoid rinsing with water directly after brushing as this washes away fluoride before it has had time to strengthen the teeth.

Mumford & Sons review, ‘Prizefighter’ - Choosing vulnerability over cynicism
British folk trio revive the communal spirit of their early years by inviting artists such as Hozier, Chris Stapleton and Gigi Perez to collaborate
- Bookmark
- CommentsGo to comments
“Hey! Did you call? Did you fall? Do you need someone?” an impassioned Marcus Mumford asks on his band’s irresistible new single “Banjo Song”. Earthy and earnest as ever, his urgent questions come bolstered by the raw strum of the instrument for which the band were once both celebrated and mocked in equal measure. After a couple of rockier albums (2015’s Delta and 2018’s Wilder Mind), the band returned to a rootsier sound on 2025’s Rushmere. Now, just nine months later, their sixth album, Prizefighter, sees them doubling down on their original USP with glorious gusto. What’s more, they’ve brought a whole crew of A-list guest stars along for the ride, with the likes of Gracie Abrams, Hozier, Chris Stapleton and Gigi Perez swelling the singalong to a stadium-sized lock-in.
It’s surprising that Mumford & Sons haven’t included more featured artists on their records; the nu-folk movement of the 2010s seemed almost as communal-cliquey as California’s Laurel Canyon singer-songwriter circle of the Sixties and Seventies. Mumford & Sons could be found playing gigs at the tiny (now defunct) Bosun’s Locker beneath a pasty shop in Fulham, along with acts such as Noah and the Whale, Laura Marling, Emmy the Great, Johnny Flynn, and King Charles. It was a lax venue where many of the underage musicians could guarantee getting served alcohol, clinking warm pints between strumming battered guitars. But eventually that scene splintered as Mumford & Sons hit the international mainstream.
Last year, though, Mumford & Sons revived some of this collective spirit, bringing younger folk-pop stars Noah Kahan and Maggie Rogers along for a rerun of their original 2011 railroad tour of the US. It’s helped them pick up the momentum you feel on Prizefighter. Interviewed in The Times earlier this year, 39-year-old Mumford said the band had “found the fun again”, proven in the record’s bounty of hook-filled tunes.
Co-written and co-produced with welcoming, woody warmth by The National’s Aaron Dessner, the record opens with the steadying sentiment of “Here”. Mumford is joined by country star Chris Stapleton (if ever a voice could have a bushy beard, it’s his) as the pair own both their “trophies” and their “mistakes” together over a stomped beat, augmented with a liquid bluesy electric solo. Irish singer-songwriter Hozier hangs out on “Rubber Man”, about the reassurance of shared memories, while the clock-tick pulse of “Icarus” finds Mumford’s rough-grained vocal bolstered by the rich commitment of 26-year-old indie artist Gigi Perez. Gracie Abrams’s light graze of a croon skates elegantly over the sweet, piano-driven “Badlands”.
Guest-free highlights include the delicately plucked “Alleycat”, resonant “Stay” and “Conversations with My Son”, which skips along its gorgeous acoustic guitar solo while Mumford’s lyrics pledge enduring love and support. Though there have been times when critics have tired of Mumford & Son’s big, fraternal hug schtick, there’s no doubting their sincerity. And in these troubled times, it feels like a fool’s luxury to choose cynicism over their tuneful vulnerability and endorsement of united humanity. As Mumford reminds us on “Banjo Song”, you can be “a mess” yourself and still prove worth leaning on.

Florence Welch is the UK’s best live act – and a moment of magic at her O2 gig sealed it
The powerhouse indie singer refused to go on with the charade of an arena full of fans filming on their phones, and released an ecstatic energy with her demand to ‘be present’, writes Patrick Smith
- Bookmark
- CommentsGo to comments
At the London O2 on Tuesday night, 20,000 fans genuflecting before her, Florence Welch broke into 2008’s “Dog Days Are Over”, its harp trills cascading into that thumping chorus. Two-thirds in, though, she pulled back. The band kept playing beneath her – quieter now, letting the tension build – while she scanned the room, singling out phones and refusing to let that ethereal vibrato rip until every last one of them was put away. “Be present,” she implored; the footage would be “f***ing awful” anyway. When every screen had finally gone down – really, all of them – she released the pressure and the place erupted, her audience bouncing in unison, arms astretch, like wheat beaten by a gale.
Of course, we’re living through a collective reckoning with our phones, everyone talking about presence and mindfulness and experiencing art rather than documenting it. But head to any gig and that reflex still kicks in: the song starts, the phone goes up, the souvenir gets captured for an Instagram story you’ll post and never watch again. Far be it from me to claim I’m immune – I filmed her rendition of “Cosmic Love” earlier in the set – but if anyone has earned the authority to make 20,000 people actually commit to the here and now, it’s Florence Welch. Why would anyone be watching this singular artist on a screen the size of a playing card when there she was in full gaze, shadowed by four incredible dancers twirling and crawling through dry ice, commanding the stage like some magnificent priestess?
Since her single “Kiss with a Fist” dropped in 2008, Welch has become the most successful British alt-rock artist of her generation – Arctic Monkeys aside. She’s been sampled by Kendrick Lamar and Drake, collaborated with Taylor Swift and Lady Gaga, while Beyoncé has hailed her an inspiration. You can trace her sound through to the gothic maximalism of Chappell Roan and The Last Dinner Party. In 2015, when Dave Grohl’s broken leg forced Foo Fighters to withdraw from Glastonbury, Welch stepped up to headline the Pyramid Stage. Only two other British women have topped that bill this century: Adele and Dua Lipa. This is the kind of company she keeps.
And yet, for much of her early career, Welch was met with mixed reviews, dismissed as too theatrical, too earnest, too extravagant. When she broke her foot on stage at the London O2 in 2022 and bled through the rest of the show, the performance earned only four stars. The detail stuck. It became a lyric in “Music by Men”, a joke at her own expense and everyone else’s. On her latest album Everybody Scream – which is wild, profound and audacious – she addresses the double standard head-on with “One of the Greats”, an industry-skewering song she tore through at the O2 with vituperative glee. “I’ll be up there with the men and the 10 other women in the hundred greatest records of all time,” she sings, before adding, “It must be nice to be a man and make boring music just because you can.”
It’s a line that could have sounded bitter, but didn’t; it sounded heartfelt, delivered with the bravura of someone who knows they’ve already won the argument. If boring male mediocrity gets canonised, then what Welch has achieved – five UK No 1s and global renown – should have made her untouchable years ago. From the beginning, Welch has written about women who are powerful yet fragile, grounding folklore and fury in experience. Everybody Scream takes those ululations, that baroque melodrama, and sharpens them into something more focused, more devastating.
In 2023, mid-tour, Welch suffered an ectopic pregnancy that ruptured during a festival performance in Cornwall. Emergency surgery saved her life; the fallopian tube couldn’t be saved. “The closest I came to making life was the closest I came to death,” she told The Guardian. She still hopes for children. “You Can Have It All” grieves that loss directly. More broadly, the album filters it through witchcraft, medieval mysticism and horror tropes, and is, at heart, about the physical and psychological toll of performance – the price you pay to be an artist, the question of whether the stage leaves room for a full life.
Which brings us back to the O2, to that exhilarating unfurling of “Dog Days Are Over”. We can talk all we like about having digital detoxes and being in the moment and experiencing the sweaty immediacy of a live show, but nothing changes until someone forces us to comply. In 20 years’ time, Florence + the Machine will be considered one of the greats. I’ll never forget seeing Welch on the John Peel stage at Glastonbury in 2009, climbing up the rigging while delivering a brilliant, career-defining set. I didn’t have a camera phone. Nor did many others. Yet that image of her in those enormous high heels, dangling one-handed, is one that I’ll never forget. If more artists start doing what Welch did on Tuesday, we might actually break the habit. Welch, certainly, has the love – and clout – to see this through.

LRT English Newsletter: Happy fasting

LRT English Newsletter – February 20, 2026.
Chances are you observed some sort of celebration this week. Perhaps you welcomed the Year of the Horse in red, broke iftar with dates, or indulged before having a priest mark your forehead with ashes. And, if you happen to be in Antarctica, you might even have caught the annular solar eclipse.
Meanwhile, Lithuanians marked their Independence Day (or, as it is known formally, State Restoration Day) and, in seasonal fashion, turned into devils, stuffing themselves with pancakes for Užgavėnės. Here’s one photo essay if you want to see what the celebration looked like in Vilnius, and another if you’re curious about the straw effigies competing for the title of the most terribly beautiful Morė. Let’s hope they’re hideous enough to finally chase away the winter.
Here are a few other commemorations and celebrations to keep on your radar:
– As the 120th anniversary of Lithuania’s first kanklės ensemble arrives in 2026, the year has been officially devoted to celebrating the country’s most emblematic instrument.
– As Lithuania’s public broadcaster celebrates its centenary, UNESCO highlighted the occasion on World Radio Day, February 13.
– February 11 marked the International Day of Women and Girls in Science – what a fitting moment to learn about the first all-female Antarctic winter expedition.
WHO IS RUNNING LITHUANIA’S FOREIGN POLICY?
Ongoing discussions about Lithuania’s relationship with Taiwan and China have, if anything, highlighted Prime Minister Inga Ruginienė’s growing interest in playing a more active role in foreign affairs. In practice, her office is primarily focused on domestic policy, but an apparent rivalry with Foreign Minister Kęstutis Budrys has made her more outspoken on external issues as well.
Political analysts say the rivalry may stem in part from Budrys’ emergence as a potential political contender, as few in Vilnius doubt that the foreign minister could run in the 2029 presidential election. The dynamic has raised concerns that Lithuania’s foreign policy risks becoming entangled in domestic political competition at a time when the country’s voice on the international stage arguably needs to remain as consistent as possible.
Speaking of foreign policy, the United States’ inconsistent messaging is also sowing divisions among Lithuanian Americans. Some say they no longer recognise the America they grew up with, expressing shock at Donald Trump’s treatment of allies and questioning whether the country can still serve as a reliable guarantor of freedom in Europe. Others urge a more pragmatic reading of his rhetoric, arguing that his statements should be assessed separately from his actions.
OLYMPIC INCONSISTENCIES
Last week, Lithuania condemned the International Olympic Committee’s decision to disqualify Ukrainian skeleton athlete Vladyslav Heraskevych for wearing a helmet featuring images of Ukrainian athletes killed during Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.
This week, Lithuanian Prime Minister Inga Ruginienė said she would boycott the upcoming Milan-Cortina Paralympic Games in protest of a decision to allow Russian and Belarusian athletes to compete under their national flags.
Both controversies stem from the IOC’s efforts to uphold the Olympic Truce, prohibiting “any kind of demonstration or political, religious or racial propaganda” at Olympic venues. That rule was cited in Heraskevych’s disqualification, even though his helmet did not explicitly reference Russia or its invasion of Ukraine.
Following Russia’s full-scale invasion, Russian and Belarusian athletes were barred from competing under their national flags at the Olympic and Paralympic Games. However, the International Paralympic Committee lifted that ban this year despite the ongoing war, prompting concerns that the IOC could take similar steps ahead of the 2028 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles and raising broader questions about why athletes from other countries involved in active conflicts, including Israel, continue to compete under their national flags.
DEFENCE UPDATES
– Lithuania submitted evidence to the UN aviation body over repeated airspace violations caused by smuggling balloons that continue to disrupt Vilnius Airport operations. Meanwhile, the country is looking for solutions, testing new anti-balloon and anti-drone defences at Pabradė training area.
– The government is seeking around 1 billion euros to develop transport links critical for military mobility. The money will be spent on priority projects, including reinforcing routes through the Suwałki Corridor, a strategically sensitive stretch along the border often cited as Lithuania’s main vulnerability in the event of a Russian attack.
– Additional military funding has been earmarked for Ukraine, focusing on air defence, drones and long-range artillery ammunition.
NO PEACE FOR FORMER PMS
This week, Lithuanian prosecutors questioned two senior politicians, both former prime ministers, as special witnesses in separate pretrial investigations.
Former Prime Minister Gintautas Paluckas was questioned as a special witness by the Special Investigation Service (STT) in a pre-trial investigation into alleged abuse of office and illegal enrichment. The probe, launched in July last year, followed an investigative journalism report that raised questions about Paluckas’ past business dealings.
Saulius Skvernelis, leader of the Democrats “For Lithuania,” on the other hand, was interviewed by the STT after raids on his home and office. The inquiry concerns alleged corruption at the State Plant Service, where representatives of plant-exporting companies were allegedly required to pay large bribes for phytosanitary certificates.
ECONOMY UPDATES
– The European Commission adopted a comprehensive strategy to boost support for European Union eastern member states bordering Russia, Belarus and Ukraine. Lithuania is among the nine covered EU member states.
– Heating bills are strangling Lithuanian churches.
– Lithuania’s poverty rates are amongst the worst in EU, young adults at highest risk.
– Those seeking sexual services might have to pay much steeper fines.
– Starting march, you can fly to Helsinki from Vilnius in the evening again
EDITOR’S PICKS:
– Here’s what the EU should do for Belarusians in opposition to their government, according to an activist who spent 3 years in Belarusian prison
– How should Lithuania help minority communities balance their children’s cultural identity with the need to learn the state language?
– Lithuanian government revisits plan to turn Sports Palace into Jewish memorial, again.

Key Takeaways from the ISW:
- Western sources continue to indicate that Russian President Vladimir Putin’s objectives are not limited to control of Ukrainian territory — in line with ISW’s longstanding assessment based on repeated Kremlin public statements.
- Western sources tied Putin’s unwillingness to compromise in negotiations to his belief that the Russian economy can continue to support a protracted war, which is consistent with ISW’s longstanding assessment of Putin’s theory of victory.
- The Kremlin is attempting to distract the United States with bilateral economic deals in order to secure concessions during US-led peace negotiations on Ukraine.
- The Ukrainian defense industrial base (DIB) continues to move toward self-sufficiency, but Western support remains critical to this endeavor.
- Russian forces have reportedly adapted their Geran-2 drones to be “mothership” drones that carry first-person view (FPV) drones deeper into the Ukrainian rear.
- Ukrainian forces recently advanced near Kupyansk. Russian forces recently advanced near Slovyansk.

Romania's president offers to evacuate 1,000 children from Gaza, backs Trump's peace plan
Romania pledges humanitarian aid, educational support and institutional expertise to Gaza, highlighting cooperation with both Jewish and Palestinian communities
ISTANBUL
Romanian President Nicusor Dan said Thursday that his country is ready to evacuate 1,000 children from Gaza for treatment in Romanian hospitals and contribute to rebuilding key civilian institutions as leaders gathered in Washington, DC for the inaugural meeting of US President Donald Trump’s Board of Peace.
Dan opened his speech by thanking Trump for convening the meeting and for his leadership, describing the initiative as “a peace plan that has been comprehensive and stable,” and for his “efforts and results in other parts of the world.”
“I think everyone desires peace, stability and prosperity in Gaza,” he added, saying “the question is how to act."
On the humanitarian front, Dan said Romania is prepared to increase the number of flights to evacuate sick children from Gaza for treatment in Romanian hospitals, noting that the country has already carried out similar operations and could extend support to as many as 4,000 family members.
He added that Romania has strong expertise in emergency response systems, including ambulance and fire services, and can assist in rebuilding these systems while providing necessary infrastructure and equipment.
He added that Romania is “already offering some scholarships for Palestinian students” and can extend the program while also helping “to rebuild and refurbish the schools in Gaza.”
Highlighting institutional support as the most important contribution, Dan said Romania has prior experience in rebuilding core state institutions including the police, justice system and public administration in other parts of the world and is ready to provide experts and trainers to assist similar efforts in Gaza.
He also emphasized that Romania has “traditionally good relations with the Jewish people and with the Palestinian people,” which he said would help advance efforts toward peace, concluding his remarks by saying that Romania can be counted on.

A new Kenyan intelligence report has found that at least 1,000 Kenyans were recruited to fight for Russia in Ukraineafter allegedly being misled with false promises of jobs before being sent to the front lines.
The report was presented to parliament by Kimani Ichung’wah, who accused Russian embassy officials of colluding with work recruitment agencies to dupe Kenyans into believing they would be given skilled jobs in Russia.
Parliamentary leader Ichung’wah said the National Intelligence Service report shows that 89 Kenyans were on the front line, 39 were hospitalised, 28 were missing in action, others had returned home, and at least one was confirmed dead.
This comes as the European Union said it is not seeing any tangible signs from Russia of serious engagement to end the war after the latest round of peace talks in Geneva.
“We see that Russia continues its relentless attacks on Ukraine. This does reflect that Russia is not ready for peace. We still do not see tangible signs that Russia is engaging seriously in peace,” said European Commission spokesperson Anouar El Anouni.
The EU spokesperson added that “nothing can be decided about Ukraine without Europe at the negotiating table”.
EU says Russia showing ‘no tangible signs’ of serious engagement and ‘not ready for peace’
The European Union has said it is not seeing any tangible signs from Russia of serious engagement to end the war in Ukraine after the latest round of peace talks in Geneva.
“We see that Russia continues its relentless attacks on Ukraine. This does reflect that Russia is not ready for peace. We still do not see tangible signs that Russia is engaging seriously in peace,” said European Commission spokesperson Anouar El Anouni.
“Even this week, ahead of the peace talks, Ukraine experienced another massive missile and drone strike, according to Ukrainian authorities. As long as the bloodshed continues, we will continue to put pressure on Russia,” he said.
The EU spokesperson added that “nothing can be decided about Ukraine without Europe at the negotiating table”.
Zelensky says further steps on peace talks will be determined in meeting today
Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky has said he is set to hold a peace talks discussion with the members of his negotiating team after talks in Switzerland.
"Today all members of our negotiating group will already be in Ukraine, and for tomorrow I have scheduled a special meeting with them regarding our next steps and decisions. There will be a report here in Kyiv on those aspects of the negotiations that should not be discussed over the phone. We will also define the further framework of talks with our partners – the American side, the Europeans – and with the Russian side," he said.
Poland ends special refugee support system for Ukrainians
Polish president Karol Nawrocki has approved a legislation calling for an end to support measures for Ukrainian refugees entering Poland and moved help into the country’s general law for protection of foreigners seeking refuge.
The earlier legal framework was created when Russia launched a full-scale invasion on Ukraine in February 2022 and offered simplified residence, employment, access to social benefits, and education for Ukrainians fleeing the war.
“I sign this law with the conviction that it protects our state finances, streamlines the system, and restores a sense of basic justice," Karol Nawrocki said.
These provisions will now incorporate Ukrainians into a broader foreigner protection legislation and will create a unified temporary protection system that apply to all foreigners.
However, Poland will continue to extend the legal stay of Ukrainian nationals on their territory till 4 March, 2027.
The law also offers residency rights for Ukrainians already granted protection or whose documents were extended due to the war.
EU eager to start Kyiv membership talks 'as soon as possible'
The European Union is eager to begin Ukraine’s EU membership talks “as soon as possible”, European Council president António Costa said.
“I cannot say if it’s in 2027 or even in 2026 or later, but what is important is we cannot lose the momentum,” Costa said, speaking to reporters during a visit to Oslo.
The top official did not mention a specific date of Ukraine joining the bloc.
The US plan for an end to the war in Ukraine calls for Kyiv’s EU accession by January 2027, though experts generally consider that date highly unrealistic.
European intelligence chiefs do not see Ukraine peace deal as likely
European intelligence chiefs do not believe a deal to end Russia’s war in Ukraine will be reached in 2026, Reuters is reporting citing the heads of five intelligence services.
Trilateral talks this year have failed to see any significant progress, despite positive sounds from both sides following earlier meetings.
Four of the five senior intelligence officials said Moscow is using negotiations with the US to seek sanctions being lifted and to help business deals be concluded. They have described the talks in Geneva as “negotiation theatre”, one said.
It marks a striking difference in views between Europe and the White House, which says talks have been constructive.
"Russia is not seeking a peace agreement. They are seeking their strategic goals, and those have not changed," one European intelligence chief said.
Russia says it has 'no reason' to believe that India will stop buying its oil
Russia’s foreign ministry has said they have "no reason" to believe that India has changed its position on buying Russian oil.
The US president Donald Trump has repeatedly claimed that India has agreed to stop its crude oil imports from Russia.
“We have no reason to believe that India has changed its position on buying Russian hydrocarbons. India’s purchase of Russian hydrocarbons benefits both countries and helps maintain stability in the international energy market,” Foreign Ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharova said in her weekly briefing.
“There is nothing new in the claims of US president Donald Trump, as well as US Secretary of State Marco Rubio, who have grabbed the right to dictate to independent nations,” Ms Zakharova said.
However, Russian crude accounted for its smallest share of India’s oil imports since late 2022 in January, industry data showed.
India – the world’s third-largest oil importer and consumer – had sharply increased purchases of discounted Russian oil after Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine in 2022, with volumes exceeding 2 million barrels a day in some months.
But western sanctions and pressure to secure a trade deal with the United States have led New Delhi to scale back imports.
Since November, China has overtaken India as the largest buyer of Russia’s seaborne crude.
Ukraine's 2026 defence exports could hit 'several billion dollars', official says
Ukraine could export several billion dollars of military goods and services this year after authorising its first wartime foreign sales and is considering introducing a tax on those exports, a senior Ukrainian defence official said.
Earlier this month, the state commission handling related licences in wartime approved the majority of 40 applications from defence sector producers for exports of materiel and services, Davyd Aloian, deputy secretary of Kyiv's National Security and Defence Council, said in an interview to Reuters.
Ukraine halted weapons exports following Moscow's February 2022 invasion and has relied heavily on partners' arms supplies to defend itself against Russian forces.
At the same time, Kyiv poured resources into developing its armaments industry, particularly drones and missiles. Leveraging its vast battlefield experience, Ukraine has in recent years experienced a defence technology boom.
Asked about export potential for this year, Aloian said: "Taking into account ready-made products, spare parts, components, and services that can be provided, it amounts to several billion dollars."
Overall, the potential is "significantly higher" than pre-war exports, he said.
Zelensky tears into Putin over Ukraine-Russia peace talks: ‘I don’t need historical s**t’
Volodymyr Zelensky has torn into Vladimir Putin after the latest round of negotiations in Geneva failed to achieve a breakthrough.
The increasingly frustrated Ukrainian president lashed out at the Russia leader in a post on X and an interview with British journalist Piers Morgan.
“I don't need historical shit to end this war and move to diplomacy. Because it's just a delay tactic. I read no less history books than Putin,” the Ukrainian president said in a furious post on X.
The remarks came hours after hopes of a Ukraine peace deal looked further than ever Wednesday, when critical talks with Moscow and Washington ended in less than two hours.

Russia recruits over 1,000 Kenyans to fight in Putin’s war in Ukraine, intelligence report says
A new Kenyan intelligence report says that 1,000 Kenyans were recruited to fight for Russia in Ukraine after being misled with false promises of jobs in Russia before being sent to the front lines.
The report was presented to parliament on Wednesday by parliamentary leader Kimani Ichung’wah, who accused Russian embassy officials of colluding with work recruitment agencies to dupe Kenyans into believing they would be given skilled jobs in Russia. He said the Russian embassy officials issued them tourist visas.
The Russian Embassy in Kenya’s capital, Nairobi, denied the allegations, saying in a statement Thursday that it never issued visas to anyone intending to travel to Russia to fight in Ukraine. It added: “the Russian Federation does not preclude citizens of foreign countries from voluntarily enlisting in the armed forces.”

Russia demands proof Navalny was poisoned
Russia’s foreign ministry spokesperson has demanded that European nations accusing Russia of poisoning Alexei Navalany provide evidence.
“All the accusations against Russia were of the 'highly likely' variety. There were no specific details,” said Maria Zakharova.
“It was purely a proclamation to become the opening act of the Munich (security) conference and to overshadow the Epstein files.”
Britain, France, Germany, Sweden and the Netherlands said on Saturday that analyses of samples from Navalny's body had confirmed the presence of epibatidine, a toxin found in poison dart frogs in South America and not found naturally in Russia.

Colombian president defies high court, rallying thousands to defend minimum wage hike
Gustavo Petro calls for demonstrations after Colombia’s Council of State halts record pay increase
BOGOTA, Colombia
Thousands of Colombians took to the streets Thursday in a series of rallies and marches called by President Gustavo Petro.
The demonstrations were in response to a recent ruling by the Council of State -- Colombia’s highest administrative court --which provisionally suspended the government’s ambitious 23.7% minimum wage increase originally decreed in December.
While the capital, Bogota, served as the epicenter of the unrest, protests were also organized in other key cities including Cali, Medellin and Barranquilla.
In Bogota, the scale of the protests led to significant disruptions when demonstrators blocked major arteries, forcing the suspension of public transportation systems and leaving commuters caught in widespread traffic chaos.
By the afternoon, the various marches converged on the historic Plaza de Bolivar, where trade unions, workers' associations and representatives from Indigenous and Afro-Colombian communities gathered.
Addressing a sea of protesters from the heart of the capital, Petro took a hardline stance against the judicial suspension. He announced that his administration would maintain the minimum wage at two million pesos (around $544) -- the exact figure established in the December decree.
The president emphasized that he has not changed a "single digit" of the original increase. He argued that the wage hike is now bolstered by new, rigorous technical studies that justify the amount.
"We are not backing down," Petro declared to the cheering crowd. "We have signed the decree and officially submitted it back to the Council of State for reconsideration."
The Council of State’s intervention served as a "precautionary measure" following several lawsuits. The court pointed to potential legal flaws in the original December decree, specifically questioning whether the government ignored technical requirements mandated by Law 278 of 1996, which requires wage hikes to be balanced against current inflation, national productivity and concerns that excessive hikes could drive businesses into the informal sector.
As the "precautionary suspension" remains in place, the standoff between the executive branch and the judiciary continues to keep the country’s economic future in a state of high tension.

First royal arrest in centuries presents existential crisis for UK’s most powerful family
The arrest of Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor forces King Charles to choose the Crown over his own brother
Until Thursday morning, it had been nearly four centuries since the arrest of a senior British royal.
The arrest of Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor is a fresh nadir for “The Firm”, as the UK’s most powerful family tries to outrun a litany of setbacks and adapt to the 21st century.
In a measure of how much the monarchy has changed, a statement from the king offering full cooperation with the law made no mention of those family ties. Only four years ago, the late queen had rushed to the former prince Andrew’s aid, helping him to settle a sex-abuse suit linking him to Epstein - in which he denied any wrongdoing - for an undisclosed sum.
Charles, by contrast, outlined his “deepest concern” and promised Buckingham Palace’s “full and wholehearted support” for the authorities investigating his brother. “Let me state clearly,” he wrote: “The law must take its course.”

Trump directs release of government records on UFOs, extraterrestrial life
Move by US president follows his criticism of his predecessor over alleged disclosure of classified information
ISTANBUL
US President Donald Trump said Thursday that he has directed federal agencies to declassify and release government records pertaining to extraterrestrial life and other unexplained aerial phenomena.
“Based on the tremendous interest shown, I will be directing the Secretary of War, and other relevant Departments and Agencies, to begin the process of identifying and releasing Government files related to alien and extraterrestrial life, unidentified aerial phenomena (UAP), and unidentified flying objects (UFOs), and any and all other information connected to these highly complex, but extremely interesting and important, matters,” Trump wrote on his Truth Social platform.
Trump claimed earlier Thursday that his predecessor, former President Barack Obama, made classified information public when he confirmed the existence of extraterrestrial life.
"He gave classified information. He's not supposed to be doing that," he told reporters on Air Force One. "He made a big mistake. He took it out of classified information. No, I don't have an opinion on it. I never talk about it. A lot of people do. A lot of people believe it."
Trump said he "may get him out of trouble by declassifying" the information. It was unclear what information he was referring to when he alleged that Obama disclosed classified materials.
Interest in extraterrestrial life has grown in recent days after Obama said during a conversation with American podcast host Brian Tyler Cohen that aliens “are real.”
“They’re real, but I haven’t seen them,” he said on the podcast published Saturday, answering a question about extraterrestrials.
“They’re not being kept in Area 51; there’s no underground facility, unless there’s this enormous conspiracy and they hid it from the president of the United States,” he added.
Obama released a subsequent statement on the US social media platform Instagram in which he said he “was trying to stick with the spirit of the speed round.”
“Statistically, the universe is so vast that the odds are good there’s life out there,” he said. “But the distances between solar systems are so great that the chances we’ve been visited by aliens are low, and I saw no evidence during my presidency that extraterrestrials have made contact with us. Really!”
Area 51 is a highly classified US Air Force facility situated at Groom Lake in southern Nevada. While it has long been the subject of conspiracy theories involving extraterrestrials, its only officially acknowledged function is aircraft testing.

Iran warns US bases, assets 'legitimate targets' if it attacks

In this handout photograph released by the U.S. Navy on Feb. 6, 2026, Nimitz-class aircraft carrier USS Abraham Lincoln (CVN 72) and Arleigh Burke-class guided-missile destroyer USS Frank E. Petersen Jr. (DDG 121) sail in the Arabian Sea, on Feb. 6.
Iran on Thursday warned that U.S. bases, facilities and assets would be "legitimate targets" if the United States follows through on its military threats and attacks.
Amir Saeid Iravani, the Iranian ambassador to the United Nations, made the remarks in a letter to U.N. Secretary General Antonio Guterres and the president of the Security Council that was seen by AFP.
President Donald Trump has deployed warships, fighter jets and other military hardware to the Middle East as he seeks to block Iran from building a nuclear bomb, something Tehran says it is not pursuing.
The letter cited a social media post by Trump on Wednesday, where he said the United States may need to use UK military bases, including one on an Indian Ocean island, "should Iran decide not to make a deal."
"Such a belligerent statement by the President of the United States...signals a real risk of military aggression, the consequences of which would be catastrophic for the region and would constitute a grave threat to international peace and security," Iravani wrote in the letter.
He called for the Security Council -- the U.N.'s top decision-making body where Washington has veto power -- to "ensure that the United States immediately ceases its unlawful threats of the use of force."
The letter said Iran remains committed "to diplomatic solutions" and "on a reciprocal basis, addressing ambiguities regarding its peaceful nuclear programme."
But Iravani warned if Iran faced military aggression, "all bases, facilities, and assets of the hostile force in the region would constitute legitimate targets in the context of Iran's defensive response."
Trump has repeatedly threatened military action against Iran, citing a deadly crackdown on anti-government protesters last month then more recently over its nuclear program.
On Thursday, Trump said that Iran had at most 15 days to make a deal and again suggested that the United States would attack if failed to do so.
His comments followed talks on Tuesday in Geneva between U.S. envoys Steve Witkoff and the president's son-in-law Jared Kushner, who met indirectly with Iran's top diplomat, who said that there was progress.
A previous attempt at negotiations collapsed when Israel launched surprise strikes on Iran last June, beginning a 12-day war that Washington briefly joined to bomb Iranian nuclear sites.

Police detail seven-month operation behind UAH 400M drug seizure
This was announced by Dmytro Torhalo, Nead of the Department for Combating Drug-related Crime of the National Police, during a television broadcast, an Ukrinform correspondent reports.
“The preparation for the practical phase of this operation took almost seven months. Throughout this period, the National Police of Ukraine maintained direct communication with colleagues in Moldova and Poland, under the coordination of Europol. Europol enabled us to respond quickly to various challenges that arose during the documentation process,” Torhalo said.
He noted that throughout this phase, the National Police also involved other agencies, including the State Border Guard Service of Ukraine, the State Customs Service of Ukraine, and others.
When asked whether further arrests are expected and whether there is a risk that part of the criminal network may have remained undocumented, Torhalo assured that the National Police continues to work on the case.
He said the National Police has a clear action plan.
“I will not disclose the details of these actions due to the secrecy of the investigation, but I can assure you that we are moving in the right direction and will not stop here,” the head of the department emphasized.
The operation Rubikon was carried out in Ukraine, Poland, and Moldova, resulting in the seizure of 27 million doses of narcotics.
Torhalo also expressed confidence that criminal groups would attempt to rebuild the smuggling channel used to supply drug precursors into Ukraine. “That is why we will prevent this,” he said.
As previously reported by Ukrinform, the large-scale police operation Rubikon delivered the most significant blow to the drug trade in recent years, with law enforcement seizing illicit substances worth UAH 400 million.

Israeli tech entrepreneur says Gaza needs to reconnect to the world
Liran Tancman says Palestinian, Arab and US partners were brought together to deliver practical solutions for the region
WASHINGTON
Answering Gaza's needs requires reconnecting it to the world digitally and economically, an Israeli tech entrepreneur said Thursday.
Liran Tancman, a former Israeli Intelligence Corps official and a co-founder of the Israeli Cyber Command, was speaking during the inaugural meeting of the US-led Board of Peace in Washington, DC.
Since Oct. 7, 2023 as a result of Israel's attacks, most of the infrastructure in Gaza, including telecommunications, has been damaged or become unusable.
Gaza was once a vital trade hub between Asia and Europe, making this reconnection a return to its historical roots, said Tancman.
The National Committee for the Administration of Gaza (NCAG) is actively building a secure digital backbone and an open platform that enables e-payments, financial services, e-learning and health care while keeping users in control of their data, he noted.
He said this effort receives significant support from regional partners, noting that Palestinian, Arab and US partners were brought together to deliver practical solutions for the region.
In parallel, an Amazon-like logistics system is advancing to help Palestinians launch businesses, import goods globally and trade securely, he said.
This initiative will lower prices, drive growth and help transform Gaza into an open, transparent and corruption-free economic zone, he noted.
He said NCAG was also consulted on how to unlock Gaza's potential, yielding to a clear demand to replace corruption with an open, tax-free system.
Tancman was among the founders of the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF), which was established during Israel's months-long strict blockade of Gaza. GHF is known for attacks targeting civilians waiting for food at aid distribution centers.
He has also collaborated with the Tony Blair Institute for Global Change (TBI), which was mentioned in connection with a plan to relocate Gazans, but TBI rejected this previously.
Tancman also helped develop the concept of requiring Palestinians to undergo biometric vetting to receive aid as early as 2015, according to the pan-Arab news platform Daraj Media.
Human Rights Watch and the UN have strongly criticized this system, saying that aid distribution areas have been turned into de facto intelligence gathering and “targeting” points for the Israeli army.

Deadly California avalanche search to go over weekend
Sign up now: Get ST's newsletters delivered to your inbox
LOS ANGELES – The search for a ninth person believed killed in a huge avalanche
The bodies of eight people known to have died when they were engulfed in a wall of snow cannot be moved because of the storm pummelling the Sierra Nevada mountain range – and the risk of yet more avalanches.
“Due to hazardous weather conditions, avalanche victims cannot be safely extracted off the mountain today,” the Nevada County Sheriff’s office said on Facebook.
“Recovery efforts are expected to carry on into the weekend.”
Six people survived the tragedy
The group – four guides and 11 paying clients – was on its third day of a backcountry skiing trip on the 2,776m-high Castle Peak in the Lake Tahoe region of northern California, an area popular with mountain enthusiasts.
Late on Feb 19, in a statement reported by US media, families of six of the victims identified them as women who were “mothers, wives and friends, all of whom connected through the love of the outdoors”.
“They were passionate, skilled skiers who cherished time together in the mountains,” the families’ statement said, adding “we have many unanswered questions”.
The statement also noted that the women were “experienced backcountry skiers” who were “fully equipped with avalanche safety equipment”.
The six who survived – five clients and a guide – managed to call for help shortly after disaster struck, but white-out conditions and the risk of further snow slides meant rescue teams could not reach them for several hours.
Two had to be helped down and needed hospitalisation.
‘Enormous tragedy’
The US Forest Service said on Feb 19 that all the land it manages in the area will be shuttered for the next few weeks to help in the recovery operation.
“Due to the current instability of the snowpack and need to prioritise first responder access to the area, members of the public are prohibited from entering the closure area during search and rescue operations,” a statement said.
“In order to continue recovery operations, emergency personnel will need to use snow machines, aircraft, various other heavy equipment and possibly explosives to mitigate further environmental hazards to the safety of first responders conducting recovery efforts.”
The closure order will remain in effect until March 15.
In the aftermath of the accident, questions have been asked about why skiers were out on the mountain in such difficult conditions, with several feet of snow falling in a short period and experts warning of the risk of avalanches.
Expedition organisers Blackbird Mountain Guides on Feb 18 said all staff in the group were professionally trained, and urged people to avoid speculating about the circumstances.
“This was an enormous tragedy and the saddest event our team has ever experienced. In addition to mourning the loss of six clients, we also mourn the loss of three highly experienced members of our guide team,” company founder Zeb Blais said.
“Guides in the field are in communication with senior guides at our base, to discuss conditions and routing based upon conditions.
“There is still a lot that we’re learning about what happened. It’s too soon to draw conclusions, but investigations are under way.” AFP

Ukrainian women tell their stories of sexual violence by Russian soldiers
Sign up now: Get ST's newsletters delivered to your inbox
KYIV - Hundreds of Ukrainian women and girls have reported sexual violence
The actual number of victims
Some of the women say they have been impregnated by Russian soldiers and live with children who will forever remind them of their attackers. Others have told of being forced to serve as sex slaves for entire companies of Russian troops. Still others say their life became a waking nightmare after they were incapacitated and raped by Russian forces.
For Ukraine, the sexual violence is a largely hidden trauma. Advocates say many women are reluctant to file cases because they want to avoid stigma and painful memories, or because they live in territory that remains occupied by Russia and have little hope of legal redress.
The Kremlin has said many of the reports of sexual violence were groundless. It did not respond to a request for comment for this story.
Still, some women have broken the cycle of silence, helped by survivor groups, or motivated to shed light on what they call atrocities that Russia has used as a weapon of war.
Here are the stories of four of those women, three of whom asked that their full identities be withheld to protect their privacy.
On March 7, 2022, two weeks into Russia’s invasion, Ms Lesya, a 53-year-old economist, and her husband, Mr Sasha, heard a knock on their door, in a village near Kyiv, Ukraine’s capital. Two Russian soldiers burst in, she said.
One of them caught her and dragged her into a neighbour’s house, she recalled. “He raped me straight away,” Ms Lesya said. “The second one shot my husband in the stomach and leg while I was being raped.”
Four other Russian soldiers approached the house where she was being violated, she said. “I thought that was it for me – they had knives, rifles and grenades,” Ms Lesya recalled. But the soldiers stopped her attacker and pulled him away, she said.
She then searched for her husband, she said. She found him bleeding on the floor of another house. Neighbours were attempting first aid.
Ms Lesya begged the Russian troops to allow her to drive her husband to the hospital, she said, but they would not let her get in her car.
Mr Sasha died in Ms Lesya’s arms two days after he was shot, she said. One of his last utterances was “Thank God my father didn’t live to see this,” Ms Lesya recalled, devastated at the memory.
A doctor who investigated her husband’s death confirmed that he had died from gunshots to the abdomen during the Russian occupation. Ms Lesya filed a complaint with the prosecutor-general’s office accusing the Russian forces of rape, and criminal proceedings have begun.
Her husband’s death, she said, was worse than the rape.
She still lives in their house. Her car was stolen, then returned after Ukrainian soldiers pushed the Russian army out of the Kyiv region. It had been marked with a “V”, a symbol Russia has used in the war. She has not driven it since.
Ms Maria, a lawyer, often provided legal aid for Ukrainians living in territories occupied by Russia after an initial invasion in 2014. When the full-scale war began in 2022 and Russian troops took over her town in the southern Kherson region, Ms Maria was accused under Russian law of being “a threat to the security of the Russian Federation”, she said.
Ms Maria, who asked to be identified by a nickname in this article, was violently arrested in January 2023 by a group of masked men, she said, and was told she would be expelled from the region.
She and a male detainee were driven to the front line in the Zaporizhzhia region, she said. On the way, she said, she overheard a radio conversation in which one soldier said to another: “You can take the man; he’ll dig trenches and chop wood for you. As for the woman, do whatever you want with her.”
Ms Maria, 50, was shoved into a small farmhouse full of Russian soldiers, she said. There, she was forced to serve “as a slave”, she said, submitting to servicemen before they were sent into a fierce battle that was likely to be their last.
That day, “they got drunk, beat me, and two soldiers raped me”, she said.
A Russian major arrived the next morning, Ms Maria said, and found her injured and soiled, lying motionless on the floor. He told her that word of a woman’s presence near the front line had spread.
The only way to escape, the major told her, was to cross on foot to the Ukrainian side. “The officer had told me, ‘If you make it, light a candle for me. No one’s made it so far,’” she recalled.
Ms Maria walked through minefields, crawled through the ruins of a destroyed bridge and reached a Ukrainian checkpoint late at night.
“When I saw the first checkpoint, I dropped to my knees,” she said. “I hugged the soldiers and cried.”
Ms Iryna Dovgan, the director of SEMA Ukraine, a group that aids victims of wartime rape, confirmed that Ms Maria had provided testimony to the prosecutor’s office accusing Russian forces of rape, and that criminal proceedings had been initiated.
Because of her injuries, Ms Maria could not walk for several weeks, she said. She was also emotionally drained. She recently joined a support group for survivors of sexual violence. She spent weeks inside her house, she said, until one of the group’s members pulled her out. “I had completely shut down,” she said.
Ms Svitlana, 31, was already worried about her four-week-old son, who had been born in fragile health and had lost access to medical care after the Russian army invaded her village in southern Ukraine. Then, Russian soldiers stormed her home and threatened to kidnap the boy and take him to Russia, she said.
She intervened and they relented, she said. But even after that frightening encounter in March 2022, her partner, the baby’s father, began to befriend the troops. The father, a Russian sympathiser, invited them frequently into their home and drank with them, she said.
One day, as the men gathered, her partner forced her into a white van with two soldiers, she said. The soldiers put a mask over her face, she said, and drove her to a nearby village. Ms Svitlana’s partner stayed in the van while one of the soldiers forced her into a shop and raped her twice, she said.
There had been no way to resist, she said. The soldiers “had a grenade, a knife and a rifle”, she recalled.
Afterwards, Ms Svitlana’s partner accompanied her back to their house without saying a word, she said.
Six months later, she fled to another village with her baby and four other children from previous relationships. She and her partner had split up. But she soon noticed that her stomach was growing. A pregnancy test came back positive.
“I wanted to get an abortion,” she recalled. “I went to the hospital, but they said it was too late. I was 23 weeks pregnant.”
Ms Svitlana’s baby boy, Yaroslav, was born on March 8, 2023.
The regional prosecutor’s office is investigating the case, saying it received a report from a gynaecologist who treated her.
The child looks like her rapist, she said. She is seeing psychologists to help her come to terms with her situation.
“Yaroslav is developing faster than my other children. He already speaks fluently,” Ms Svitlana said. “Sometimes, I regret that I wanted the abortion. I love him almost like the others.”
When Russian troops occupied the city of Berdyansk in south-eastern Ukraine on the night of Feb 26, 2022, Ms Tetiana Tipakova decided to resist.
Ms Tipakova, 53, a former student leader and an entrepreneur, wrapped herself in a Ukrainian flag and organised anti-Russian protests. She delivered speeches in front of City Hall and recorded videos for social media.
Less than a month later, Russian troops grabbed Ms Tipakova inside her home. Eight armed men in balaclavas handcuffed her, put a bag over her head and drove her to a prison colony, she said.
“I knew that place. It was the worst of all the prisons” in Berdyansk, she said.
There, she was tortured for seven days, she said. On the fourth day, she said, she was driven to grounds outside the prison where guards had set up a mock execution by firing squad.
While detained, Ms Tipakova was subjected to psychologically and physically abusive interrogations, as well as to beatings and electric shocks. After “the electric current ran through my body”, she said, she started “constantly smelling burning hair.”
She said she was sexually assaulted by prison guards who violated her with their hands and with objects such as firearms.
The goal of the torture, she said, was to break her mentally and silence her, as well as to force her to spread Russian propaganda in Berdyansk.
The abuse continued, she said, until she agreed to film a social media video acknowledging that anti-Russian protests were a mistake. She was released and then fled to the city of Zaporizhzhia, where she now leads a charity that aids internally displaced persons.
Her story has become well known in Ukraine, shared widely on social media, and she was invited to testify in The Hague about human rights abuses in Russian-occupied territories. She regularly speaks at international conferences and works with a Ukrainian organisation that gathers the stories of wartime rape survivors. She said she hoped to shed light on Russian war crimes and bring perpetrators to justice. NYTIMES

Polish president vetoes key judicial reform bill, citing constitutional concerns
Move adds to standoff between President Nawrocki and Prime Minister Tusk’s pro-EU government
WARSAW
Polish President Karol Nawrocki vetoed a key government-backed bill Thursday reforming the National Council of the Judiciary (KRS), dealing a blow to the ruling coalition’s efforts to overhaul Poland’s justice system after years of rule-of-law disputes with the European Union.
Nawrocki rejected the bill on the grounds that it would undermine judicial stability and open the door to political interference in the courts.
“I cannot sign a law which, under the slogan of restoring the rule of law, in fact introduces a new stage of chaos and opens the way to political influence over judges,” he said.
He argued that the legislation would lead to the “segregation of judges” and violate the constitution.
The veto highlights the ongoing institutional standoff between Poland’s president and Prime Minister Donald Tusk’s pro-EU government, which has pledged to restore judicial independence and unlock EU funds frozen over rule-of-law concerns.
The veto had been widely expected, as the president has regularly criticized the justice reforms pursued by the governing coalition and Justice Minister Waldemar Zurek, whom he recently described as a “legal terrorist” in a television interview.
The vetoed bill was designed to change the composition and functioning of the KRS, the body responsible for nominating judges.
The government argues that reform is necessary to reverse changes introduced under the previous Law and Justice (PiS) party government, which critics say politicized the judiciary and weakened its independence.
Nawrocki rejected that reasoning, insisting that judges appointed under previous rules cannot be divided into categories such as “new” or “old” judges.
“In the Polish legal order, there are no ‘neo’ or ‘paleo’ judges,” he said, adding that questioning their status could cast doubt over millions of court rulings.
He also stressed that appointing judges is an exclusive constitutional prerogative of the president and cannot be reviewed by the government or justice minister.
Under Poland’s constitution, parliament can override a presidential veto only with a three-fifths majority, which the governing coalition currently lacks.

If Allan can’t get it together, she may not be leader come this year’s election

Opinion
If Allan can’t get it together, she may not be leader come this year’s election
Once, when politicians mostly answered questions and believed in accountability, there was a truism in journalism: the more a leader shouted, complained, dodged and abused, the closer you were to the truth.
Today, bullying is supposedly abhorred, particularly by some on the Left who have actually mastered the dark art and use it against anybody who disagrees or questions.
Which is why in these recent weeks it has been revealing to watch the behaviour of Premier Jacinta Allan.
She is rattled. You can see it in her eyes, hear it in her voice and smell it in her strategy as she blusters and bullies and bumbles her way through the Big Build scandal.
She has now blocked parliamentary discussion on changes to IBAC which would enable it to follow the money in one of the most important issues in Victoria in the past 50 years, the CFMEU’s involvement in the Big Build. She has refused to launch a royal commission despite wide pressure, and thrown several tantrums in media conferences under intense but fair questioning.
But this government does not answer questions, legitimate or otherwise, as the dodging and tantrums have shown.
When questioned on Thursday by an unusually aggressive gallery, the premier bullied her way through.
She spat out self-righteous anger and halted the press conference to demand a “retraction” when Channel 10 reporter Jessica Maggio suggested to Allan she looked “disinterested” in questions about victims of the CFMEU thuggery.
Her eyes and body language flashed with anger. She finally reneged and said Maggio’s silence was an indication of retraction. Nonsense.
This display was petulant, weak and harmed her. If a leader can’t calmly handle a pack of baying press hounds, they are scarcely fit to lead.
Today, Allan looks more like Dan Andrews Mark II than a leader sworn to transparency, honesty and working for the interests of the people.
The Andrews playbook was this: when a crisis developed he would downplay, deflect and abuse questioners or critics. It was strategic political bullying, and I won’t complain about experiencing it first hand. That’s the game.
Allan is now trying to do the same, but she is not very good at it. She also has a rattled caucus watching carefully to assess how she manages the toughest crisis of her time.
Victorian Labor Party rules make replacing the leader a drawn-out process involving a vote of parliamentary and branch members. But it is possible, although unlikely, that if she does not get this together, Allan will not lead into the next election.
If the polls get worse, there could be pressure on her to resign and for a new leader to be elected unopposed, dodging the new rules.
But that is speculation. Back to today’s mess. As is its way, the government spin machine has attempted to muddy the whole CFMEU issue, so let’s keep it simple:
There are credible allegations the public has been robbed of a staggering amount of money.
A decent government would accept that allegation, investigate it fully and try to track down where the money went.
Then, the ministers responsible for allowing this to happen on their watch would resign. But this is not a decent government.
Respected corruption investigator Geoffrey Watson, SC, has outlined allegations of a criminal web within the construction industry which may have taken $15- $30 billion out of Victorians’ pockets.
True, he has not presented forensic evidence, but he has put forward strong allegations which demand serious consideration and action from the government.
Watson is a distinguished barrister, not a conspiracy theorist or right-wing activist. He deserves respect. Instead he has been mocked and insulted by a government that stands accused of allowing corruption to thrive.
Victorian Police Minister Anthony Carbines accused Watson of chasing headlines and even “making things up”, which apart from being absurd and offensive could also keep the courts busy should Watson choose to act.
This scandal has worsened because a government that should have been ensuring the judicious spending of our money has instead constructed a defensive strategy designed to mislead and confuse the public and undermine allegations. That playbook again: downplay, deflect and attack the critics.
The premier has refused to adequately answer questions about how, as minister in charge of the Big Build from 2018, and then leader of the state since 2023, she knew nothing of what was going on.
There were two options: either she knew and ignored it, or did not know and was incompetent. Either way she’s accountable.
Labor strategists are watching this carefully. Social media is bristling with complaints about corruption. That’s Labor’s political guiding light. So they’re worried.
But let’s finish with another truism. It is said that a government will never call an inquiry unless it knows in advance what the outcome will be.
In this case, Allan may well be avoiding a royal commission because she knows exactly what the outcome would be.
It’s not unreasonable for any Victorian to argue that the $15 billion or more of taxpayers’ money allegedly siphoned off could have eased the crisis in hospitals, hired more police, fixed potholes and replaced crumbling fire trucks.
Then for them to shout at their leader: “Premier, just answer the bloody question!”

Trump says Obama 'gave classified information' when ex-president said aliens 'are real'
'He gave classified information. He's not supposed to be doing that,' Trump says of former President Barack Obama
WASHINGTON
US President Donald Trump claimed Thursday that his predecessor, Barack Obama, made classified information public when he confirmed the existence of extraterrestrial life.
"He gave classified information. He's not supposed to be doing that," Trump told reporters on Air Force One. "He made a big mistake. He took it out of classified information. No, I don't have an opinion on it. I never talk about it. A lot of people do. A lot of people believe it."
Trump said he "may get him out of trouble by declassifying" the information. It is unclear what information he is referring to when he alleges that Obama disclosed classified materials.
Obama said during a conversation with American podcast host Brian Tyler Cohen that aliens “are real.”
“They’re real, but I haven’t seen them,” he said on the podcast published Saturday, answering a question about extraterrestrials.
“They’re not being kept in Area 51; there’s no underground facility, unless there’s this enormous conspiracy and they hid it from the president of the United States,” Obama said.
Obama released a subsequent statement on the US social media platform Instagram in which he said he “was trying to stick with the spirit of the speed round.”
“Statistically, the universe is so vast that the odds are good there’s life out there,” he said. “But the distances between solar systems are so great that the chances we’ve been visited by aliens are low, and I saw no evidence during my presidency that extraterrestrials have made contact with us. Really!”
Area 51 is a highly classified US Air Force facility situated at Groom Lake in southern Nevada. While it has long been the subject of conspiracy theories involving extraterrestrials, its only officially acknowledged function is aircraft testing.

Türkiye ready to contribute to Gaza 'in every way possible': FM Fidan

Türkiye is ready to contribute to Gaza "in every way possible," Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan said Thursday.
"Our message is this: whether it's humanitarian aid, the administration of Gaza, infrastructure and superstructure services, or contributing to the (International) Stabilization Force, we are ready to provide all kinds of support in all these areas," Fidan told Anadolu Agency and TRT in the U.S. capital, Washington, DC.
His remarks came right after attending the inaugural Board of Peace meeting, which was presided over by U.S. President Donald Trump, bringing together representatives from more than 45 countries to discuss Gaza’s reconstruction and broader international stabilization efforts.
Fidan said the meeting, held at the level of heads of state and government, carried symbolic importance as its first session but also produced tangible commitments.
The minister stressed that member states, especially those contributing financially and potentially militarily to the International Stabilization Force, declared their commitments.
"In that sense, it was important in delivering concrete outcomes,” he added.
He described the gathering as a key milestone as Trump's Gaza plan enters its second phase, which focuses on reconstruction and restoring local governance structures.
Fidan emphasized that rebuilding Gaza requires not only physical reconstruction but also restoring functional local administrative bodies.
"The crucial point here is that as Gaza rebuilds, local government bodies need a serious renewal and capacity building in the essential services they provide to the people," he said, noting that much of Gaza’s infrastructure has been destroyed.
He highlighted ongoing coordination with the National Committee for the Administration of Gaza (NCAG), a 15-member technocratic body chaired by Ali Shaath, a Palestinian technocrat with extensive expertise in infrastructure, planning and public administration.
Fidan said Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan recently discussed governance and reconstruction plans with Shaath.
Türkiye, he added, stands ready to assist in health, education and other capacity-building services inside Gaza beyond immediate humanitarian relief.
The minister said Türkiye has maintained uninterrupted humanitarian efforts since the beginning of the crisis, mobilizing state institutions and civil society organizations.
Erdoğan remains committed to security stabilization and recovery in the Gaza Strip, Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan said during the inaugural Board of Peace meeting.
He said that “after two years of human suffering, (a) ceasefire in Gaza has been achieved, thanks to President Trump's personal engagement and our collective efforts.”
“Yet the humanitarian situation remains fragile, and ceasefire violations continue to occur. A prompt, coordinated and effective response is therefore essential,” said Fidan.
“President Erdogan remains fully committed to Gaza's security stabilization and recovery. Türkiye has already been providing (an) immense amount of humanitarian assistance to Gaza,” he said. “We can also contribute meaningfully to the rehabilitation of health and education sectors, as well as the training of the police force. In addition, we are prepared to provide troops to the International Stabilization Force.”
“Türkiye will continue to support your (Trump’s) efforts towards a just and lasting peace. We remain convinced that the foundation of such peace is a two-state solution. Let us work towards that objective for the benefit of all peoples of the region,” he added.
On Thursday, Fidan said a Turkish aid ship carrying supplies arrived at an Egyptian port en route to Gaza. Ankara is also seeking to send an initial 20,000 housing containers, he added.
In addition, Türkiye is continuing medical evacuations and operating field hospital services through its Health Ministry, he stressed.
As part of Gaza’s stabilization, Fidan said efforts are underway to establish a local police force capable of providing security and public services for more than two million residents.
"We have a commitment to provide training to the police force for this purpose. Our president also has the will to send troops to the stabilization force if the parties agree," Fidan added.
Türkiye, he said, will continue its efforts with “a strong sense of responsibility” to help secure lasting peace and stability in the region.

Greenland rare earths play shows strong magnetic pull for Eclipse

Greenland rare earths play shows strong magnetic pull for Eclipse
Brought to you by Bulls N’ Bears
Eclipse Metals’ first-pass metallurgical tests at its Grønnedal rare earths project in southwest Greenland have delivered encouraging confirmation that the critical minerals are well suited to magnetic separation, suggesting the potential for efficient beneficiation.
Phase one wet, magnetic separation tests on composite samples showed impressive results, delivering between 78 and 86 per cent recovery.
More than 90 per cent of the contained iron moved into the magnetic material, with only three to four per cent ending up in the final non-magnetic tail.
Critically, the majority of the rare earth minerals were captured in the magnetic material during testing, indicating that more than 90 per cent of the rare earths can be captured in the upgraded product.
Head assays across the seven composites, sourced from a 2023 drilling and trenching program, registered consistent rare earths grades, with neodymium ranging between 533 and 1828 parts per million (ppm), coupled with solid praseodymium numbers.
The test work has identified two clearly different types of rock chemistry. One is a high-iron, low-silica zone with higher rare earth grades and iron levels of 14 to 50 per cent, while the other is a silica- and alumina-rich zone that usually carries lower rare earth grades.
The company says these different domains offer optionality for tailored processing, blending, and optimisation to maximise efficiency and grade stability. And while the results are still early, the work has done its job as a first-pass test by providing a strong technical base to guide the next phase of testing.
The mineralisation’s predictable magnetic responses suggest that staged separation could remove a large amount of waste material before hydrometallurgy, potentially streamlining the production path.
Eclipse is now pressing ahead on phase two work, with representative quarter-core from the 2025 diamond drilling program already in Perth.
That work will include grind optimisation, staged wet magnetic separation refinement and assays on selected size or chemical fractions. Mineralogical work will also be conducted to pin down the rare earths hosts and evaluate additional separation pathways.
Eclipse’s Grønnedal project sits within the company’s broader Greenland critical minerals portfolio and is only 10km north of the company’s historic Ivigtût cryolite mine, where initial work has revealed a smorgasbord of other elements.
The close proximity of the two unusual deposits and their broad mineral spread positions the company to capitalise on growing global demand for rare earths and other critical elements in clean energy, defence and high-tech applications.
The early metallurgical work signals a green light for Grønnedal, showcasing the project’s favourable processing characteristics that could fast-track Eclipse towards a scalable rare earths play in a Tier-1 jurisdiction.
With phase two representative testwork underway and more data inflow to come, Eclipse Metals remarkable duo of Greenland projects is building real momentum.
Results from phase two metallurgical tests look likely to put another layer of icing on the cake.

Israeli foreign minister reiterates his condemnation of Hamas
Gideon Saar backs Trump plan, calls for disarmament and ‘deradicalization’ of Gaza
ISTANBUL
Israeli Foreign Minister Gideon Saar reiterated his condemnation of Hamas and other armed groups Thursday, invoking a narrative of victimhood as he endorsed US President Donald Trump’s Gaza plan during the inaugural meeting of the Board of Peace in Washington, DC.
Saar claimed that Israel had endured “a difficult war for two years on seven different fronts,” describing it as one fought “against pure evil: Hamas, Islamic Jihad and Hezbollah.”
Since the start of the Gaza genocide in October 2023, Israel has carried out airstrikes in Lebanon, Syria, Yemen and Iran.
Referring to the Oct. 7, 2023 events, when Hamas and other Palestinian groups launched a surprise, coordinated attack from the Gaza Strip into southern Israel, Saar said: “That terrible day will not be forgotten. And we must act to ensure it never repeats itself.”
Saar alleged that previous plans for Gaza failed because they did not address “the core issues: terror, hate, incitement and indoctrination.”
“At the heart of President Trump’s comprehensive plan are the disarmament of Hamas and Islamic Jihad, demilitarization of the Gaza Strip, and deradicalization of Palestinian society there,” he said, adding that Israel supports the plan and will work toward its success.
“Hamas must be disarmed,” Saar said.
He also stressed the need for a “fundamental deradicalization process.”
The Board of Peace was established within the framework of efforts toward a peaceful settlement in the Gaza Strip. It seeks to promote peacemaking around the world. Washington has said additional states have since joined the initiative.
A US-backed ceasefire agreement has been in place in Gaza since Oct. 10, halting Israel’s two-year onslaught that has killed more than 72,000 people, mostly women and children, and injured over 171,000 since October 2023.
Despite the ceasefire, Israeli forces have committed hundreds of violations through shelling and gunfire, killing 611 Palestinians and injuring 1,630, according to Gaza’s Health Ministry.

NEW YORK, February 20. /TASS/. US President Donald Trump is considering a large-scale strike on Iran's nuclear facilities, ABC TV reported, citing a source.
According to the source, the head of the Washington administration has reviewed several response options, including a powerful strike on nuclear, military and government facilities.
Earlier, The Wall Street Journal reported, citing sources, that Trump was also weighing a limited strike on Iranian military and government targets to pressure Tehran into accepting a nuclear deal favorable to Washington while avoiding a full-scale attack. Officials said such a strike could be launched within days.
The report noted that the US leader has not yet made a final decision on an attack against Iran. On Thursday, Trump said he would give Iran no more than 15 days to reach an agreement.

Iran’s response to any aggression to be decisive: Envoy

He condemned recent statements by the US president as violations of international law, urging immediate action to prevent further escalation and warning that Iran will exercise its inherent right to self-defense under the UN Charter if attacked.
In a formal letter to Secretary-General of the United Nations Antonio Guterres and President of the UN Security Council James Kariuki on February 19, Saeed Iravani cited the repeated and explicit US threats of the use of force, including references to potential military operations launched from Diego Garcia and other regional bases.
The Iranian envoy asserted that such statements constitute a breach of Article 2(4) of the Charter of the United Nations and risk destabilizing an already volatile region.
While reaffirming Iran’s commitment to diplomacy and ongoing nuclear negotiations conducted within the framework of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, Iravani called on the Security Council to fulfill its primary responsibility for maintaining international peace and security and to prevent the normalization of unlawful threats and potential acts of aggression.
What follows is the full text of his letter:
In the Name of God, the Most Compassionate, the Most Merciful
Excellencies,
Upon instructions from my Government, and with reference to our previous letters dated 30 December 2025 and 2, 9, 13, 22, and 28 January 2026 regarding the persistent threat of the use of force by the United States of America against the Islamic Republic of Iran, I write further to draw your urgent attention, and that of the members of the Security Council, to the continued threats by officials of the United States to resort to the use of force-including the recent public statement by the President of the United States concerning the use of the Diego Garcia base in connection with a potential military attack against the Islamic Republic of Iran-which constitute a flagrant violation of the Charter of the United Nations and international law and risk plunging the region into a new cycle of crisis and instability.
On 18 February 2026, in a social media post, the President of the United States once again issued an explicit public threat of the use of force against the Islamic Republic of Iran and stated: "... Should Iran decide not to make a deal, it may be necessary for the United States to use Diego Garcia, and the Airfield located in Fairford, in order to eradicate a potential attack...."
Given the volatile situation in the region and the persistent movement and build-up of military equipment and assets by the United States, such a belligerent statement by the President of the United States must not be treated as mere rhetoric; it signals a real risk of military aggression, the consequences of which would be catastrophic for the region and would constitute a grave threat to international peace and security.
The Islamic Republic of Iran remains fully committed to the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations and to diplomatic solutions. It has engaged constructively, with seriousness and in good faith, in nuclear talks with the Government of the United States, with a view to clearly conveying its concerns and demanding the full and verifiable lifting of the unlawful and inhumane unilateral coercive measures (UCMs) imposed against the Iranian nation, while, on a reciprocal basis, addressing ambiguities regarding its peaceful nuclear programme, in order to reach a mutually acceptable, results-oriented solution fully consistent with the recognized inalienable rights of all States parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT).
The Islamic Republic of Iran remains of the view that, should the United States likewise approach these talks with seriousness and sincerity and demonstrate genuine respect for the principles of the Charter of the United Nations and the peremptory norms of international law, the achievement of a durable and balanced solution would be entirely possible.
Against this backdrop, the Islamic Republic of Iran calls upon Your Excellency and all members of the Security Council, consistent with the Council's primary responsibility under the Charter of the United Nations for the maintenance of international peace and security, to fully utilize the Council's authority and good offices to ensure that the United States immediately ceases its unlawful threats of the use of force, complies with its obligations under the Charter- particularly Article 2 (4)-and refrains from any action that could further escalate tensions or lead to a military confrontation, the consequences of which would be severe and far-reaching for regional and international peace and security.
The Security Council and the Secretary-General must act without delay, before it is too late. The Security Council must not allow threats of the use of force and acts of aggression to be normalized, legitimized, or treated as an acceptable political norm, or to be used as instruments of foreign policy. Should such unlawful conduct be left unaddressed, another sovereign Member State's turn will soon come.
The Islamic Republic of Iran has repeatedly stated at the highest level that it neither seeks tension nor war and will not initiate any war. However, in the event that it is subjected to military aggression, Iran will respond decisively and proportionately in the exercise of its inherent right of self-defense under Article 51 of the Charter of the United Nations. In such circumstances, all bases, facilities, and assets of the hostile force in the region would constitute legitimate targets in the context of Iran's defensive response. The United States would bear full and direct responsibility for any unpredictable and uncontrolled consequences.
I should be grateful if you would have the present letter circulated as an official document of the Security Council.
Please accept, Excellencies, the assurances of my highest consideration.

Türkiye to set up 100 prefabricated homes for disaster-hit families in northern Lebanon
Move follows deadly building collapse in Tripoli as Ankara pledges continued humanitarian support
BEIRUT/ISTANBUL
Türkiye has announced that it is ready to set up 100 prefabricated housing units in the northern Lebanese city of Tripoli to support families affected by a recent disaster.
On Feb. 8, at least 14 people were killed and eight others were rescued after a residential building collapsed in Tripoli.
A meeting was held at the governorate headquarters with the participation of Türkiye’s Ambassador to Lebanon Murat Lutem, Acting Governor of Tripoli and North Lebanon Iman Al-Rafai, Tripoli Mayor Abdul Hamid Karimeh and Wael Zmerly, president of the Union of Al-Fayhaa Municipalities.
Following the incident, Karimeh said many buildings in the city face the risk of collapse due to negligence, describing Tripoli as effectively a “disaster zone.”
Speaking to an Anadolu, Lutem said the Lebanese government has been working around the clock to provide necessary support to neighborhoods affected by the disaster in Tripoli.
“We aim to contribute to these efforts with our support. Türkiye will continue to stand by Lebanon,” he said, reiterating that Ankara is ready to provide all necessary assistance to help heal the wounds caused by the disaster.
Discussions focused on damaged structures following the recent building collapse in Tripoli, the evacuation of high-risk buildings, and the rapid provision of logistical support to affected families.
Lutem said Türkiye is ready to set up 100 prefabricated housing units for families whose homes were destroyed or heavily damaged, adding that Ankara will continue supporting the Lebanese people through its humanitarian institutions.
He said the assistance will also include training for civil defense and search-and-rescue teams along with equipment support.
Lebanese authorities said that over the past week, a total of 229 families have been evacuated from 21 buildings at risk of cracking or collapse in the city.
Officials from Türkiye’s Foreign Ministry, the Disaster and Emergency Management Authority (AFAD) and the Turkish Red Crescent also attended the meeting.
Lutem and his delegation later met with Lebanese Social Affairs Minister Haneen Sayed and the Secretary-General of the Higher Relief Commission, Bassam Nabulsi.
In a statement posted on the US social media company X’s platform, Sayed said the Turkish delegation held talks in Beirut to address the latest developments in Tripoli and described the offer to provide 100 prefabricated homes as a significant contribution to urgent shelter needs.

Anadolu’s recap of top stories from around the globe
ISTANBUL
Here’s a rundown of all the news you need to start your Friday, including Iran warning the UN that it will respond “decisively” to any US aggression, US President Donald Trump saying clarity on a new Iran deal is coming in 10 days, a report that Trump is considering a limited strike to pressure Tehran on nuclear talks, and five countries committing troops to the new Gaza International Stabilization Force.
TOP STORIES
Iran's permanent mission to the UN warned that Iran will respond "decisively and proportionately" to any military aggression, stressing that the United States would bear "full and direct responsibility" for the consequences, according to a letter obtained by Anadolu.
"The Islamic Republic of Iran has repeatedly stated at the highest level that it neither seeks tension nor war and will not initiate any war," it said in the letter addressed to UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres and the presidency of the UN Security Council.
US President Donald Trump said it would soon become clear whether a deal with Iran is possible, warning that Washington may be forced to escalate if negotiations fall short.
"We may have to take it a step further, or we may not," he said at the inaugural meeting of the Board of Peace in Washington, adding that the situation would likely become clearer "over the next probably 10 days."
US President Donald Trump is considering a limited military strike on Iran in a bid to pressure Tehran into agreeing to a new nuclear deal, a report said.
The Wall Street Journal, citing people familiar with the matter, said the initial operation — if approved — could take place within days and would target a limited number of military or government sites. The move is said to be designed to intensify pressure on Iran while stopping short of a full-scale attack that could provoke major retaliation.
If Iran refuses to comply with Trump’s demand to halt its nuclear enrichment activities, Washington could escalate its response to a broader campaign against regime facilities, potentially aimed at destabilizing the leadership in Tehran, the report added.
The commander of the Gaza International Stabilization Force (ISF) announced that five countries have committed troops to serve in the nascent security body.
Maj. Gen. Jasper Jeffers, speaking at the Board of Peace's inaugural meeting in Washington, said Indonesia, Morocco, Kazakhstan, Kosovo and Albania pledged troops, while Egypt and Jordan would train police forces.
Jeffers also announced that Indonesia accepted the position of deputy commander of the force.

Epstein estate agrees to $44 million settlement in victim class action
Sign up now: Get ST's newsletters delivered to your inbox
Jeffrey Epstein’s estate has agreed to pay as much as US$35 million (S$44.43 million) to resolve a class action lawsuit that accused two of the disgraced financier’s advisers of aiding and abetting his sex trafficking of young women and teenage girls
Boies Schiller Flexner, a law firm representing Epstein victims, announced the settlement in a brief filed in federal court in Manhattan.
The deal, if approved by a judge, would bring an end to a 2024 lawsuit filed against Epstein’s former personal lawyer Darren Indyke and former accountant Richard Kahn, who are co-executors of Epstein’s estate.
Epstein’s estate previously set up a restitution fund that paid out US$121 million to victims. The estate also paid out US$49 million in additional settlements to victims.
Neither Indyke nor Kahn “made any admission or concession of misconduct” as part of the settlement made public on Feb 19, their lawyer Daniel Weiner said in an e-mailed statement.
“Because they did nothing wrong, the co-executors were prepared to fight the claims against them through to trial, but agreed to mediate and settle this lawsuit in order to achieve finality as to any potential claims against the Epstein Estate,” Mr Weiner said.
Mr Weiner said the settlement would provide “a confidential avenue for financial relief” for Epstein victims who have not already resolved claims against the estate.
Epstein died in a New York jail in August 2019. His death was ruled a suicide.
In the 2024 lawsuit, lawyers at Boies Schiller Flexner said Indyke and Kahn helped Epstein create a complex web of corporations and bank accounts that let him hide his abuses, and pay victims and recruiters, while leaving them “richly compensated” for their work.
The Boies law firm previously helped obtain US$365 million of settlements with JPMorgan Chase

Trump says Gaza war ‘is over’, but analysts warn fighting could resume within weeks
Observers say the unresolved question of Hamas’ disarmament leaves the fragile truce vulnerable to collapse
At the gathering in Washington on Thursday, attended by top officials from more than 20 countries, promises of reconstruction and a “bright future” for Gaza were coupled with blunt US warnings that the alternative to disarmament would be a return to war.
Outside the meeting, Israeli officials reinforced that message, setting out a 60-day timetable for Hamas to disarm and reiterating that no rebuilding would begin before demilitarisation – conditions that observers said could put Gaza back on a path to open conflict.
But “if they don’t, it’ll be, you know, they’ll be harshly met,” he added, while also saying the group deserved “credit” for locating and returning all the bodies of Israeli captives in Gaza.
US Secretary of State Marco Rubio warned that there was no alternative to Trump’s plan for Gaza.

Some EU countries oppose EC plans to expand staff by 2,500 employees — media

BRUSSELS, February 20. /TASS/. The European Commission's plans to expand its staff by 2,500 employees under the seven-year EU budget framework for 2028-2034 have drawn sharp criticism from nine EU member states, Politico reports.
In a letter addressed to Budget Commissioner Piotr Serafin, EU ministers described the European Commission's request for an additional €1.4 billion to hire new staff and strengthen administrative capacity as inappropriate.
"We expect the Commission to present ambitious, quantified proposals as a direct input for ongoing negotiations on the next MFF (Multiannual Financial Framework - TASS), including on an EU administrative system that reflects the challenges of our times," says the letter, signed by ministers from Austria, the Czech Republic, Denmark, Germany, Estonia, Latvia, Sweden, Finland and the Netherlands.
In this regard, "the proposed increase [from the Commission] of 2,500 posts as well as the overall significant increase of heading 4 (administration) runs counter to the stated objectives of efficiency, restraint and reform, and risks undermining the credibility of the broader MFF proposal," the letter authors point out.
"The European Commission’s credibility in asking Member States for budgetary discipline very much depends on adhering to its own principles," the appeal states.

Iran warns UN it will respond 'decisively' if US launches military aggression
'The Security Council and the Secretary-General must act without delay, before it is too late,' says letter by Iranian mission
HAMILTON, Canada
Iran's permanent mission to the UN warned that Iran will respond "decisively and proportionately" to any military aggression, stressing that the United States would bear "full and direct responsibility" for the consequences, according to a letter obtained Thursday by Anadolu.
"The Islamic Republic of Iran has repeatedly stated at the highest level that it neither seeks tension nor war and will not initiate any war," it said in the letter addressed to UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres and the presidency of the UN Security Council.
"However, in the event that it is subjected to military aggression, Iran will respond decisively and proportionately in the exercise of its inherent right of self-defense under Article 51 of the Charter of the United Nations," it added.
The mission warned that "all bases, facilities, and assets of the hostile force in the region would constitute legitimate targets in the context of Iran’s defensive response," stressing that "the United States would bear full and direct responsibility for any unpredictable and uncontrolled consequences."
The letter cited a Feb. 18 social media post by US President Donald Trump that was described as "an explicit public threat of the use of force" against Iran, referencing the potential use of military facilities in Diego Garcia and the RAF Fairford base in England.
Urging immediate action by the UN, the letter said: "The Security Council and the Secretary-General must act without delay, before it is too late."
Iran described US threats as signaling "a real risk of military aggression, the consequences of which would be catastrophic for the region and would constitute a grave threat to international peace and security."
Reaffirming its commitment to diplomacy, Iran's UN mission expressed full commitment "to the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations and to diplomatic solutions" and has engaged "constructively, with seriousness and in good faith, in nuclear talks with the Government of the United States."

Singapore busker ‘stunned like a vegetable’ after ex-PM Lee spotted at performance
Lee Hsien Loong attended Bryan Wong’s show at Rainforest Wild Asia, creating a viral moment with the street performer
The 29-year-old acrobatics artist was performing his Circles In Circus act at Rainforest Wild Asia when he spotted Lee and his wife, Ho Ching, watching from the crowd.
In a video later posted to social media, Wong zoomed in to Lee’s face, joking: “Sir, I’m sorry, I’m going to zoom in to your face, thank you very much!” and a smiling Lee was seen waving back.
“Stunned like a vegetable,” Wong captioned the clip, helpfully reminding followers that the senior minister was also Singapore’s former prime minister.
And, no, he was not performing at an event where he had expected Lee to show up.
Wong shared that when he spotted Lee in the audience, he was internally debating whether he should acknowledge him.

Andrew’s arrest shows the power of a 24-hour newsroom
Many of you will have woken up to our extensive coverage of the arrest of Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor on suspicion of misconduct in public office over his links to Jeffrey Epstein and concerns that he leaked confidential government documents.
The news junkies among you will have spotted reports of the arrest as it broke on Thursday evening, when our world team and overnight homepage producers quickly swung into action, producing a live blog, a “trunk” news story, some quick analysis from Europe correspondent David Crowe, and a what you need to know article that hopefully answers all your key questions.
With events such as this, we really see the benefit of being a 24-hour news organisation, with journalists based in the US and UK ensuring subscribers wake up to the latest comprehensive coverage of events.
As our former chief political correspondent in Canberra, Crowe has extensive experience in covering big political crises – and his expertise in distilling the key facts of a story and providing balanced and insightful analysis while others are still scrambling to catch up makes him the best in the business.
The royal family has quickly moved to try to cauterise any damage to the institution from Mountbatten-Windsor’s arrest, with King Charles saying the “law must take its course”, and confirming that authorities have “our full and wholehearted support and co-operation”. The sight of the King attending a fashion show as Mountbatten-Windsor was being driven from a police station in the back of a car was both confronting and surreal.
The impact and fallout from this arrest will be a significant news event that will take weeks, months and maybe even years to come to terms with – and it’s a story you can be reassured we will stay on top of.
It has been a busy time for our world desk, who have been closely monitoring the build-up of US weapons in the Middle East over past days as President Donald Trump threatens Iran over the future of its nuclear program. Despite Trump giving Iran a 10-day deadline to abandon its ambitions to have nuclear weapons or face military strikes, experts say a move could happen any time from this weekend. So watch this space.
Before the news of Mountbatten-Windsor’s arrest broke last night, I had intended to write to you about yet another of Pauline Hanson’s extraordinary outbursts this week about Muslims in general, and Lakemba in particular.
The Queensland senator began the week with an interview in which she asked, “How can you tell me there are good Muslims?”
Then she doubled down on Wednesday, singling out Lakemba when pressed to name parts of the country people “can’t go into” without feeling unwelcome or unsafe.
These comments are offensive, dangerous, ignorant and clearly wrong. So, should we have ignored them, as some of our readers have suggested? I don’t think this is really an option, as Hanson is a public figure of some importance, with the Herald’s latest opinion poll showing the party has drawn level with the Coalition.
Our Canberra bureau noted that Prime Minister Anthony Albanese labelled the remarks “disgraceful”, but we decided it would be worthwhile asking the people of Lakemba what they thought. Patrick Begley visited the suburb on Thursday with photographer Sam Mooy, where visitors and residents alike, including local pharmacist Fatma Youssef (pictured below), provided a big thumbs down for Hanson’s comments, plus a positive assessment of a suburb that will be jammed with visitors and locals happily mixing on the streets during the Ramadan night markets this weekend and beyond.
Hopefully, that’s enough said on that topic, and we can all move on to more positive and constructive debates that will build a better and more unified Australia.

DIU conducts tactical control exercises for future Air Assault and Marine Corps officers
The DIU reported this on Facebook, releasing a video from the exercises, according to Ukrinform.
During the training, graduating cadets practiced assaulting a fortified position defended by special forces of the DIU Khymera unit.
“Modern warfare requires officers to be capable of making decisions under real combat conditions. Training that involves combat units helps close the preparation gap: cadets operate against an adversary that fights according to modern standards and gain experience that is directly relevant to the battlefield,” the DIU said.
It is emphasized that cooperation between the DIU and the Odesa Military Academy is an important contribution to training the officer corps of Ukraine’s Air Assault Forces and Marine Corps.
After such exercises, officers arrive at their units ready for combat operations – with a clear understanding of a commander’s responsibility, unit cohesion, and the cost of every decision.
As previously reported by Ukrinform, a project aimed at collecting the experience of Ukraine’s best military instructors was launched in Ukraine in recent days.

‘If you get what I mean’: Anti-lockdown activist’s ‘vote harvesting’ ploy

‘If you get what I mean’: Anti-lockdown activist’s ‘vote harvesting’ ploy
An anti-lockdown campaigner has launched a supposedly environmental party in an apparent attempt to game Victoria’s upper house voting system by harvesting preferences for conservatives like One Nation.
Monica Smit, founder of COVID-19 conspiracy group Reignite Democracy, lamented on social media that “freedom” supporters had not acted strategically as she launched her “Save the Environment Party” as a cheap and easy way to influence November’s state election result.
“One of the tactics used in preference whispering is creating minor parties with catchy names so that uneducated voters see a name they like and put a one next to it, and they have no idea that this is actually just harvesting votes for someone else,” Smit said in a social media video on Wednesday.
“We have finally decided to be strategic – if you get what I mean.”
Smit called on her followers to become members of the party so she could register with the Victorian Electoral Commission. Then, she said, she could cut preference deals to help One Nation, former Queensland senator Gerard Rennick’s People First, the Libertarian Party or Family First.
But when contacted by The Age, Smit insisted it was not a front, saying: “It’s a real party, with real policies.”
Victoria is the last jurisdiction in Australia with the controversial group voting system, which allows micro parties to pool preferences from Victorians who vote above the line on the ballot paper for the upper house. Candidates can leapfrog more popular parties through deals that have elected candidates who received less than 1 per cent of the vote.
So-called preference whisperer Glenn Druery is the most prominent player in this system, charging minor and micro parties to arrange sophisticated preference deals.
Before the 2022 election, the Herald Sun obtained leaked video in which Druery privately boasted about creating a sham party to redirect preferences.
“So keeping that story in mind, I have very exciting news. I have started a new minor party in Victoria called Save the Environment Party,” Smit said in her social media video.
“If I can create a group voting ticket to help other conservative parties — like One Nation, or Libertarians, or the Family First Party, or Gerard Rennick’s party — and if my party, Save the Environment Party, doesn’t get any candidates elected, I will be so glad to be able to help those other parties with any votes that I happen to get on election day.”
Yet Smit later maintained the party was genuine.
“We genuinely do care about the environment, and our policies reflect the party’s title,” Smit told The Age. “I wouldn’t use the word ‘harvest’, that sounds manipulative.”
She said she had not had conversations with other parties yet, but that 220 people had joined within 36 hours. She said she intended to register the party next week once it reached the threshold of 500 members, who would be checked by the electoral commission.
The Age last year revealed the government was considering abolishing group voting tickets, widely regarded as undemocratic, in time for the November election. Labor sources unable to speak publicly still expected the government to act.
One Nation state president Warren Pickering confirmed the party had not discussed preferences with Smit, but did not rule it out. He said One Nation would turn to “shenanigans with group voting tickets” later in the year.
The party opposes the group voting system as a subversion of the democratic process, but Pickering said he understood Smit’s rationale to counter Druery if it did remain in place for the election.
The Libertarian Party and Family First have previously worked with Druery. Rennick’s People First party is not registered in Victoria but has signalled its intention to.
Libertarian MP David Limbrick said his party wasn’t aware of Smit’s new project and was focused on its own campaign and candidates. But the party is “open to discussions with anybody”, he said.
“Glenn [Druery] is not working for our party, and it remains to be seen how preferences will work at the next election.”
The Victorian Greens, who usually fare the worst from group voting, have brought their own bill to parliament to abolish the system.
Greens leader Ellen Sandell said the supposedly environmental party was “the epitome of how deeply rigged this system is”.
“If you care about the environment, One Nation is the absolute last place you would want your vote to end up,” Sandell said.
“If Labor doesn’t fix this rigged ‘preference whispering’ system before November, then there’s a real risk our upper house will be controlled by the likes of One Nation and far-right parties.”
In a video on Friday, Smit said the party’s name would attract votes from people that normally wouldn’t support parties she hoped to cut preference deals with.
“That’s just the system that’s available to us. It’s about time we use the system, if you know what I mean.”
She claimed to know of other minor parties being established “with really great names”. “It’s going to be an interesting election,” she said, winking.
The Save the Environment Party website purports its policies include: supporting controlled burns to manage bushfire fuel; opposing brumby culls but backing wild boar hunting; opposing large-scale and foreign-owned renewable energy projects; that national parks should be accessible; and that corporations should be more responsible for plastic waste.
The Animal Justice and Legalise Cannabis parties support abolishing group voting tickets only if accompanied by bigger reform such as replacing the eight regions with a single statewide electorate, as is used in NSW and Western Australia. But changing the structure in this way would require a referendum.
Other minor parties in the upper house oppose the change entirely, arguing it would result in less diversity in the parliament.
The Victorian government is considering the parliament’s electoral matters committee recommendations, including the abolition of group voting, a spokeswoman said.
Druery declined to comment. Family First and People First were contacted on Friday.

Hong Kong airport’s Terminal 2 projected to serve 15 million travellers this year
Airport Authority says 15 airlines are scheduled to operate from the terminal, set to fully open in May, with a midterm goal of doubling its capacity
Hong Kong International Airport’s second terminal, set to fully open in May, is projected to serve 15 million travellers by the end of this year, with a midterm goal of increasing capacity to 30 million.
The target was revealed by Rock Chen Chung-nin, lawmaker and board member of the Airport Authority, who said on Friday that the 15 airlines scheduled to operate from the terminal would primarily be budget and newer carriers flying short-haul routes.
The carriers would include Hong Kong Airlines, HK Express and Greater Bay Airlines, along with several others that mainly fly routes to Southeast Asia, Chen said.
“The counters of these airlines in Terminal 1 will be vacated, potentially making room for more long-haul flights or business travellers,” he said.
Chen added that the revamped terminal would feature a higher level of technology and more self-service kiosks compared with the first terminal.
“Terminal 2 caters to younger travellers who are more technologically advanced,” he told a radio programme. “If we operate more long-haul flights or cater to business travellers, they will be operating in Terminal 1.”
With fewer counters, passengers at the revamped Terminal 2 would be able to check in and drop off their luggage themselves, making the process more flexible, Chen said.

LONDON – The Thames Valley Police, the force that arrested Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor on Feb 19
But like any British police force, the force must also investigate crimes reported to have taken place in its territory.
That means the investigation into potential misconduct in public office by Mountbatten-Windsor
In fact, it was law enforcement officials from the Thames Valley force who arrested Mountbatten-Windsor on the morning of Feb 19.
Day to day, the force’s officers provide armed teams and mounted officers to guard Windsor Castle and the crowds of tourists and locals who frequently gather for events in the town of Windsor, which is about 40.2km west of London.
The force covers more than 2,200 square miles (5,698 kq km) of territory in South East England, which encompasses Windsor Castle and the stately home known as Chequers, which belongs to the prime minister and frequently hosts royals and international dignitaries.
When US President Donald Trump was entertained at both of those locations during his lavish state visit in September, the Thames Valley Police carried out one of the biggest protective security operations in British history for the occasion, deploying drones, snipers, sniffer dogs, horses and boat teams.
Many of the 43 regional police forces in England and Wales cover just one city or county, but the Thames Valley Police – one of Britain’s largest forces, with about 5,000 officers according to the latest government figures – is responsible for Buckinghamshire, Berkshire and Oxfordshire, which have more than 2.3 million residents.
The Thames Valley Police is one of several British police forces investigating potential offenses relating to the Epstein files.
London’s Metropolitan Police in February began an investigation into a former British government minister, Mr Peter Mandelson – also in relation to potential misconduct in public office.
It is also making initial inquiries regarding accusations that an unnamed protection officer had turned a “blind eye” during visits to the private island in the Caribbean that Jeffrey Epstein owned.
The Surrey Police has called for any witnesses to allegations of child sexual abuse in the 1990s to come forward, and several forces that host airports used by Epstein’s private jet are assessing information in the files.
In a statement on Feb 18, Britain’s National Police Chiefs’ Council said a coordination group was supporting the regional forces to “seek information from overseas law enforcement agencies”.
It added that “policing and its law enforcement partners are taking this matter extremely seriously and will assess all information thoroughly.” NYTIMES

Asian shares are mixed, US futures edge higher as AI fears drag Wall Street lower
Shares are mixed in Asia as worries over risks linked to massive investments in artificial intelligence and a potential U.S.-Iran conflict weigh on major benchmarks
- Bookmark
Shares were mixed Friday in Asia as worries over risks linked to massive investments in artificial intelligence and a potential U.S.-Iran conflict weighed on major benchmarks.
U.S. futures edged higher, while oil prices resumed their ascent. Crude prices have been climbing as both the United States and Iran signal they are prepared for war if talks on Tehran’s nuclear program fizzle out.
Tokyo’s Nikkei 225 fell 1.2% to 56,797.22 as shares in major banks and other financial institutions skidded on worries over the potential impact of weakening private credit companies that have lent to companies exposed to the risk that AI will steal away their businesses.
That includes market heavyweights like Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group, which has a partnership with Blue Owl Capital, one such private-credit company. MUFJ's shares dropped 2.6% in Tokyo after Blue Owl lost 5.9% on Thursday.
Toyota Motor Corp. fell 3.9% and Sony was down 3.3%.
In Hong Kong, the Hang Seng lost 0.6% to 26,544.62 as the market reopened following Lunar New Year holidays. Markets in mainland China and Taiwan remain closed until next week.
South Korea's Kospi jumped 2.2% to 5,803.40, however, led by major defense contractors like Hanwha Aerospace, whose shares soared 8.6%. The company is one of many benefiting from a ramp up in military spending in many countries.
Elsewhere in the region, Australia's S&P/ASX 200 edged 0.1% lower to 9,075.70.
India's Sensex added 0.2%, and the SET in Bangkok lost 0.7%.
On Thursday, the S&P 500 slipped 0.3% to 6,861.89. The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 0.5% to 49,395.16, and the Nasdaq composite lost 0.3% to 22,682.73.
Booking Holdings dropped 6.1% for one of the market’s sharper losses, even though the company behind the Booking.com, Priceline and OpenTable brands reported a profit for the latest quarter that edged past analysts’ expectations.
It is one of many companies under pressure because of worries that competitors powered by artificial-intelligence technology could upend its industry and take away customers. Booking’s stock has lost roughly a quarter of its value so far this year already.
Carvana sank 7.9% even though the retailer reported a stronger profit for the latest quarter than analysts expected.
Walmart, meanwhile, pushed and pulled on the market after jumping to an early gain of 2.7% and then flipping to a loss of 1.4%. The retail giant delivered stronger results for the latest quarter than analysts expected, but it gave a profit forecast for the upcoming year that fell short of estimates.
Some of the bigger gains in the S&P 500 came from stocks of oil companies, which climbed with the price of crude. A barrel of benchmark U.S. crude rose 1.9% to $66.43, while Brent added 1.9% to $71.66 per barrel.
Early Friday, U.S. benchmark crude was up 29 cents at $66.69 per barrel. Brent, the international standard, gained 30 cents to $71.96 per barrel.
Occidental Petroleum jumped 9.4% after it also reported a stronger profit for the latest quarter than analysts expected.
Higher oil prices could lead the Federal Reserve to hold off on cuts to interest rates. Fed officials said at their last meeting that they want to see inflation fall further before they would support cutting rates further this year.
On the other hand, a report saying the number of U.S. workers applying for unemployment benefits eased could signal the pace of layoffs is slowing.
Other U.S. economic reports said that growth for manufacturing in the mid-Atlantic region is accelerating, but potential The U.S. trade deficit also widened in December by more than economists expected.
In other dealings early Friday, the dollar rose to 155.24 Japanese yen from 154.99 yen. The euro slipped to $1.1752 from $1.1775.
The price of gold rose 0.5% and the price of silver was up 0.8%.

What to know about Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor’s arrest
Sign up now: Get ST's newsletters delivered to your inbox
LONDON – Mr Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor, the disgraced brother of King Charles III who was until late last year known as Prince Andrew, was arrested by the British police
Mr Mountbatten-Windsor, who was stripped of his royal titles
Late on the evening of Feb 19, the BBC reported that he was seen leaving the police department. King Charles said that he supported a “full, fair and proper process” in the investigation.
Why was Mountbatten-Windsor arrested?
The British police have not released details on the specifics of the investigation, saying only that they had arrested a man on suspicion of misconduct in public office.
Their statement did not name the man, in accordance with British police rules. Previous reports indicate that Mr Mountbatten-Windsor may have improperly shared confidential government documents with Epstein
What else is in the Epstein files?
The US Justice Department recently released a tranche of documents, colloquially known as the Epstein files.
Those documents also included photos of Mr Mountbatten-Windsor appearing to kneel over an unknown woman lying on a floor.
The photos came after years of controversy over damning details about Mr Mountbatten-Windsor’s alleged sexual abuse of a young woman trafficked to him by Epstein. Mr Mountbatten-Windsor has steadfastly denied that he sexually assaulted the woman, Ms Virginia Roberts Giuffre.
Doubts about his account of his relationship with Epstein – and details of his alleged sexual misconduct in a memoir by Ms Giuffre published posthumously in 2025 – made his position in the royal family untenable.
There was no mention in the police statement on Feb 19 of any accusations of sexual abuse or trafficking.
What comes next?
Mr Mountbatten-Windsor was taken into custody after his arrest but was released in the evening of Feb 19, and was photographed leaving a Norfolk police station in the back of a car. The Thames Valley Police said in a statement that the case remained under investigation.
Under British law, the police generally cannot hold suspects for more than 24 hours without charging them. A court can only grant an extension application to hold them for a maximum of 96 hours.
If the police believe an offence has been committed, they send a file of evidence to the Crown Prosecution Service, which brings charges if it thinks that there is a realistic prospect of conviction and that the case is in the public interest. The process can take several months.
What is misconduct in public office?
The guidance to British prosecutors about the offence says that it is committed when a public officer “wilfully misconducts themselves” in a way that abuses the public’s trust, among other offences.
A conviction would hinge on both the legal definition of “public officer” and also “wilful”. The offence carries a maximum sentence of life imprisonment.
There is no definition in British law of what a public officer is. Cases are assessed individually. Past prosecutions have included elected officials, government staff workers and members of the armed forces.
Mr Mountbatten-Windsor was the British government’s trade envoy from 2001 to 2011. He was previously an officer in the Royal Navy.
But no case has ever tested whether a member of the royal family could be considered a public officer.
For an action to be wilful, someone would had to have known it to be wrong or have had “reckless indifference as to whether it is wrong or not”, guidance to prosecutors says.
How has the royal family reacted?
King Charles put out a statement on Feb 19, saying that British authorities had “our full and wholehearted support and cooperation”.
“The law must take its course,” he said, calling the investigative process “full, fair and proper”.
The statement comes after 15 years of the royal family fighting to steer clear of the stink of Mr Mountbatten-Windsor’s friendship with Epstein.
The two men’s ties have forced the family into its most serious crisis since the death of Princess Diana in 1997. The scandal has also dwarfed the tabloid storm over Prince Harry and Meghan Markle’s public exit from the royal family.
In 2022, Mr Mountbatten-Windsor was forced to relinquish his military titles and royal charities shortly before he settled a lawsuit with Ms Giuffre over her claims that he sexually abused her around 2001, while she was under 18.
In late 2025, a memoir by Ms Giuffre, who had died by suicide earlier in the year, offered more sordid details. As the public outcry grew, Mr Mountbatten-Windsor was stripped of his royal titles.
In February, he was evicted from his residence, the Royal Lodge in Windsor. He moved to a home personally owned by King Charles on the grounds of Sandringham, a royal residence. NYTIMES

Former Prince Andrew arrested for several hours by police, marking a historic event in the United Kingdom

At breakfast time on Thursday, February 19, on Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor's 66th birthday, a dozen officers from Thames Valley Police arrived at his residence on the Sandringham Estate in Norfolk and arrested him. The late Queen Elizabeth II's favorite son and the younger brother of King Charles III remains eighth in line to the British throne, and was "released under investigation" at the end of the day according to police, following the search of the Royal Lodge – his former residence in Windsor.
Thames Valley Police (West of London) confirmed at midday Thursday that officers had taken a "man in his 60s" in for questioning on suspicion of misconduct in public office (people questioned by police are generally not named in the United Kingdom, with respect to the presumption of innocence).
It is highly likely that the investigation centers on communications extracted from the millions of documents in the Epstein case published by the US Department of Justice at the end of January. These documents appear to show that Mountbatten-Windsor, who had already been stripped of all his titles and honors in 2025 due to his longtime friendship with the American sex offender, passed confidential information to him while serving as the British government's special envoy for trade between 2001 and 2011.

Hong Kong public hospitals report decline in emergency visits over Lunar New Year
Hospital Authority links 15 per cent year-on-year decline in A&E cases during the first three days of the holiday to fee reforms taking effect
Hong Kong’s public hospitals recorded a year-on-year decline of up to a 15 per cent in the number of patients seeking emergency treatment during the first three days of the Lunar New Year holiday, following fee adjustments introduced at the start of the year.
The decline was revealed on Friday by Dr Axel Siu Yuet-chung, chairman of the Hospital Authority’s coordinating committee.
He noted that accident and emergency departments (A&E) in public hospitals often became overcrowded during long holidays, as most private clinics closed.
Checks by the South China Morning Post at 11am on Friday found that non-urgent patients at Pamela Youde Nethersole Eastern Hospital in Chai Wan faced waiting times of up to nine hours to see a doctor.
Across most public hospitals, waiting times for semi-urgent and non-urgent patients averaged around four hours, while urgent cases were typically seen within half an hour.
Siu said the number of patients visiting A&E departments during the first three days of the holiday had dropped by about 11 to 15 per cent compared with the same period last year.

It’s the jingle you can’t get out of your head. Coles might wish you’d never heard it

It’s the jingle you can’t get out of your head. Coles might wish you’d never heard it
Retail consultant Trent Rigby was doing an eight-month stint in Coles’ marketing team in 2012 when he got a jingle stuck in his head. It was “Down Down”, the supermarket’s riff on British rock band Status Quo’s 1975 hit song of the same name, playing so often in the office it lived “rent-free” in his head for weeks.
“It changed everything for Coles,” Rigby says. “I genuinely reckon ‘Down Down’ is probably one of the most effective brand jingles Australia has ever produced.”
It could also end up being one of the most costly after a bruising week for Coles in the Federal Court in Melbourne. There, the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission is trying to prove many of Coles’ “Down Down” discounts were false in what former competition tsar Allan Fels calls the “case of the century”.
Over the course of the week the ACCC’s top silk, Garry Rich, SC, peered into the plumbing behind Coles’ discounting decisions, extracting admissions, having testy exchanges and facing repeated denials to his questions.
Along the way, a room of the nation’s legal elite has been subjected to multiple versions of Coles’ ads featuring the jingle that Rich said “sticks in one’s ears for longer than is healthy”. The results of the case – which is essentially trying to determine what a discount actually is – will linger for a lot longer.
Inspired by Reddit
At the height of public fury about inflation in late 2024, the consumer watchdog lobbed legal bombshells at Coles and Woolworths by accusing them of “illusory” discounts on products that were the same price or even higher than before.
It has arguably been a case brought by the people. Users of social media site Reddit unwittingly helped craft the ACCC’s investigation: in one thread, user sec-rose laid out how much the cost of her Coles shopping list, an online order of 52 items, had changed across roughly a year. The basket that cost $192.80 at the end of 2022 was $225.75 by August 2023.
Others piled in. “Lucky dog dry dog food [jumped from] $6.50 to $11 overnight. Scumbags,” commented Minimum-Divide2186. “Soon I’m sure they’ll drop it to $10.90 and claim it’s ‘Down Down!’” jeered sec-rose in response.
In another post, user MattJak shared a picture of a red and white “LOW PRICE” ticket of $9.80 with a white sticker behind it that said $9.50. When this masthead raised similar issues with Coles in September 2023, the grocery giant treated two examples as isolated incidents before revising its statement to describe it as an “error”.
But in the courtroom, it hasn’t been Coles’ top brass Leah Weckert squirming in the witness stand. Day-to-day category managers overseeing product ranges at Coles, such as its pet food divisions, have had the minutiae of their “discounting” decisions combed through with forensic intensity.
Leading the defence is John Sheahan, KC , who acted for Nine, publisher of this masthead, in its successful defence against defamation proceedings from disgraced Victoria Cross recipient Ben Roberts-Smith.
Down Down’s “compelling” labels
As internal emails on pricing negotiations between supermarket middle management and their suppliers were read out, the nation got a glimpse behind Coles’ deli counter to see exactly how its sausage of pricing decisions is made.
What emerged was the ever-shifting rule book behind the coloured pricing tickets Australians rely on to make shopping decisions, which the company calls its “guardrails”.
An “Every Day pricing” ticket, red and white with no price comparison on it, has to remain set for a minimum of six months.
A “Down Down” promotion, meanwhile, can be set only following a “price establishment period” of a minimum window, according to Coles’ internal documents tendered at trial.
But internal emails aired by the Federal Court showed this window is malleable: what was 12 weeks became four amid competitive anxiety to keep up with Woolies.
But even that four-week requirement proved too high a hurdle for some managers, who admitted they had breached the internal guideline, blaming versions of “human error”.
Coles’ defence has been that its price rises were genuine and the result of suppliers requesting cost increases to cover for inflation.
But in one instance, in response to a dog food supplier’s proposed 14.7 per cent increase, Coles pushed back with an 8.8 per cent increase, including a customer discount.
In an email read before the court, Coles’ then pet food category manager Paul Carroll refused a compromise offer from the supplier of a 10 per cent increase and appeared to suggest the supermarket would have to review and potentially cease stocking the supplier’s range of that pet food.
There is, the ACCC’s lawyers suggested, an incentive for Coles to agree to price rises only when they were rapidly followed by discounts to allow it to keep promoting products even at higher prices, laying bare the pulling power of the big red hand.
Carroll disagreed that that was the sole motivation.
When Rich put to him that Coles wasn’t a charity and was motivated only by profits, Carroll pushed back and said he was driven to help customers.
Coles’ manager of health products Matthew Hankin though, told the court that the Down Down ticket’s price comparison (known as the ‘was/is’ price) was more “compelling” to shoppers.
What is a discount, anyway?
Behind the question that the case rests on – whether Coles’ advertised discounts were genuine – is a second question: whether a product’s “establishing” price, which must precede a “Down Down” discount, was real.
The ACCC’s lawyers have argued this “establishing price” is artificial, and that while shoppers paid it for a short period of time, it existed only to allow for a subsequent “Down Down” promotion to be set at a higher price than the product was previously sold for.
The consumer watchdog alleged Coles misled shoppers in relation to “Down Down” pricing across 245 products when filing the initial legal action. But for the two-week hearing, the parties have agreed to focus on 12 products, including 2 litre bottles of Coca Cola, 900 gram tins of Karicare baby formula, Rexona deodorant, Lurpak butter and a box of Arnott’s Shapes.
The exchange on the multipack box of Arnott’s Shapes biscuits was typical of the week. Several Coles managers said the company’s “guardrail” system for discounts was sometimes accidentally broken.
Coles sold the Shapes for $5 for more than a year on a “Down Down” ticket, and then in mid-2022, it upped the price to $5.50 with the same “Down Down” promotional label.
And while it was meant to have a four-week “price establishment” period in between at $6.50, the court heard that the product had been set at that price for just three weeks.
On Tuesday, Coles’ former head of commercial strategy Rebecca Thompson said the price change plan between Coles and Arnott’s had forgotten to factor in a biannual 30 per cent discount campaign on certain Arnott’s brands.
“It was an error, and we tried to rectify it with as [little] confusion as possible,” Thompson said.
Thompson’s response harked back to an earlier question from Justice Michael O’Bryan earlier in the week.
The judge, who has a bookish manner that still leaves no doubt as to who controls the courtroom, is one of the best in the business on competition law.
The third generation Supreme Court judge (grandfather: Sir Norman, father Norman) was appointed to a 2014 review that led to major changes to Australia’s competition laws.
, an avid surfer and Collingwood fan,the ACCC’s Rich on why the ACCC was drawing so much attention to a product’s initial ‘first’ price rather than focusing on the ‘second’ price and the third Down Down price. In essence, he was wondering whether, if the price rise was genuine, it mattered whether the product had previously been sold for less.
“Consumers aren’t so naive to believe that the price has no relationship with the cost,” O’Bryan told Rich on Monday.
But by Thursday, questioning from the ACCC’s barristers had yielded what at least looked like an answer.
Coles category manager Hankin said the company’s March 2022 decision to increase the cost of Colgate toothpaste from $5.50 to $7 for four weeks before marketing it as “Down Down” to $6 had been a deliberate strategy.
“And the only reason that the product was sold for four weeks in between at $7 on a white [regular price] ticket was that Coles could comply with its internal guard rails,” ACCC barrister Emma Bathurst suggested. “Correct, to ... implement the ‘Down Down’ [discount],” Hankin said.
As Rich said on Monday, “there is never a scenario in which price two is going to continue”. “[It] begs the question, why on earth are you telling your customers prices are going down? They’re not.”
Former ACCC chair Allan Fels, who has been keeping an eye on proceedings, has seen enough.said: “The discounts look to be pre-engineered and pre-planned,” he says.
‘They have us in a chokehold’
Although the trial resumes next week — and the result is anyone’s guess — Attention has now turned to what the consequences for Coles will be, if any.
The case has implications for retailers on what they are allowed to call a real discount.
Two things need to be proven: whether there was misleading and deceptive conduct, and whether harm was done.
On the former, intent doesn’t matter. “On the face of it, those ‘false’ discounts may have persuaded consumers to buy products when they otherwise would not have,” says Fels.
On the latter, Coles’ “victims” – which in other court cases may be hundreds or thousands of consumers – are effectively the broader Australian population, across potentially years.
“The case involves millions of consumers and hundreds of millions of dollars in hundreds of stores everywhere in Australia, for essential goods,” says Fels. “I can’t think of a consumer case which has such big consumer ramifications.”
Coles – and rival Woolworths, when its separate case goes to trial in April – stands to face steep penalties, further blows to its reputation, and it could be punished by investors. Then, there’s how the government will react in front of an electorate that is still anxious about the cost of living. A Coles win that spurs the government to react with legislation could prove a pyrrhic victory.
Either way, the Redditors are watching. MattJak, like millions of other Australians, wonders whether the case will meaningfully alter shopping habits.
“I am against Coles and Woolworths, although I feel like they have us in somewhat of a chokehold,” he says.
“Our grocery bill has continued to climb and we have not changed our spending habits much at all.”

Viking eyes US defence tungsten gap after due diligence win
Brought to you by Bulls N’ Bears
Viking Mines has wrapped up due diligence on its flagship Nevada tungsten acquisition in the US and has given the project a resounding technical thumbs-up. The successful review could fast-track the company’s path to becoming a key player in America’s push for a secure domestic supply of the critical mineral.
The company’s detailed review - including a site visit and deep dive into historical datasets - has confirmed high-grade tungsten mineralisation at its Linka project, with outstanding skarn-style potential remaining open and untested in multiple directions.
Key confirmation came from historical shallow drilling intercepts, including a hit of 7.9m grading 0.9 per cent tungsten trioxide from just 7.6m depth.
That solid strike has been further backed up with the recent discovery of a surface extension 800m southwest of the main pit grading 0.6 per cent tungsten oxide, effectively doubling the interpreted strike to 1.6 kilometres.
‘We are bypassing early exploration and moving straight into high-impact targeting.’Viking Mines managing director and chief executive officer Julian Woodcock
The company’s due diligence has significantly de-risked the geology and has also saved significant exploration time, effort and expenditure through integrating and digitising decades-old production records. These indicate that the Linka deposit was historically mined for 65,000 tonnes at an average grade of 0.49 per cent tungsten oxide.
Present naturally as the minerals wolframite and scheelite, tungsten has long been prized as a critical metal thanks to its exceptional physical properties. It boasts the second-highest melting point of any element at 3422°C, behind only carbon, and an impressive tensile strength of about 980 megapascals.
The metal is also remarkably dense, with a specific gravity of 19.25 – almost on par with gold and surpassed only by osmium among naturally occurring elements. Adding to its appeal, tungsten is an efficient thermal conductor, ranking behind only gold, silver, copper and aluminium.
Viking Mines managing director and chief executive officer Julian Woodcock said: “Completing due diligence on the Nevada portfolio is a major milestone. Our review has validated the historical data and identified clear pathways for resource definition across the Project. We have now moved into the formal acquisition phase with a high degree of confidence.”
Viking has now shifted aggressively into development mode, including determined tenement expansion to increase the operation’s strategic footprint. Meanwhile, three-dimensional geological modelling, high-resolution geophysics and drill planning are underway to pinpoint the company’s maiden drilling targets for this year.
Near-term upside is emerging from roughly 1000 tonnes of historical stockpiles at site, which returned 0.8 per cent tungsten oxide in sampling, while several shallow open-pit opportunities have also come into view.
These avenues could enable early concentrate production for offtake discussions, alongside focused grade control drilling to unlock early small-scale, open-pit development potential at the main Linka deposit. The timing couldn’t be better.
The US currently has no serious, realistic, or sustained domestic tungsten production, and a looming December 2026 deadline under policies such as the Restoring Essential Energy and Security Holdings Onshore for Rare Earths (REEShore) Act to eliminate Chinese-sourced materials from military supply chains is driving urgent demand for secure, Nevada-based sources.
Driven by demand in the industrial, renewables and defence sectors – and a shrinking supply outside of China – the alloy-hardening metal has soared in price in the past 12 months from US$340 per metric tonne unit (mtu), where one mtu equals 10kg of tungsten oxide, to a current price of US$1850 per mtu.
Viking’s Tier-1 jurisdiction assets appear to position the company perfectly to capitalise on this vital commodity.
Next steps for Viking include wrapping up its integration of the geophysics data, finalising federal permitting, completing metallurgical sighter work, and locking in drill targets for a high-impact 2026 campaign.
Viking is moving quickly to turn this strategically vital portfolio into a tangible, quantifiable contributor to US tungsten independence.
With due diligence delivering the green light and America’s tungsten crunch intensifying, Viking is perfectly placed to deliver high-grade discoveries and near-term development wins.
As the company’s proposed drilling looms, the race for domestic supply is heating up and Viking has the bit between its teeth.

TIME100 Health Honorees Toast to Funding Research, Reimagining Aging, and Spreading Altruism

During a busy year in global health, some of the most influential names driving innovation and shaping policy gathered Thursday night at the TIME100 Health Impact Dinner.
The 2026 TIME100 Health list honors a diverse group of scientists, doctors, advocates, educators, and other changemakers leading the way in pioneering breakthrough treatments, improving access to care, and creating awareness around emerging issues in public health. The evening featured a panel on preventative care moderated by TIME executive editor Nikhil Kumar and ended with a round of toasts from four honorees, who spoke about the importance of long-term funding for health, reinterpreting the story around aging, and altruism to help those in medical need.
Investing in health
The first toast of the night was given by Dr. Kiran Musunuru, director of the Genetic and Epigenetic Origins of Disease Program at the University of Pennsylvania Perelman School of Medicine. He and Dr. Rebecca Ahrens-Nicklas used a personalized CRISPR therapy to tweak a mutation that turned the devastating genetic disorder of an infant child named KJ into a manageable condition.
However, he noted that the monumental success of KJ’s treatment is the end result of decades of research that went into achievements like The Human Genome Project, rapid whole-genome sequencing, CRISPR gene editing, lipid nanoparticle formulations, RNA technology, representing the career work of many scientists behind the scenes.
“We’re simply one link in a very long chain … and, of course, no part of that long chain could have been forged without strong support from the federal government” and funding from the National Institutes of Health, he said. “Equally important were the career staff at the Food and Drug Administration, who worked closely with us to strike the right balance of rigor, flexibility, and speed in developing the therapy for KJ.”
As things are starting to get interesting in medicine and health, “now is not the time to take the foot off the accelerator,” he said.
An alternative narrative for aging
The second toast of the night was given by gerontologist Kerry Burnight who coined the term “joyspan” to shift the way people think about aging. “The tragedy of old age is not that we grow old and die. It's that the process of doing so is made unnecessarily, and at times, excruciatingly painful and humiliating,” she said. While this narrative fuels the lucrative fear-based anti-aging industry, she invites us to visualize an alternative.
“If we, people lucky enough to be aging as well as serving aging humans, see and celebrate the strengths and contributions of older people, rather than fall prey to the fantasy of never dying, not aging,” she said, “we can tackle these daunting challenges that our nation is facing.”
Shrinking the kidney transplant waiting list
Actor and director Jesse Eisenberg, who made a non-directed kidney donation to an anonymous matching patient next on the transplant list last year, closed out dinner with a final toast advocating for spreading the word on altruistic organ donations that could help the more than 90,000 people waiting for a kidney transplant. “I want to acknowledge that I am probably the dumbest person here and the least qualified to be talking right now,” he said, but he focused on what he did have experience in, which was the “risk-free” process behind his organ donation, which he knew he had to do after hearing about the concept of this type of donation on a podcast.
“I never heard from anyone or read an interview with anybody who said they wrestled with the decision. … It was always: ‘I heard about it and signed up,’” he said. “Which makes me wonder if the problem isn’t convincing people to do this, but simply finding the people who already would.”
“That’s the reason I wanted to speak tonight — and to briefly co-opt this gathering of otherwise brilliant minds — because I imagine there is no more qualified group of people who could figure out how to reach these particular people, how to shrink that horrible number of 90,000 people to close to zero.”
TIME100 Impact Dinner: Leaders Shaping the Future of Health was presented by Novartis and Aster DM Healthcare.

Russian-run areas of Ukraine face water, heat and housing woes
Nearly four years into its full-scale invasion, Russia controls about 20% of Ukrainian territory
- Bookmark
Nearly four years into its full-scale invasion, Russia controls about 20% of Ukrainian territory. Many of the estimated 3 million to 5 million people who remain in regions under Moscow's control face housing, water, power, heat and health care woes.
Even President Vladimir Putin has acknowledged “many truly pressing, urgent problems” in the regions of Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson and Zaporizhzhia, which were illegally annexed by Moscow months after the all-out war began on Feb. 24, 2022.
Russian citizenship, language and culture is forced upon residents, including in school lesson plans and textbooks.
Some residents live in fear of being accused of sympathizing with Kyiv, according to Ukrainians who have left. Many have been imprisoned, beaten and killed, according to human rights activists.
Russia established a “vast network of secret and official detention centers where tens of thousands of Ukrainian civilians” are held indefinitely without charge, said Oleksandra Matviichuk, head of the Nobel Peace Prize-winning Center for Civil Liberties.
Russian officials have refused to comment on past allegations by U.N. human rights officials that it tortures civilians and prisoners of war.
One family's plight
Inna Vnukova spent the first days of the Russian occupation in the Luhansk region hiding in a damp basement with her family. Outside in her village of Kudriashivka, soldiers bullied residents, set up checkpoints and looted homes. There was constant shelling.
“Everyone was very scared and afraid to go outside,” Vnukova told The Associated Press in Estonia, where she now lives. The troops sought out officials and civil servants like her and her husband, Oleksii Vnukov.
In mid-March 2022, she and her 16-year-old son, Zhenya, fled the village with her brother’s family, even though it meant leaving her husband behind temporarily. They risked a trip by car to nearby Starobilsk, waving a white sheet amid mortar fire.
Oleksii Vnukov, a court security officer, stayed for nearly two weeks. Russian soldiers twice threatened to kill him before he escaped.
“The people there aren’t living, they’re just surviving,” he said of the 150 people — including the couple's parents — who still live in the village that once was home to 800.
Vnukova and her husband have a new life in Estonia, where she works in a printing house and he is an electrician. Their son is now 20, and they have a 1-year-old daughter, Alisa.
Life in shattered Mariupol
Russian forces besieged Mariupol for weeks before the port city fell in May 2022. The bombing of the Donetsk Academic Regional Drama Theater on March 16 of that year killed nearly 600 people in and around the building, an AP investigation found — the war's single deadliest known attack against civilians.
Most of the population of about a half-million fled but many hid in basements, said a former actor who huddled for months with his parents.
The former actor, now in Estonia, spoke on condition of anonymity to not endanger his 76-year-old parents, still in Mariupol. They took Russian citizenship to get medical care and a one-time payment equivalent to $1,300 per person as compensation for their destroyed home, he said.
Housing remains a problem even though the population is about half of what it was before the war. New apartments are sold to Russian newcomers — not those who lost their homes, according to complaints sent by video to Putin.
Not everyone opposes the Russian takeover. The former actor says half of the members of his old troupe support the Kremlin. Still, he said his parents asked him not to send postcards in Ukrainian because “it could be dangerous.”
Crumbling infrastructure
Years of war and neglect have saddled many cities with crumbling municipal services.
In Alchevsk, a city in the Luhansk region, over half the homes are without heat in this bitterly cold winter. Five warming stations have been set up.
In the Donetsk region, water trucks fill barrels outside apartment blocks — but they freeze solid in winter, said a resident who spoke on condition of anonymity because she feared repercussions. “There’s constant squabbling over water,” she said.
Moscow encourages Russians to move to the occupied regions, offering various benefits. Teachers, doctors and cultural workers are promised salary supplements if they live there for five years.
The northeastern city of Sievierodonetsk, once home to 140,000 people, suffered significant damage and now has only 45,000 mostly elderly or disabled residents. Only one ambulance crew serves the city, and Russian medical workers rotate in to staff its hospital, said a 67-year-old former engineer who spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of retribution.
“I know how difficult it is now for the residents of the liberated cities and towns. There are many truly pressing, urgent problems,” Putin said in September. He cited the need for reliable water supplies and access to health care, and said he has launched a “large-scale socioeconomic development program” for the regions.
Living in fear
Stanislav Shkuta, 25, from Nova Kakhovka in the Kherson region, said he narrowly escaped arrest several times before reaching Ukrainian-controlled territory in 2023. He recalled being on a bus that was stopped by Russian soldiers, and "men and women were asked to strip to the waist to see if they had Ukrainian tattoos.”
Shkuta, now in Estonia, said he “turned white with fear, wondering if I’d cleared everything on my phone.”
Friends who stayed in Nova Kakhovka say life has worsened, with suspected Ukrainian sympathizers stopped on the street or in surprise door-to-door inspections, he added.
Mykhailo Savva of the Center for Civil Liberties in Ukraine said "Russian special services continue to identify disloyal Ukrainians, extract confessions, and continue to detain people,” with residents facing document checks and mass searches.
Human rights groups say Russia used “filtration camps” early in the war to identify potentially disloyal individuals, as well as anyone who worked for the government, helped the Ukrainian army or had relatives in the military, along with journalists, teachers, scientists and politicians.
About 16,000 civilians have been detained illegally, but that number could be much higher because many are held incommunicado, said Ukrainian Human Rights Ombudsman Dmytro Lubinets.

Japan's traditional kimonos are being repurposed in creative and sustainable ways
The kimono is getting a vibrant remake in Japan
- Bookmark
The kimono, that elaborate, delicate wrap-around garment worn by geisha and samurai from centuries back, is getting a vibrant remake, appreciated these days for a virtue that’s more relevant than ever: sustainability.
A genuine silk kimono, which literally means “worn thing,” lasts a hundred years or more. In a Japanese family, it’s handed down over generations like heirloom jewelry, artworks and military medals.
It never goes out of style.
The design of the kimono and accompanying “obi” sash has remained basically the same since the 17th century Edo period depicted in Akira Kurosawa samurai movies.
But today, some people are taking a different creative approach, refashioning the traditional kimono, and also taking apart and resewing them as jackets, dresses and pants.
“I noticed that a lot of beautiful kimono is just sleeping in people’s closets. That’s such a waste,” said Mari Kubo, who heads a kimono-remake business called K’Forward, pronounced “K dash forward.”
Hers is among a recent surge in such services, which also turn old kimono into tote bags and dolls.
The most popular among Kubo’s products are “tomesode,” a type of formal kimono that is black with colorful, embroidered flowers, birds or foliage at the bottom.
She also creates matching sets, or what she calls “set-ups.” A tomesode is turned into a jacket with its long, flowing sleeves intact, and its intricate patterns placed at the center in the back. She then takes a kimono with a matching pattern to create a skirt or pants to go with the top. Sometimes, an obi is used at the collar to add a pop of color.
Kubo said many of her customers are young people who want to enjoy a kimono without the fuss.
A remade kimono at K’Forward can cost as much as 160,000 yen ($1,000) for a “furisode,” a colorful kimono with long sleeves meant for young unmarried women, while a black tomesode goes for about 25,000 yen ($160).
Reuse and recycle
What Tomoko Ohkata loves most about the products she designs using old kimonos is that she doesn’t have to live with a guilty conscience, and instead feels she is helping solve an ecological problem.
“I feel the answer was right there, being handed down from our ancestors,” she said.
Recycling venues in Japan get thousands of old kimonos a day as people find them stashed away in closets by parents and grandparents. These days, Japanese generally wear kimonos just for special occasions like weddings. Many women prefer to wear a Western-style white wedding dress rather than the kimono, or they wear both.
Many of Ohkata’s clientele are people who have found a kimono at home and want to give it new life. They care about the story behind the kimono, she added.
Her small store in downtown Tokyo displays various dolls, including a samurai paired with his wife, who are traditionally brought out for display in Japanese homes for the Girls’ Day festival every March 3. Her dolls, however, are exquisitely dressed in recycled kimonos, tailored in tiny sizes to fit the dolls. They sell for 245,000 yen ($1,600) a pair.
The art of putting on a kimono
The original old-style kimono is also getting rediscovered.
“Unlike the dress, you can arrange it,” says Nao Shimizu, who heads a school in Japan’s ancient capital of Kyoto that teaches people how to wear a kimono and how to carry oneself while wearing it.
“In half a year, you can learn how to do it all by yourself,” she said, briskly demonstrating several ways to tie the obi to express different moods, from playful to understated.
Besides its durability, said Shimizu, that versatility also makes the kimono sustainable.
Younger Japanese are taking a more relaxed view, wearing a kimono with boots, for instance, she laughed. Traditionally, kimono is worn with sandals called “zori.”
Although it requires some skill to put on a kimono in the traditional way, one can take lessons from teachers like Shimizu, like learning a musical instrument. Professional help is also available at beauty parlors, hotels and some shops.
Most Japanese might wear a kimono just a few times in their lives. But wearing one is a memorable experience.
Sumie Kaneko, a singer who plays the traditional Japanese instruments koto and shamisen, often performs wearing flashy dresses made of recycled kimonos. The idea of sustainability is deeply rooted in Japanese culture, she says, noting that the ivory and animal hide used in her musical instruments are now hard to obtain.
She calls it “the recycling of life.”
“The performer breathes new life into them,” says the New York-based Kaneko.
“In the same way, a past moment — and those patterns and colors that were once loved — can come back to life.”

A traditional sausage in the shape of a horseshoe is 'ironed' for dryness in southeastern Serbia
A traditionally crafted spicy sausage in the town of Pirot in southeastern Serbia is said to lift both a person’s energy and spirits, especially during the long winter months
- Bookmark
During long winter months, a traditionally crafted spicy sausage in the town of Pirot in southeastern Serbia is said to lift both a person's energy and spirits.
The “ironed sausage” — or “peglana kobasica” in Serbian — is a rich mixture of selected meats loaded with seasoning and dried naturally. The name of the sausage is derived from a unique bottle-flattening technique that makes it thin and gives it a horseshoe shape.
And though it has been part of Pirot's tradition through generations, the delicacy praised for high-quality meat and its sustainable, organic manufacturing has gained fame beyond this sleepy town near Serbia's border with Bulgaria.
In 2022, Pirot's ironed sausage was awarded a certificate from the state food safety authorities for regional excellence and origin — a process that requires producers to follow a set of regulations in order to get the official stamp.
“It is a supreme product,” Marjan Savic, who heads an association of ironed sausage producers, told The Associated Press. “Our sausage is one of the best, if not the best."
Pirot's sausage-making tradition dates back at least a century, or perhaps even to the Ottoman era, which ended in the Balkans in 1913.
In old times, sausage makers used meat from older animals to stuff the sausages and then dry them, sometimes hanging them on broomsticks in their sheds or attics.
These days, there are around 35-40 certified producers in the area. They use locally bred beef and goat meat, adding garlic, hot pepper and spices harvested from the scenic Stara Planina mountain nearby.
Making an ironed sausage is “hard labor,” Savic said. First, the meat must be fully cleared of all fat and connecting tissue, "which is probably the hardest part of the job,” he explained.
The sausages are then dried and flattened daily by hand, for full taste and shape. The process ends in time for a sausage fair that takes place in Pirot every January, attracting thousands of visitors, including many from neighboring Bulgaria.
But despite growing demand, the sausage-making businesses are threatened by dwindling goat herds in the area, and generally warmer and more humid winters in recent years that experts partly link to climate change.
Misa Rajic learned the sausage-making craft from his grandfather and remembers making ironed sausages every winter while growing up. He now owns a small manufacturing unit in his home on the outskirts of Pirot.
“It takes about a month to get a dry, dehydrated product that is ready for consumption,” Rajic said, showing visitors how sausages are pressed with a glass bottle from the middle outward.
The process, he added, "helps further mix the meat inside the sausage and it helps with the drying because it extracts the moisture.”
A well-dried sausage has a dark color with the greyish surface of the beef intestines' casing, which is peeled off before serving. Locals in Pirot consume the sausage much like a digestif — after a full meal, including the desert. They cut it into leaf-thin slices and chew slowly with red wine to enjoy the taste.
“We recommend red wines that are a bit robust to match the poignant aroma,” Savic said. “It's not so good with white wine.”

WA businessman’s efforts to avoid tax bill on $350k ‘work’ Ferrari rebuffed

WA businessman’s efforts to avoid tax bill on $350k ‘work’ Ferrari rebuffed
A Perth tax agent has been accused of fabricating logbooks and lying about money he was given in his mother’s will as he claimed a $350,000 Ferrari bought through work was exempt from fringe benefits tax, with a tribunal finding he instead used the car to take his girlfriend on trip’s to Western Australia’s premier wine region.
The Administrative Review Tribunal dismissed an appeal by the man and his firm this week, after an audit by the Australian Taxation Commissioner uncovered fringe benefit tax liabilities relating to a Ferrari California bought in 2013 for the man to drive to and from work, and to visit clients across Perth’s metropolitan area.
The man’s name has been kept private due to a confidentiality order, and he has been referred to throughout a decision published this week as “Mr Jones”.
The tribunal heard the man’s firm – of which he is the sole director – bought the 2010 model second-hand for about $346,000 plus costs in 2013, and it was never registered as a fringe benefit.
Mr Jones asserted he never used the car for private purposes and never used it to carry passengers – meaning it was ultimately a car he used just for work.
However, the tribunal found logbooks of the car’s kilometres kept over the years didn’t match up with the mechanic where the car was often serviced.
On one occasion, the logbook recorded Mr Jones had driven 50 kilometres from his home to his office in Marmion, in Perth’s northern suburbs, when his diaries indicated he was actually in Sydney.
According to the decision, GPS maps also showed Mr Jones frequently overestimated how far it was from his house to his office, and Administrative Tribunal deputy president Clare Thompson SC ultimately threw the logbooks out as evidence.
“Specifically, I have found that the logbooks were fabricated for the purposes of the applicant’s dispute with the commissioner, and his written statements were deliberately misleading as to the accuracy of the logbooks,” she said.
“This causes me to have grave doubts as to the overall reliability of what Mr Jones has said in evidence other than when it is against his interest.
“For example the evidence of him taking his girlfriend as a passenger to Margaret River.”
While Mr Jones’ firm argued his use of the car was “minor, infrequent and irregular”, Thompson said Mr Jones had conceded under questioning he used the car more frequently than originally admitted.
During evidence, Mr Jones told the court he would travel once a year to Margaret River, Bunker Bay and Busselton – holiday destinations in the heart of WA’s premier wine region – where he had rental properties, to conduct inspections.
“Apart from monitoring my investments, a small portion of the time down south would involve having lunch at some wineries,” he told the tribunal.
The tribunal also found Mr Jones had lied about how the firm bought the car and paid off its payments, saying he had used money he had been gifted when instead the car had been purchased using a loan.
“My dearly departed mother very kindly left me some funds in her will which was used for the deposit,” he told the tribunal.
Thompson found that statement was “plainly designed to evoke some sympathy”, but said it showed the man was “cynical and scheming”.
Thompson upheld the commission’s remaining findings, and rejected the firm’s claims the car was ultimately a work vehicle.
The matter was dismissed.

European Commission prepares legal grounds to intercept Russian oil tankers — source

BRUSSELS, February 20. /TASS/. In its 20th sanctions package, the European Commission is developing a legal foundation to allow the interception of tankers with Russian oil, which raises serious concerns among several European Union countries regarding the risk of a military confrontation at sea, a source in Brussels diplomatic circles told TASS.
"The European Commission’s plans to prohibit maritime transport of Russian oil under the 20th sanctions package, along with the associated financial and insurance services, are accompanied by negotiations between the European External Action Service and the countries and jurisdictions that provide tanker registration services, in order to obtain permission to inspect tankers under their flags on the high seas to enforce the new sanctions," he said.
"They are essentially preparing legal grounds for stopping, inspecting, and potentially seizing tankers transporting (according to Brussels - TASS) Russian oil and their cargo. This is causing significant concern among some EU states, as it could lead to a direct military clash at sea," the diplomat noted, commenting on the difficulties in approving the 20th sanctions package against Russia.
The source emphasized that "the lawfulness of any use of force under [unilateral] EU sanctions will not be recognized by Russia and many other countries, making the threat of a direct military confrontation real."

Alaska to replace Black Veterans Memorial Bridge, saving part as tribute to Alaska Highway builders

Alaska to replace Black Veterans Memorial Bridge, saving part as tribute to Alaska Highway builders
A historic bridge in Alaska named for segregated Black soldiers who battled extreme weather and terrain to help build the first road link between Alaska and Canada needs to replaced
- Bookmark
Thousands of Black soldiers performed the backbreaking work of transforming rough-hewn wilderness in extreme weather swings during World War II to help build the first road link between Alaska and the Lower 48.
The work of the segregated Black soldiers is credited with bringing changes to military discrimination policies. The state of Alaska honored them by naming a bridge for them near the end point of the famed Alaska Highway.
Now, eight decades later, the aging bridge needs to be replaced. Instead of tearing it down, the state of Alaska intends to keep two of the bridge’s nine trestles in place as a refashioned memorial. The others will be given away.
Two spans will become the memorial
The state of Alaska will replace the 1,885-foot (575-meter) bridge that spans the Gerstle River near Delta Junction, the end point of the Alaska Highway about 100 miles (161 kilometers) south of Fairbanks.
Seven of the bridge’s trestles are being offered for free to states, local governments or private entities who will maintain them for their historical features and public use.
The two remaining spans from the old bridge, renamed the Black Veterans Memorial Bridge in 1993, will honor the 4,000 or so Black soldiers who built the first wooden bridge over the river while completing the Alaska Highway.
These two sections, the first trestles on either end, will retain the name of the memorial bridge. The new Gerstle River Bridge will unofficially carry the memorial name unless the Legislature also makes it official. The old bridge will remain in place until the new one opens in 2031.
Former mayor wants proper memorial
Mary Leith, a former Delta Junction mayor and member of the historical society, said she’s pleased some of the history will be saved, but she wants the state to have proper signage and a highway pullout area near the historic bridge to allow people to walk on it.
“I would hope that if they’re going to save it, then they save it properly,” she said.
The Black Veterans Memorial Bridge sign will remain and the two sections will be visible from the new bridge, but both will be blocked off to prevent people from climbing or vandalizing them, said Angelica Stabs, a spokesperson for the state transportation department. No pullout is planned.
The new bridge will parallel the existing bridge to the east, leaving about 50 feet of space between it and the old bridge's location, Stab said.
Soldiers' work helped integrate the U.S. Army
The project to build a supply route between Alaska and Canada used 11,000 troops from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers divided by race, working under a backdrop of segregation and discrimination. Besides transforming the rugged terrain, the soldiers had to deal with mosquitoes, boggy land, permafrost and temperatures ranging from 90 degrees F (32 degrees C) to minus 70 F (minus 56 C).
“Though conditions were harsh for all, they were nearly unbearable for black soldiers. From the Deep South, most of these soldiers had never encountered anything approaching the severe conditions of the far north. Moreover, since black troops were not typically permitted to use heavy machinery, they made do with picks, shovels, and axes. In addition, they were prohibited from entering towns and were confined to wilderness assignments,” according to a historical account by the National Park Service.
It took Black soldiers working from the north just over eight months to meet up with white soldiers coming from the south to connect the 1,500-mile (2,400-kilometer) gravel road, then called the Alcan Highway, from Dawson Creek, British Columbia, to Delta Junction Oct. 25, 1942.
“In light of their impressive performance, many of the black soldiers who worked on the Alcan were subsequently decorated and sometimes deployed in combat. Indeed, the U.S. Army eventually became the first government agency to integrate in 1948, a move that is largely credited in part to the laudable work of the soldiers who built the Alcan,” the National Park Service says.
Road expedited after Japanese attacks
Alaska was still a territory, and officials long wanted such a road to the Lower 48. However, battles over routes and its necessity led to delays.
Japanese attacks on Pearl Harbor in Hawaii and Dutch Harbor in Alaska, along with the Japanese invasions of the Alaska islands Kiska and Attu signaled urgency for the road since the ocean shipping lanes to the West Coast could be vulnerable.
Black soldiers working near Delta Junction built a temporary bridge over the Gerstle River in 1942. Contractors finished the steel structure two years later.
Free bridge comes with caveats
The Alaska transportation department is accepting proposals until March 6 for the seven trestles, but you don't have to take them all. The state will consider all proposals, even those seeking one or two trestles for uses such as a walkway over a creek in a public park.
Winners will have to abide by certain restrictions including not allowing vehicular traffic, paying for removal, transportation and lead abatement, and maintaining the features that make the bridge historically significant.

New Zealand expands sanctions against Russia over its invasion of Ukraine
This was reported by the country’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs, according to Ukrinform.
The ministry said that, as of February 20, changes had been made to the sanctions regime introducing restrictions against 23 individuals, 13 companies, and 100 vessels.
It was also noted that, effective today, the maximum price cap on crude oil of Russian origin has been reduced from $47.60 to $44.10 per barrel.
According to the updated register of organizations and individuals subject to New Zealand’s economic restrictions, the list now includes executives of the Russian cryptocurrency exchange Garantex, several Russian citizens who are officers of Russian intelligence services, as well as three Iranian nationals who are board members of Qods Aviation, a leading Iranian producer of unmanned aerial vehicles.
It is worth noting that since March 2022, the government of New Zealand has imposed restrictions more than 35 times on Russian companies and individuals, as well as on Russia’s allies. To streamline the process, the country’s parliament adopted special legislation. In total, New Zealand has introduced various bans, including trade and financial restrictions, against more than 1,800 individuals, among them Russian President Vladimir Putin, members of the Russian government and Security Council, and deputies of the State Duma and the Federation Council of the aggressor state.
As previously reported by Ukrinform, the EU is nearing the final stage of work on its 20th package of sanctions against Russia, with a final agreement expected after two meetings of ambassadors in the Coreper II format, although objections from Hungary may delay the process.

Accused Russian spy couple back in court

Accused Russian spy couple back in court
The legal team for one half of a couple accused of spying for Russia have squabbled with the prosecution in court over whether a nearly 300-page statement of facts effectively outlines the case against their client.
Kira Korolev, 41, who was in the Australian Army, was arrested alongside her labourer partner, Igor Korolev, in 2024 at their home in Everton Park on Brisbane’s northside.
The Australia Federal Police allege the former information systems technician, who held an ADF security clearance and served in the army for years, travelled to Russia undeclared while on long-term leave from the army in 2023.
While she was away, it is alleged she told Igor how to log into her official work account from their Brisbane home to gain access to material on defence computer systems to send to Russia.
The case triggered national concerns over foreign interference as the pair were charged with preparing to carry out an act of espionage.
Multiple devices have been seized from the couple, with contents that need to be translated from Russian. The prosecution is still working its way through this material.
On Friday in Brisbane Magistrates Court, Igor Korolev’s legal aid solicitor Anastasia Stoenko sought to have the basis of the prosecution’s case further detailed, noting the statement of facts is 288 pages long.
“That contains a lot of information but not, perhaps, what the basis of the case is.”
Given the volume of the material, Stoenko said they could not prepare appropriately without further information.
Commonwealth prosecutor Ellie McDonald argued the statement of fact sufficiently outlines the basis of the allegations against the couple.
Kira Korolev’s legal team from Phillips Crawford Lawyers did not make any requests other than another court date after the upcoming bail application.
Stoenko’s request was denied by the magistrate, who said while it is important for the defence to understand in general terms what evidence is being relied upon, this would form part of the committal process.
The Korolevs remain in custody, though Kira’s legal team filed an application for bail last month.
Her lawyer, Alan Phillips, told the court that given the complexity of the case, a half-day hearing – expected to proceed in the Magistrates Court – would be allocated for the application in March.
McDonald said bail would be opposed in the application, which was expected to return to court on March 31.
The matter will now also be back in court on April 17.

A newly discovered Spinosaurus species has revealed that the iconic Jurassic Park predator might not have been fully aquatic but more like a “hell heron” that waded through shallower waters.
The fossil was unearthed by a team of around 20 researchers in the central Sahara region of Niger, offering critical clues to how the giant beast moved.
The horned species, named Spinosaurus mirabilis, had scimitar-shaped crests on the back that were sheathed in keratin. The crest was likely a brightly coloured display feature, curving towards the sky as a blade-shaped beacon.
Previous Spinosaurus fossils had only been seen in coastal deposits close to the shoreline, leading some researchers to suggest they could have been fully aquatic predators that pursued their prey underwater.
The new fossil shows the ancient beasts also lived inland, 500-1,000km from the nearest marine shoreline, likely in a forested inland habitat dissected by rivers.
After analysing other fossils found in the area, researchers said the Spinosaurus likely lived with long-necked dinosaurs in a riverside habitat about 100-95 million years ago.
“I envision this dinosaur as a kind of ‘hell heron’ that had no problem wading on its sturdy legs into two meters of water but probably spent most of its time stalking shallower traps for the many large fish of the day,” palaeontologist Paul Sereno, an author of the new study published in Science, said.
Researchers also found that Spinosaurus mirabilis had interdigitating teeth, with those of the lower jaw protruding outwards and between those of the upper. Such an arrangement would have made a deadly trap for catching slippery river fish.
The find represents a new phase of evolution for this group of massive, fish-eating dinosaurs, the study noted.
In the first phase during the Jurassic Period, the giant reptiles developed their elongated skulls for fish-catching. In the second, during the Early Cretaceous Period, Spinosaurus spread as predators along the coast of the Tethys Sea.
This led to the third phase in which species like S mirabilis specialised as shallow water predators in northern Africa, researchers said. “This find was so sudden and amazing, it was really emotional for our team,” Dr Sereno said.
“I will forever cherish the moment in camp when we crowded around a laptop to look at the new species for the first time, after one member of our team generated 3D digital models of bones we found to assemble the skull — on solar power in the middle of the Sahara,” he said.

Russian-run areas of Ukraine face water, heat and housing woes — and hunts for the disloyal
Four years into its full-scale invasion, Russia controls about 20% of Ukrainian territory, where an estimated 3 million to 5 million people live
- Bookmark
Even now, safely in her new home of Estonia, Inna Vnukova says she can’t purge the terrifying memory of living under Russian occupation in eastern Ukraine early in the war and her family’s harrowing escape.
They hid in a damp basement for days in their village of Kudriashivka after Russia’s full-scale invasion in February 2022. In the streets, soldiers waving machine guns bullied residents, set up checkpoints and looted homes. There was constant shelling.
“Everyone was very scared and afraid to go outside,” Vnukova told The Associated Press, with troops seeking out Ukrainian sympathizers and civil servants like her and her husband, Oleksii Vnukov.
In mid-March, she decided that she and her 16-year-old son, Zhenya, would flee the village with her brother's family, even though it meant leaving her husband behind temporarily. They took a risky trip by car to nearby Starobilsk, waving a white sheet amid mortar fire.
“We had already said our goodbyes to life, cursing this Russian world,” said Vnukova, 42. “I’ve been trying to forget this nightmare for four years, but I can’t.”
Many Ukrainians like Vnukova fled the invading forces. Those who stayed risked being detained — or worse — as Russian forces eventually took control of about 20% of the country and its estimated 3 million to 5 million people.
A new, Russian life in the seized regions
After four years of war, life in shattered cities like Mariupol and villages like Kudriashivka remains difficult, with residents facing problems with housing, water, power, heat and health care. Even President Vladimir Putin has acknowledged they have “many truly pressing, urgent problems."
In the illegally annexed regions of Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson and Zaporizhzhia, Russian citizenship, language and culture is forced on residents, including in school lessons and textbooks. By spring 2025, some 3.5 million people in the four regions had been given Russian passports — a requirement to receive vital services like health care.
Some in the regions say they live in fear of being accused of sympathizing with Ukraine. Many have been imprisoned, beaten and killed, according to human rights activists.
Oleksii Vnukov, a court security officer, stayed behind in the village for nearly two weeks. Russian soldiers twice threatened to kill him, including an instance where he and a friend were dragged off the street by soldiers. But he survived and soon also escaped the village.
The family traveled through Russia before making it to Estonia, where Inna works in a printing house and Oleksii, 43, is an electrician.
“All life is leaving the occupied territories,” Vnukov said. “The people there aren’t living, they’re just surviving.”
Mykhailo Savva of the Center for Civil Liberties in Ukraine said the Russian military's practice of wielding “systemic and total control” in the regions continues today.
“Even though a significant number of socially active people have already been detained, Russian special services continue to identify disloyal Ukrainians, extract confessions, and continue to detain people,” Savva said. “Residents face such practices as document checks, mass searches, and denunciations on a daily basis.”
Human rights groups say Russian authorities used “filtration camps” to identify potentially disloyal individuals, as well as anyone who worked for the government, helped the Ukrainian army or had relatives in the military, along with journalists, teachers, scientists and politicians.
Stanislav Shkuta, 25, who lived in occupied Nova Kakhovka in the Kherson region, said he narrowly escaped arrest several times before reaching Ukrainian-controlled territory in 2023. He recalled being on a bus that was stopped by Russian soldiers.
“It was horrific. Men and women were asked to strip to the waist to see if they had Ukrainian tattoos,” said Shkuta, who now lives in Estonia. “I turned white with fear, wondering if I’d cleared everything on my phone.”
He said his friends who stayed in Nova Kakhovka say life has worsened, with suspected Ukrainian sympathizers stopped on the street or in surprise door-to-door inspections.
“Today, my friends complain that life there has become impossible,” he said.
Russia established a “vast network of secret and official detention centers where tens of thousands of Ukrainian civilians” are held indefinitely without charge, said Oleksandra Matviichuk, head of the Nobel Peace Prize-winning Center for Civil Liberties.
“Everyone knows that if you end up in the basement, your life is worth nothing,” she said.
Russian officials have refused to comment on past allegations by U.N. human rights officials that it tortures civilians and prisoners of war.
About 16,000 civilians have been detained illegally, but that number could be much higher because many are held incommunicado. said Ukrainian Human Rights Ombudsman Dmytro Lubinets.
A U.N. report released last summer said that between July 2024 and June 2025, it spoke to 57 civilians who were detained in the occupied regions, and that 52 of them told of severe beatings, electric shocks, sexual violence, degradation and threats of violence.
One particularly famous case is that of Ukrainian journalist Victoria Roshchyna, 27, who disappeared in 2023 while reporting near the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant and died in Russian custody. When her body was handed over to Ukraine in 2025, it bore signs of torture, with some of her organs removed, a prosecutor said.
“Russia uses terror in the occupied territories to physically eliminate active people working in certain fields: teachers, children’s writers, musicians, mayors, journalists, environmentalists. It also intimidates the passive majority,” Matviichuk says.
Destruction in Mariupol
At the start of the war, Russian forces besieged Mariupol before the port city fell in May 2022. The Russian bombing of the Donetsk Academic Regional Drama Theater on March 16 of that year killed close to 600 people in and around the building, an AP investigation found, in the single deadliest known attack against civilians in the war.
Most of the city's population of about a half-million fled but many hid in basements, said a former actor who huddled for months with his parents, saying they were nearly killed by the Russian bombing.
The former actor, now in Estonia, spoke on condition of anonymity to not endanger his 76-year-old parents, still in Mariupol. They had to take Russian citizenship to get medical care, as well as a one-time payment equivalent to $1,300 per person as compensation for their destroyed home, he said.
As in other occupied cities, Russification is taking place in Mariupol, changing street names, teaching Moscow-approved curriculum in schools, using Russian phone and TV networks and putting the city in Moscow's time zone.
“But even today, the threat of death has not gone away. Only those who have Russian passports can survive,″ the former actor said, adding that his parents have asked him not to send postcards in Ukrainian because “it could be dangerous.”
Putin "openly states that there is no Ukrainian language, no Ukrainian culture, no Ukrainian nation. And in the occupied territories, these words are turning into terrible practice,” Matviichuk said.
But not everyone opposes the Russian takeover in Mariupol. The former actor says half of the members of his old troupe now support the Kremlin and believe Kyiv “provoked the war.”
Housing is a sore point in Mariupol, where the population is about half of what it was before 2022. New apartment blocks rose from the ruins, but rather than going to those who lost their homes, they are sold to Russian newcomers.
Some who lost their homes have made video appeals to Putin. “You said we ‘don’t abandon our own.’ Do we not count as your own?” said one resident at a mass rally.
At least 12,191 apartments in Mariupol were added to a list of purportedly “ownerless” and abandoned flats to be expropriated in the first half of 2025. Thousands more are being seized elsewhere.
Moscow is encouraging Russian citizens to move to the occupied regions, offering a range of benefits. Teachers, doctors and cultural workers are promised salary supplements if they commit to living there for five years.
Crumbling infrastructure and a shortage of doctors
Years of war and neglect have saddled many occupied cities in eastern Ukraine with serious problems in supplying heat, electricity and water.
The northeastern city of Sievierodonetsk suffered significant destruction before falling to Russia in June 2022. Once home to 140,000 people, only 45,000 remain, mostly elderly or disabled.
Only one ambulance crew serves the whole city, and doctors and other health workers rotate in from Russian regions like Perm to work at its hospital, said a 67-year-old former engineer who spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of retribution.
But she still supports “the great work Putin is doing,” because she was born and raised in the former Soviet Union.
In Alchevsk, a city in the Luhansk region, over half the homes have been without heat for two bitterly cold months. Five warming stations have been set up and utility companies said over 60% of municipal heating networks are in poor shape, without funds for repairs.
Even a pro-Moscow politician, Oleg Tsaryov, has accused authorities of freezing “an entire city.” When the heating system failed in 2006, he noted on social media that Ukrainian authorities "and the entire country stepped in to help and completely replaced the faulty equipment.” But after the Russian takeover, officials had “contrived to repeat this Armageddon scenario all over again,” he added.
In the Donetsk region, water trucks fill barrels outside apartment blocks — but they freeze solid in winter, said a resident who spoke on condition of anonymity because she feared repercussions.
“There's constant squabbling over water,” she said, adding that lines to get the precious resource are “insane,” and people who are away at work often miss the trucks' arrival.
Donetsk residents wrote an appeal for Putin to intervene in what has become "a humanitarian and environmental catastrophe.”
Putin last year acknowledged the plight in the four regions.
“I know how difficult it is now for the residents of the liberated cities and towns. There are many truly pressing, urgent problems," he said, marking the third anniversary of incorporating those areas into Russia. He cited the need for reliable water supplies and access to health care, among other issues, and said he has launched a "large-scale socioeconomic development program” for the regions.
Meanwhile, Inna Vnukova is building a new life in Estonia: She and Oleksii now have a 1-year-old daughter, Alisa. Their son is now 20.
Only about 150 people — including the couple's parents — remain in the village that once was home to 800, Vnukova said, adding that she would like to show her daughter the family's native Luhansk region someday.
“We’ve been dreaming of returning for four years, but we increasingly wonder — what will we see there?” she asked.

European Central Bank president Lagarde expects to complete her term

FRANKFURT – Ms Christine Lagarde expects completing her mission as president of the European Central Bank (ECB) will take until the end of her term, she told the Wall Street Journal in an interview on Feb 19, amid reports she would step down before her contract expired.
Ms Lagarde’s comments come after the Financial Times reported on Feb 18 that she planned to leave her job before the end of her contract in October 2027 and ahead of the French presidential election in 2027
“When I look back at all these years, I think that we have accomplished a lot, that I have accomplished a lot,” she said.
She added: “We need to consolidate and make sure that this is really solid and reliable. So my baseline is that it will take until the end of my term.”
Reuters exclusively reported on Feb 19. Ms Lagarde sent a private message to fellow policymakers later on Feb 18, reassuring them that she was still concentrating on her role of leading Europe’s most important financial institution and that they would hear it from her, rather than the press, if she wanted to step down.
Like her message to colleagues, Ms Lagarde’s Journal interview dampened speculation about an early exit, but left the door ajar to the possibility.
She declined to comment to the newspaper on the Financial Times report. The ECB said in a written statement that Ms Lagarde had not made a decision about the end of her term, but stopped short of denying the report.
The ECB president said in 2025 she intended to complete her term, a commitment she conspicuously failed to repeat this week.
When Ms Lagarde’s name first emerged as a possible candidate for ECB president in 2019, she said she had no interest in the job and would not leave the International Monetary Fund, where she was the managing director.
Lagarde’s many options
Ms Lagarde told the Journal that she viewed her mission as price and financial stability, as well as “protecting the euro, making sure that it is solid and strong and fit for the future of Europe”.
She also said that the World Economic Forum was “one of the many options” she was considering once she left the central bank.
Bank of France governor Francois Villeroy de Galhau announced plans to step down from his job last week, in a move that gives Mr Macron a chance to pick the next French central bank chief.
The French president picks the country’s central bank governor and, as the head of the euro zone’s second largest economy, plays an important role in wider negotiations to select the head of the ECB.
Polls show either far-right National Rally leader Marine Le Pen, or her protege Jordan Bardella, could win the French presidency
While the party has long dropped a call for France to leave the euro, the party is still seen as something of an unknown quantity in central banking circles. REUTERS

NORAD detects Russian planes off of Alaska, sends aircraft in response
Sign up now: Get ST's newsletters delivered to your inbox
Feb 19 - The North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD) said on Thursday it detected and tracked multiple Russian military aircraft operating in the Alaskan Air Defense Identification Zone (ADIZ) off Alaska.
NORAD detected and tracked two Russian Tu-95s, two Su-35s, and one A-50 operating in the Alaskan Air Defense Identification zone, the U.S and Canadian defense organization said in a statement.
NORAD said it responded by launching two F-16s, two F-35s, one E-3, and four KC-135s to intercept, positively identify, and escort the aircraft.
The Russian military aircraft remained in international airspace and did not enter American or Canadian sovereign airspace, NORAD said, adding that the aircraft were escorted until they departed the Alaskan ADIZ. REUTERS

Can Europe survive without US defence? Surprisingly, the Baltic sea nations are showing the way | Elisabeth Braw

When European countries in the Baltic Sea region joined Nato for protection against Russia, they were not anticipating their most powerful Nato ally would be the one threatening to seize territory from them. The shock of the Greenland crisis may have faded from the headlines, but Donald Trump’s US has also suggested it may decide not to defend Europe. And Russia continues to be a nuisance in the Baltic Sea.
Luckily, the vulnerable Baltic nations have launched an impressive string of initiatives to keep their mini-ocean safe. As the US sheds responsibility for Europe’s defence, these efforts could provide a model for the future of Nato itself.
Finland announced in January that it would team up with other Baltic Sea countries to create a maritime surveillance centre. Finland sees it as a way to increase capability and authority to intervene in “situations” in its territorial sea and exclusive economic zone. It’s a sensible measure.
And it’s not the only one. When the two Nord Stream pipelines exploded in the exclusive economic zones of Sweden and Denmark in September 2022, it took the region by complete surprise. To be sure, a few prophetic voices had been warning for years that undersea cables and pipelines were vulnerable to sabotage, but with virtually no suspicious incidents jeopardising this invaluable infrastructure, complacency set in. Then came the sabotage of Nord Stream, followed by the arrival of the Russian shadow fleet – designed to dodge oil sanctions – and the mysterious rupture of two cables and a pipeline in 2023.
The ocean’s coastal states – minus Russia – began cooperating more. As undersea cables continued to be mysteriously cut, threatening energy and internet provision, and shadow vessels traversed these waters on a daily basis, they began to improve information-sharing, a boring but essential measure. They launched an AI tool called Nordic Warden to detect anomalies above undersea cables and pipelines. Their navies and coastguards expanded maritime patrolling. They launched shadow-vessel inspections (a more difficult task than it sounds, because international maritime law grants all vessels freedom of navigation). Early last year, they even created a joint maritime patrolling service to protect cables and pipelines day and night. Although Baltic Sentry, as this patrol is called, is officially a Nato initiative, it’s executed by the Baltic Sea nations themselves.
For Estonia, 2023 was a rude awakening, as Erkki Tori, the country’s national security adviser, told me. Now, in 2026, he says that Russia’s shadow fleet is being tackled not just in the Baltic Sea, but in other waters as well. Existing maritime law is a constraint but it does allow certain types of action, Tori insists. The exchange of ideas and practices with other countries is a vital part of the solution.
The same approach – taking action within the limits of international law – goes for the protection of undersea cables and pipelines.“The international mechanisms that the world has were not built for things like this, but we’ve tried anyway – within the rule of law,” Tori says.
The Baltic Sea nations appear to have inspired other countries. The French navy seized an alleged Russian shadow tanker with false flag registration in the waters between Spain and Morocco in January. It was the second such intervention by France of a suspected shadow tanker in recent months.
Indeed, the Baltic Sea nations are demonstrating what Nato’s member states can do, especially by teaming up with their neighbours. That matters now that the alliance’s ability to operate is being questioned. As the Danish prime minister, Mette Frederiksen, concluded during the height of the Greenland crisis, Nato would no longer exist if the US decided to attack the territory of another member country.
Trump may decide to leave Greenland in peace for the time being (although Frederiksen is not too sanguine on that point, as she made clear at the Munich Security Conference). Even so, the question remains whether the US would support European countries in case of attack, as the Nato treaty’s mutual defence pledge, or article 5, requires. “If they don’t pay, I’m not going to defend them,” Trump said last March, referring to his European allies in Nato. A few months later, member states committed to spending 5% of GDP on defence and related areas.
Ordinary Europeans have already drawn their own conclusions about how Nato must be reimagined for an era in which the US puts up less and less of the military capability. In Sweden, only a quarter of the population believes the US would come to its aid in the case of an attack. Last June, 51% of Britons considered it unlikely that the US would come to the aid of the Baltic states in case of a Russian attack.
That’s why initiatives such as the Baltic Sea nations’ maritime collaboration are so essential. Nato may survive or even thrive in the long term. Trump may abandon his confrontational stance. But nobody knows. Teaming up in smaller groups is imperative: it allows Nato countries to look after their own regions, without Nato and without the US. What’s more, it does no harm to the alliance.
The localised cooperation we are seeing among the Baltic Sea nations is a taste of Nato’s future.

New drone unit to investigate illegal waste dumping across England

A new 33-strong drone unit is being deployed to investigate the scourge of illegal waste dumping across England, the government has announced.
The improvements to the investigation of illegal waste dumping – which costs the UK economy £1bn a year – come as the ringleader of a major waste crime gang was ordered to pay £1.4m after being convicted at Birmingham crown court.
Varun Datta, 36, from London, was responsible for the organised illegal dumping of mostly municipal waste at a network of 16 sites across the country, including at a historic manor house and a nature reserve in Lancashire.
Datta – described as a “prolific waste criminal” – was given a four-month jail sentence, suspended for 18 months, and ordered to pay £1.1m, reflecting the financial benefit from his crimes, plus £100,000 in compensation and £200,000 in prosecution costs.
On Friday the government announced a set of new tougher measures to tackle illegal waste dumping.
It will step up its use of drones, with the introduction of a new 33-strong drone team. Some drones will be equipped with light detection and ranging (lidar) technology, which can create highly detailed maps of illegal waste sites.
The Environment Agency, which holds the responsibility for investigating waste crime, has increased the size of its joint investigations unit to 20 specialists.
Phil Davies, the head of the joint unit for waste crime, said: “With organised criminals becoming ever more sophisticated, we are adopting new technologies to find and, importantly, stop them. Through the greater use of drones, stronger partnerships and more officers on the ground, we will build on our action so far and send a clear message to those committing waste crimes – we will stop you.”
The EA secured a major victory against Datta when he was convicted last week after pleading guilty to knowingly causing controlled waste to be deposited at 16 sites. The weight of the waste totalled about 4,275 tonnes, and the illegal dumps were spread across Lincolnshire, Cambridgeshire, Lancashire, Kent, Surrey, Rutland and Middlesbrough.
Datta was convicted along with two other men. Two further suspects are still being hunted.
Judge Paul Farrer KC said at the sentencing the crimes were reckless. “Smell and flies were a feature at some of the illegal sites and caused a localised adverse effect to air quality,” he said. Landowners had been forced to incur substantial costs to remove the illegal waste, he added.
He gave Datta a four-month prison sentence, suspended for 18 months, as well as 30 days’ rehabilitation and 200 hours of unpaid work.
The court heard that Datta became a registered waste broker through his company, Atkins Recycling Ltd, in 2015. He acted recklessly by claiming the waste the company handled was being sent to a legal site at Kiveton Park, near Sheffield. However, the loads were actually diverted to unlicensed dumps around the country, the court heard.
The Middleton nature reserve in Lancashire was one of the locations where waste was dumped. Part of the £100,000 compensation is intended to be used to restore the reserve.
Mohammed Saraji Bashir, 45, of Peterborough, who pleaded guilty to knowingly causing controlled waste to be deposited at three sites, was also given a suspended four-month prison sentence, 30 days of rehabilitation activity and 200 hours of unpaid work.
Robert William McAllister, 55, of Northwood, London, had pleaded guilty to failing to comply with the duty of care imposed on brokers of waste in relation to controlled waste that was deposited at two sites. He was fined £750.

‘Al-Aqsa is a detonator’: six-decade agreement on prayer at Jerusalem holy site collapses
Unknown

14:00:24 KST

A six-decade agreement governing Muslim and Jewish prayer at Jerusalem’s most sensitive holy site has “collapsed” under pressure from Jewish extremists backed by the Israeli government, experts have warned.
A series of arrests of Muslim caretaker staff, bans on access for hundreds of Muslims, and escalating incursions by radical Jewish groups culminated this week in the arrest of the imam of al-Aqsa mosque and an Israeli police raid during evening prayers on the first night of Ramadan.
The actions by the Jerusalem police and the Shin Bet internal security force, both now under far-right leadership, represent a rupture in the status quo agreement dating back to the aftermath of the 1967 war, which stipulates that only Muslims are permitted to pray in the sacred compound around the mosque, known as the al-Haram al-Sharif to Muslims, which also encompasses the seventh-century Dome of the Rock shrine. To Jews it is the Temple Mount, the site of the 10th-century BCE first temple and second temple, which was destroyed by the Romans in 70 CE.
Changes in the status quo have historically shown the potential to ignite unrest and conflict in Jerusalem and the Palestinian occupied territories with repercussions across the world. A visit by the then Israeli opposition leader, Ariel Sharon, in 2000 ignited the second Palestinian intifada, which lasted five years, and Hamas gave the name al-Aqsa Flood to its attack on Israel in October 2023 which killed 1200 Israelis and triggered the Gaza war, claiming it was provoked by Israeli violations at the Jerusalem mosque.
“Al-Aqsa is a detonator,” said Daniel Seidemann, a Jerusalem lawyer who has regularly advised Israeli, Palestinian and foreign governments on legal and historical issues in the city. “It’s usually around the same thing – a real or perceived threat to the integrity of sacred space. And that’s what we’re witnessing. There have been provocations frequently during Ramadan, but things are exponentially more sensitive now. The West Bank is a tinderbox.”
Tensions have escalated steadily around al-Aqsa mosque as far-right Israelis have taken up key security positions. The national security minister, Itamar Ben-Gvir – who had eight criminal convictions before taking office, for supporting a terrorist organisation and incitement to racism, among other charges – has said he wanted to raise the Israeli flag at the compound and build a synagogue there.
Ben-Gvir has made inflammatory visits to the al-Aqsa site over the past year, and backed a series of unilateral changes to the status quo, allowing Jews to pray and sing in the compound. In January, he installed an ideological ally, Maj Gen Avshalom Peled, as the Jerusalem police chief, and with the reported backing of the prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, allowed Jews to take printed prayer sheets on to the site, in ever-more clearcut violations.
“The status quo has collapsed because there are prayers on a daily basis,” Seidemann said. “In the past, the police were very strict about preventing any kind of provocation … but these measures are displays of ‘we’re in control here, get used to it or get out of the way’.”
In the run-up to Ramadan this year, the Jerusalem Waqf, the Jordanian-appointed foundation charged with managing the al-Aqsa site as part of the status quo agreement, has come under increasing pressure. Waqf sources said as many as 17 of its staff had been put in administrative detention (detention without charge) this week by the Shin Bet, and at least 42 staff members had been banned from entering the site.
They said six Waqf offices had been ransacked in recent weeks and the staff prevented from rehanging doors or doing other repairs. The Waqf has been prevented from installing sun and rain shelters or temporary clinics for worshippers. Officials allege they have even been prevented from bringing toilet paper on to the site.
The cumulative effect, the officials said, had been to strain the Waqf’s ability to cater to the 10,000 Muslims expected to come to pray at al-Aqsa mosque over the month of Ramadan.
The Palestinian-run Jerusalem governorate provided different figures: 25 Waqf staff members banned, and four detained. Neither the Jerusalem police nor the Shin Bet responded to requests for comments on the allegations.
In the first week of Ramadan the police extended the morning visiting hours for Jews and tourists from three to five, in another unilateral change to the status quo. On Monday, the al-Aqsa imam, Sheikh Mohammed al-Abbasi, was detained inside the mosque courtyard, according to the Palestinian news agency Wafa, and social media posts showed the police raiding the compound again on Tuesday evening during the first night prayers of Ramadan.
“There are so many ingredients that make this Ramadan especially dangerous,” said Amjad Iraqi, a senior Israel/Palestine analyst at the International Crisis Group. “Last year was relatively smooth, but this year there are a confluence of so many factors on the Israeli and Palestinian sides that may incentivise the Temple Mount activists to try and create new alterations.”
“If in the past the Israeli government felt compelled to engage with regional powers, today they care much less about what they have to say and think,” Iraqi added.
“There has been a diffusion of impunity … Israelis have been able to accomplish a lot outside of the constraints they thought existed politically, militarily and diplomatically, in Gaza and the West Bank. So why would they feel bound by international opinion?”

‘This is catastrophic’: Fergie lying low amid Andrew’s shock arrest
The whereabouts of Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor’s ex-wife and, until recently, housemate are unclear following the former prince’s shock arrest.
Sarah Ferguson has largely kept out of the public eye since the former couple were told to vacate their 30-room royal lodgings near Windsor Castle in September as it emerged that Mountbatten-Windsor remained in contact with convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein for longer than previously claimed.
There were reports the ex-duchess might move in with oldest daughter Princess Beatrice’s family in the Cotswolds, but she was recently spotted in the French Alps with friends before catching up with Princess Eugenie, 35, who was at a contemporary art fair in Qatar for work, according to London’s Daily Mail.
Ferguson is yet to comment since Andrew’s release by British police after his arrest on suspicion of misconduct in public office, and Hello! magazine reports she is “lying low” somewhere in the United Arab Emirates.
London’s Telegraph reported that princesses Beatrice and Eugenie were understood to be “in a state” following their father’s arrest, and a source close to Ferguson questioned how much more she could take.
“This is catastrophic for her and the girls. She seems to be doing her best to put a brave face on it. Her desperation for money was clear stupidity, but does that equate to what she’s going through now?” the source told the Telegraph.
Ferguson, who married then-prince Andrew at a lavish wedding at Westminster Abbey in 1986 before separating just over five years later and divorcing in 1996, has stood by her ex-husband through years of scandal, calling him a “real gentleman” and “principled man” in a since-deleted Instagram post in 2019.
Revelations about the 66-year-old’s own relationship with Epstein, whom she reportedly called a “steadfast, generous and supreme friend” in a 2011 email, have seen her dropped as patron or ambassador from various charities, including children’s hospice Julia’s House, food allergy charity The Natasha Allergy Research Foundation, Prevent Breast Cancer and the Teenage Cancer Trust. A spokesman for Ferguson said at the time that she sent an email on the advice of her lawyers after Epstein threatened to sue her for associating him with sexual abuse in a media interview, Britain’s Press Association reported.
Separately, six companies linked to Ferguson were to be shut down after the latest release of the so-called Epstein files, the BBC and CNN reported.
Amid growing questions over her future, royal commentator Richard Fitzwilliams told the Daily Mail: “Sarah Ferguson has no future at all. She’s shamed and her businesses are closed down, and certainly no charity would touch her.”
Others suggested her former royal title may still have some cachet outside the United Kingdom. According to the Daily Mail, Ferguson is looking for a new PR team to help her return to society.
“In Britain, neither Sarah nor Andrew will be socially accepted again, whatever they try to do or wherever they go. But in the Middle East, no one will care about what they have got up to,” Andrew Lownie, the author of Entitled: The Rise and Fall of the House of York, told the Daily Mail.
Being named in the millions of documents that make up the Epstein files does not imply any wrongdoing. Ferguson has previously said she regrets her friendship with Epstein, while Mountbatten-Windsor has consistently denied any wrongdoing.

Antarctica faces 'devastating changes' under high emissions future

Scientists model best-case and worst-case climate scenarios for Antarctica
In short:
A team of international scientists has modelled the best-case and worst-case scenarios for the Antarctic Peninsula amid human-induced climate change.
They say higher temperatures could reduce sea ice coverage by 20 per cent and trigger other "devastating" impacts on the environment and wildlife by the end of the century.
What's next?
The researchers say emissions need to be curtailed to avoid global temperatures rising more than 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels.
Scientists say parts of Antarctica face "devastating" and "irreversible" impacts from climate change unless urgent action is taken to limit greenhouse gas emissions.
International researchers have raised the alarm after modelling the best-case and worst-case scenarios for the Antarctic Peninsula under a range of global warming outcomes.
The wildlife-rich peninsula, which is already one of the fastest-warming regions on the planet, is the icy continent's main hub for scientific research, tourism and fisheries.
"Its future depends on the choices that we make today," said lead author Professor Bethan Davies, from the UK's Newcastle University.
"Under a low emissions future, we can avoid the most important and detrimental impacts.
"However, under a higher emissions scenario, we risk the loss of sea ice, ice shelves, glaciers, and iconic species such as penguins."
The report, published in Frontiers in Environmental Science, modelled the likely impact of three different scenarios by 2100 and beyond:
- Low emissions, where global temperatures rise by 1.8 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels, noting they are already about 1.5 degrees warmer.
- Medium-high emissions (3.6 degrees above pre-industrial levels)
- Very high emissions (4.4 degrees above pre-industrial levels)
Eight different aspects of the Antarctic Peninsula's environment were examined in relation to potential future impacts.
They included ice shelves, sea ice, land ice, marine ecosystems, terrestrial ecosystems, the Southern Ocean, the atmosphere, extreme events and implications for operations.
The study found low emissions would result in "modest changes" in sea ice, ice shelves and land ice.
Under the mid-range scenario, the modelling indicated further changes, including increased severity and frequency of extreme events and "localised extinction events".
"This scenario, closest to our current trajectory, would see sustained ice loss at a faster rate than present, considerable and practically irreversible changes to habitats, infrastructure damage and challenges to operational environments," the report states.
Under the higher emissions scenario, the modelling showed "long-term and interrelated changes … which are irreversible on a human timescale", including:
- The number of days per year above 0 degrees Celsius rising from 19 to 48
- Sea ice coverage reducing by 20 per cent over winter
- The range of keystone species such as krill contracting to the south, impacting predators such as penguins and whales
- Greatly increased frequency and intensity of extreme events, including atmospheric and oceanic heatwaves
- Significant ice shelf thinning and ice loss in southern parts of the peninsula
- Accelerated ocean warming, warmer air temperatures and increased likelihood of liquid precipitation
- Glacier recession and ice shelf collapse
While the report acknowledges the "uncertainties" of predicting future changes with confidence, it concludes that a low-emissions pathway provides the best chance of protecting the area.
"The higher emissions pathways … would result in dramatic and irreversible changes to the Peninsula, damaging its charismatic wildlife and unique ecosystems, contributing to sea level rise and resulting in significant operational challenges in a region that is increasingly of global geopolitical interest and competition," it states.
"Urgent actions towards maintaining global temperatures as far below 2 degrees C and as close to 1.5 degrees C of warming as possible … are needed to avoid these devastating changes in this vulnerable polar region."
Professor Davies said future changes in Antarctica would have significant repercussions elsewhere.
"Though Antarctica is far away, changes here will impact the rest of the world through changes in sea level, oceanic and atmospheric connections and circulation changes," he said.
"Changes in the Antarctic do not stay in the Antarctic."

Could medical care help cure China’s services trade deficit?
The speed, efficiency and affordability of treatment in China is attracting foreign patients, but some bottlenecks need to be cleared
Chinese demand for overseas schooling, holidays and medical treatment has contributed to a persistent deficit in the country’s services trade, but signs of a tentative counter-current are emerging as a growing stream of foreign patients heads to China.
While patients in the United States or Europe may wait months to secure their first appointment with a specialist, an entire medical journey can be compressed into just a few days in Shanghai, Beijing and other Chinese megacities.
The contrast has become a trending topic on Chinese social media platforms as a rising number of foreign patients praise the speed, efficiency and affordability of medical treatment in China.
“It’s China speed,” said Wu Peng, a doctor specialising in orthopaedics and sports medicine at Shanghai 10th People’s Hospital.
His most recent foreign patient, an American with an anterior cruciate ligament injury, took just a week to progress from initial consultation and imaging to reconstruction surgery and a post-operative check-up.
“Chinese doctors have extensive experience, and treatment here is far more affordable,” Wu said.

‘We Still Have a Long Way to Go’: TIME100 Health Panel Discusses Efforts to Prevent Heart Disease
Unknown
Unknown Publisher
2026-02-20
05:00:00 UTC
14:00:00 KST

At the TIME100 Health Impact Dinner in New York City on Thursday, TIME executive editor Nikhil Kumar kicked off a panel discussion with one big question: Why is heart disease still the leading cause of death for men and women?
“Perhaps before we answer the question of why it’s the leading cause of death today,” replied Dr. Sadiya Khan, a professor of cardiovascular epidemiology and an associate professor of medicine at Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine, “we have to know where we started.”
She began by telling a story: In 1945, when then-President Franklin Roosevelt died, his death seemed “sudden and unexpected,” Khan said. But looking back at the notes from his doctors, Khan said, it’s clear that he had had very high blood pressure for years that was untreated.
“None of us would sit on that today,” Khan said. “We now know we can treat blood pressure. We can add years, decades of life by treating blood pressure. But we still don’t do it. And we still don’t achieve that success.”
Millions of people in the U.S. have high blood pressure, but many of them don’t receive adequate treatment, Khan said. “So I think the answer is: we’ve come a long way, but we still have a long way to go.”
Khan, who was on the 2026 TIME100 Health list for her work on assessing cardiovascular risk early, was joined onstage Thursday by Arianna Huffington, the founder and chief executive officer of health and wellness company Thrive Global, and Victor Bultó, president of Novartis U.S., which sponsored the event in New York City.
Kumar turned the discussion over to Bultó, asking him why Novartis has not only developed therapies to tackle heart disease but has shifted towards addressing human behavior. Bultó, who was also on the 2026 TIME100 Health list, said that the technology that can reduce cardiovascular risk events and add years to many people’s lives already exists—but isn’t being utilized.
“We had to shift from being just a medical sciences company to start shifting into being a social sciences company to understand what is the underlying behavior that actually underpins this,” he said.
Bultó said that his team has learned that humans tend to be “wired to take the dopamine hit of something that gives us pleasure today and discount all the damage it’s going to do in the future.” Now, experts are advocating for greater understanding on how people can change those behaviors.
Khan also talked about her efforts in targeting young women to help them avoid cardiovascular issues later in life. She said that for many young women, healthcare is often focused around pregnancy. And many women experience complications during pregnancy, such as high blood pressure, preeclampsia, and gestational diabetes. She herself had gestational diabetes, and she hadn’t realized that it has a connection to heart disease.
“We’re learning so much more that these early markers can actually be signals and be a red flag about the future. And the important thing is not that that’s scary or that means that I’m going to have a heart attack, but that I can do something about it now,” Khan said. “I can focus on the health behaviors that are going to prevent this from progressing and really make a difference. And with that information, we can empower people—young women, young men—to really be able to take hold of their own health much earlier than we used to think about it.”
“I mean, even today, if you Google heart attack or heart disease, you get a picture of an older person, and that’s not where we should be,” she continued. “We have to start much earlier.”
Huffington called it “inspiring” that both Khan, a prominent doctor, and Bultó, the head of a big pharma company, were willing to talk about the impact that both medicines and behaviors can have on human health.
She said that there are five critical behaviors to consider when it comes to health: sleep, stress, food, exercise, and connection.
“It’s a whole new playbook for pharma that used to basically sell you a drug, have a purely transactional relationship with you, and now is changing that to actually be your partner on your health journey, which obviously includes medicines, but it also includes behavior,” Huffington said.
TIME100 Impact Dinner: Leaders Shaping the Future of Health was presented by Novartis and Aster DM Healthcare.

The voices of the detainees and associations that will participate in Saturday’s demonstration against Denmark’s asylum policy

On Saturday, 21st of February, at 3pm, demonstrators will gather outside the Danish Parliament in Copenhagen to demand the closure of Denmark’s deportation centers. Alongside the civil society group “Close The Camps”, residents of detention and deportation centres, as well as psychologists, lawyers, students, and members of other grassroots organisations, will march to Kongens Nytorv, calling out the country’s strict asylum policies.
Residents from several of Denmark’s deportation centres will attend the protest. Among them are residents from Kærshovedgård and Sjælsmark, the deportation centres by the Danish Prison and Probation Service, Danmarks Fængsler. Residents at Kærshovedgård are men or couples without minors. In addition, residents from Avnstrup, the centre accommodating families in the asylum system, and Sandholm, Denmark’s primary arrival centre, are expected to participate. Residents from Holmegaard, a facility on the island of Langeland that has been used in recent years for asylum housing and contingency accommodation, will also be present.
Residents from the Ellebæk immigration centre will not be able to attend the protest, as it is a closed, prison-like facility where freedom of movement is fully restricted. In 2020, a report from the Council of Europe’s Committee for the Prevention of Torture described the conditions as “unfit for human beings.” The committee stated that conditions at the centre were among the worst in Europe, and even worse than those in the Danish prisons it had inspected. In 2024, Amnesty International Denmark further expressed their concerns towards prolonged deprivation of liberty without a clear release. Voices from Ellebæk will be heard through testimonies read out during the demonstration.
The demonstration is a response not only to the stricter rules in the deportation camps, but also to the trend of Denmark becoming a “European role model for how people are treated within the asylum system”, explained Julie Stokholm Daugaard, member of Close The Camps. She added, “It has already become a scary picture that has shaped policies in other countries of the European Union.”
Life inside the system
Valerii, a Ukrainian resident, was sent to Kærshovedgård for the first time in 2024. For a crime he committed, he received a sentence of four months in prison, but he ended up staying for eight months. From Horlivka – a city occupied by Russia as early as 2014 – Valerii says Ukraine is no longer his home. When we met him, he was sitting in a chair that had been taped together several times. Next to him was a notebook with the speech he planned to deliver at Saturday’s protest. From his neatly organised desk, he looked out into the forest, right onto the barred metal fences. The closest town, Bording, is roughly seven kilometres away.
Valerii has a daughter who was born in Denmark and is now two years old. He described how the system affects her well-being and development, recalling her asking, “Daddy, when are you coming home?” A question he cannot answer, because there is no release date.
Since the beginning of 2026, reporting requirements have tightened further, imposing daily registration and stripping residents of the right to drive. Kasia Skoluda, chairperson of the NGO Solidarity with Kærshovedgård, said residents most often report a lack of basic medical care. “The system is basically about survival,” she noted. “If something is not absolutely necessary, it won’t be treated.”
The Danish Ministry of Immigration and Integration commented that residents with mental health issues at Kærshovedgård are accommodated in a separate area with no access for other residents due to their specific circumstances. Valerii added that “the public doesn’t see that [Kærshovedgård is] a place of isolation. They don’t understand what it means to live in uncertainty for years. Without work, without the possibility to study or simply to feel like a human being.”
The Danish Ministry of Immigration and Integration commented that as the residents do not have legal stay, they do not have permission to work in Denmark. Those without legal stay are expelled due to criminal convictions or rejected asylum seekers who are not cooperating with the immigration authorities on their departure. Residents are free to leave Denmark as it is their obligation according to law.
Conditions in Ellebæk are even more restrictive. According to Clara Nepper Winthe, another member of Close The Camps, “Residents in Ellebæk are completely disconnected. They don’t have access to the internet, and their only link to the outside world is a phone hanging on the wall in the corridor,” she explained. Coupled with limited access to outdoor time, she added, this further affects residents’ mental health.
As the Demonstration approaches
As the weekend approaches, Valerii prepares to speak in front of hundreds of people. For him, attending the protest is “a way of telling the world that we do not agree with how we are being treated, that we want our voices to be heard.”
But speaking out does not come without risk. “Even if the majority of us are there with peaceful intentions, it only takes a small number of people to create chaos, and that can lead to serious consequences for everyone involved”, explained another resident, Kamran. “In my situation, that risk feels especially serious, because any negative incident could affect my case. Still, many of us participate because remaining silent feels even harder than taking that risk.” Kamran concludes. Kamran’s name was changed as he requested to remain anonymous in this article.
Amid tightening regulations, hope persists alongside uncertainty. Kamran explained, “Solidarity helps reduce the feeling of isolation and strengthens our belief that change is possible.”
Valerii said, “I love my daughter and I’m not stopping. I’m going to the end. I fight for my human rights.” He concluded, “when Danes or other activists support us, it means we are not alone. It proves that there are other people who see us as human beings, not just numbers in a system. It gives us the strength to continue to fight.”

Migration issues split Social Democrats in the European Parliament
Swedish Social Democrat MEPs in the European Parliament recently voted with the right-wing parties, and against the line of their own party group.
It was on the controversial issue of setting up a list of countries that are considered safe to send migrants back to, including Egypt, Morocco and Tunisia.
The Social Democrats' affiliated political group in the EU parliament, the centre-left Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats, said that they would vote against the proposal.

12 Malaysian police arrested over Chinese nationals’ missing crypto
Officers allegedly stormed a Selangor bungalow, seized laptops and forced a Chinese national to fork over US$51,000 in digital assets
The arrests, announced on Thursday, came just days after Malaysia’s king had issued a blunt warning about corruption within the civil service and police ranks, cautioning that such practices were on his “radar”.
Selangor police chief Shazeli Kahar said the officers were taken into custody following a complaint filed on February 6 by one of eight alleged victims, who local media said were aged between 25 and 45.
The group claim they were robbed when police stormed a bungalow in Kajang district, outside Kuala Lumpur, confiscating their phones and laptops before coercing one of them to transfer digital assets to a specific cryptocurrency account, local English-language daily New Straits Times reported.
“Immediate action was taken and 12 police officers were arrested to assist investigations,” Shazeli said in a statement. He confirmed that the case was being treated as a gang robbery involving a foreign national’s cryptocurrency but did not provide additional details.

Deadly tower collapse has locals in Lebanon’s Tripoli asking: Are we next?
February 8 collapse killed at least 15 people in Lebanon’s second city, where buildings are in poor condition after decades of underinvestment.
Tripoli, Lebanon – Hossam Hazrouni points underneath a concrete staircase to the exposed foundation of the building where he lives.
“Inside, there, look,” the 65-year-old says. “The interior pillars are all broken. It’s covered in water. Everything inside is wet.”

A few metres away lies a pile of smashed concrete blocks and twisted metal. It is the rubble of a building that collapsed on February 8, killing at least 15 people.
In Tripoli, collapsed buildings are fast becoming common. This is the fourth building to collapse this winter alone. Today, hundreds of buildings are at risk of collapse due to a lethal combination of ageing infrastructure, unregulated construction, Lebanon’s 2019 economic crisis, the 2023 earthquake that fractured much of the local infrastructure’s foundation, and a relatively heavy rain season.
Locals like Hazrouni are afraid their buildings will be next.
“They told us that you should evacuate and you shouldn’t stay, but how are we supposed to leave when we are in a bad situation?” he asked, raising his palms to the sky. “Where are we supposed to go?”
Collapsing structures
In the 1950s, Tripoli, Lebanon’s second-largest city and the largest in the country’s north, was a hub for trade and shipping in the region. But in the intervening years, its status has fallen to become one of the poorest cities on the Mediterranean Sea.
It is also a city of massive disparity. Multiple billionaires live in Tripoli, including the former Prime Minister Najib Mikati and former Minister of Finance Mohammad Safadi, while about 45 percent of the city’s population lives in poverty, according to a 2024 World Bank report.
Over the years, most of Tripoli’s middle- and upper-class residents have moved to the southern edge of the city, leaving behind its impoverished classes to inhabit the decaying old city. Many of the poor know their concrete buildings are ageing and in poor condition, but have little means to fix them.
“The first problem is that the structures are old,” Fayssal al-Baccar, an engineer, told Al Jazeera from a restaurant in southern Tripoli. Al-Baccar is also the founder of the Tripoli Emergency Fund, a private initiative started in response to the collapsing building issue that has been fundraising to help the city.
“The lifespan of concrete is between 50 to 80 years,” al-Baccar explained, and in many of the buildings in central Tripoli, that lifespan is coming to an end. On a sheet of white paper with a blue pen, he drew a model of a building’s foundation.
“Through time, the pH [level] of the concrete will become more and more acidic,” he said, sketching lines around the base of his drawn wall. “Then it will corrode the steel – the steel will self-destruct – and the building will collapse.”
The issue has been exacerbated by a few incidents in particular. When a 2023 earthquake devastated northern Syria and southern Turkiye, it was widely felt in Tripoli as well. Local officials say that it damaged much of the infrastructural foundations of older buildings, many of which have had irregular or unregulated floors added to them, making them weaker. The area has also suffered from neglect and a lack of infrastructure for years, even before the 2019 economic and banking crisis.
Lastly, there is the issue of water damage. This year, Lebanon has received more rainfall than in the last couple of years. And in the days leading up to the collapsed building on February 8, it rained multiple times. “Water is infiltrating into the concrete and is also making the steel worse,” al-Baccar said.
That is why al-Baccar has recruited whom he described as some of the city’s “best and most successful” to help fill governmental gaps.
One of those people is Sarah al-Charif, the Tripoli Emergency Fund’s spokesperson and fundraising committee member. She is also the Lebanon director for Ruwwad Al Tanmeya, a nonprofit focused on youth and disenfranchised communities, and was appointed vice president of Tripoli’s Port Authority last year.
“You’re talking about areas where most, if not all, of the buildings are old and dilapidated, some of which are actually on the verge of collapse,” al-Charif said from her office at Ruwwad Al Tanmeya’s office in Bab al-Tabbaneh, less than a kilometre (0.62 miles) away from where the building collapsed on February 8.
“The fact that the problem is so big reflects decades of accumulated neglect by a state that hasn’t fulfilled its obligations towards this city,” she said.
Al-Charif said she doesn’t hold the current government – which took office a year ago – responsible, but that historically, “people who were in positions of power didn’t do anything, they weren’t fulfilling their duties”.
“There’s also a part that falls on the landlord, a part that falls on the tenant, and a part that falls on the merchants who are the builders. Maybe they’re using substandard materials,” she said. “So everyone has to take their share of the responsibility.”
Historical neglect
Standing on the street, Wissam Kafrouni, 70, points to the top floor of a building just a few doors down from the structure that collapsed on February 8. A crack runs zig-zagging down the building’s side, in the pattern of descending stairs. His nephew rents the top-floor apartment, he says, but the landlord is claiming that repairs are the responsibility of the tenant.
Locals in this neighbourhood say that many officials have visited the site in recent days, including Prime Minister Nawaf Salam. They also say that they’ve been told for years that the local municipality has plans to fix the infrastructure, but that little has come about from it.
The local government has known about the issue for years, but until now, little has been done. Deputy Mayor Khaled Kabbara is part of a new municipal government elected in 2025.
“The issue of cracked buildings is a very old issue in the city of Tripoli, and unfortunately, it has not been dealt with in previous periods,” he told Al Jazeera from Tripoli’s municipality headquarters. But this new municipal government that was elected in 2025, he said, has “raised its voice”.
Kabbara also said that Tripoli has been historically ignored by Beirut “since independence” in the 1940s, but that the current government was working with the local government to find solutions.
“Honestly, this is the first time that we feel that someone is listening and there is someone who is working with us,” he said.
A group of engineers are currently inspecting buildings around the city to decide if damaged buildings can be repaired or must be evacuated and demolished. Evacuation warnings have been issued for 114 buildings, though that number is expected to rise substantially.
Families that evacuate should receive a one-year shelter allowance to secure alternative housing. Religious institutions have opened their doors to evacuees, while Turkiye has also promised to donate about 100 prefabricated houses.
A call centre has also been set up for residents to report suspected issues with their buildings. The hotline has so far received reports on approximately 650 different buildings, Kabbara said.
One of the buildings previously reported to the call centre was the building that collapsed on February 8. Locals had heard a creaking sound coming from the building.
Kabbara acknowledged that the report was received and that the residents were afraid. However, he said, the engineers had not inspected it before it collapsed because nothing in the report indicated it needed an urgent inspection.
What comes next?
Back in Bab al-Tabbaneh, numerous locals expressed frustration and fear. They said many officials and associations have visited the site, but few have delivered on promises to help them.
“We’ve been told there is a plan to fix the infrastructure since the Siniora government,” Samir Rajab, 56, said, referring to Fouad Siniora, the prime minister of Lebanon from 2005 to 2009. “But nothing happens.”
Next to the destroyed building site, Mustapha al-Abed, 54, repaired a broken washing machine out of a small workshop. He said his work was not very fruitful lately, as poverty forced many in this area with broken appliances to wash their laundry by hand.
He looked over at the site where the building had gone down just days earlier. “The problem is not here any more. These people are already dead,” he said. He then pointed across the street to a bustling neighbourhood, where people were doing their Ramadan shopping.
“The problem is all the other buildings.”

Thai police go undercover as Lunar New Year lion dancers to catch thief
When Thai police were having trouble catching a serial burglar, they came up with a creative plan
- Bookmark
Thai police came up with a creative plan to nab a serial burglar who repeatedly slipped through their fingers: going undercover in a traditional lion costume to get close to their elusive quarry.
Video footage released by the Bangkok police department showed officers hidden beneath a red-and-gold lion costume dancing toward the suspect on Wednesday as he wandered through a Lunar New Year fair at a temple in Nonthaburi, a province neighbouring Bangkok.
Moments later, the officer who was holding the lion’s papier mache head lunges at the suspect and swiftly pins the man to the ground.
Police say the suspect, identified as a 33-year-old man, is accused of breaking into the home of a local police commander in Bangkok three times earlier this month, making off with valuables worth about 2 million baht ($64,000).
In a press release, police said they had attempted to arrest the man several times, but he was quick to spot police officers and ran off.
They later identified him by tracing stolen amulets he had sold and learned that he frequently visited temples in Nonthaburi.
While the Lunar New Year is not an official holiday in Thailand, celebrations are common and lion dances are often part of the festivities, providing the perfect cover for the operation.
Police said the suspect has confessed to the burglaries, saying he stole to buy drugs and gamble. They added that he has previously been convicted of drug-related offences and burglary.

‘He had the world at his feet’: Coroner finds ‘missed opportunities’ in teen’s anaphylactic death
Harry Tsindos hunched over in his chair and wept as details of his teenage son’s final moments were read out in the Victorian Coroner’s Court.
In his hands he held a wooden stick figure, a present from his son James, who made the ornament when he was in grade 3. He found the gift by chance in the back seat of his car this week.
“Dad, I love you so much and happy Father’s Day,” a handwritten note scrawled on it read. “I’ll never let you go.”
On Friday, coroner Sarah Gebert ruled there had been several missed opportunities in the year 12 student’s medical care after he suffered a severe anaphylactic reaction to a burrito bowl and was rushed to hospital on May 27, 2021.
In the corner of the packed courtroom sat a smiling photo of 17-year-old James, dressed in his Brighton Grammar uniform, a “piano prodigy”, who was intelligent, kind, funny and adored by his family.
His mother, Venetia, sat in the front row and wiped away tears, her fingernails painted black and white like the keys of a piano in honour of the son who had filled their home with serene music.
The meal, which James ordered from a vegan restaurant via now-defunct food delivery app Deliveroo, contained a cashew nut sauce.
James, who had history of allergic rhinitis and asthma, noticed his lip swelling, tingling in his throat and abdominal pain after eating part of the burrito bowl.
His dad called an ambulance and James received two doses of adrenaline from paramedics five minutes apart. His condition appeared to improve, but the inquest heard that James developed a wheeze on the way to Holmesglen Private Hospital.
The teenager told healthcare workers at the hospital he was struggling to breathe, and he wanted his mum. Seconds later, he lost consciousness.
Gebert said that James’ wheeze warranted an emergency category 2 response from the hospital, triggering urgent treatment within 10 minutes.
Instead, staff had triaged him as category 3, requiring treatment within 30 minutes.
Expert witnesses Associate Professor Warwick Butt, an intensive care consultant and globally decorated clinician, told an inquest James’ wheezing and his use of an asthma puffer 15 times at the hospital should have been a red flag to immediately escalate his care.
“His condition was likely to become very severe, very quickly. He needed immediate treatment,” Butt said.
However, Gebert noted there has been a failure by the hospital staff to recognise the severity of James’ wheeze, which should have been treated as if it were secondary anaphylaxis: a dangerous recurrence of severe, life-threatening allergic symptoms that can happen after the initial reaction.
At 4.10pm, James’ condition deteriorated rapidly, and he was administered a third dose of adrenaline.
He was transferred to the resuscitation ward and quickly went into cardiac arrest.
Gebert agreed with an expert medical panel who found that earlier administration of that third shot of adrenaline, by roughly 10 to 15 minutes, may have significantly improved James’ chances, but may not have guaranteed his survival.
She made eight recommendations including that the Department of Health update its guidelines around anaphylaxis management for young people who also suffer from asthma.
“The loss of James to his family has been shattering, and I do not have the words which could even come close to encapsulating that loss,” Gebert said.
“It is apparent that his death occurred at a time when he was excitedly contemplating his future beyond school. He had the world at his feet.”
The coroner called for Safer Care Victoria to develop a statewide approach to the treatment of anaphylaxis presentations in emergency departments and increase awareness of recurrent attacks.
She said the state’s health department should also require best practice guidelines, developed by the National Allergy Council and the Allergy and Anaphylaxis, to be used for online food ordering to reduce the risk of allergic reactions from inadvertent exposure.
Outside court, Harry clutched a photo of his son while the family’s lawyer, Shari Liby, from Slater and Gordon, read out a statement on their behalf.
“James lit up our lives and those of everyone around him, and without him things are dark,” they said.
“What happened to James is a tragedy that has shattered our family. We, like the coroner, hope that the terrible circumstances of James’ death can be used to keep other patients safe in the future.
“While our family home is no longer filled with the sound of James at the piano, we do feel some gratitude to know that his death has not been in vain.”

Venezuela approves amnesty law that could free hundreds of political prisoners
Landmark amnesty bill was signed by Venezuela’s interim president nearly seven weeks after the capture of Nicolas Maduro by the US
Venezuela’s National Assembly on Thursday unanimously approved a long-awaited amnesty law that could free hundreds of political prisoners jailed for being government detractors.
But the law excludes those who have been prosecuted or convicted of promoting military action against the country - which could include opposition leaders like Nobel Peace Prize winner Maria Corina Machado, who has been accused by the ruling party of calling for international intervention like the one that ousted former president Nicolas Maduro.
The bill was signed by interim president Delcy Rodriguez, who pushed for the legislation under pressure from Washington, after she rose to power following Maduro’s capture during a US military raid on January 3.
“One must know how to ask for forgiveness and one must also know how to receive forgiveness,” Rodriguez said at the Miraflores presidential palace in the capital Caracas, after signing the bill into law.
In one of the first releases after the bill passed, Machado ally and former National Assembly vice-president Juan Pablo Guanipa announced his release from detention after about nine months in prison and under house arrest.

Petro rallies thousands as Colombia’s wage battle spills into streets

Thousands of demonstrators marched across Colombia on Thursday after President Gustavo Petro called supporters into the streets in response to a court ruling that temporarily blocked his government’s sweeping minimum wage increase.
The protests erupted after the Council of State, the country’s highest administrative tribunal, provisionally suspended the 23.7 percent wage hike decreed in December, citing potential procedural flaws and concerns over its economic impact.
The capital Bogotá became the focal point of demonstrations, with major roads blocked and public transport disrupted as marchers flooded the city center.
Rallies also took place in Cali, Medellín and Barranquilla, reflecting nationwide mobilisation behind the wage measure.
By afternoon, crowds converged on Plaza de Bolívar, where unions, workers’ groups, and representatives from Indigenous and Afro-Colombian communities gathered to show support for the policy.
Proposal resubmitted to the court
Addressing the crowd, Petro struck a defiant tone, insisting his administration would maintain the new minimum wage of two million pesos (about $544) and had not altered “a single digit” of the decree.
He said new technical studies backed the increase and confirmed the government had resubmitted the measure to the court for reconsideration.
The Council of State’s intervention followed lawsuits arguing the decree may have bypassed legal requirements that wage adjustments be weighed against inflation, productivity and the risk of pushing businesses into the informal economy.
With the suspension still in force, the dispute has evolved into a broader institutional standoff, pitting the presidency against the judiciary and raising uncertainty over Colombia’s economic outlook.

Argentina's lower house passes labor reform before final Senate vote
Sign up now: Get ST's newsletters delivered to your inbox
BUENOS AIRES, Feb 20 - The lower house of Argentina’s Congress approved on Friday a contentious labor reform bill backed by libertarian President Javier Milei, despite a nationwide strike by unions opposing the changes that had brought parts of the country to a halt.
Investors have been closely watching the legislation, passed by 135 votes in favor with 115 against, to see whether Milei has the power to continue implementing his free-market agenda.
The government says the bill, approved last week by the Senate with support from the ruling party and its center‑right allies, will spur investment and boost formal employment.
Lawmakers were debating modifications in the early hours on Friday before sending the bill back to the Senate for a final vote to become law. Among the changes was the removal of an article that reduced sickness-related benefits for employees.
"What good is an entire library of labor legislation if, at the end of the day, the system it establishes doesn’t serve to create jobs?" ruling party lawmaker Lisandro Almiron asked during the debate on the bill.
However, unions say the proposed overhaul threatens long‑standing worker protections, including the right to strike.
In protest, the powerful CGT union called a 24‑hour stoppage on Thursday by transport workers, public sector staff and bank employees. REUTERS

Women gave the monarchy decency. Has men’s indecency forever soiled the crown?

Opinion
Women gave the monarchy decency. Has men’s indecency forever soiled the crown?
The shame is of titanic proportions. Members of the royal family aren’t meant to appear slumped in the back of cop cars, leaving police stations, caught by cameras looking stricken in flashlight. In fact, one of the underpinnings of the monarchy is that monarchs are above the law, not subject to it, based on the understanding that their behaviour is impeccable and worthy of respect. Even their offspring benefit from this sense of somehow floating above commoners.
Which is why it is even more shocking when their reputations are dirtied by allegations of having sexually abused minors (individually and in an orgy) and a close association with a billionaire who orchestrated a global sex-trafficking paedophile network, even trading official secrets with them.
Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor, previously the entitled Prince of (Previous) Impunity, has been arrested and investigated over suspicions of misconduct in public office. This comes after the release of millions of Epstein file documents prompted accusations that, when he was a British trade envoy, he shared confidential information with Jeffrey Epstein. He has now been released after questioning, and we wait to see if charges will ensue.
Of course, Mountbatten-Windsor – while he somehow remains eighth in line to the throne – is not a monarch. He is both the son and the disgraced brother of one. As Keir Starmer said, he may yet face the full force of the law, like one of the King’s subjects.
To fully understand the extent of the shame, we need to understand the history of the monarchy. To find royals who have last been arrested and actually executed, we need to go back to the bloody 16th and 17th centuries. Both Mary, Queen of Scots and King Charles I were tried for treason and beheaded.
The only modern royal to have a criminal record is Princess Anne, who, not long after she was hit with a fine for speeding in her Bentley, pleaded guilty to a charge under the Dangerous Dogs Act after her English bull terrier – Dotty – bit two children in Windsor Great Park in 2002.
It is the dutiful women – the long-serving queens Victoria and Elizabeth II – who have imbued the monarchy with respectability and decency. The Victorian era had its own scandals: Victoria’s son Bertie was called to testify in a divorce case where he was named as one of the men with whom Lady Harriet Mordaunt had committed adultery. The public scoffed when he denied it, given his well-earned reputation as a philanderer, but poor Lady Harriet was declared to be insane and thrown into a psychiatric institution, as so many “difficult” women were. (For centuries, when women have spoken of sexual transgressions or crimes, they have been dismissed as deranged Pinocchios. “She has no credibility,” Epstein told a reporter of Virginia Giuffre, Mountbatten-Windsor’s accuser. She spoke “total horseshit”, was a “total liar”. Epstein emailed someone he called the Duke that “the only person she didn’t have sex with was Elvis”.)
Victoria’s cousin, King Leopold II of Belgium, was the most filthy and disreputable of the lot. He was not only responsible for millions of deaths in the Congo – the first time the term “crimes against humanity” was used was for him – but he imported young virgins from Britain for his pleasure. He paid £800 a month for this steady stream of girls aged 10 to 15. And what happened, you might ask? Nothing. He continued his disgusting ways until his death: Belgians booed the funeral procession of this sex-trafficker, who grew his finger nails so long they curled in spirals.
And this takes us to the central question the monarchy is facing: why have they been, for so long, considered above the law? Why is there still such a thing as sovereign immunity?
Under British law, the king or queen is expected to act within the law but is also considered above the law. Sovereign immunity literally means they “can do no wrong” and can’t be prosecuted under civil or criminal law. Nor can they be compelled to give evidence in court. This is only the case for the head of the royal family, but you might understand if your mum or dad was considered to be outside the realm of legal consequence, a bit of that might rub off on you too.
After all, the sovereign is the head of the church and the “fount of all justice”, meaning courts derive authority from the crown. Even prisoners are detained at “her/his majesty’s pleasure”.
An article on the British Monarchy website outlined: “Although civil and criminal proceedings cannot be taken against the Sovereign as a person under UK law, The Queen is careful to ensure that all her activities in her personal capacity are carried out in strict accordance with the law.”
Since the late 1960s, exemptions were made to more than 160 laws, allowing immunity for Elizabeth II, which automatically transferred to her son Charles upon his coronation. These include not needing to travel with a passport, on the grounds that passports are issued in the monarch’s name. The same rationale applies to driver’s licences. The monarch has immunity from jury duty and, curiously, racial, ethnic and sexual equality laws. Anyone working for the royal family is unable to complain if they are discriminated against on race or sex grounds.
Should this exemption remain? In 1968, the Queen’s head financial manager, Lord Tryon, stated “it was not, in fact, the practice to appoint coloured immigrants or foreigners to clerical roles in the royal household”. This is clearly no longer the case, but as recently as 2021, Buckingham Palace was considering the need to appoint a diversity chief.
Of course, Mountbatten-Windsor is not being investigated as a royal but as a public officer, as former trade envoy. Misconduct occurs when an officer abuses public trust by “wilfully neglecting to perform their duty” or “wilfully misconducting themselves”.
The question of standards – or exemptions for royals – will doubtless be examined in months to come, but regardless, the royal family should be front-footed and candid when asked about what they knew, the questions they asked and the answers that were given. They are exempt from freedom of information laws, but should they always be, especially when King Charles issues a statement saying: “Let me state clearly: the law must take its course”?
Nine separate forces in the UK are currently investigating claims aired in the Epstein files, from sex trafficking to Epstein’s use of various airports. Much will be written about a royal “crisis”, for the tarnishing of the family’s status, and of the need for the King to distance himself vigorously from the brother once branded by tabloids as “Randy Andy”.
The American President Donald Trump said the whole thing was very sad, “it’s very bad for the royal family”. Not all that great, either, for the 1000-odd women who have claimed Epstein trafficked and abused them.
King Charles III’s greatest challenge will be ensuring the focus is not on a potential loss of privilege for the arch-privileged, but instead on the victims trampled by systems that painted them as mad, as liars, as expendable flesh.

Chinese EV maker Zeekr accelerates European expansion with Italy launch
The carmaker is pressing ahead despite tariffs on Chinese electric vehicles, betting on demand for high-spec models
Zeekr, the premium electric vehicle (EV) brand owned by Geely Auto, has entered the Italian market, with customer deliveries and retail openings set to follow in spring.
The move is part of its broader European expansion, following the launch of sales in Germany in December last year.
In partnership with local distributor Jameel Motors Italia, Zeekr began taking orders for its full model range on Thursday, according to a press release.
“Italy is a key market in our European expansion, and the timing for Zeekr’s entry could not be better,” said Lothar Schupet, acting CEO of Zeekr Europe.
“Demand for premium electric vehicles is growing rapidly, supported by continued investment in charging infrastructure. Together, we look forward to introducing Zeekr to Italian customers and contributing to the development of electric mobility in the country.”
Founded in 2021 by Geely, China’s second-largest carmaker, Zeekr began selling and delivering vehicles in Europe in 2023, starting with Sweden and the Netherlands.
The company plans to expand into additional European markets in 2026, including France, Britain and Spain.

Ukrainian National Guard drones take out Solntsepyok, three Pion guns behind Russian lines
The unit reported this on Facebook, releasing combat footage, according to Ukrinform.
“At the beginning of February, Lasar’s Group of the National Guard carried out a special operation in the Luhansk region. Thanks to the effective actions of the crews, 13 units of high-value Russian equipment were successfully hit,” the statement said.
The enemy assets were located within the areas of responsibility of the 3rd and 10th Army Corps of the Armed Forces of Ukraine.
Lasar’s Group aerial reconnaissance detected several clusters of equipment while analyzing the enemy’s firing positions, including a loading point for the TOS-1A Solntsepyok, a command-and-staff vehicle, and an artillery platoon.
The Russian equipment was hidden deep behind the line of contact. Crews of Lasar’s Group heavy bomber drones were deployed to strike the locations.
Ukrainian forces delivered precision strikes against the following equipment: three 2S7 Pion self-propelled artillery systems, one TOS-1A Solntsepyok, one TZM-T transport-loading vehicle, one command-and-staff vehicle, and seven armored combat vehicles.
The carefully planned special operation significantly reduced the shelling of forward Ukrainian positions in the areas of responsibility of the two corps and weakened the enemy’s offensive capabilities.
As previously reported by Ukrinform, soldiers of the 412th Separate Unmanned Systems Brigade Nemesis of the Armed Forces of Ukraine struck a Russian Osa surface-to-air missile system in the Donetsk region.

Banner of Donald Trump unfurled at Justice Department headquarters

WASHINGTON, Feb 19 - A banner of U.S. President Donald Trump has been unfurled outside the headquarters of the Justice Department in the latest effort to stamp his identity on a Washington institution.
The blue banner unfurled on Thursday between two columns in a corner of the agency's headquarters includes the slogan: "Make America Safe Again."
Since returning to the White House last year, Trump has moved aggressively to imprint his image and influence on federal institutions.
He has reshaped cultural and policy bodies by installing loyalists, renamed prominent institutions, and sidelined officials linked to past probes, steps critics say blur the lines between political power and traditionally independent government functions.
Banners bearing Trump's image were affixed last year to the Department of Labor, the Department of Agriculture and the U.S. Institute for Peace buildings.
A board of directors appointed by the president voted in December to add Trump's name to the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts. Trump's name was also affixed last year to the U.S. Institute of Peace building in Washington.
The White House referred questions about the latest banner to the Justice Department, which did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
In a statement cited by NBC News, a DOJ spokesperson said the department was "proud" to celebrate its "historic work to make America safe again at President Trump's direction."
In 2023, former Justice Department special counsel Jack Smith secured indictments accusing Trump of illegally retaining classified documents following his first term in office and of plotting to overturn his defeat in the 2020 election.
Trump falsely claimed that he won the 2020 election. His supporters stormed the U.S. Capitol on January 6, 2021, in an unsuccessful attempt to prevent the Congress from certifying the results of that election. After taking office for a second time in January 2025, Trump pardoned the rioters.
Trump denied wrongdoing in the cases against him, calling them politically motivated. Smith dropped both cases against the Republican after Trump won the 2024 election, citing a Justice Department policy against prosecuting a sitting president.
Smith resigned from the Justice Department days before Trump returned to the White House early last year.
The Trump administration's Justice Department has since targeted and fired many officials involved in probes against the Republican leader. REUTERS

Growing calls for independent probe into Air India crash as investigators focus attention on pilots
Investigators are yet to settle on a cause for the crash but are leaning in the direction of either human error or deliberate action by pilots rather than a mechanical fault despite allegations that the aircraft was flawed from the moment it entered service in India. Alisha Rahaman Sarkar reports

It is now more than eight months since the June afternoon in Ahmedabad, western India, when a Boeing 787-8 Dreamliner fell from the sky, crashing down into a busy medical college in one of the world’s worst aviation disasters.
All but one of the 241 people on board the London-bound flight were killed as well as 19 medical students and others on the ground. The dead include 200 Indians, 52 Britons, seven Portuguese nationals and a Canadian. Incredibly, one man survived – Leicester resident Viswashkumar Ramesh, who was thrown clear of the fuselage.
How did this seemingly routine flight end in such devastating circumstances? That’s one of several questions being asked by the families of those killed, and time is running out for India’s aviation authorities to come up with an answer. According to international regulations, crash investigators must provide a final report one year after the incident, which would typically point to a probable cause and provide recommendations on how to avoid it happening again.
The Independent understands that investigators have still not settled on a cause for the crash, but that they are leaning in the direction of either human error or deliberate action by the pilots – rather than any mechanical fault with the plane.
That’s despite a growing number of lawsuits directed at Boeing and Air India, filed by the families in courts in the UK and US, alleging that the plane in question was flawed from the moment it entered service in India.
A preliminary investigation report, released one month after the 12 June crash, has already triggered allegations of an attempt to avoid culpability by pinning the blame on the pilots. The family of one of the two pilots has already moved India’s top court to clear his name after the preliminary report appeared to implicate him.
The report, submitted nearly 30 days after the tragedy, stuck to providing the factual sequence of events, stopping short of any causal analysis and leaving deeper questions unanswered. It claimed that three seconds after taking off, both the aircraft’s fuel control switches almost simultaneously flipped from “run” to “cutoff”, starving the engines of fuel.
The plane immediately began to lose thrust and sank. One pilot could be heard on the cockpit voice recorder asking the other why he had cut off the fuel. "The other pilot responded that he did not do so," the report noted. An auxiliary power unit intended to provide power to the aircraft in the event of engine failure then deployed automatically.
The switches returned to the “run” position after about 10 seconds. It was too late. Moments later, one of the pilots transmitted a “Mayday, Mayday, Mayday” call.
The 15-page preliminary report assigned no blame, identified no cause and didn’t conclude whether the crash was the result of technical failure, human error, maintenance issues, or systemic oversight gaps.
Still, it sparked a media trial of the pilots, first officer Clive Kunder, 32, who was flying, and captain Sumeet Sabharwal, 56, who was observing.
The coverage of Sabharwal, a veteran with 15,638 flying hours, focused on unsubstantiated claims about his mental health, prompting his 91-year-old father Pushkar Raj Sabharwal to ask the Supreme Court of India for an independent investigation into the crash.
The court responded sharply, insisting that there was no basis to blame the captain. “It is extremely unfortunate, this crash, but you should not carry this burden that your son is being blamed,” Justice Surya Kant said. “Nobody can blame him for anything.”
"The preliminary report was a total disaster," says Amit Singh, the founder of Safety Matters Foundation, an aviation safety education platform, and a party to the family’s application to the Supreme Court.
“The words have been very cleverly chosen that they cannot basically bounce back on them,” he tells The Independent. “But there are certain issues which they should have investigated. And the technical part has given a clean chit. Whereas the report itself says there were so many technical issues. So they are basically playing with people’s psychology.”
The judge’s remarks about the captain came after Air India’s chief executive, Campbell Wilson, emphasised that initial investigations "indicated that there was nothing wrong with the aircraft, the engines or the operation of the airline".
Still, an Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau (AAIB) official, who asked not to be named, told The Independent they continued to investigate all possibilities, not just human error. “We haven’t ruled out any probable cause, be it technical or human error,” they said. “However, there seems to be less scope for mechanical fault.”
Other media outlets have quoted sources as saying investigators have all but ruled out mechanical failure or sabotage, leaving pilot action as the strongest line of inquiry. And that’s in keeping with the way the authorities have treated the two pilots’ families.
The Independent learned that AAIB officials visited Sabharwal’s Mumbai home unannounced in August and told the family that the pilot had died by “suicide”. Family members were also asked to appear before investigators, a move aviation experts said violated established rules.
“This hurt me like hell,” the captain’s father told local media outlet Mojo Story. Frail and living alone, the former air traffic controller and ex-official of the aviation regulator DGCA felt compelled to move the Supreme Court to seek justice for his son.
“He was a professional pilot and well-experienced and knew his job very well,” he said.
“I think his colleagues can tell you better than I about what kind of a person he was. He was always calm and quiet. I pray to the almighty that the proceedings should be just and fair and he should get the justice.”
The AAIB also invited a legal notice from the Federation of Indian Pilots after the agency summoned the late pilot’s nephew Varun Anand, a serving Air India pilot, to face the investigators.
“The sole basis for calling Captain Varun Anand appears to be his familial relationship with the deceased pilot-in-command, which is impermissible in law and renders the summoning arbitrary and unsustainable," the federation said, noting that he was neither a factual witness nor a technical witness nor an expert witness in relation to the crash.
"We’ve realised that the people who should be taking responsibility for the Air India crash are instead trying to put everything on Sumeet,” a member of the pilot’s family told The Telegraph.
“A sustained media campaign was run, first to question his professionalism and then his mental health. It’s sad to see a powerful lobby tarnishing the reputation of Sumeet.”
Independent aviation experts said recent findings pointed to an electrical fault, possibly caused by a water leak, which likely made the lights flicker inside the plane just before the crash, as described by the lone survivor.
“So we’ve figured out what actually happened. We’ve a logical justification, and everything adds up to an electrical failure. Cascading electrical failure,” Singh says, adding that his requests to assist in the investigation met with silence.
According to the Foundation for Aviation Safety, an aviation advocacy group in the US, the Boeing aircraft had a record of technical and electrical failures. It entered service with Air India in 2014 and went on to suffer a series of system failures, including an electrical fire in 2022 which led to the replacement of core system components, the group said in a submission to the US Senate. The issues, it alleged, were caused by "a wide and confusing variety of engineering, manufacturing, quality, and maintenance problems throughout its 11-year life".
Ed Pierson, the advocacy group’s executive director, linked the aircraft’s history to manufacturing quality concerns around the 787. Pierson described the 787 Dreamliner as an “electrical monster” due to its unprecedented reliance on complex electrical systems to replace traditional pneumatic and hydraulic functions.
He said investigators must thoroughly assess whether cascading system failures played a role in the crash before assigning responsibility to flight crews.
The Dreamliner had faced three electrical failures and 11 minor components malfunctions in the 48 hours before the crash, according to The Federal. Hours prior to the crash, it had even suffered a hard, abnormal descent on its inbound flight due to an issue with one of its flight control systems.
The AAIB report mentioned that the pilots logged a sensor fault but it failed to mention what the maintenance staff logged. According to the maintenance log, the right-side stabiliser-trim electric motor control unit had failed and it had been replaced along with the wiring and stabiliser sensors.
This was also mentioned in the aircraft health monitoring report sent to Boeing and Air India on 12 June 2025.
In the wake of the crash, AAIB investigators went to Washington to check whether the fuel switches had been deliberately moved to “cutoff”, with the National Transportation Safety Board analysing cockpit recordings for tell-tale sounds of manual toggling, unnamed sources told The Wall Street Journal.
“To us, that tends to indicate there is probably something there that needs to be looked at because common sense would tell that if you’ve a conclusive recording that would support the pilot's suicide narrative then there would be no need to go to Washington to go through the data,” Mike Andrews, an American lawyer representing nearly 130 families of the victims, tells The Independent. “If you already know the answer, why are you still searching for the answer, essentially.”
On the other side, US investigators were allegedly barred from photographing the wreckage in India, some of which had been moved before they could examine it, the Journal reported.
Indian authorities were also accused of sidelining black box analysis in the early stages of the inquiry.
“The procedure is, the minute you get the black box, you are supposed to decode, because it has so much critical information,” Singh notes. “But these black boxes – the first one was recovered on 13 and the second on 16 June – were sitting in Ahmedabad until the 24th."
As the investigation remains shrouded in mystery, hundreds of bereaved families are left to mourn in the dark, grappling with devastating loss and no answers.
Some families say they can’t bear the sound of aircraft overhead while others find themselves struggling to make ends meet. “There are economic hardships that were not there before because in some cases the primary breadwinner was killed in the crash. So families in some cases have been uprooted, have had to move in order to be able to afford daily living. In some cases, teenage and young adult children have had to drop out of school and go to work to help support the families," Andrews says.
Loneliness hangs heavy over Anil Ambala Patel, who lost his son Harshit Patel and daughter-in-law Pooja in the crash. Already widowed by his wife’s death from breast cancer, he is now buried under the weight of grief, having lost most of his family.
His son and daughter-in-law had come to visit after two years of moving to the UK in 2023. The couple had married in 2018 and the two families had pooled money to send her for studies at De Montfort University. Harshit had moved to Leicester on a dependent visa.
“Harshit and Pooja said they would return to India in 2027 and settle down here,” Patel tells The Independent. He is now struggling to access the couple’s bank account in Leicester.
In Banaskantha, about 250km from Ahmedabad, Savdhanbhai Chaudhary mourns the death of his son and his daughter-in-law. Kamlesh Chaudhary, 26, who worked in a “fancy goods store”, had been in London since 2022. He had come visiting to take his newlywed bride, Dhapuben Chaudhary, 24, with him.
It was his wife’s first time travelling by air. "Our family and the entire village was so proud of our children that they could make it in London. I miss them a lot. There are no words for our loss. No compensation will ever fill the gap of our children," Chaudhary says, tears rolling down his eyes.
The last memory of his children is a 30-second video of the couple clearing the security gate on 12 June. In January, Chaudhary travelled five hours to Ahmedabad to receive their half-burnt remains and was told to return later to collect more.
Air India has set up a Family Returns Centre in Ahmedabad for the affected families to collect the belongings of their loved ones. The airline has recovered 22,000 items from the crashed flight. The families have a 45-day window, ending 20 February, to browse an online portal, select images they recognise, place them in a “claim box”, and contact the airline to process their claims — a tedious process for some of the families unfamiliar with technology.
In days after the crash, Air India quickly paid the equivalent of $28,000 to the families of each of the dead. The airline's owner, Tata Group, pledged to add another $112,000.
Andrews said that while majority of the families received compensation from the Tata Group, some were still awaiting to receive the ex-gratia money from the state government.
In Meghani Nagar, the area near the Ahmedabad airport where the plane crashed, residents say the violence of that day remains etched in their memory.
"The plane was flying unusually low. Before I could understand what was happening, there was thick black smoke and a deafening crash," Manubhai Rajput, who lives 200 meters from the crash site, told The Times of India. “We never looked up at the sky. But that day is etched in my mind.”
The charred and abandoned hostel building and the adjoining canteen stand as haunted reminders of the disaster.
"The area now lies very silent, only a few birds chirp here," Sanjaibhai, a security guard tasked with keeping away trespassers, says. While the investigation continues, the area remained off-limits to the public.
Akash Patni, 14, was on his way to deliver food to a relative when the flight crashed, killing him. His mother, Sita Patni, her burn scars a testament to her struggle to save him, says she saw him "burn to ashes" before her eyes.
"I am in pain the whole day. I tried to save him, but he did not survive,” she tells The Independent. "I couldn’t sleep in the house anymore after what happened to my son.”
She can no longer muster the courage to look at planes flying overhead.
Her husband, Sureshbhai, closed the family tea shop after the tragedy and said in January that he planned to move away from the airport and the city. No amount of monetary compensation could “bring back what we have lost”, he said.
In London, several families of the victims have filed a personal injury lawsuit at the London High Court. James Healy-Pratt, an aviation partner at Keystone Law, told The Independent that High Court proceedings had been issued against Air India but not yet formally served.
“This is against the backdrop of upcoming confidential negotiations in London,” he said, referring to settlement talks. “Hopefully, the parties will resolve their claims through such dialogue without the need for a trial in the Kings Bench Division of the London High Court.”
Air India, jointly owned by the Tata Group and Singapore Airlines, is on track to report its largest annual lose ever of Rs 150bn ($1.6bn) for the financial year ending 31 March 2026, according to sources quoted by Bloomberg.
There is talk of Air India searching for a new chief executive to replace Wilson, although the process may not conclude until the final crash report is released, with his term due to end in mid-2027 and reports that he could leave earlier than that unconfirmed.
The Independent approached Air India and Boeing for comment. Air India declined to give an on-record statement, citing the ongoing investigation, while Boeing had not responded at the time of publication.
Wilson, who has visited the site of the crash, previously said investigations “take time” but that the airline “will be fully transparent and we will support the process for as long as it takes... Air India will continue to do everything we can to care for those affected by this tragedy, and to uphold the trust placed in us.”
Boeing’s CEO Kelly Ortberg offered the manufacturers “deepest condolences” to the victims after the crash, and said Boeing “stands ready to support the investigation led by India’s Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau”. Subsequent media enquiries to Boeing have been directed to the AAIB.
While some families have been offered final compensation packages by Air India, and others continue to keep their legal options open, for all those involved the next big date on the horizon is 12 June 2026, when the UN aviation watchdog’s rules stipulate that the authorities must provide either their final report, or a comprehensive update explaining any further delays and their findings so far. Whether that provides any closure remains to be seen.

Indonesia, Morocco, Kosovo among 5 countries to send troops under Gaza plan
Kazakhstan and Kosovo have also pledged to participate, while Egypt and Jordan will provide training for police officers.
Indonesia, Morocco, Kazakhstan, Kosovo and Albania have pledged to send troops to Gaza, the commander of a newly created International Stabilization Force (ISF) has said during a meeting of United States President Donald Trump’s so-called Board of Peace.
US Army General Jasper Jeffers, who has been appointed as the head of a future Gaza stabilisation force by Trump’s board, said on Thursday that the Indonesian contingent to the mission has “accepted the position of deputy commander”.

“With these first steps, we will help bring the security that Gaza needs,” Jeffers said during a meeting of the board in Washington, DC.
Indonesian President Prabowo Subianto, who was among several world leaders participating in the meeting, said his country would contribute up to 8,000 personnel to the planned force “to make this peace work” in the war-torn Palestinian territory, where Israel’s genocide has killed at least 72,000 people.
Kazakhstan’s President Kassym-Jomart Tokayev said his country will also send an unspecified number of troops, including medical units, to Gaza, while Morocco’s Foreign Minister Nasser Bourita said that his country is ready to deploy police officers to Gaza.
Albania, whose prime minister recently made a two-day official visit to Israel, has also said it will contribute troops, while neighbouring countries Egypt and Jordan have said they will participate by training police officers.
Indonesia, which was one of the first countries to commit to sending troops, has sought to reassure potential critics that its participation is intended to ensure international law is upheld in Gaza, amid Israel’s genocidal onslaught.
‘Indonesian troops will not be involved in combat operations’
Indonesia’s foreign minister met with both United Nations chief Antonio Guterres and Palestinian ambassador to the UN Riyad Mansour in New York on Wednesday, in advance of President Subianto’s participation in the Board of Peace meeting.
“Indonesia’s mandate [on troop deployment] is humanitarian in nature with a focus on protecting civilians, humanitarian and health assistance, reconstruction as well as training and strengthening the capacity of the Palestinian Police,” Indonesia’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs said in a recent statement, according to the Jakarta Post newspaper.
“Indonesian troops will not be involved in combat operations or any action leading to direct confrontation with any armed group,” the ministry said, responding to questions raised over its future role in Gaza by Amnesty International.
The head of Amnesty International Indonesia, Usman Hamid, has voiced concerns that Indonesia risked violating international law through its participation in the Board of Peace and the planned stabilisation force for Gaza.
Hamid warned that Indonesia’s deployment of troops to Gaza “means putting Indonesia at risk of participating in a mechanism that will strengthen violations of International Humanitarian Law”.
“The Peace Council does not include members from the most disadvantaged Palestinians, but instead includes members from Israel, which has for nearly eight decades carried out an illegal occupation and apartheid against the Palestinian people, even committing genocide in Gaza,” Hamid wrote last week in an open letter to the speaker of the People’s Representative Council of the Republic of Indonesia.
Palestinians have also voiced concerns that Trump’s Board of Peace will only further entrench Israel’s illegal occupation of the Gaza Strip, as Israeli forces continue to carve out more “buffer zones” and restrict the entry of food and other aid, months into a so-called “ceasefire” with Hamas, during which almost 600 Palestinians have been killed in Israeli attacks.
The Gaza stabilisation force differs from other peacekeeping forces deployed by multilateral organisations such as the UN or the African Union.
In neighbouring Lebanon, more than 10,000 peacekeepers from 47 countries continue to participate in the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL), which was created in 1978.
Indonesia, along with Italy, is one of the largest contributors of troops to UNIFIL, which has repeatedly come under fire from Israeli forces, despite a fragile ceasefire between Israel and Hezbollah.

Two mental health facility escapes ended in tragedy. Now, a push for 'urgent' change
Unknown

This article contains references that may be distressing for some viewers.
NSW's mental health care crisis has again been thrown into the spotlight, following the escape of two patients from the same hospital, who days later were allegedly involved in separate incidents where three people died.
The incidents have reignited criticism of the state's mental health crisis, following the Bondi stabbing coronial inquest — which found perpetrator Joel Cauchi slipped through the cracks of the mental health care system.
One of the men, a 31-year-old, was an involuntary patient at Australia's largest mental health facility at Sydney's Cumberland Hospital. It's alleged he was driving a stolen vehicle that crashed in Sydney's south-west, killing two women aged 60 and 84.
The other patient, a 25-year-old man, escaped from the same facility during a transfer to another hospital. He allegedly stabbed three people in Merrylands, which led to the death of one.
The two men remain before the courts, while the Western Sydney Local Health district said it supports discussions about ways to improve the safety of patients, staff and the broader public. The district has also said it's undertaking a formal review into security protocols.
NSW Premier Chris Minns said there'll be an urgent government review into security protocols at Cumberland Hospital.
"We need to keep the public safe in the circumstances where someone has a psychiatric episode and is a danger to themselves or members of the public."
Mental health system too focused on waiting for a crisis before initiating treatment, say advocates
NSW Nurses and Midwives' Association Cumberland delegate Nick Howson said the system is broken, and nurses at the hospital are struggling with systematic failure.
"The reality of it is you can see the outcome of what happens when there's not enough people around to provide the care that we're supposed to provide," he said.
"We're doing what we can with very little resources behind it, you can't blame an individual hospital or an individual health district because they are hamstrung by the funding from the government."
Calls for more funding
Last year, dozens of public hospital psychiatrists resigned in protest over a lack of funding
The Chair of New South Wales Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Psychiatrists RANZCP says a recent temporary pay rise is insufficient to address a lack of community care, housing and hospital beds.
Dr Ian Korbel says funding for mental health has always been an issue.
"We've seen that since the de-institutionalisations that happened in the late 80s to early 90s. The money that was saved from closing those old institutions just didn't move to the community care where they needed to be."
"So it means the patients are ending up in hospital more than they should. We have over 50,000 people in NSW who have severe mental illness who are not accessing care — this is neglect by the state of its most vulnerable patients," Korbel said.
Chief executive of mental health consumer group BEING Giancarlo De Vera said a greater focus must also be given to community support to prevent people being left in positions where they are held for treatment against their will.
"These levels of funding are just insufficient. We need more mental health outreach in the community. We need more supported housing for people who have serious mental illness both short-term and long-term."
"To a degree we need more beds as well. We're looking at some of the lowest levels of beds in the western world. We're down to less than 30 beds per 100,000 people in NSW, where the average is about 60," De Vera said.
Push for a coordinated national approach
SANE Australia's chief clinical officer Dr Rahul Khanna said the funding comes down to the state and federal governments.
"We've seen that failure across a national really, and part of it comes down to funding responsibilities between state and federal governments ending up with a really fragmented system, that's really hard to understand and hard to access."
Correction: an earlier version of this article incorrectly stated Dr Pramudie Gunaratne as the current NSW chair of Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Psychiatrists. Dr Ian Korbel is the current chair.

FBI, US Justice Department oversee Ukraine’s corruption probe into Energoatom — report

WASHINGTON, February 20. /TASS/. The US Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and the Department of Justice (DoJ) supervised the National Anti-Corruption Bureau of Ukraine (NABU) and Ukraine’s Specialized Anti-Corruption Prosecutor’s Office (SAPO) in the investigation of the Energoatom company, a report prepared for the US Congress jointly by the Pentagon, the US State Department, and the US Agency for International Development (USAID) states.
The report notes that the US administration provided SAPO "with case-based strategic advice and guidance." According to the Department of Justice, this "enabled SAPO’s ability to process significant cases related to corruption in Ukraine’s state-owned energy corporation."
"The DoJ Resident Legal Advisor and FBI met with NABU to provide case mentoring, discuss possible bribery or money laundering schemes in the case, and confer about tracing funds seized in the investigation," the report states.
On November 10, 2025, NABU and SAPO announced an investigation into a major corruption scheme in the energy sector, dubbed Operation Midas. According to the investigators, the participants in the scheme laundered around $100 million. Vladimir Zelensky's close friend, businessman Timur Mindich, was identified as the coordinator of the schemes. He left the country several hours before searches began.
The publication of the case materials led to the resignation of several ministers, including German Galushchenko, who previously headed the Ministry of Energy and the Ministry of Justice, as well as the dismissal of the head of Zelensky’s office and his associate Andrey Yermak. The developments temporarily paralyzed the work of the parliament. Reports also indicated that not all case materials had been made public, that new senior officials could be implicated, and that the investigation was not limited to the energy sector, with detectives also examining defense procurement.
On February 17, Ukraine’s High Anti-Corruption Court placed Galushchenko charged with laundering funds from Energoatom into custody with the possibility of release on bail set at $4.6 million.

Belarus unable to secure visas for Trump's Board of Peace meeting

Belarusian officials said Feb. 19 that they were unable to obtain visas to travel to the United States for the inaugural meeting of the Board of Peace, despite receiving an official invitation to attend.
"Visas for our delegation to the Peace Council meeting were not issued, despite all documents being submitted on time and procedures followed," Belarus' Ministry of Foreign Affairs wrote on social media.
Foreign Minister Maxim Ryzhenkov had been slated to attend, though the invitation was formally addressed to Belarusian leader Alexander Lukashenko.
"If even basic formalities aren't respected, what 'peace' are we talking about?" the ministry wrote.
Established by U.S. President Donald Trump, the Board of Peace was initially conceived as a U.N.-approved mechanism tasked with implementing the Gaza peace plan. The initiative has since been described as seeking a broader mandate.
Trump is expected to serve as the board's inaugural — and potentially only — chairman. A proposed $1 billion fee for a permanent seat has led some observers to characterize the body as the U.S. president's personal version of the United Nations, an institution he has frequently criticized.
The board could conceivably, at the chairman's discretion and with the consent of the states concerned, address other conflicts worldwide, including Russia's war against Ukraine.
Despite its invitation to the Board of Peace, Belarus has been one of Russia's closest allies throughout the full-scale invasion of Ukraine. Minsk has supported Russian troop movements, missile launches and drone attacks, and serves as a possible launch site for Russia's nuclear-capable missiles.

Don’t bell Australia’s cats. Just make it illegal to own one

Opinion
Don’t bell Australia’s cats. Just make it illegal to own one
In Australia, it is illegal to own a pet tortoise. It is illegal to import an exotic bird. It is illegal to buy foreign Sea-Monkey eggs with your Sea-Monkey aquarium.
And yet, you can import your cat. You can phone up a cat breeder and buy one. You can keep your cat in your garden and let it roam the neighbourhood. I saw one on my street yesterday, a corpulent thing, slinking between cars, no doubt fattened mightily with the corpses of my local birds, mammals and even insects. This is insanity. It is an environmental catastrophe.
I am a zoologist. I love animals. I have even known a cat or two that I liked very much. But I’m also an evolutionary biologist. Cats kill more of Australia’s native species than any other exotic import. It’s time we outlawed pet cats, just as we outlaw other exotic animals inappropriate to the Australian environment.
Last month, there was a little dust-up in the scientific community over the role of domestic and feral cats in Australian mammal extinctions. A paper in late 2025 that had tried to cast doubt on cats’ role in the devastation was piecemeal dismantled by a 25-strong group of conservation scientists and the Biodiversity Council. The invasive predators are indeed still on the hook for the carnage – and not just of some species.
“The evidence is overwhelming; cats and foxes were the primary driver of the decline of most of the Australian mammals that have become extinct since 1788, and continue to drive the decline of many remaining species,” said Professor John Woinarski, who led the study.
The cats do not limit themselves to mammals, of course. They are famously bad for birds. In New Zealand, several iconic species survive only on mammal-free offshore islands because cats and other introduced mammals have made survival impossible on the mainland.
These introduced hunters are simply not part of the evolutionary history of the wildlife of this continent, and their presence here is an ongoing disaster for our native wildlife.
Shall I put some numbers on it? For context, let’s think about chickens. Chickens are not wild animals, but just for argument’s sake, how many do Australians kill per year? Just over 700 million. A lot of animals die by our hands, deliberately or otherwise. The cats? Between feral and pet cats, they kill 3 billion wild animals a year. Or 8.2 million a day. The Invasive Species Council breaks down the daily toll: “On average, cats kill 2.92 million mammals, 1.67 million reptiles, 1.09 million birds, 0.26 million frogs and 2.97 million invertebrates every 24 hours.”
Leaving out the feral cats, just the pets are estimated to kill almost 200 animals per cat, per year, mostly native species. And every pet cat is a potential escapee, tomorrow’s feral Tom. Your cat is a killer, and it cannot be permitted to live here.
There is no excuse for the cavalier way we treat cat ownership, especially against the strict quarantine regulations in place against other potential threats to our unique and precarious wildlife. It is rightly illegal to own or import a fox – and yet we have a regulated industry for the breeding and selling of cats, which do about 10 times more damage. We are allowing a massacre to persist for the sake of keeping a discretionary pet. We do not need cats. We need to be without them.
We need to make it illegal to own a cat in this country. They are not a suitable pet for our environment. We can do it gradually and compassionately: current pet cats can be kept if spayed or neutered, and kept exclusively indoors until their natural deaths, under severe legal penalty for violation. The breeding trade should be shut down, with due support for those in the industry to transition to other ventures. Over time, the pet cats will slowly become extinct, so that some of our native wildlife might not.
“Indoor cat” owners will object. They are responsible, they’ll say. They are conservation-minded. And they may well be – but their pets are part of a society-wide practice that is neither containable nor sustainable. As long as pet cats exist, some will get outside and cause mayhem. They can keep their pets indoors until their pets pass on, but then, no replacements.
The feral cat problem also needs to be tackled, and is trickier. Foxes too. You have to find them, after all. But that is no excuse for dragging our feet on eliminating pet cats, which is far more straightforward and would reduce the total number of cats on the continent by 40 to 80 per cent.
As I said, I love animals. I would love to have a pet tortoise, but I accept that sacrifice for the protection of the Australian ecosystem. Cat lovers need to do the same.
Please keep your hate mail brief and civil.

Horror allegation puts Epstein’s remote ranch back in focus

Horror allegation puts Epstein’s remote ranch back in focus
New Mexico’s Department of Justice said the state is investigating an allegation, which emerged from documents released by the US Department of Justice, that the late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein ordered the bodies of two foreign girls buried outside his remote New Mexico ranch.
The state’s Department of Justice spokesperson Lauren Rodriguez said on Wednesday (US time) that it had requested an unredacted copy of a 2019 email from the US Justice Department that contained the allegation.
The US Justice Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The FBI declined to comment.
“We are actively investigating this allegation and are conducting a broader review in light of the latest release from the US Department of Justice,” Rodriguez said in an emailed response to queries about the case.
A day earlier, New Mexico’s legislature launched the first comprehensive investigation into accusations that Epstein sexually abused girls and women at the Zorro Ranch, 48 kilometres south of Santa Fe, for more than two decades.
In 2019, after Epstein’s death, a woman identified as Jane Doe said in court that he had molested her at Zorro Ranch in 2004 when she was 15. The woman recalled feeling small and powerless, describing how he had laid her on the floor so she was confronted by all the framed photographs on his dresser of him smiling with wealthy celebrities and politicians.
Pressure from Congressional Democrats to uncover Epstein’s crimes has become a major political challenge for US President Donald Trump.
The redacted email, contained in the latest release of Epstein-related documents, had been sent a few months after Epstein’s death to Eddy Aragon, a New Mexico radio show host who had discussed the Zorro Ranch on his program.
The sender, claiming to be a former Zorro Ranch employee, requested payment of one bitcoin in return for videos that the email said had been taken from Epstein’s house and showed the financier having sex with minors.
Aragon said in a phone interview that he believed the email to be legitimate and immediately forwarded it to the FBI.
He said he did not receive any payment from or have any further contact with the sender, although he recently tried to respond for the first time, but the address was no longer in service.
The redacted email to Aragon said two foreign girls had been buried on Epstein’s orders “somewhere in the hills outside the Zorro” and that the two had died “by strangulation during rough, fetish sex”.
A 2021 FBI report, also contained in the latest Epstein file release, said Aragon visited an FBI office to report the email, which offered seven videos of sexual abuse and the location of two foreign girls buried on Zorro Ranch in return for one bitcoin.
A Reuters search of other documents among the Department of Justice’s disclosures did not find any other references to the allegations in the redacted email or what investigators made of its claims.
The Justice Department warned last year that some of the files it disclosed from its investigation of Epstein “contain untrue and sensationalist claims”, and that they include anonymous accusations that investigators did not corroborate, or in some cases determined to be false.
In an interview this week, New Mexico State Land Commissioner Stephanie Garcia Richard said her office had found the redacted email during a recent search of the latest Epstein file release.
Garcia, in a February 10 letter to the US Justice Department and a statement, called on federal and state justice officials to fully investigate “deeply disturbing” allegations of criminality at the ranch and state lands adjacent to it.
“People deserve to know the truth about what happened on Epstein’s ranch and are looking to leaders for answers,” Garcia Richard said in a statement.
Richard cancelled grazing leases held by the ranch in 2019 after her office was denied access to inspect the nearly five square kilometres around the site that Epstein had leased since 1993.
The property was sold by Epstein’s estate in 2023, with proceeds going to creditors, to the family of Don Huffines, a Republican running for Texas state comptroller.
In a social media post, Huffines said the property has been renamed San Rafael Ranch after a saint associated with healing and that his family plans to operate a Christian retreat there.
A spokesperson for Huffines has said that the owners have never been approached by local, state or federal law enforcement requesting access to the ranch and if they do, full co-operation will be granted.
Ranch appears in files many times
There are thousands of references to the ranch in the documents released by federal authorities.
New Mexico’s Democratic former governor, Bill Richardson, was among the guests to have visited the ranch.
Following one of the early investigations into the disgraced financier, Richardson donated $US50,000 ($71,000) in 2006 election campaign contributions from Epstein to charity.
Emails and schedules recently released by federal authorities also show that a long list of entrepreneurs, actors and scientists were invited to the ranch over the years, including Woody Allen, Robert Redford, Reid Hoffman, Joi Ito and Peter Thiel.

Eric Dane, the celebrated actor best known for his roles on Grey's Anatomy and Euphoria and who later in life became an advocate for ALS awareness, died on Thursday, February 19. He was 53. His representatives said Dane died from amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, known also as Lou Gehrig's disease, less than a year after he announced his diagnosis.
"He spent his final days surrounded by dear friends, his devoted wife and his two beautiful daughters, Billie and Georgia, who were the center of his world," said a statement that requested privacy for his family. "Throughout his journey with ALS, Eric became a passionate advocate for awareness and research, determined to make a difference for others facing the same fight. He will be deeply missed, and lovingly remembered always. Eric adored his fans and is forever grateful for the outpouring of love and support he’s received."
Dane developed a devoted fanbase when his big break arrived in the mid-2000s: He was cast as Dr. Mark Sloan, aka McSteamy, on the ABC medical drama Grey's Anatomy, a role he would play from 2006 until 2012 and reprise in 2021. In 2019, he did a complete 180 from the charming McSteamy and became the troubled Cal Jacobs in HBO's provocative drama Euphoria, a role he continued in up until his death.
Dane also starred as Tom Chandler, the captain of a US Navy destroyer at sea after a global catastrophe wiped out most of the world's population, in the TNT drama The Last Ship. In 2017, production was halted as Dane battled depression.
Progressive disease
In April 2025, Dane announced he had been diagnosed with ALS, a progressive disease that attacks nerve cells controlling muscles throughout the body. ALS gradually destroys the nerve cells and connections needed to walk, talk, speak and breathe. Most patients die within three to five years of a diagnosis.
Dane became an advocate for ALS awareness, speaking a news conference in Washington on health insurance prior authorization. "Some of you may know me from TV shows, such as Grey's Anatomy, [in] which I play a doctor. But I am here today to speak briefly as a patient battling ALS," he said in June 2025. In September of that year, the ALS Network named Dane the recipient of their advocate of the year award, recognizing his commitment to raising awareness and support for people living with ALS.
Dane was born on November 9, 1972, and raised in Northern California. His father, a Navy man, died of a gunshot wound when he was 7. After high school, he moved to Los Angeles to pursue acting, landing guest roles on shows like Saved by the Bell, Married...With Children, Charmed and X-Men: the Last Stand, and one season of the short-lived medical drama Gideon's Crossing.
A memoir by Dane is scheduled to be published in late 2026. Book of Days: A Memoir in Moments will be released by Maria Shriver's The Open Field, a Penguin Random House imprint. According to Open Field, Dane will look back upon key moments in his life, from his first day at work on Grey's Anatomy to the births of his two daughters and learning that he had ALS.
Dane is survived by his wife, actor Rebecca Gayheart, and their two teen daughters, Billie Beatrice and Georgia Geraldine. Gayheart and Dane wed in 2004 and separated in September 2017. Gayheart filed for divorce in 2018, but later filed to dismiss the petition. In a December essay for New York Magazine's The Cut reflecting on Dane's diagnosis, Gayheart said, "Our love may not be romantic, but it’s a familial love," she said. "Eric knows that I am always going to want the best for him. That I'm going to do my best to do right by him. And I know he would do the same for me. So whatever I can do or however I can show up to make this journey better for him or easier for him, I want to do that."

North Korea's Kim Jong Un opens key party congress
February 20, 2026North Korea's leader Kim Jong Un opened the ruling party's congress, held once every five years, state media KCNA reported.
Thousands of delegates and party elites packed the House of Culture in the capital, Pyongyang, for the event, where Kim is expected to set his domestic and foreign policy agendas for the coming half a decade.
In a speech at the Ninth Congress of the ruling Workers' Party, given on Thursday but reported on Friday, Kim praised his nation's improving economy and regional standing, media reported.
Kim said North Korea had overcome its "worst difficulties" since the last congress in 2021, held during the global economic downturn from the COVID-19 pandemic.
The country was now entering a new stage of "optimism and confidence in the future," he said.
"Our party is faced with heavy and urgent historic tasks of boosting economic construction and the people's standard of living and transforming all realms of state and social life as early as possible," he said.
Russia, China give North Korea an economic boost
North Korea is one of the world's poorest and most isolated countries.
Its strict information blockade obscures its true economic state. But its economy has suffered for years under Western sanctions that aim to block funding for its nuclear weapons program.
Recently, however, experts suggest the country has seen some economic recovery. In 2024, the economy grew by 3.7%, according to the South Korea-based Korean Association of International Studies.
Part of North Korea's economic recovery is likely boosted by the country's stronger ties with Russia.
North Korea has sent thousands of troops to Russia as well as substantial military equipment to contribute to its war in Ukraine.
In return, Russia has expanded trade with North Korea as well as providing economic aid and military technologies.
In addition, support from China continues to be critical for North Korea. China is North Korea's largest trading partner and also provides direct aid.
The ruling parties of both China and Russia sent friendly messages to mark the start of the congress, according to the KCNA.
No mention of North Korea's nuclear weapons
Kim didn't mention relations with the United States or neighboring South Korea in his speech.
He also didn't refer to his country's efforts to develop a stockpile of nuclear weapons
On Thursday, Kim unveiled multiple rocket launchers capable of firing nuclear warheads, according to state media reported on Thursday.
Will Kim's daughter Kim Ju Ae appear?
South Korea's spy agency told lawmakers last week that it was monitoring whether Kim's teenage daughter would attend the party congress. The National Intelligence Service said it believed that Kim had selected the daughter, believed to be named Kim Ju Ae and aged about 13, as his heir.
Kim is the third in his family dynasty to rule North Korea, following his father, Kim Jong Il, and his grandfather, Kim Il Sung.
It is widely believed that he will pass on the throne to Ju Ae.

Grey’s Anatomy actor Eric Dane dead at 53 after ALS battle
Diagnosed less than a year ago, the American actor turned his final months into a powerful crusade for ALS awareness
Actor Eric Dane, who played the handsome Dr Mark Sloan on the hit television series Grey’s Anatomy, died on Thursday aged 53, his family said, less than a year after revealing that he suffered from amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, or ALS.
For 15 years, Dane played a plastic surgeon nicknamed “McSteamy” by female characters in the show. He also starred in the series Euphoria, and said after the diagnosis he would still return to the set for its third season.
“Eric Dane passed on Thursday afternoon following a courageous battle with ALS,” his family said in a statement, according to People magazine and other media.
“He spent his final days surrounded by dear friends, his devoted wife, and his two beautiful daughters, Billie and Georgia, who were the centre of his world.”
ALS is a progressive disease in which a person’s brain loses connection with the muscles. It is also known as Lou Gehrig’s disease after the Hall of Fame baseball player who died from it in 1941 at age 37.
“Throughout his journey with ALS, Eric became a passionate advocate for awareness and research, determined to make a difference for others facing the same fight,” Dane’s family added.

Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor’s arrest prompts calls for justice in the US

The arrest of Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor on suspicion of misconduct in public office in the UK has prompted calls from US lawmakers and survivors of Jeffrey Epstein’s abuse to demand accountability for those linked to the late sex offender across the Atlantic.
Mountbatten-Windsor, 66, was detained on Thursday in connection with his conduct as a UK trade envoy and after disclosures of emails linked to Epstein, the disgraced banker and convicted sex offender. He was released under investigation on Thursday evening after police questioned him in relation to allegations he shared confidential material with Epstein. Mountbatten-Windsor has consistently denied any wrongdoing related to Epstein, and Thursday’s arrest is not related to any allegation of sexual misconduct.
Responding to the arrest, Skye Roberts, the brother of the late Virginia Giuffre – who alleged she was trafficked to the UK in 2001 at age 17 to have sex with Mountbatten-Windsor, an allegation he has repeatedly and strongly denied – said:“The reality is the UK is doing far more. I think that the king can hold his head high when he comes here saying: ‘I am doing the most that I can …’ While here in the United States, our president has yet to even do even remotely the same. And survivors and the people are very disappointed in that.”
Meanwhile, US president Donald Trump described Mountbatten-Windsor’s arrest as “a shame” and “very sad.”
Speaking on Air Force One, Trump said: “I’m the expert in a way because I’ve been totally exonerated so I can speak about it … I think it’s a shame. I think it’s very sad. I think it’s so bad for the royal family. It’s very, very sad. To me, it’s a very sad thing.”
On Thursday, Kentucky’s Republican representative Thomas Massie – who co-sponsored legislation with California’s Democratic representative Ro Khanna to compel the justice department to release millions of files related to Epstein – called for action in the US.
“Prince Andrew was just arrested. This was the metric I established for success of the Epstein Files Transparency Act that @RepRoKhanna and I got passed,” Massie wrote on X.
He went on to urge US attorney general Pam Bondi and FBI director Kash Patel “to act”, adding: “Now we need JUSTICE in the United States.”
Robert Garcia, the ranking member of the House of Representatives’ oversight committee, issued a similar statement, saying: “Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor’s arrest is an enormous step forward in our fight to secure justice for the survivors of Jeffrey Epstein’s horrific crimes … Now it’s the time for the United States to end this White House cover up. President Trump and his Epstein administration are not above the law.”
Lawmakers have asked Mountbatten-Windsor to come to the US to testify about his ties to Epstein.
Like Garcia, Suhas Subramanyam, another Democratic member of the House oversight committee, said on X: “Our investigation on the Oversight Committee led to real accountability of Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor in the UK. Now, we need that justice and accountability here in the United States.”
In a separate interview on MS Now, Subramanyam added: “I’m so glad that this happened and there needs to be more of it. And frankly, it’s happening in Europe but it’s not happening enough in the United States.”
New Mexico’s Democratic representative Melanie Stansbury echoed similar sentiments, saying: “Today former Prince Andrew was arrested for [alleged] crimes associated with Epstein. The first royal arrested since the English Civil War in 1647. Think about that. And yet, here in the United States, the President and DOJ are engaged in a cover-up, refusing to investigate crimes that have been buried for decades. It’s time to prosecute!”
Meanwhile, Nancy Mace, a Republican representative of South Carolina, said: “We were the FIRST to call for Prince Andrew’s arrest MONTHS ago. And today, justice caught up. Because of four Republicans who refused to flinch, refused to fold, and forced the Epstein files into the light, the powerful had nowhere left to hide.”
She added: “Today sends a clear message: no one is above the law.”
According to recently released documents by the justice department, Mountbatten-Windsor’s name had been on US law enforcement radar for 15 years before his arrest.
One survivor, Maria Farmer, who was the first known survivor to report Epstein and his accomplice Ghislaine Maxwell – later convicted of sex trafficking – said: “Today is just the beginning of accountability and justice brought forth by Virginia Roberts Giuffre – a young mother who adored her daughter so deeply, she fought the most powerful on earth to protect her … Let’s now demand all the dominos of power and corruption begin to fall.”
Similarly, Marijke Chartouni, another survivor, said: “If only the US Justice Department acted as decisively. It took British police less than three weeks from the release of the latest tranche of Epstein files to arrest Andrew, making Pam Bondi and Kash Patel look increasingly inept.”

Gavin Newsom trolls ‘Dozy Don’ as president’s eyes droop during Board of Peace event: ‘He’s really just asleep’
The Board of Peace held its first meeting Thursday

- CommentsGo to comments
California Governor Gavin Newsom’s press office has once again trolled President Donald Trump, this time by labeling him “Dozy Don”, after the president appeared to close his eyes at an event.
The Board of Peace held its first meeting on Thursday in Washington, D.C. There, Trump announced that member nations had pledged $7 billion toward a Gaza reconstruction fund. He also said the U.S. will contribute $10 billion to the Board of Peace.
But, as the day went on, some social media users accused Trump of falling asleep or seeming tired at the event.
Newsom’s press office shared a brief clip of Trump, whose eyes appeared to be closed during an official’s speech, with the caption: “That’s not a still photo of Dozy Don. He’s really just asleep.”
Others were quick to make similar posts.
“Poor low energy Donald. He’s tuckered out,” Adam Kinzinger, a former Republican congressman, wrote on X.
The Lincoln Project, a political group founded by anti-Trump Republicans, posted a still photo that appears to show Trump with his eyes closed at the event. “Bored of Peace,” the organization wrote.
When reached for comment, White House spokesperson Anna Kelly told The Independent: “President Trump is the sharpest, most accessible, and energetic president in American history.”
“While the deranged and failing Independent has their ‘reporters’ push baseless conspiracy theories — President Trump is securing world peace,” Kelly added.
Newsom, who is widely considered to be a front-runner for the 2028 Democratic presidential nomination, has used social media to hit out at the president over the past year. The governor even mimics Trump’s online posting style by writing in all-caps and signing posts with his initials.
The governor acknowledged his efforts last month while speaking at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland.
“This is not normal, it’s a deviation of normalcy,” Newsom said. “We’ve got to call it out. So I put a mirror up to Trump and Trumpism – in all caps.”

Deputy Speaker of the Knesset, MK Limor Son Har-Melech, together with dozens of activists from the Nachala movement, crossed the border fence into the Gaza Strip in violation of the law on Thursday evening.
Son Har-Melech dedicated the act as a Purim celebration, "With the aim of encouraging Jewish settlement in Gaza," the journalist Eli Zilberberg wrote in a post on his X/Twitter account.
According to Kan News, the activists are being pursued by the IDF.
The Otzma Yehudit MK has said in a statement published by the Nachala organization that "Gaza is ours forever," trying to justify her entrance into the territory.
In a post on her personal X account, Son Har-Melech said, "At the beginning of the month of Adar, (...) we merited, with thanks to the Lord, to enter the land of Gaza, together with the Nachala movement and dozens more families, women, men, and children."
She added that only by rebuilding settlements in Gaza would Israel ensure "victory and true security" for its people.
Group plants trees in Gaza after crossing border
On Instagram, the Nachala movement shared that the group that entered Gaza has planted trees.
"With tremendous excitement, we planted trees in our beloved Gaza region together with the Deputy Speaker of the Knesset, MK Limor Son Har-Melech. We will continue to act until Gaza is Jewish!" they said.
The movement invited the public to join the initiative and take part in a "massive" march to Gaza, which they plan to hold during Passover week (hol hamoed).
"The time has come to settle Gaza!" they wrote.
In a statement released by the organization, the MK said that, with the action in Gaza, the group was declaring that "Jewish boys and girls will play in the streets of Gaza, thriving cities will rise in Gaza, and life will flourish."
According to Kan News, the group's act marked the second time within a month that right-wing activists have breached the border fence into the Gaza Strip in an attempt to demand the re-establishment of Jewish settlements in the territory.

Gur Lavy seizes his chance, becomes Maccabi Tel Aviv’s latest success story

When Gur Lavy signed with Maccabi Tel Aviv this past summer after having won the Israeli Player of the Season award with Hapoel Gilboa/Galil, the mild-mannered forward really had no idea about how joining the most decorated club in the country would be different than anything else he had experienced in his young career.
But after having been serenaded by the yellow-and-blue faithful following game-changing performances in the Euroleague win over Bayern Munich, as well as the State Cup semifinal victory over Hapoel Jerusalem, Lavy has become yet another link in the Maccabi Tel Aviv chain of success.
The 24-year-old Lavy began his youth career at Maccabi Zichron Yaakov and then moved to Hapoel Haifa between 2020-2024, while having been loaned out to Kiryat Ata for the 2021/22 season and helped the club from the Karyot earn promotion to the top league from the Leumit.
After last year’s MVP performance, Maccabi Tel Aviv pounced on the Bat Shlomo native and added the young Sabra to its cadre.
Lavy was given very limited minutes in the Euroleague as well as in the top Israeli games, while he began to earn his stripes with the yellow-and-blue against the lower-profile opponents.
As he bided his time, he knew that at some point he would be called upon. When TJ Leaf injured his shoulder (and is now out for the season after surgery), it was clear that Oded Katash would need to turn to Lavy to fill the void and fill it he has and then some.
Gur Lavy finds his footing in Maccabi Tel Aviv spotlight
In the Israeli league game right after Leaf went down, Lavy was dominant, scoring 23 points to go along with seven rebounds while shooting 3-of-3 from deep to help Maccabi overcome Maccabi Raanana by 17 points. That allowed Katash the confidence that Lavy would be able to play a part in the upcoming Euroleague clash against Bayern, and the bench boss was proven correct.
With five massively important points in very limited minutes, Lavy gave Maccabi a boost that aided them in the overtime victory.
From there, Katash inserted him into the State Cup Classico semifinal showdown against Hapoel Jerusalem in the third quarter, when Maccabi had fallen behind by almost double digits, and from there it was history.
Lavy scored and scored some more while playing stifling defense to will the yellow-and blue back into the game. The forward dropped nine points and was sung to as a conquering hero by the fans after the game, to the forward’s delight.
“Wow, it’s the most exciting feeling in the world. I’m just happy we protected our home court, kept the winning streak at home and continued the positive momentum, Lavy told The Jerusalem Post after the continental win.
Lavy was a big part of that victory, hitting a late three-pointer that ignited the crowd.
“It’s crazy. First of all, I was waiting for that moment. Yes, it’s a shame it happened because TJ is injured, but I’m happy I took the opportunity. Of course, when the three went in, the crowd lifted me up together with it, and I’m so happy about it.”
Every game seems like Maccabi is living on the edge, with one close victory after the next, and that is helping educate Lavy.
“First of all, it’s crazy, I’m still learning what it’s like at Maccabi, but the games are close, and the teams are really good. That’s just the competition in the Euroleague, I believe. Playing in overtime is never easy because everyone is tired and playing a lot of minutes. I’m happy we managed to rise to the occasion. It’s not the first time we’ve played overtime, so maybe that experience helped us.”
When the fans jumped to their feet when Lavy entered the game, it wasn’t hard to notice the soft-spoken forward just take it all in and enjoy the moment.
“From the moment I signed here, I’ve been part of the team; it’s not related to whether I play or not. Of course, in the games I didn’t play, I still wanted to contribute. I’m happy that recently, in the last few games, I’ve been able to contribute on the court as well, which makes me happy. I assume it makes the fans happy, too, and I hope I’m contributing positively.”
Katash spoke about how Lavy has progressed this season and even compared a situation he was once in to that of his young player.
“Gur is amazing and exceptional in the way he was able to handle the situation. Because Gur sometimes didn’t get opportunities or minutes, even recently, not because he didn’t deserve it or because he isn’t good, but simply because we’re overloaded with players at that position, and sometimes that happens. But Gur is so positive, so present and really wants to improve; he’s truly an exceptional character, and I’ve coached many players with good character. Gur is exceptional.”
The bench boss continued: “Of course, now the opportunity has opened up, as happened and has happened to many players. I’ll take you 30 years back, it happened to me too. I came in as the second point guard, and Guy Goodes finished the season with an injury. But if you stay positive and focused, that’s what Gur did, and Gur is terrific for us. His minutes were significant, and we also saw that in the league game. It’s special to the extent that it almost couldn’t happen with most players unless they’re truly mentally strong like Gur, and that’s very impressive.”
Lavy shared his thoughts on how he and Katash get along.
“First of all, Oded is an amazing coach. He has a lot of experience at these levels. I learn a lot from him every day, and I’m happy he’s gradually integrating me into the games. I hope to get more opportunities in the future.” Maccabi captain John DiBartolomeo spoke about what Lavy has been able to contribute.
“I’m really happy for Gur. It’s not easy making the transition from a small club in Israel to Maccabi. There’s obviously growing pains, and Gur has handled them tremendously all season. Whether it’s playing in the Euroleague or Israeli competitions, being ready whenever his number is called in both leagues. Herr, he made a lot of plays, and his three-pointer was one of them, but he does a lot of things off the ball. He plays the right way. He’s a good teammate. I think he’s a player that will continue to grow and can be here for a long time.”
Roman Sorkin, who plays in the front court with Lavy, expressed his admiration for the player.
“I think it’s not simple to play like that. To come in and get just a few minutes, it’s not easy. It’s about diving for balls, and he played very well for us today. We saw on video how good he was and how much he gives in his minutes. The way he plays with heart, everyone sees it and is happy. It’s not just because he’s Israeli or because he hasn’t played much; he gives his heart. He fights tooth and nail here for every minute, for everyone and for Israel.”
As for succeeding in reaching their goals in any of the competitions that Lavy and Maccabi are participating in, it is always an uphill battle.
“We’re doing everything we can to get there,” exclaimed Lavy. “We’re only focused on one thing – winning games.”

Soroka Medical Center prepares for potential military conflict with Iran

Soroka Medical Center has begun preparing for conflict with Iran, with hospital management and emergency teams updating procedures, checking readiness, and running simulations for wartime scenarios.
The hospital was hit by a ballistic missile in June of 2025, sustaining severe damage to its infrastructure. Since then, Soroka Center has been working on recovery and is now forced to prepare for another military campaign.
The medical center is already simulating emergency situations, and in recent days, procedures have been refined and guidelines updated for transferring patients in case of another emergency.
Additionally, preparations have begun at Wolfson Medical Center. The orthopedics department has moved to urology, the pediatric surgery department to the children's department, and the hospital's underground areas have been evacuated.
It should be emphasized that there has been no reduction in patient care.
Municipal readiness for emergencies
In addition to heightened alert levels in hospitals, the issue of municipal preparedness is also being raised.
The Tel Aviv Municipality has declared that, in the event of an emergency, public shelters will automatically open.
In Petah Tikva, some shelters are ready for public use, and others will open based on instructions. In Bat Yam, shelters have not yet been activated, while in Rishon LeZion, most shelters are already open, with many equipped with an automatic opening mechanism in case of emergency.
The residents have noticed these disparities. For many, the daily question has become whether there is an open shelter within walking distance.

Months before voters head to the polls, and before Israel has even set a date for its next election, the opposition that is seeking to replace Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his government is already breaking apart. The opposition leaders are engaging in attacks on each other, setting up political traps, and formulating excuses for failure.
On Thursday morning, a leaked recording of former prime minister Naftali Bennett was published by Kipa News, in which Bennett floated the idea of a national unity government modeled on the late-1980s arrangement between Shimon Peres and Yitzhak Shamir.
The comparison itself was not particularly controversial or unwelcome; Israel is still warring with Hamas in Gaza and Hezbollah in Lebanon, with a second major war with Iran appearing more and more inevitable by the day.
In the recording, he rejected the politics of blanket boycotts and said he would not rule out governing alongside National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir and Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich. Bennett said that the national security minister is a “deeply unserious individual,” adding that “clowning is no substitute for seriousness.”
Smotrich, by contrast, was described as “combative but hardworking,” with Bennett arguing that his inclusion in Bennett’s previous coalition would have removed the need to rely on Mansour Abbas’s Ra’am faction.
These remarks drew the immediate ire of figures who are supposed to be Bennett’s natural political partners in any post-Netanyahu alignment.
Yair Golan warned that Israel must be “repaired” from its current condition, declaring that his Democrats faction would not “lend a hand to a government that includes those responsible for internal division, the systematic destruction of the rule of law, and the October 7 massacre.”
Yashar! Head Gadi Eisenkot struck a similar tone, arguing that anyone who held senior responsibility on October 7, “including cabinet members and at their head Prime Minister Netanyahu,” is “unworthy, unfit, and must not hold public office.”
Eisenkot called on politicians to “look forward,” a sentiment that opposition leader Yair Lapid endorsed with a brief but telling “agreed.”
However, Lapid found his own position under attack earlier this week after appearing to launch a preemptive “gevalt” campaign, warning of disaster before the campaign had even begun.
“The polls being published, along with very troubling in-depth studies that have not been published, indicate that it is no longer at all certain that the liberal bloc will win,” Lapid cautioned. “If we don’t come to our senses, we will lose. If we continue working against one another, we will lose.”
And this is the heart of the problem that has been plaguing Israel’s politics for years.
Since October 7, opposition figures have argued that they would have governed, prepared, and responded better than Benjamin Netanyahu and his coalition. Yet now, those same figures appear to be laying the groundwork for explaining why victory may be impossible.
Lapid is right about one thing: The opposition bloc appears unlikely to be able to reach a majority without the Joint List – a prospect that remains politically toxic for the majority of lawmakers and voters in his bloc. However, the uncomfortable truth for the sitting coalition is that it, too, appears to struggle to reach a majority on its own.
Gov't has become 'overrun with identity politics, boycotts'
If these realities push politicians to double down on mutually assured destruction – targeting the very people they will need to govern with – then Israel risks remaining trapped in the same cycle of division and identity politics that brought the Jewish state to October 7.
This is true not only for the opposition. It is a symptom of a broader failure, on both the Left and the Right, to move past October 6. While Israeli voters are vying for their elected officials to highlight their responsibility and ability to govern, the Knesset has become overrun with identity politics, boycotts, and loyalty tests.
Voters are tired. They have been scarred repeatedly, from every direction. They are less interested in populist rhetoric and more interested in answers. Answers on restoring security, holding those in power both politically and militarily accountable, and how the country will function on the day after.
If Israel’s political class continues to perform for the cameras instead of making their case, the result will stray far away from the “rehabilitation” the nation needs. Instead, it will only lead Israel into deeper stagnation.
Without a serious and immediate shift in tone and priorities, the divisions that have plagued and weakened Israel in the years leading up to October 7 will continue to define it in the years to come.

OpenAI and Anthropic CEOs refuse to hold hands during Modi’s India AI summit photo op
The incident in New Delhi highlights the frosty relationship between Sam Altman and Dario Amodei
Once a rival, always a rival.
As Prime Minister Narendra Modi kicked off the busiest day of India’s AI Summit in New Delhi, he orchestrated a photo op with 13 other business and political leaders, all standing in a line and holding each other’s hands above their heads.
Well, all of them except two.
Sam Altman and Dario Amodei, CEOs of rivals OpenAI and Anthropic, were positioned next to each other and, awkwardly, refused to clasp each other’s hands. Instead, they stood with their arms crossed in the air, avoiding eye contact. Amodei had worked at OpenAI but left to co-found his company because he felt that OpenAI was becoming too commercially focused.
The snub went viral on social media platforms in India. In a video afterwards, Altman said he “didn’t know what was happening on stage” and was not sure what he was supposed to do. An OpenAI spokesperson confirmed the authenticity of the video.
The two now lead the most valuable closely held AI companies in the world, with OpenAI worth about US$500 billion and Anthropic valued at US$380 billion.

Major road crash leaves 18 dead, 3 injured in northeast Egypt
Road accidents, often linked to speeding, claim thousands of lives each year in Egypt.
A collision between a truck and a passenger pick-up in Egypt’s northeastern Port Said province has left 18 people dead, mostly fishermen, and three others injured, according to reports.
The crash at approximately 12:30pm local time (10:30 GMT) on Thursday occurred on the 30 June Axis highway, to the south of Port Said, according to Egypt’s state-run Al-Ahram newspaper.

Survivors of the collision are being treated in hospital, and public prosecutors have launched an investigation into the circumstances of the accident, according to Al-Ahram.
Images from the scene of the accident posted online showed the aftermath of the crash, with a pick-up truck crushed between two large cargo trucks and debris scattered across the road, The Associated Press (AP) news agency reports.
AP said the pick-up truck was transporting fishermen to work at fish farms in the coastal Port Said area.
Attending the inaugural meeting of United States President Donald Trump’s Board of Peace in Washington, DC, on Thursday, Egyptian Prime Minister Mostafa Madbouly sent his condolences to the victims of the collision and ordered that financial assistance be provided to relatives of the deceased and injured.
Madbouly said in a statement posted on Facebook that he was following up on the incident through reports from the governor of Port Said province.
Deadly road accidents are common on Egypt’s roads and claim thousands of lives each year in crashes often involving microbuses and heavy trucks. Speeding, poor road conditions, and lax enforcement of traffic laws have been cited as contributing factors in collisions.
In June last year, a truck collided with a minibus, killing 19 people, most of them teenage girls, according to local officials.

New Trump banner hung on Justice Department headquarters
Sign up now: Get ST's newsletters delivered to your inbox
Large banners of President Donald Trump now hang from multiple federal buildings in Washington, including the nation’s top law enforcement branch, in a bold statement of power and influence over the government.
A long blue banner with Mr Trump’s visage was draped on the exterior of the Justice Department headquarters in Washington, DC, on Feb 19, making it the latest federal building to have a banner with the President’s face.
The banner’s lower border says “Make America Safe Again” in capital letters.
The signage is a strikingly prominent indication of how Mr Trump has eroded the separation that has long existed between the Justice Department and the White House to protect the department from political influence.
That careful distance has been dissolving since the beginning of Mr Trump’s second term. He has installed allies at the top ranks of the department to oversee a retribution campaign and investigate perceived political enemies. Hundreds of agency lawyers have since been fired, and thousands more have resigned.
The White House referred all questions pertaining to the Justice Department’s banner – including the reason behind its installation, its cost and the duration of its display – to the Justice Department, which did not respond immediately to a request for comment.
Similar banners were installed at other federal buildings in 2025, including the Agriculture Department and Labor Department.
The banner hung between columns at the Washington headquarters of the Agriculture Department says “Growing America Since 1862”. It hangs a few columns away from a banner depicting Abraham Lincoln.
An Agriculture Department spokesperson said on Feb 19 that the department was excited to celebrate America’s 250th anniversary, “particularly the roles our farmers and ranchers had in shaping our nation”.
The Trump banner at the Labor Department says, “American Workers First”, also in capital letters, and carries the emblem for the nation’s 250th anniversary. Along the same frontage hangs a banner showing Theodore Roosevelt, with the same wording and emblem.
Those two banners cost roughly US$6,000 (S$7,600) and were originally created for Labor Day, said Courtney Parella, a spokesperson for the Labor Department.
After receiving “tremendous positive response”, the department decided that they would stay up throughout the celebrations for America’s semiquincentennial, she said.
The same day that the banner was hung on the Justice Department building, Mr Trump hosted the inaugural meeting of the Board of Peace
It was held at the Donald J. Trump United States Institute of Peace, a decades-old organisation recently renamed for the President.
“Marco named it after me,” Mr Trump said in his opening remarks at Board of Peace meeting, while Secretary of State Marco Rubio sat a few feet away. “I had nothing to do with it, I swear I didn’t. I swear. I had no idea.” NYTIMES

‘Long time coming’: The days of free-roaming cats could be numbered in WA

‘Long time coming’: The days of free-roaming cats could be numbered in WA
Conservation groups are celebrating after the West Australian government moved on cat containment laws after a decade-long fight.
This week, the Cook government announced it was progressing amendments to the Cat Act that would give local governments the legal right to introduce and manage their own cat containment laws.
The federal government estimates pet cats kill about 1.5 billion native animals every year and in 2024 the feral cat working group in WA estimated in Perth that number was about 47 million.
More than 20 local governments have tried and failed to implement cat containment laws because they extend beyond the powers of the Cat Act, which does not prescribe rules on roaming pet cats.
State law takes precedence over local government laws, and every local government attempt has been quashed by an upper house committee that reviews local laws.
The last council to attempt to regulate roaming cats was the Shire of Pingelly late last year, whose Save the Numbat Local Law was quashed by the committee.
If passed, the WA amendments will allow local governments to implement local laws that include restricting cats to their owners’ premises, prohibiting cats from all public areas, or introducing cat curfews.
“Cat containment will prevent the destruction of native wildlife and improve the lives of people’s beloved pet cats,” Local Government Minister Hannah Beazley said.
Bruce Webber, a long-time advocate for containment laws and executive manager of science and conservation at Bush Heritage Australia, was jubilant at the amendments, but saved criticism for the time it took to bring them in.
“Very happy with the outcome but very sad it’s taken this long; we shouldn’t ignore the number of animals that had to die over the past decade to get this solution in place,” he said.
“I think it’s the right result. The minister, to her credit, has listened to the evidence and urgency being demanded by the community and us delivering the right solution.
“I think it should fly through both houses [of parliament], hopefully next week. That will give us the quickest solution to cat containment.”
Webber said the working group had already been collaborating with the government and the WA Local Government Association on a model for cat containment laws that could be easily adopted by councils.
He said a survey of councils conducted last year suggested 80 per cent would now adopt cat containment laws.
WALGA president Karen Chappel said the association had long advocated for the state to prioritise reforms to the Cat Act.
“WA has needed clear direction and legislative changes to ensure local governments can implement effective cat local laws, and we acknowledge the state government’s commitment and engagement with the sector,” she said.
“Empowering Local Governments to be able to implement cat containment measures in response to their communities and individual circumstances is vital for promoting responsible pet ownership and safeguarding the natural environment.”
The state government has urged councils to work with owners of outdoor cats to consider transition arrangements, strategies and initiatives to support the impending changes of laws.
The government is also undertaking a wholesale review of the Cat Act where it is looking at cat registration, sterilisation, microchipping, breeding and cat ownership limits.

Bolivia’s ex-leader Evo Morales reappears after months-long unexplained absence

Bolivia’s long-serving socialist former leader, Evo Morales, reappeared on Thursday in his political stronghold of the tropics after almost seven weeks of unexplained absence, endorsing candidates for upcoming regional elections and quieting rumours he had fled the country in the wake of the US seizure of his ally, Venezuela’s ex-president Nicolás Maduro.
The weeks of hand-wringing over Morales’ fate showed how little the Andean country knows about what’s happening in the remote Chapare region, where the former president has spent the past year evading an arrest warrant on human trafficking charges, and how vulnerable it is to fears about US president Donald Trump’s potential future foreign escapades.
The media outlet of Morales’ coca-growing union, Radio Kawsachun Coca, released footage of Morales smiling in dark sunglasses as he arrived via tractor at a stadium in the central Bolivian town of Chimoré to address his supporters.
Morales, Bolivia’s first Indigenous president, who served from 2006 until his fraught 2019 ouster and subsequent self-exile, explained that he had come down with chikungunya, a mosquito-borne ailment with no treatment that causes fever and severe joint pain, and suffered complications that “caught me by surprise”.
“Take care of yourselves against chikungunya — it is serious,” the 66-year-old Morales said, appearing markedly more frail than in past appearances.
He dismissed rumours fuelled by local politicians and fanned by social media that he would try to flee the country, vowing to remain in Bolivia despite the threat of arrest under conservative president Rodrigo Paz, whose election last October ended nearly two decades of rule by Morales’ Movement Toward Socialism party.
“Some media said, ‘Evo is going to leave, Evo is going to flee.’ I said clearly: I am not going to leave. I will stay with the people to defend the homeland,” he said.
Paz’s revival of diplomatic ties with the US and recent efforts to bring back the Drug Enforcement Administration — some 17 years after Morales expelled American anti-drug agents from the Andean country while cozying up to China, Russia, Cuba and Iran — have rattled the coca-growing region that serves as Morales’ bastion of support.
Paz on Thursday confirmed that he would meet Trump in Miami on 7 March for a summit convening politically aligned Latin American leaders as the Trump administration seeks to counter Chinese influence and assert US dominance in the region.
Before proclaiming the candidates he would endorse in Bolivia’s municipal and regional elections next month, Morales launched into a lengthy speech reminiscent of his once-frequent diatribes against US imperialism.
“This is geopolitical propaganda on an international scale,” he said of Trump’s bid to revive the Monroe Doctrine from 1823 in order to reassert American dominance in the Western Hemisphere. “They want to eliminate every left-wing party in Latin America.”

Trump directs release of government files ‘related to alien and extraterrestrial life’
Trump has accused Obama of sharing ‘classified information’ after the former president spoke about aliens on a recent podcast
- Bookmark
- CommentsGo to comments
President Donald Trump is directing the release of government files “related to alien and extraterrestrial life” and other similar topics.
Trump announced Thursday night on Truth Social that he’s directing top officials, including Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, to begin identifying and releasing “Government files related to alien and extraterrestrial life, unidentified aerial phenomena (UAP), and unidentified flying objects (UFOs), and any and all other information connected to these highly complex, but extremely interesting and important, matters.”
Trump said the move is “based on the tremendous interest shown” in the topic. The Independent has contacted the White House for more information.
Just hours before his announcement, Trump accused former President Barack Obama of making a “big mistake” and sharing “classified information” after he suggested aliens are real on Brian Tyler Cohen’s podcast at the weekend.
"They're real, but I haven't seen them, and they're not being kept in ... Area 51. There's no underground facility unless there's this enormous conspiracy and they hid it from the president of the United States," Obama told the podcaster.
Obama later clarified his answer on Instagram, telling his followers he saw “no evidence during my presidency that extraterrestrials have made contact with us.”
“I was trying to stick with the spirit of the speed round, but since it’s gotten attention let me clarify. Statistically, the universe is so vast that the odds are good there’s life out there,” he wrote.
The Independent has contacted the Obama Foundation for comment.
Officials were quick to react to Trump’s announcement.
Hegseth re-shared Trump’s statement on X, accompanied by an alien emoji and a salute emoji. White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt wrote: “OUT OF THIS WORLD NEWS from President Trump.”
Senator John Fetterman, a Democrat, discussed the move with Fox News host Jesse Watters on Thursday night.
"If he’s going to release all of the X-Files, I think that could be a bipartisan thing," Fetterman said, referring to the 1990s TV series, which follows two government agents as they investigate aliens and other unexplained phenomena.
Representative Nancy Mace, a Republican from South Carolina, said she had previously demanded the Defense Department and other agencies release similar information.
“Tonight, President Trump is directing full disclosure of UAP and UFO files. In October, I wrote to DoD, CIA, NSA, and DNI demanding exactly that. The truth belongs to the American people,” she wrote on X.
Others reacted with skepticism, including Republican Representative Thomas Massie, who suggested Trump’s announcement could be a “distraction” from the release of files related to Jeffrey Epstein.
“They’ve deployed the ultimate weapon of mass distraction, but the Epstein files aren’t going away… even for aliens,” he posted on X.
Adam Kinzinger, a former Republican congressman, also wrote: “What about the 2 million unreleased Epstein files tho.”
This announcement comes a day after Trump’s daughter-in-law suggested the president has prepared a speech related to extraterrestrial life.
“I have just heard kind of around that he’s actually said, my father-in-law has actually said it, that there is some speech that he has, that I guess at the right time...I don’t know what the right time is...that he is going to break out and talk about, and it has to do with maybe some sort of extraterrestrial life, so to speak,” Lara Trump told the New York Post’s Pod Force One podcast.

School issues asbestos warning after ceiling panel falls during class
A north Brisbane school has issued a warning to families and shut down a classroom after part of a ceiling tile containing asbestos fell during class on Thursday.
The Education Department said the piece of ceiling was dislodged from a workshop classroom at Albany Creek State High School, with one student claiming it had been broken off after one of their peers tugged on a power cord connected to the ceiling.
“Access to the area where the incident occurred was immediately restricted and QBuild was engaged to remediate and provide clearance for re-occupation,” a department spokesperson said.
Three students were in the room at the time. Items also in the room, including those belonging to students, were quarantined for testing.
The school, built in 1981, was known to contain asbestos in some of its buildings.
One member of the school community told Brisbane Times she was surprised at families’ responses following a letter sent from Principal Derek Weeks on Thursday detailing the incident.
“If you’ve ever worked or volunteered in a school, you know how seriously they take the asbestos thing,” she said.
On Friday, the Education Department confirmed the tile piece was “asbestos-containing”.
“The school is working closely with impacted students and families to address any concerns, including regarding personal belongings that may have been affected,” the department said.
Albany Creek State High School has 1550 students currently enrolled, and sits on Brisbane’s outer northern suburbs, about 20 kilometres from the city centre.

Israel racing to curb Iran missile surge, warns 'no airtight solution' to thousands of rockets

While the United States focuses its negotiations with Iran largely on the nuclear issue, Israeli defense officials say the more immediate concern for Israel is Tehran’s accelerating ballistic missile program.
In closed-door discussions between senior IDF officials and U.S. counterparts, Israeli officials have warned that Iran continues to expand missile production and could possess at least 5,000 ballistic missiles by the end of 2027. Without a series of interception and disruption efforts carried out during Operation Rising Lion in June 2025, the number could have approached 8,000 by the end of the decade, according to Israeli defense sources.
Officials described the projection not as a theoretical estimate but as a working assessment guiding daily operations within Military Intelligence, the Air Force and air defense units.
According to Israeli data, Iran is currently producing about 100 ballistic missiles per month, with output expected to increase. Israeli officials say Tehran is relying on volume, calculating that even advanced multilayered air defense systems — including Arrow, David’s Sling and Iron Dome — have limited capacity against sustained, large-scale barrages.
During Operation Rising Lion, Iran launched more than 500 ballistic missiles and about 1,000 drones toward Israel over several days. The IDF said about 86% of the ballistic missiles were intercepted and roughly 99% of the drones were shot down. Still, missiles that penetrated defenses caused significant damage in Tel Aviv, Ramat Gan, Bat Yam, Haifa and at Soroka Medical Center in Be'er Sheva.
The scale of the attacks led Israel to shift from a largely defensive posture to an expanded offensive campaign aimed at destroying launchers and missile infrastructure inside Iran. The campaign, described by defense officials as “missile hunting,” involved sustained Air Force strikes at distances of roughly 1,500 kilometers after air superiority was achieved within 48 hours, according to the IDF.
Israeli officials said approximately 120 mobile launchers were destroyed within days, along with 35 production sites and ammunition depots. The operation marked what defense officials described as a strategic shift — combining interception with systematic efforts to strike launch capabilities before missiles could be fired.
Iran entered the June conflict with more than 2,000 missiles and ended it with roughly half that number, according to Israeli assessments. Even so, officials acknowledge there is currently no airtight solution to a scenario involving thousands of ballistic missiles. While layered defenses and early warning systems can reduce damage, they cannot eliminate the threat entirely.
Israeli officials also note that many of the missiles currently being produced by Iran use liquid fuel rather than solid fuel. According to defense assessments, this reflects difficulties in obtaining advanced components, including specialized processors, due to sanctions. The result, officials say, is lower technological sophistication per missile but a higher production rate.
Israeli officials say they are careful not to appear to be pushing the United States toward military confrontation, but emphasize that the missile threat is immediate and significant. Defense officials in Tel Aviv are in ongoing coordination with the Pentagon and U.S. military leadership, and say there is growing recognition in Washington that Iran’s missile arsenal poses a broader regional risk.
An Israeli official said the threat is not limited to Israel, noting that ballistic missiles could also target U.S. bases and regional allies and constrain U.S. operational freedom in the Middle East.
Senior defense officials describe military cooperation between Israel and the United States as an increasingly reciprocal partnership, citing operational experience gained during Operation Rising Lion, including joint intelligence coordination and long-range strike capabilities.
In Israel’s defense establishment, officials express limited optimism about a near-term diplomatic breakthrough between Washington and Tehran. Assessments suggest the gaps remain too wide for a comprehensive agreement that would satisfy U.S. demands — and especially Israel’s — if Iran’s missile program remains outside effective oversight.
Despite economic strain and internal pressures inside Iran, Israeli defense officials assess that the Islamic Republic may become more dangerous under stress, channeling resources into military deterrence. The acceleration of the missile program, they say, is part of that strategy.
Even if military action does not topple the regime in Tehran, Israeli officials describe the broader effort as cumulative — combining diplomatic pressure, sanctions, disruption of production chains and technological delays to gradually erode Iran’s capabilities rather than relying on a single decisive move.

Trump says he will order the release of Pentagon files on aliens and UFOs

Donald Trump has announced he is directing the defense department and other agencies to release whatever files they have on the search for alien life.
In a post on his social media platform, Trump said that he will ask the defense secretary and others “to begin the process of identifying and releasing Government files related to alien and extraterrestrial life, unidentified aerial phenomena (UAP), and unidentified flying objects (UFOs).”
Comments from Trump’s predecessor, Barack Obama, went viral last weekend after podcast host Brian Tyler Cohen asked the former president if aliens are “real.”
“They’re real, but I haven’t seen them,” Obama responded. “And they’re not being kept in, what is it? Area 51. There’s no underground facility, unless there’s this enormous conspiracy and they hid it from the president of the United States.”
On Thursday, Trump accused Obama of disclosing “classified information”.
The president told reporters aboard Air Force One, “I don’t know if they’re real or not,” and said of Obama, “I may get him out of trouble by declassifying.”
Obama clarified earlier this week that he had not seen evidence that aliens “have made contact with us,” but said, “statistically, the universe is so vast that the odds are good there’s life out there.”
Trump told reporters Thursday that when it came to the prospect of extraterrestrial visitors: “I don’t have an opinion on it. I never talk about it. A lot of people do. A lot of people believe it.”
Trump’s daughter-in-law Lara Trump suggested this week that he was ready to speak about it, however, when she said on a podcast that the president had a speech prepared to deliver on aliens that he would give at the “right time.”
That was news to the White House. Press secretary Karoline Leavitt responded with a laugh when she was asked about it Wednesday and told reporters, “A speech on aliens would be news to me.”
Public interest in UFOs and the possibility of the government hiding secrets of extraterrestrial life re-emerged after a group of former Pentagon and government officials leaked Navy videos of unknown objects to US media in 2017. The renewed scrutiny prompted Congress to hold the first hearings on UFOs in 50 years in May 2022, though officials said that the objects, which appeared to be green triangles floating above a Navy ship, were likely drones.
Since then the Pentagon has promised more transparency on the topic. The information that has been made public shows that the vast majority of UFO reports made by the military go unsolved but the ones that are identified are largely benign in nature.

Paris mayoral election campaign gets bogged down in controversy

Paris's municipal race is in a sticky situation. With one month to go before the vote, scheduled for March 15 and 22, the six main candidates vying to succeed Socialist Mayor Anne Hidalgo seem mired in the muddy marls of Paris, stuck in positions that hardly shift. Some controversial topics, such as the never-ending budget talks in Parliament, scandals in the after-school sector, legal cases and mutual accusations of pandering to political extremes, have stalled the emergence of momentum and the development of constructive debates during the campaign.
The final lineup was eagerly anticipated following the entry of Sarah Knafo (Reconquête, far right) into the race on January 7. For the Socialists, former deputy mayor Emmanuel Grégoire, who had been preparing since 2020, won the party's internal primary and intended to embody the next generation. He even achieved a political first in Paris: Rallying the entire left, excluding the radical left La France Insoumise (LFI), under his name. Despite that, the Paris lawmaker, who is rather introverted, has found it difficult to make an impression on public opinion. He remains relatively unknown and has struggled to overcome his reputation as a right-hand man. Grégoire served as chief of staff to former mayor Bertrand Delanoë from 2010 to 2012, to former prime minister Jean-Marc Ayrault from 2012 to 2014 and Hidalgo's first deputy from 2018 to 2024.

China helps Zimbabwe grow US$1.2 billion tobacco crop amid debt, health concerns
As Zimbabwe’s largest agricultural export and a primary foreign currency earner, tobacco dominates its trade with Beijing
This represents a major turnaround for an industry that, if not for Chinese investment, would have nearly collapsed two decades ago, although it remains a crop of concern for health campaigners.
As Zimbabwe’s largest agricultural export and a primary foreign currency earner, tobacco dominates its trade with Beijing. Last year, China imported US$790 million of the “golden leaf”, accounting for 31 per cent of its total imports from Zimbabwe, according to the Chinese embassy in Harare.
Gorden Moyo, director of the Public Policy and Research Institute of Zimbabwe (PPRIZ), attributes these production levels to Chinese involvement, specifically by Tian Ze Tobacco Company (TZTC).
“It provided financial support through low-interest loans, zero mark-up on inputs and technical assistance to scores of contract farmers,” said Moyo, a former minister of state enterprises. The intervention proved vital after the industry was brought to its knees following the land reforms of the era of former leader Robert Mugabe that led to the exit of white commercial farmers and subsequent targeted Western sanctions.
According to the country’s Tobacco Industry and Marketing Board (TIMB), yields plummeted from 260 million kilograms in 1998 to a record low of 48 million kilograms by 2008. As Western financing dried up, China offered to revive Zimbabwe’s tobacco industry as Beijing moved to secure supplies.
A turning point arrived in 2005 when Harare signed a memorandum of understanding with the China National Tobacco Corporation, paving the way for Tian Ze, a subsidiary of the corporation.

The secret to black-tie dressing in Australia
How do you do black-tie when it’s really hot?
“Less is more” is the tried-and-true advice of most fashion experts, but when it comes to evening wear in a steamy hotel ballroom or hothouse marquee, more can be, well, more. I’m not suggesting reaching for full-length faux fur and sweating it out on the dance floor like a jockey in a sauna when the DJ plays Uptown Funk, but there are more options than the ubiquitous strappy minidress in butter-yellow.
Karl Lagerfeld’s successor as creative director at Chanel, Matthieu Blazy, understands that summer evening-wear can actually feature a sleeve. His spring 2026 runway debut show in Paris last October concluded with model Awar Odhiang in a stunning, floor-sweeping skirt and roomy, T-shirt-style blouse. A full skirt offers all the drama of a ballgown while allowing for air circulation on the dance floor. Unlike with minidresses, there are no concerns about modesty when seated, while the sheer volume of fabric allows you to tap into a flotilla of trends (add lace, fringing sequins or a floral print and you’re set).
Wearing a T-shirt with a skirt also channels the sexy ease of Sharon Stone, who famously wore a lavender Vera Wang satin skirt with a man’s white shirt from Gap to the Oscars in 1998. An added bonus? You don’t need to worry about bra straps or tan-lines.
Some Australian brands, such as Matteau and Oroton, have taken the next step, with tank-top-style dresses that flow into a longer skirt; with the right accessories, these look so ready to party come cocktail hour. It’s all a matter of looking cool to stay cool.

CARACAS, February 20. /TASS/. Venezuela’s authorized President Delcy Rodriguez has signed the Law on Amnesty for Democratic Coexistence, which was unanimously passed by the National Assembly of the country.
"On January 30, I proposed adopting an amnesty law covering the entire political process since 1999, when <...> politically motivated violence led to hate crimes and justifying external aggression against Venezuela," Rodriguez said on the Venezolana de Television TV channel. She thanked the members of parliament and participants in the Program for Democratic Coexistence and Peace, who have "showed exceptional political maturity," allowing the amnesty legislation to be adopted in a short time.
Rodriguez emphasized that restoring justice should be one of the key priorities, and that Venezuela needs peace and stability. The law will allow the release of political prisoners convicted from January 1, 1999 to the present, and will take effect once it is published in the Official Gazette of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela.

Nasa ranks 2024 spacecraft mishap among its worst disasters
US space agency delivers a harsh assessment of a botched Boeing Starliner test flight that stranded two astronauts
Nasa on Thursday blamed what it called engineering vulnerabilities in Boeing’s Starliner spacecraft along with internal agency mistakes in a sharply critical report assessing a botched mission that left two astronauts stranded in space.
The US space agency labelled the 2024 test flight of the Starliner capsule a “Type A” mishap - the same classification of the deadly Challenger and Columbia shuttle disasters - a category that reflects the “potential for a significant mishap,” it said.
The failures left a pair of Nasa astronauts stranded aboard the International Space Station for nine months in a mission that captured global attention and became a political flashpoint.
“Starliner has design and engineering deficiencies that must be corrected, but the most troubling failure revealed by this investigation is not hardware. It’s decision-making and leadership,” Nasa administrator Jared Isaacman said in a briefing.
“If left unchecked,” he said, this mismanagement “could create a culture incompatible with human space flight”.

Report: Hamas holds leadership elections
The militant group Hamas is holding elections to determine its new interim leadership, according to a report in the BBC.
Voting will take place among Hamas membership in Gaza, the West Bank and other places where Hamas members are located.
Sources told the BBC that voting had taken place in secret in Gaza and had already concluded, but it was unclear at what stage the voting process was in other locations.
Whoever is elected as interim leader will serve in that position for a year, per the report. The front-runners are said to be Khalil al-Hayya, a Hamas leader in Gaza who is thought to be aligned with former leaders Yahya Sinwar and Ismail Haniyeh; and Khaled Meshal, who leads the Hamas movement outside of the Palestinian territories.
In December, Saudi news reported that Hamas was preparing to hold elections for the head of the group's political bureau.
Hamas' leadership was mostly killed by Israeli strikes during the Israel-Gaza war.
U.S. removing guardrails from proposed Saudi nuclear deal, document says
U.S. President Donald Trump has told Congress he is pursuing a civil nuclear pact with Saudi Arabia that does not include non-proliferation safeguards the U.S. has long said would ensure the kingdom does not develop nuclear weapons, according to a copy of the document sent to Congress and reviewed by Reuters.
Trump, a Republican, and former President Joe Biden, a Democrat, have worked with Saudi Arabia on paths to building the first civil nuclear power plants for the kingdom.
The development comes amid fears of a new global nuclear arms race following the expiration earlier this month of the last strategic arms limitation treaty between Russia and the United States, and China's moves to expand its own nuclear arsenal.
Arms control groups and many Democrats and some leading Republicans – including Secretary of State Marco Rubio when he served in the Senate – have insisted that any agreement come with guardrails, including that Saudi Arabia not have the ability to enrich uranium or to reprocess spent nuclear fuel, potential pathways to weapons, demands also made by successive U.S. administrations.
RECAP: Trump mulls limited preliminary strike on Iran to pressure nuclear deal, report says
Here are Friday's updates from Israel, Gaza, the West Bank and the Middle East:
■ U.S. President Donald Trump is considering a limited preliminary strike on Iran to pressure the Islamic regime into meeting U.S. demands for a nuclear deal, the Wall Street Journal reported.
■ Iran told UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres on Thursday that Tehran will consider bases, facilities and assets of the "hostile force" in the region as legitimate targets if it faces military aggression.
■ Far-right MK Limor Son Har-Melech (Otzma Yehudit) entered the Gaza Strip as part of a settler tree-planting event with dozens of attendees.
■ Secretary of State Marco Rubio expressed his gratitude to the UAE for contributing $1.2 billion to Trump's Board of Peace Gaza rehabilitation and humanitarian efforts, the U.S. State Department said.
■ Prime Minister Netanyahu said Israel and the U.S. agreed Gaza will not be rebuilt until fully demilitarized, while Trump said he expects Hamas to give up weapons and claimed people had told him Gazans "don't mind dying," speaking as world leaders met in Washington.
■ Five nations committed troops to a new Gaza force, and Trump's Board of Peace secured $7 billion in aid with Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and the UAE pledging billions, and Indonesia, Morocco, Kazakhstan, Kosovo and Albania providing troops, while Egypt and Jordan offered police training.
■ Board of Peace official Nikolay Mladenov said Palestinian police officers are being recruited and trained in Egypt to help disarm Hamas, drawing 2,000 applicants within hours.
■ Trump announced that FIFA will raise $75 million for Gaza projects, including soccer fields, with global stars expected to participate.
■ Trump withdrew support for the U.K.'s Chagos Islands deal after Britain blocked U.S. use of RAF bases for potential strikes on Iran over legal and security concerns.
■ Norway announced it will not join Trump's Board of Peace but will host this spring's Ad-Hoc Liaison Committee meeting for Palestinian aid, which it has led for decades.
■ The U.S. paid about $160 million of its nearly $4 billion United Nations dues as Trump pledged further support and touted his Board of Peace as a complement to the struggling organization.
Trump mulls preliminary limited strike on Iran to force nuclear deal, report says
U.S. President Donald Trump is considering a limited preliminary strike on Iran to pressure the Islamic regime into meeting U.S. demands for a nuclear deal, the Wall Street Journal reported.
According to the journal, the strike would be intended to avoid escalating into a full-scale offensive and minimize the risk of Iranian retaliation.
The initial strike, which could come in a matter of days if authorized, would focus on a limited number of military or government sites, sources familiar with the matter told the WSJ. If Iran continues to defy Trump's demand to end its nuclear enrichment program, the United States would escalate with a broad military campaign targeting regime facilities, with the potential goal of toppling the Islamic regime.
One source said Trump could escalate strikes, starting small before expanding to broader attacks until the Iranian regime agrees to either dismantle its nuclear program or otherwise falls.
It was unclear how seriously Trump is weighing the option after weeks of debate, although senior advisers have repeatedly floated the idea of military strikes. In recent discussions, officials said, the possibility of a large-scale military campaign has been the focus, according to the WSJ.
'Gaza will be Jewish': Far-right MK plants trees in Gaza Strip settlement event
Far-right MK Limor Son Har-Melech (Otzma Yehudit) entered the Gaza Strip for a tree-planting event with dozens of attendees.
Event organizers from the Nahala settler movement said, "This evening, dozens of families, men, women and children entered Gaza together with Knesset Deputy Speaker MK Limor Son Har-Melech." It was also reported that a large settler march is expected in the Gaza Strip over Passover.
Son Har-Melech said at the event, "In this place, from which the most vile murderers came out to sow death and destruction, we announce today: Jewish boys and girls will play in the streets of Gaza, and prosperous cities will arise in Gaza and life will flourish."
She added, "'Where the Jews rule over their enemies' is not just a verse in the Book of Esther, it is the reality we are building here on the ground. Gaza will be Jewish, because only in this way will we ensure victory and real security for the people of Israel."
Iran tells UN chief it will respond 'decisively' if subjected to military aggression
Iran told UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres on Thursday that Tehran will consider bases, facilities and assets of the "hostile force" in the region as legitimate targets if it faces military aggression.
U.S. President Donald Trump's rhetoric towards Iran "signals a real risk of military aggression," Iran's permanent mission to the United Nations said in the letter, adding Iran did not want a war.

BRUSSELS — U.S. President Donald Trump's administration has threatened to retaliate against European countries if the EU favors domestic weapons-makers in a drive to rearm the continent.
The U.S. Department of Defense objected to any EU effort to limit American arms-manufacturers' access to the European market and warned that would trigger a reciprocal response.
The administration made the previously unreported remarks in a contribution to a European Commission consultation earlier this month, after the EU’s executive branch requested feedback from governments and industry on European weapons procurement rules.

Pilot killed as Iran fighter jet crashes in Hamadan province

An Iranian fighter jet has crashed, killing one of two pilots onboard, Iranian state broadcaster IRIB said.
The air force plane crashed during a late-night training exercise in western Hamadan province, IRIB posted on Telegram.
"The cause of the accident is under investigation," it added.
The incident comes amid massive US military buildup near Iran.
President Donald Trump has deployed warships, fighter jets and other military hardware to the Middle East as he seeks to block Iran from building a nuclear bomb, something Tehran says it is not pursuing.
Trump has repeatedly threatened military action against Iran, citing a deadly crackdown on protesters last month then more recently over its nuclear programme.
On Thursday, Trump said that Iran had at most 15 days to make a deal and again suggested that the United States would attack if failed to do so.
Iran in response warned that US bases, facilities and assets would be "legitimate targets" if the US follows through on its military threats and attacks.
Amir Saeid Iravani, the Iranian ambassador to the United Nations, made the remarks in a letter to UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres and the president of the Security Council.
The letter cited a social media post by Trump on Wednesday, where he said the United States may need to use UK military bases, including one on an Indian Ocean island, "should Iran decide not to make a deal."
"Such a belligerent statement by the President of the United States...signals a real risk of military aggression, the consequences of which would be catastrophic for the region and would constitute a grave threat to international peace and security," Iravani wrote in the letter.
He called for the Security Council — the UN's top decision-making body where Washington has veto power — to "ensure that the United States immediately ceases its unlawful threats of the use of force."
A previous attempt at negotiations collapsed when Israel launched surprise strikes on Iran last June, beginning a 12-day war that Washington briefly joined to bomb Iranian nuclear sites.

Family begs to stop vicious teen killer’s bid for day release

Family begs to stop vicious teen killer’s bid for day release
The family of a mother stabbed to death in her bed say they are terrified at the prospect of her teen killer being granted day leave from a mental health facility.
The boy and his best mate, who were 14 and 15 at the time, killed the older boy’s mother so they could steal her car with a plan to run away and create a child army.
The victim’s son pleaded guilty to murder and was jailed for at least 10 years. But his younger friend, who has autism and ADHD, was found not guilty because of mental impairment.
On Friday, the Supreme Court heard preparations were under way to move him to a psychiatric facility when he turns 18.
There, day release back in the community, supervised or unsupervised, can then be granted by a court.
The victim’s sister stood shaking as she told the judge her family remain haunted by what occurred in April 2023 and opposed any move towards the killer’s freedom.
She said the teenager had been welcomed into her sister’s home, where he was cared for and treated with kindness and respect, before the 41-year-old was bludgeoned with a cricket bat and stabbed multiple times.
“I’m terrified at the thought of [the teenager] being in the community in any capacity now, or any time in the future. We’re anxious, frightened, at the prospect of this ever occurring,” she said.
“This was not a momentary loss of control. It was a planned and abhorrent attack on a woman who was unarmed, unsuspecting, and inside her own home.
“The blunt force trauma included a cricket bat combined with a horrific number of stab wounds. The fact she was left for dead… demonstrates a profound lack of empathy; a dangerous disposition.”
The sister also took aim at the boy’s parents, saying they had been “unwilling or unable” to provide the boy support and act when clear flags of his mental health issues emerged.
“[He] had the ability to contribute to the planning of these events, articulating disturbing desires to harm others ... and yet appeared non-threatening externally, demonstrating his capacity to mask his intent,” she said.
“[Him] being found not guilty by way of mental impairment and not fully held accountable has been deeply challenging for all who loved [the victim].”
The victim’s mother spoke through tears, saying the boy’s lack of adequate family support had left her questioning whether her daughter might still be alive today if earlier interventions had taken place.
“I fear for the unsuspecting public, the people who show him kindness. The danger is real,” she said.
The court earlier heard the two school friends formed a delusional plan to create a paramilitary anti-communist army to restore Australia’s Christian values and fulfil a prophecy they’d received from God. They planned to kill the woman, take her car and drive to Halls Gap where they planned to blow up a bridge and bring in recruits.
The plans were shared with other classmates, codenamed Operation Continuity, and they packed bags with military gear and ration packs.
Police were alerted to the killing when the victim’s youngest child was woken by his mother’s screams and ran to a nearby police station.
Supreme Court Justice James Elliott will continue to hear the matter in June.

Trump says US will release files related to aliens and UFOs

President Donald Trump said he is directing federal agencies to release government documents that discuss extraterrestrial life and unexplained aerial phenomenon.
“Based on the tremendous interest shown, I will be directing the Secretary of War, and other relevant Departments and Agencies, to begin the process of identifying and releasing Government files related to alien and extraterrestrial life, unidentified aerial phenomena (UAP), and unidentified flying objects (UFOs), and any and all other information connected to these highly complex, but extremely interesting and important, matters,” Mr Trump said in a Truth Social post at night on Feb 19.
Mr Trump earlier on Feb 19 accused former president Barack Obama of giving away classified information
“He gave classified information, he’s not supposed to be doing that,” Mr Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One. The President suggested he could get Mr Obama “out of trouble” by declassifying the related information.
Mr Obama told liberal commentator Brian Tyler Cohen in an interview earlier in February that aliens are “real”, though added that he had not seen any, “and they’re not being kept in Area 51”. The former president later clarified that he did not mean to signal any special knowledge.
The US intelligence community released a report in 2021 detailing what it knew about unidentified flying objects that have been spotted by military pilots over the past several decades. The unclassified report contained few conclusive answers and no mentions of theories that aliens might have been responsible for them, but said that the government wanted to take reports of such episodes more seriously.
Also in 2021, the Pentagon released videos showing American military pilots tracking unidentified flying objects that rotated or quickly switched directions in mid-air.
Mr Trump’s push to focus on aliens comes at the beginning of a hectic midterm election year, with a heavy public focus on information disclosed in files related to the disgraced financier Jeffrey Epstein – many of which mention Mr Trump by name – as well as the issue of affordability, which has weighed on his popularity ratings.
Republicans face an uphill battle to hold on to their congressional majorities as polls show voters have soured on the President’s approach to managing the economy and the cost of living.
In Georgia earlier on Feb 19, Mr Trump claimed victory on affordability, signalling an unwillingness to embrace the idea that economic concerns are growing as he begins to campaign for Republican candidates around the country.
Mr Trump has come under repeated criticism from Democrats during his time in office for disclosing classified information, and was indicted on federal charges over allegations of wilfully retaining classified defence documents after his first term. That case was subsequently dismissed when he won re-election in 2024. BLOOMBERG

US pays $203 million of more than $5 billion owed to UN
Sign up now: Get ST's newsletters delivered to your inbox
WASHINGTON – The United States has paid about US$160 million (S$203.11 million) of the more than US$4 billion it owes to the UN, a United Nations spokesperson said on Feb 19 as US President Donald Trump hosted the first meeting of his “Board of Peace” initiative
“Last week, we received about US$160 million from the US as a partial payment of its past dues for the UN regular budget,” the UN spokesperson said in a statement.
Mr Trump said during his comments at the opening “Board of Peace” meeting that Washington would give the UN money to strengthen it.
The US is the biggest contributor to the UN budget, but under the Trump administration it has refused to make mandatory payments to regular and peacekeeping budgets, and slashed voluntary funding to UN agencies with their own budgets.
Washington has withdrawn from dozens of UN agencies
UN officials say the US owed US$2.19 billion to the regular UN budget as at the start of February, more than 95 per cent of the total owed by countries globally. The US also owes another US$2.4 billion for current and past peacekeeping missions and US$43.6 million for UN tribunals.
“We’re going to help them (UN) money-wise, and we’re going to make sure the United Nations is viable,” Mr Trump said.
“I think the United Nations has great potential, really great potential. It has not lived up to (that) potential.”
Countries, including major powers of the Global South and key US allies in the West, have been reluctant to join Mr Trump’s “Board of Peace” where Mr Trump himself is the chair. Many experts have said such an initiative undermines the UN.
Mr Trump launched the board in January and proposed it late in 2025 as part of his plan to end Israel’s war in Gaza.
A UN Security Council resolution recognised the board late in 2025 to 2027, limiting its scope to Gaza, the Palestinian territory it was meant to oversee following Israel’s devastating more than two‑year assault.
Under Mr Trump’s plan to end Israel’s war in Gaza, the board was meant to oversee Gaza’s temporary governance. Mr Trump subsequently said the board will tackle global conflicts and look beyond Gaza as well.
UN experts say that Mr Trump’s oversight of a board to supervise a foreign territory’s affairs resembles a colonial structure and criticized the board for not having Palestinian representation. There was no UN representative at the “Board of Peace” meeting on Feb 19. REUTERS

WASHINGTON – Iran on Feb 19 warned that US bases, facilities and assets would be “legitimate targets” if the United States follows through on its military threats and attacks.
Mr Amir Saeid Iravani, the Iranian ambassador to the United Nations, made the remarks in a letter to UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres and the president of the Security Council that was seen by AFP.

He called for the Security Council – the UN’s top decision-making body where Washington has veto power – to “ensure that the United States immediately ceases its unlawful threats of the use of force”.
The letter said Iran remains committed “to diplomatic solutions” and “on a reciprocal basis, addressing ambiguities regarding its peaceful nuclear programme”.
But Mr Iravani warned if Iran faced military aggression, “all bases, facilities, and assets of the hostile force in the region would constitute legitimate targets in the context of Iran’s defensive response”.
Mr Trump has repeatedly threatened military action against Iran, citing a deadly crackdown on anti-government protesters in January then more recently over its nuclear programme.
On Feb 19, Mr Trump said that Iran had at most 15 days to make a deal and again suggested that the United States would attack if failed to do so.
His comments followed talks on Feb 17 in Geneva between US envoys Steve Witkoff and the President’s son-in-law Jared Kushner, who met indirectly with Iran’s top diplomat, who said that there was progress.
A previous attempt at negotiations collapsed when Israel launched surprise strikes on Iran in June 2025, beginning a 12-day war that Washington briefly joined to bomb Iranian nuclear sites. AFP

"This isn't Emily Bronte's Wuthering Heights", scream the reviews. Well, duh. If anyone enters the cinema this weekend expecting a faithful re-enactment of the 18th century gothic masterpiece, they're missing the point. Emerald Fennell's fever dream of an adaptation is crass, classless, horny and a more than a little bit deranged — but boy is it a fun ride. See it at the cinema and lean into the crazy.

Classic TV show: The Secret Life of Us
What happens when you take the beloved formula of US sitcom Friends, and transplant the group of gorgeous young things from a New York City cafe to a grubby St Kilda beach? Why, you get The Secret Life of Us, of course. The four seasons of this iconic Australian show introduced us to a group of twenty-somethings, all living in the same apartment block, struggling with the growing pains of becoming adults. But this is a grittier version of the US show: there's sex, drugs, dreams and betrayal. With sultry voiceovers from the original soft boi Samuel Johnson, the show faces taboo topics like abortion, racism and sexual assault. There's stunning early 2000s fashion — tiny phones and silk tops abound — and surprising emotional heft. It's also a delight to see the baby faces of beloved actors like Claudia Karvan, Deborah Mailman and Joel Edgerton, showing just why they all went on to so much more.

Album: Meg Mac — It's My Party
Out today through EMI
For once, Meg Mac doesn't feel in control, and she's embracing it. Abandoning early plans for an austere, "witchy" record, she leans instead into a brighter, pop‑forward sound. Even as these songs sparkle more than before, every ache and hesitation still cuts through in her sharp, gripping lyrics. She reflects on the road she's taken so far, sometimes scolding her past self, sometimes extending grace, all with a clarity that feels more candid than her earlier work. It's a testament to her growth as a writer, and her newfound willingness to let a little fun in. The record's bookends are especially strong: He Said No is immaculate mature pop, and the title track somehow lands miles from Lesley Gore. In between, she delivers songs that are honest, brave, deeply relatable and pretty damn catchy.

Book: My Cursed Vagina by Lally Katz
Published by Allen & Unwin on February 3.
"Your vagina is cursed," a psychic tells Australian playwright Lally Katz in New York in 2011. While she's clearly a scam artist, her declaration is proved true again and again over the ensuing decade as Katz travels between Australia and the US, where she was born, touring her work and dating questionable men. There's a twisted ovary, a rash that turns out to be herpes and two miscarriages recounted in distressing detail. Katz has made a career out of writing about her personal life in plays such as Stories I Want to Tell You in Person (2013), which was adapted into a two-part series for ABC TV, and her first book, My Cursed Vagina, is no different. Katz's quirky wit and searing honesty make her memoir a laugh-out-loud read. It's a story about growing up, making choices and living with the consequences — even if they are, unfortunately, an STI.

For the kids: Play School: Humpty's Big Book of Nursery Rhymes
Come for the stories, stay for the remixed nursery rhymes and home interior inspo. For the first time since 2013, the Play School opening titles have had a refresh and they're a drawcard in themselves. Jemima, Little Ted and the crew have some fancy new digs to call home in the stop-motion opener that balances nostalgia with a healthy dose of hygge and home decoration. But the main attraction in Humpty's Big Book of Nursery Rhymes is indeed Humpty and friends who explore childhood classics like B-I-N-G-O (recast as B-U-S-T-E-R, bro) and Row Your Boat through song, crafts and stories. Sixty years of Play School and they’re still showing us the endless possibilities for creation with a rubber glove, a toilet roll and an active imagination.
Recipe: Baked zucchini with charred corn and whipped feta
Whether you want a quick tasty meal or an impressive side dish for a BBQ or gathering, this dish from Ismat Awan will fit the brief. Zucchini is the star, as it should be in peak season when it is abundant and inexpensive. Paired with a few pantry and fridge staples — canned corn and pumpkin seeds crisped up in a pan, and feta whipped with yoghurt into a creamy base — it creates a lovely mix of texture and a satisfying balance of sweet, salty and tanginess. If you're game (and I recommend you be) drizzle on some hot honey before serving.

Italy, the United Kingdom and Japan hope to bring Germany on board their next-generation fighter jet project

As the Future Combat Air System (FCAS) project that was developed with France and Spain is facing unprecedented threats, will Germany seek new partners? This idea has been circulating since statements made on December 4, 2025, by Italian Defense Minister Guido Crosetto. Speaking before Parliament, he mentioned the possibility that Germany might "in the future" join the next-generation fighter jet project developed by Italy in collaboration with the United Kingdom and Japan. According to Italian media, Council President Giorgia Meloni and German Chancellor Friedrich Merz even discussed this scenario in January during a summit in Rome.
The Global Combat Air Programme (GCAP), which was launched by a treaty signed in December 2022 between the UK, Italy and Japan, has not encountered the same obstacles as the FCAS, with the three countries having opted for centralized and balanced governance through a joint venture. Named "Edgewing," it brings together the British defense contractor BAE Systems, Italy's Leonardo and Japan Aircraft Industrial Enhancement, with each holding one-third of the capital. It has been operational since June 2025 and aims to fly its first demonstrator before 2027, with the system entering service in 2035 – five years ahead of FCAS.

BUDAPEST, February 20. /TASS/. Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban said he fears that continued attempts by European Union leaders to obstruct US efforts toward a Ukrainian settlement could prompt US President Donald Trump to abandon the negotiating process.
"I am only afraid that the Americans may suddenly pack up and leave the Russian-Ukrainian peace talks. The current situation cannot be masked by any elaborate linguistic tricks. While President Trump is persistently seeking a settlement, Europeans stand in his way at every step," Orban told Hungarian journalists following the first session of the Board of Peace chaired by Trump.
"The Americans are constantly putting forward peace initiatives, maintaining direct communication with the Russians, and holding negotiations, while European leaders have decided to continue the war and believe Russia must be defeated on Ukraine’s territory," the prime minister said at the press conference, broadcast by the M1 TV channel. He added that cooperation between the United States and Europe is becoming increasingly difficult.
Orban said that during his meetings with Trump, he urged the US leader to continue efforts to resolve the Ukrainian conflict which would otherwise go on for a long time. "I don’t know how this war can be stopped without the Americans," he emphasized.

Italian PM: There are important steps forward in Ukraine talks but territorial issue remains unresolved
Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni has said that there have been "important steps forward" in peace talks on Ukraine regarding security guarantees, but in her view a settlement of the key territorial issue is still far off.
Source: Meloni in an interview with Sky TG24, posted on 19 February
Quote: "I see not so much a turning point approaching as contact regarding a ceasefire, which in Ukraine is still very far away."
Details: Meloni stressed that the key problem remains unresolved.
Quote: "There is a peace plan in which many issues have also been settled on paper, except that we are still very far from resolving the main issue, namely the question of territories to which Russia continues to lay claim, which in my view is entirely unfounded."
Details: Instead, Meloni said that there has been good progress in peace talks on the issue of security guarantees for Ukraine.
Quote: "I see important steps forward in the documents that we are currently working on. Very good work has been done on security guarantees for Kyiv which, incidentally, are based on the Italian proposal to shape them along the lines of Article 5 of the North Atlantic Treaty."

Trump orders Pentagon to release files on UFOs and aliens
February 20, 2026US President Donald Trump, citing "tremendous interest," said he was directing the Pentagon and other government agencies to release files related to extraterrestrials and unidentified flying objects (UFOs).
He said the agencies should include "any and all other information connected to these highly complex, but extremely interesting and important, matters."
He made the announcement on social media on Thursday, hours after accusing former President Barack Obama of disclosing "classified information" when he suggested in a podcast interview that aliens were real.
"I don't know if they're real or not," Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One. When asked of Obama, he said: "I may get him out of trouble by declassifying."
What did Obama say about aliens in the podcast?
In a podcast released last week, Obama said he believed aliens were real, but he had not seen any evidence of them during his presidency.
"They're real, but I haven't seen them and they're not being kept in... Area 51," he told host Brian Tyler Cohen, referring to the top-secret facility at the heart of many UFO conspiracies.
Once his comments quickly went viral, the ex-president took to clarify on Instagram.
"Statistically, the universe is so vast that the odds are good there's life out there," he said. "But the distances between solar systems are so great that the chances we've been visited by aliens is low, and I saw no evidence during my presidency that extraterrestrials have made contact with us. Really!"
Aliens and Area 51
Public interest in extraterrestrials, unidentified flying objects and unidentified aerial phenomena has prompted several conspiracy theories over the years.
Several internet chat rooms and social media accounts dedicate themselves to solving this mystery, and many insist the US government knows more than it lets on.
It is what gave birth to the "Storm Area 51" event, where about 100 people gathered at the entrance to the secretive US military base "to see them aliens."
This interest was renewed in recent years as the US government investigated several reports of what appeared to be supernatural aircraft. However, in March 2024, the Pentagon released a report saying it had no proof the aerial phenomenon was alien technology.

Two men in their mid-30s were killed overnight when their vehicle veered off Highway 6 and plunged into a ravine near Taibeh.
The crash was reported to Magen David Adom’s 101 emergency center in the Yarkon region at 12:41 a.m. Paramedics and medics who arrived at the scene found the vehicle overturned on its roof at the bottom of the embankment, with four people trapped inside.
Two of the men were unconscious, without pulse or breathing, and suffering from severe multi-system injuries. After medical examinations during complex rescue operations carried out by firefighters, paramedics pronounced them dead at the scene.
A man and a woman, also in their 30s, were seriously injured in the crash. Magen David Adom teams provided life-saving treatment and evacuated them to Meir Medical Center in Kfar Saba. Both were reported to be conscious but suffering from multi-system trauma.
Fire and Rescue Services said crews from the Sharon regional station used hydraulic tools to extricate the four occupants from the wreckage before transferring them to medical personnel.
ZAKA volunteers from the Sharon district were operating at the scene to handle the victims with dignity and collect remains.
Police are investigating the circumstances of the crash.

US president directs the Pentagon to release records on extraterrestrial life after accusing Obama of disclosing ‘classified information’

WASHINGTON, February 20. /TASS/. The US government will begin declassifying documents on extraterrestrial life and unidentified flying objects (UFOs), US President Donald Trump said.
"Based on the tremendous interest shown, I will be directing the Secretary of War [Pete Hegseth], and other relevant Departments and Agencies, to begin the process of identifying and releasing Government files related to alien and extraterrestrial life, unidentified aerial phenomena (UAP), and unidentified flying objects (UFOs), and any and all other information connected to these highly complex, but extremely interesting and important, matters," he wrote on Truth Social.
Earlier, Trump said that former US President Barack Obama (2009-2017) had disclosed classified information by recently stating that aliens exist. At the same time, the current American leader declined to clarify whether this meant he was confirming the existence of extraterrestrial civilizations.
In an interview on February 14, Obama said that aliens existed. Shortly afterward, he published a statement clarifying that "the universe is so vast that the odds are good there's life out there." He also added that during his presidency he saw no evidence that aliens had made contact with humans.

Menacing letters sent to politicians bear hallmarks of Sydney mosque threats

Racist hate mail sent to politicians bears hallmarks of Lakemba Mosque letters
In short:
Several politicians have been targeted with racist, threatening letters as far back as 2022, with clear similarities to threats received by Lakemba Mosque in recent weeks.
Senator Lidia Thorpe has called upon fellow politicians to take threats of racist violence more seriously.
What's next?
The letters have been reported again to police for investigation alongside the Lakemba Mosque threats.
Letters targeting independent senators Lidia Thorpe and Fatima Payman and former Greens leader Adam Bandt years ago have been reported for a second time to police, in connection to threats made to Lakemba Mosque.
Three letters containing hate speech and threats of violence have been sent to Australia's largest mosque in recent weeks, including references to the Christchurch terror attack and racist language about Muslims, threatening to "burn them out".
A spokesperson for NSW Police confirmed one letter sent to the mosque had been seized and is undergoing forensic examination.
The ABC has uncovered that similar letters targeting politicians were sent to branches of the Victorian Greens in 2022 and the NSW Greens in 2024.
In both cases the letters were reported to police, but no arrests were made in connection with the threats.
Similarities between the letters sent to the politicians and Lakemba Mosque are evident including the handwriting, distinctive swastikas, and the use of what appears to be a rifle bullet dipped in ink and used as a stamp.
The ABC has chosen not to publish the letters in full as they contain hate speech.
The letters sent to the Victorian Greens targeted Senator Thorpe, who was then part of the Greens, using racist slurs and threatening her and her family.
Senator Thorpe says she only became aware of the threats in the past week, as they were reported without her knowledge in 2023.
The Greens were approached for comment.
"The hurt is that I didn't know about this, and the AFP and the government have known about threats on my life for so long," Senator Thorpe said.
Senator Thorpe has received multiple threats against her life since entering politics but said the letters were among the most serious she had received.
"A lot of people have been charged, white supremacists and [National Socialist Network] members have been charged for threatening me, for using a carriage service. They've being raided, arrested.
"Why didn't, this guy or person, why was he left to be a risk to the community?" she asked.
"Why wasn't he charged back then? And why didn't I know about this?"
The ABC understands these letters have now been reported again to the Australian Federal Police and are expected to be investigated alongside the Lakemba threats.
In 2024, a similar letter threatening to "kill Muslims" was sent to the NSW branch of the Greens, targeting the party's former leader Adam Bandt and Senator Fatima Payman, who was formerly a Labor senator.
The letter was opened by former Greens staffer Shane Bazzi, who said he reported the incident to police in 2024 and again to Crime Stoppers on Thursday.
Senator Payman told the ABC she had received additional threatening letters and emails from other sources in recent weeks, which had also been reported to the AFP.
"My office is pretty much bombarded with hate and death threats," she said.
Referencing the alleged terror attack on January 26 targeting Indigenous Australians and allies, Senator Payman said she remained on high alert.
"With what happened recently here in WA, we have become more vigilant and I have a heart full of concerns for those who are visibly different, whether it be hijabi girls, Muslims praying, migrants going about their day, or Aboriginal people protesting colonisation,” she said.
Lakemba Mosque caretaker Gamel Kheir said he did not think New South Wales Police initially responded appropriately to the threats against the mosque.
"I genuinely believe that the police didn't take it seriously," Mr Kheir said.
"When we received our first letter in the mail, we had to put political pressure to get the police to respond.
Mr Kheir questioned how seriously authorities, including elected officials, were taking "the rise of racism, bigotry, and hatred".
NSW Police said in a statement it "takes hate crimes seriously and encourages anyone who is the victim of a hate crime or witnesses a hate crime to report the matter".
The Australian Federal Police declined to answer questions from the ABC.
Leaders say racist threats are rife
Senator Thorpe said she would seek meetings with the government when parliament returned, including with Minister for Multicultural Affairs Anne Aly and Indigenous Australians Minister Malarndirri McCarthy.
She said she wanted a response to her longstanding calls to implement the Australian Human Rights Commission's National Anti-Racism Framework, which was handed to the government in November 2024.
Senator Thorpe also called on fellow politicians to take racist threats of violence against "black and brown" communities seriously and name "white supremacy" when it occurred.
"It is scary to think that it wasn't taken seriously back then,"she said.
"What's it going to take? Is it going to take, you know, someone actually taking me out or a massacre at a mosque?"
As Islam's holy month of Ramadan gets underway, Mr Kheir said he wanted politicians to make more effort to bring the community together.
In the wake of One Nation's rapid rise in opinion polls, Mr Kheir questioned the level of discourse politicians were engaging in around the Arab community.
"Sadly, we live in a world where tolerance is at an all-time low and intolerance is at an all-time high," he said.
"It's not helpful when you have people like Senator Pauline Hanson, who sort of pours fuel on the fire. There is enough fire out there at the moment in terms of intolerance and bigotry."
Senator Hanson faced criticism for inflammatory comments about Muslims earlier this week.
Mr Kheir said he was aware of Muslim community members receiving threats in their letterboxes, though he believed them to be from different sources because the handwriting was different.
"There is a way bigger issue than just arresting these individuals," he said.
"How many of these letters are out there? How many people are too scared to even go to the police about it?"

Settler activists, including far-right MK, illegally cross into Gaza
‘Gaza will always be ours,’ declares Otzma Yehudit lawmaker, as settlement group announces ‘giant march’ in Strip over Passover; troops dispatched to the scene but no immediate comment from IDF
Emanuel (Mannie) Fabian is The Times of Israel's military correspondent
A group of settler activists, among them far-right MK Limor Son Har-Melech, illegally breached into the Gaza Strip Thursday evening, prompting the Israel Defense Forces to dispatch troops to the scene.
“We were privileged, with thanks to the blessed God, to enter the Gaza Strip, together with the Nachala movement and dozens of families, women, men, and children,” the Otzma Yehudit lawmaker wrote on social media.
“Gaza will always be ours,” Son Har-Melech added.
The activists from the ultra-nationalist Nachala settlement organization said they crossed the Gaza border with vehicles and planted trees in the area, part of its attempts to reestablish settlements that were fully evacuated during Israel’s unilateral withdrawal from the Strip in 2005.
Nachala described the activists’ entry to Gaza on Thursday as part of preparations for “a giant march” in the enclave during Passover.
“In place of murderers, Jewish children will play,” a statement from Nachala quoted Son Har-Melech as saying.
The IDF has not yet commented on the incident, but in previous similar cases has said that crossing the Gaza border “is dangerous and disrupts the activity of security forces in the area.”
בהתרגשות עצומה, נטענו עצים בחבל עזה האהוב יחד עם סגנית יו"ר הכנסת, ח"כ לימור סון הר מלך ????????
ממשיכים לפעול עד שעזה תהיה יהודית! ????????

הגיע הזמן להתיישב בעזה! ????️ pic.twitter.com/4VZHC12qIV
— נחלה – תנועה להתיישבות ???? (@T_Nachala) February 19, 2026
Earlier this month, a group of settler activists similarly crossed into Gaza during a protest that Nachala held along the border, which the IDF has declared a closed military zone.
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has repeatedly said during the war that Israel has no intention of reestablishing settlements inside Gaza, although several coalition members have consistently called to do so.
Since the October 7, 2023, Hamas-led onslaught that sparked the war in Gaza, Israeli civilians have on several occasions attempted to enter the Strip — often pro-settlement activists seeking to reclaim the settlements that Israel dismantled under the 2005 Disengagement Plan.
Under US President Donald Trump’s Gaza peace plan, Israeli troops would eventually completely withdraw from Gaza with the deployment of an International Stabilization Force that is supposed to disarm Hamas.

Fellow Valentine's Day actor Ashton Kutcher also reacted to Dane’s death, writing on X, “Miss you, buddy. Let’s keep fighting the fight to solve ALS.”
“Eric adored his fans and is forever grateful for the outpouring of love and support he’s received,” Dane’s family said.
What to know about Eric Dane's early acting career
Before his breakout role as Dr. Mark “McSteamy” Sloan in Grey’s Anatomy, Eric Dane appeared in several popular TV shows.

He moved to Los Angeles and at the age of 19 landed his first television role on teen sitcom Saved By The Bell, playing Tad Pogue, a former boyfriend of Leah Remini's character Stacey Carosi.
Dane followed that appearance with small roles in The Wonder Years, Roseanne, and Married... with Children before he landed a recurring role in medical drama Gideon's Crossing in 2000. He then had a significant role as the newspaper owner Jason Dean in the fifth and sixth seasons of the fantasy series Charmed.

The memoir will include pivotal moments in Dane’s life, including his first day on the set of Grey’s Anatomy, the birth of his two daughters and when he received his ALS diagnosis, according to The Open Field.
“I want to capture the moments that shaped me — the beautiful days, the hard ones, the ones I never took for granted — so that if nothing else, people who read it will remember what it means to live with heart," Dane previously said about the book, per the Associated Press.

“I was honored he chose my publishing imprint to publish his memoir. He told me he wanted his family to know how much he loved them, and he wanted to leave them a story they could be proud of,” Shriver added.
What is ALS and what are the symptoms and causes?
Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, more commonly known as ALS or Lou Gehrig’s disease, affects nerve cells in the brain and spinal cord.
Its name is derived from Greek and refers to a wasting away of the muscles responsible for controlling voluntary movement caused by a lack of nourishment, the fault of a genetic mutation.
As the ALS Association explains: “Motor neurons reach from the brain to the spinal cord and from the spinal cord to the muscles throughout the body. The progressive degeneration of the motor neurons in ALS eventually leads to their demise.”

Brussels should scrap plans to hire 2,500 EU civil servants, 9 countries say

BRUSSELS — The European Commission should scrap plans to add some 2,500 staff and increase administrative spending at a time when capitals are being asked to tighten their belts, according to ministers from nine EU countries.
In a letter addressed to Budget Commissioner Piotr Serafin and led by Austria, the ministers commend plans by the EU executive to streamline the bloc’s next long-term budget, known as the Multiannual Financial Framework (MFF).
But they criticize the Commission’s request for increased funding to hire new staff and expand its administrative headroom. The total funds the Commission has requested to hire an additional 2,500 civil servants, spread over the lifespan of the MFF (2028-2034), amount to an estimated €1.4 billion, the signatories told POLITICO.

After more than a decade of dominating Hungary’s politics, Viktor Orbán is being outflanked on nationalism.
As the country heads toward an April election, conservative opposition leader Péter Magyar has emerged as the prime minister’s most serious challenger yet by weaponizing Orbán’s nationalist rhetoric and Euroskepticism — and using it to attack his record.
The approach has helped propel Magyar in the polls, but it has also dimmed hopes in Brussels that he would represent a clean pro-EU break from Orbán’s confrontational style.

Next week, the government is expected to announce its education white paper. It is a moment, as political correspondent Alexandra Topping explains, of high political peril.
Part of the proposals will be reforms to special educational needs provision in England. And while nearly all agree that the current system is broken – extremely expensive, very divisive, and failing the most vulnerable children – the mood around the announcements is still tense. Simply put, many disability rights campaigners fear the reforms are not about improving the system, but cutting costs.
It is perhaps the most difficult moment in parliament for the government since its aborted welfare reforms last summer.
Yet away from the politics of Westminster, many families are simply anxious about what comes next. Annie Kelly hears from teenager Jake and his mum, Laura, about their experiences with schooling and whether they trust the government to reform the system for the better.

Keir Starmer may have survived a political near-death experience last week. But with a perilous by-election looming and punishing May elections on the horizon, few in Westminster think the prime minister is truly in the clear.
With fresh jeopardy ahead, could Starmer become the fifth prime minister in a decade to fall short of a full term?
This week on Westminster Insider, host Patrick Baker asks: why don’t UK prime ministers last anymore?
Political historian and host of the Past, Present, Future podcast David Runciman argues the revolving door at the top reflects a wider global surge in political instability — driven above all by economic turbulence.
Former Downing Street communications directors Katie Perrior, Lee Cain and James Lyons lift the lid on how Britain’s unforgiving 24/7 media machine is grinding down modern premiers.
David Lammy’s former adviser Ben Judah and the Institute for Government’s Jill Rutter probe whether the civil service is helping — or hindering — an era of increasingly fragile premierships.
And the author and historian Anthony Seldon says a “massive collapse” in prime ministerial experience means many new arrivals in Downing Street are stepping into the job unprepared for the demands of governing.

On this week’s EU Confidential, Sarah Wheaton speaks with Katarína Mathernová about what it means to live — and work — in a city under near-constant Russian threat. From bombardments, freezing temperatures and winter blackouts to EU accession hopes, we ask how Ukraine is holding up as another February anniversary of the full-scale Russian invasion approaches.
Later, Sarah is joined by POLITICO’s defense editor Jan Cienski to unpack a debate gaining momentum across Europe: whether the continent needs to rethink its ultimate deterrent as long-held security assumptions begin to shift.

EU Parliament to ditch Strasbourg trips thanks to American intervention

Welcome to Declassified, a weekly humor column.
It’s finally happened! The European Parliament’s monthly commutes to Strasbourg have long been criticized for the cost to taxpayers, but have been staunchly defended by the French on the grounds that tarte flambée is delicious, which is a fair point.
But now that the eastern regions of Alsace and Lorraine are no longer part of France, the Parliament can be based purely in Brussels, with no more annoying, long journeys (although it was all worth it when, in 2023, a train carrying hundreds of MEPs and European Parliament officials took a wrong turn and ended up at Disneyland Paris).

PARIS — France’s far right is framing the death of an activist associated with far-right groups as a moment akin to the murder of Charlie Kirk in the United States.
The National Rally has in recent days started pointing to the killing of 23-year-old Quentin Deranque in Lyon as proof the poll-topping populist party is the victim of an increasingly radical political left, much as the MAGA movement in the United States did following Kirk’s assassination last year.
With key municipal elections next month serving as a bellwether of the National Rally’s electability heading into the 2027 presidential race, the incident has deepened the fissures in France’s polarized politics and fueled fears of further violence.

Awkward moment AI rivals refuse to hold hands at India event
Once a rival, always a rival.
As Prime Minister Narendra Modi kicked off the busiest day of India’s AI Summit in New Delhi, he orchestrated a photo op with 13 other business and political leaders, all standing in a line and holding each other’s hands above their heads.
Well, all of them except two.
Sam Altman and Dario Amodei, chief executive officers of rivals OpenAI and Anthropic, were positioned next to each other and, awkwardly, refused to clasp each other’s hands. Instead, they stood with their arms crossed in the air, avoiding eye contact.
Amodei had worked at OpenAI, but left to cofound his company because he felt that OpenAI was becoming too commercially focused.
The snub went viral on social media platforms in India, including X. In a video after, Altman said he “didn’t know what was happening on stage” and wasn’t sure what he was supposed to do. An OpenAI spokesperson confirmed the authenticity of the video.
The two now lead the most valuable closely held AI companies in the world, with OpenAI worth about $500 billion ($708 billion) and Anthropic valued at $380 billion.
Their competition intensified this year with a series of advances by Anthropic — most notably the growing popularity of its Claude Code suite, which is ahead of OpenAI’s Codex in market adoption — followed by OpenAI hiring the developer of OpenClaw, a popular open source AI tool that got its start by using Anthropic technology.
Amodei’s company went directly at OpenAI with a high-profile Super Bowl ad, depicting how out of place advertisements would be in AI chatbot interactions and promising that Claude will never have ads.
Altman, whose company is testing ads, responded with a somewhat defensive, 420-word X post, in which he argued ad-supported services will make AI available to more people.
“I wonder why Anthropic would go for something so clearly dishonest,” he wrote. “I guess it’s on brand for Anthropic doublespeak to use a deceptive ad to critique theoretical deceptive ads that aren’t real, but a Super Bowl ad is not where I would expect it.”

NEW YORK, February 20. /TASS/. US President Donald Trump is considering launching a limited military strike on Iran to pressure Tehran into accepting Washington’s terms of a nuclear deal, while avoiding a full-scale attack, The Wall Street Journal reported, citing sources.
According to its information, such a strike could take place within days. It would target Iranian military and government facilities. If Tehran refuses to meet Washington’s demands to abandon uranium enrichment, the United States would launch a large-scale military campaign potentially aimed at "toppling the Tehran regime."
The US leader has not yet made a final decision regarding a potential attack on Iran, the newspaper noted. White House Spokeswoman Anna Kelly told The Wall Street Journal that "only President Trump knows what he may or may not do."
Earlier, Trump said he was giving a maximum of 15 days to reach an agreement with Iran.

Six of the eight people who died after a major avalanche swept through the Castle Peak area of the Sierra Nevada this week have been identified, according to multiple reports.
The identified victims – Carrie Atkin, Liz Clabaugh, Danielle Keatley, Kate Morse, Caroline Sekar and Kate Vitt – were part of a close-knit group who frequently went on ski trips together, a spokesperson for the families told the San Francisco Chronicle. The women and their families “cherished time together in the mountains”, the spokesperson said.
Tuesday’s avalanche, the deadliest in the region in modern times, killed eight people and left a ninth missing person presumed dead. Six others survived.
“We are devastated beyond words,” the families said in a statement to the Chronicle. “Our focus right now is supporting our children through this incredible tragedy and honoring the lives of these extraordinary women.”
Two sisters, Liz Clabaugh and Caroline Sekar, were among those killed, according to the New York Times. Their brother, McAlister Clabaugh, said he was devastated by the loss.
“These are two of the best people I’ve ever known,” he said. “They were incredible sisters, mothers, wives and friends. And the idea that they are both gone is, I don’t even know how to put it into words.”
He added that many in the group of 11 skiers had been close friends for years and regularly traveled together on ski trips. The avalanche struck as the group was returning to the trailhead after a multi-day backcountry trek.
Clabaugh worked as a labor and delivery nurse at St Luke’s Health System in Boise, Idaho, according to the Chronicle. Sekar worked as a technology consultant.
Sekar’s husband, Kiren Sekar, told the Times that his wife was “authentic and unabashedly unfiltered”. He said they had been together for more than two decades and that she loved hiking, bicycling and skiing.
Neighbors also recalled her generosity. According to the Chronicle, when one neighbor moved into the area, Sekar brought her homemade cookies. She also helped organize neighborhood produce pickups, group chats and block parties.
“Even when talking about a topic that could potentially be negative, she was positive,” neighbor Jen Wofford told the Bay Area outlet. “I never heard her say an unkind word about any person. She was always smiling, always polite, would do any little thing to help out a neighbor.”
The Kentfield school district in Marin county notified families on Wednesday that Vitt, the mother of two elementary school students, had died in the avalanche, the Times reports.
In their statement, families said the group “were experienced backcountry skiers who deeply respected the mountains” and were “trained and prepared for backcountry travel”.
Some of the victims had ties to Sugar Bowl Academy, an elite ski school that issued a statement mourning members of its extended community.
“We are an incredibly close and connected community,” Sugar Bowl Academy executive director Stephen McMahon said in the statement. “This tragedy has affected each and every one of us.”
Officials have not yet released the names of those who were killed.

'Grey's Anatomy' star Eric Dane dies at 53 after ALS battle
Eric Dane, an actor known for roles in "Grey’s Anatomy" and "Euphoria", died on Thursday at 53 from amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, his representatives said. Dane, who disclosed his diagnosis less than a year ago, spent his final days with family and became an advocate for ALS awareness in recent months.
Eric Dane, the celebrated actor best known for his roles on “Grey’s Anatomy” and “Euphoria” and who later in life became advocate for ALS awareness, died Thursday. He was 53.
His representatives said Dane died from amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, known also as Lou Gehrig’s disease, less than a year after he announced his diagnosis.
“He spent his final days surrounded by dear friends, his devoted wife, and his two beautiful daughters, Billie and Georgia, who were the center of his world,” said a statement that requested privacy for his family. “Throughout his journey with ALS, Eric became a passionate advocate for awareness and research, determined to make a difference for others facing the same fight. He will be deeply missed, and lovingly remembered always. Eric adored his fans and is forever grateful for the outpouring of love and support he’s received.”

Dane was born on November 9, 1972 and raised in California. His father, a Navy man, died of a gunshot wound when he was 7. After high school, he moved to Los Angeles to purse acting, landing guest roles on shows like “Saved by the Bell”, “Married...With Children”, “Charmed” and “X-Men: the Last Stand", and one season of the short-lived medical drama “Gideon's Crossing”.
His big break arrived in the mid-2000s, when he was cast as Dr. Mark Sloan, a.k.a. McSteamy, on the ABC medical drama “Grey’s Anatomy”, a role he would play from 2006 until 2012 and reprise in 2021. In 2019, he did a complete 180 and became Cal Jacobs, a troubled married man, in HBO's provocative drama, “Euphoria”, a role he continued in up until his death.
Dane also starred as Tom Chandler, the captain of a US Navy destroyer at sea after a global catastrophe wiped out most of the world’s population, in the TNT drama “The Last Ship”. In 2017, production was halted as Dane battled depression.
In April 2025, Dane announced he had been diagnosed with ALS, a progressive disease that attacks nerve cells controlling muscles throughout the body.
ALS gradually destroys the nerve cells and connections needed to walk, talk, speak and breathe. Most patients die within three to five years of a diagnosis.

Dane became an advocate for ALS awareness, speaking a news conference in Washington on health insurance prior authorisation. “Some of you may know me from TV shows, such as 'Grey's Anatomy', which I play a doctor. But I am here today to speak briefly as a patient battling ALS," he said in June 2025. In September of that year, the ALS Network named Dane the recipient of their advocate of the year award, recognizing his commitment to raising awareness and support for people living with ALS.
A memoir by Dane is scheduled to be published in 2026. “Book of Days: A Memoir in Moments” will be released by Maria Shriver’s The Open Field, a Penguin Random House imprint. According to Open Field, Dane will look back upon key moments in his life, from his first day at work on “Grey’s Anatomy” to the births of his two daughters and learning that he has ALS.
“I want to capture the moments that shaped me – the beautiful days, the hard ones, the ones I never took for granted – so that if nothing else, people who read it will remember what it means to live with heart," Dane said in a statement around the book's announcement. "If sharing this helps someone find meaning in their own days, then my story is worth telling.”

MOSCOW, February 20. /TASS/. A Ukrainian settlement would have already been achieved after the Russian-US summit in Alaska, but Europe prevented it, Russia’s former Prime Minister Sergey Stepashin said in an interview with TASS.
"[US President Donald] Trump understands [Russian President] Vladimir Putin perfectly well. There was a breakthrough in Alaska. If it hadn’t been for Europe, which has become completely brazen, I believe peace would have been achieved," he emphasized.
Putin and Trump met at Elmendorf-Richardson Air Force Base in Alaska on August 15, 2025. In a statement to the press following the talks, Putin said that the settlement of the Ukrainian conflict was the main topic of the summit. The Russian leader also called for a new chapter in bilateral relations and a return to cooperation, and invited Trump to Moscow.

Trump labor secretary’s husband barred from department over sexual assault allegations, reports say

The husband of Lori Chavez-DeRemer, Donald Trump’s labor secretary, has reportedly been barred from the labor department’s headquarters in Washington after at least two female staff members accused him of sexually assaulting them, the New York Times, Politico and the Wall Street Journal reported on Thursday.
The allegations against Shawn DeRemer come as Chavez-DeRemer is under fire over allegations of misconduct.
According to the reports, DeRemer is accused of touching two women inappropriately at the labor department’s main building, which is named for Frances Perkins, the first woman ever to serve in the US cabinet. One of the incidents reportedly took place during working hours in December, and according to the Times, was recorded via security cameras in the office. The footage has reportedly been reviewed as part of a criminal investigation into the incident.
A police report reviewed by the Guardian shows DC’s Metropolitan police department received a complaint on 24 January about an incident on 18 December at the labor department’s offices. “The complainant reported a sexual contact against her will,” reads the report. The MPD would not confirm the suspect’s name.
Politico, citing an unnamed source, said security staff at the Francis Perkins Building were instructed in late January to deny DeRemer entry.
In an interview with the Wall Street Journal, DeRemer denied the allegations. “I have not done any of this, and I categorically deny these things. I will absolutely, categorically fight everything in this,” he said.
The labor department did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
Chavez-DeRemer, a former congresswoman who lost her seat representing part of the Portland metro area in 2024, was nominated to Trump’s cabinet shortly after he won the election. Since then, she has faced several controversies of her own.
In January, a security officer assigned to protect the labor secretary was reportedly placed on leave as officials investigate an alleged romantic relationship between them.
Two of the secretary’s top aides were also placed on leave as the department’s inspector general reportedly investigated allegations that Chavez-DeRemer drank in her office during work hours and used taxpayer funds to pay for personal trips to destinations such as Las Vegas. One of those trips was allegedly with a staffer she was reportedly having an inappropriate relationship with.
The labor department and Chavez DeRemer’s attorney have denied the allegations.
A biography of the secretary on the department’s website says she “and her high school sweetheart, Dr Shawn DeRemer, founded an anesthesia management company and several medical clinics across the Pacific north-west”.

Trump says he's ordering release of data on UFOs and aliens

US President Donald Trump said on Thursday, February 19, he is ordering federal agencies to begin "identifying and releasing" government files related to UFOs and aliens, a move sought for decades by some Americans.
"Based on the tremendous interest shown, I will be directing the Secretary of War, and other relevant Departments and Agencies, to begin the process of identifying and releasing Government files related to alien and extraterrestrial life, unidentified aerial phenomena (UAP), and unidentified flying objects (UFOs)," Trump posted on his Truth Social platform.
While he did not specify whether classified documents would be released to the public, Trump added that the files should include "any and all other information connected to these highly complex, but extremely interesting and important, matters."
Earlier in the day the Republican president claimed that one of his Democratic predecessors, Barack Obama, had revealed "classified" information in his recent viral podcast remarks about the existence of extraterrestrial life.
"They're real, but I haven't seen them and they're not being kept in... Area 51," Obama told host Brian Tyler Cohen, referring to the top-secret US military facility in Nevada at the heart of many UFO conspiracy theories. "There's no underground facility. Unless, there's this enormous conspiracy and they hid it from the president of the United States."
'A big mistake'
Asked on Thursday about the comments, Trump told reporters that Obama "gave classified information, he is not supposed to be doing that." The president did not specify what part of Obama's remarks were classified, but claimed "he made a big mistake."
For his own beliefs about aliens, Trump, 79, said "I don't know if they are real or not." No evidence has been produced of intelligent life beyond Earth.
Interest in UFOs and UAP has been renewed in recent years as the US government probed numerous reports of seemingly supernatural aircraft, amid worries that adversaries could be testing highly advanced technologies.
In March 2024, the Pentagon released a report saying it had no proof that UAP were alien technology, with many suspicious sightings turning out to be merely weather balloons, spy planes, satellites and other normal activity.

Eric Dane: How the late Grey’s Anatomy star brought his heroic ALS fight to the screen
The Californian actor, who has died at age 53, never shied away from speaking out about his ALS diagnosis. Kevin E G Perry looks back at how he used a guest appearance on ‘Brilliant Minds’ to raise awareness of the motor neuron disease
- Bookmark
- CommentsGo to comments
In October 2025, Eric Dane found himself back on the set of a medical drama. For six seasons on Grey’s Anatomy, the San Francisco-born star had made hearts race as a doctor dubbed “McSteamy”. This time, in an emotionally-charged episode of Brilliant Minds, he was playing a patient.
Six months earlier, Dane, who has died Thursday at the age of 53, announced to the world that he had been diagnosed with ALS. Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, also known as motor neurone disease, is an incurable condition that affects nerve cells in the brain and spinal cord. It causes increasing muscle paralysis over time, and life expectancy varies widely. On average, those found to have the condition live for between two and five years. Some, such as the astrophysicist Stephen Hawking, have lived much longer.
Dane vowed that the condition would not stop him from acting. In Brilliant Minds, he played Matthew Ramati, a firefighter whose pride prevented him from revealing his own ALS diagnosis to his family. In one scene, Zachary Quinto’s Dr. Oliver Wolf advised Ramati about his treatment options and the first responder reacted badly to the idea of spending his last days hooked up to a machine. “What’s it matter? Nobody survives this,” he says. “We both know that, and I know how to take care of my family.”
In another powerful scene, Dane’s character recorded a message detailing how his thoughts about asking for help had changed. Afterwards, Brilliant Minds creator Michael Grassi recalled the show’s cast and crew giving the actor a 10-minute standing ovation.
“I have never seen this happen in my entire career... it was so beautiful and so honest and so real,” Grassi told USA Today. “Also, while his character’s finding bravery, there’s a lot of bravery in Eric to tell the story as well. To come out and share this part of yourself is vulnerable but also really important, and I think raises awareness and shows people that they’re not alone.”
Dane experienced tragedy early in his life. At the age of 7, while he was growing up in northern California, his father died from a self-inflicted gunshot wound. “He was a Navy man and ended up becoming an architect and interior designer. He was a troubled soul,” Dane told the Gulf Times in 2014. “My grandmother thinks [his death] was an accident. Everybody’s got a different opinion on it.”
At high school, Dane was a water polo player who fell in love with acting after appearing in a school production of the Arthur Miller play All My Sons. After moving to Los Angeles, he made his television debut in 1991 as volleyball player Tad on teen sitcom Saved by the Bell and worked steadily over the next decade with regular roles in Gideon's Crossing and Charmed.
It was Grey’s Anatomy, however, that made Dane a star. He was initially hired to play Dr. Mark Sloan for just one episode of the medical drama but he proved such a hit with audiences that turned into 140 episodes. His memorable appearance in the show’s third season, fresh from the shower wearing only a towel, helped cement his “McSteamy” nickname.
Dane left Grey’s in 2012, and from 2014 to 2018 led the Michael Bay-produced action series The Last Ship, about the crew of a Naval destroyer after a pandemic has wiped out most of the world’s population. He also had a key role in the HBO series Euphoria, playing the father of Jacob Elordi’s character.
He married fellow actor Rebecca Gayheart in 2004, and the couple had two daughters together. Gayheart filed for divorce in 2018 but later dismissed her petition in order to support Dane after his ALS diagnosis. In December 2025, Gayheart revealed that he required 24-hour medical care, and reflected that while the former couple’s “love may not be romantic... it’s a familial love.”
As well as using his appearance on Brilliant Minds to draw attention to ALS, Dane also became a spokesperson for a number of charities including the research foundation Target ALS. In January 2026, he was named Advocate of the Year by the ALS Network.
“Facing ALS myself, I know the challenges are real and relentless,” Dane said at the time. “But together, through advocacy, awareness, and action, we can move closer to a world without this disease.”

Venezuela passes amnesty law for political prisoners
February 20, 2026Venezuela's National Assembly, on Thursday, unanimously approved a proposed amnesty that could free hundreds of political prisoners jailed for being critical of the government.
The bill marks a landmark development for the South American nation that has spent decades denying holding political prisoners.
The change in policy comes after former President Nicolas Maduro was removed from power and kidnapped by the US military in a raid in the country's capital, Caracas, on January 3.
Acting President Delcy Rodriguez, who proposed the amnesty last month, signed the bill.
"One must know how to ask for forgiveness and one must also know how to receive forgiveness," she said at the Miraflores presidential palace in Caracas after signing the bill into law.
Who does the Venezuelan amnesty law cover?
Hundreds, perhaps thousands, of Venezuelans have been jailed for political reasons over the years.
About 450 prisoners have been released since Maduro was removed from power and before the amnesty bill was enacted, but more than 600 others remain behind bars, according to the NGO Foro Penal.
The bill is meant to provide amnesty for those detained over political protests and "violent actions" over the last few decades, including a brief coup in 2002 and during elections.
However, the law excludes those who have been prosecuted or convicted of promoting military action against the country, which could include opposition leaders such as Nobel Peace Prize winner Maria Corina Machado.
The current ruling party has accused her of calling for an international intervention to remove Maduro.
People involved in the 2019 military coup are also excluded from the amnesty.
"The scope of the law must be restricted to victims of human rights violations and expressly exclude those accused of serious human rights violations and crimes against humanity, including state, paramilitary and non-state actors," UN human rights experts said in a statement from Geneva on Thursday.
The law also does not return assets to those detained, revoke public office bans, or remove sanctions against media outlets.
As for those who have been living abroad to avoid detention, the law allows a lawyer to apply for amnesty. But the person would have to be present in Venezuela for amnesty to be awarded.
Moreover, they are required to have "ceased the execution of the actions which constitutes crimes."
"It's not perfect, but it's a great step forward," opposition lawmaker Nora Bracho said during the debate. "It will alleviate the suffering of many Venezuelans."

US pays about $160m towards nearly $4bn in UN dues
President Trump has slashed foreign aid and repeatedly criticised the United Nations for failing to meet its goals.
The United Nations announced that the United States has paid approximately $160m towards its nearly $4bn in outstanding dues.
The payment goes towards the UN’s regular operating budget, according to spokesman Stephane Dujarric.

But the shortfall comes as the administration of US President Donald Trump has openly questioned its commitment to the UN and has slashed money earmarked for the international body.
Still, on Thursday, Trump appeared to endorse funding the UN during the inaugural meeting of his Board of Peace in Washington, DC.
“We’re going to help them money-wise, and we’re going to make sure the United Nations is viable,” Trump said. “And I think it’s going to eventually live up to its potential. That will be a big day.”
The UN has indicated that the US owes about $2.196bn to its regular budget, including $767m for the current year. Another $1.8bn is owed for the UN’s peacekeeping operations.
A financial crisis
For years, the UN has faced a financial crisis, with a growing shortfall of contributions. Each of the organisation’s 193 member states is required to contribute, based on its economic ability.
Poorer countries could be asked to contribute as little as 0.001 percent of the UN’s regular budget. Wealthier countries could reach the maximum contribution amount of 22 percent.
But unpaid dues have already forced the UN to slash its spending and reduce its services.
In a stark warning last month, United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres cautioned that the international body faces an “imminent financial collapse” unless its financial rules are overhauled or all 193 member nations pay their dues.
Guterres revealed that the UN’s regular operating budget could be depleted as early as July, a scenario that would severely jeopardise its global operations.
The US is the largest donor to the UN, as the world’s largest economy. But it currently owes billions in unpaid dues.
UN officials have stated that the US accounts for approximately 95 percent of the arrears to the organisation’s regular budget.
‘Empty words’
Since returning to the White House for a second term in January 2025, Trump has elevated concerns that US dues might go unpaid.
The Republican leader has repeatedly criticised the UN as ineffective, even articulating that sentiment at September’s UN General Assembly.
“What is the purpose of the United Nations?” Trump asked the assembly. “All they seem to do is write a really strongly worded letter and then never follow that letter up. It’s empty words.”
Throughout his second term so far, he has cut foreign aid spending and withdrawn from international commitments. In January, for instance, his government pulled out of 31 UN programmes, including its democracy fund and a body that works on maternal and child health.
But on Thursday, at his Board of Peace meeting, Trump appeared to take a warmer stance towards the UN, saying he planned to work “very closely” with the organisation.
“Someday, I won’t be here. The United Nations will be,” he said, seeming to endorse its longevity.
Trump also acknowledged the organisation’s financial distress: “They need help, and they need help money-wise.” He did not mention the US arrears.
While the Board of Peace establishment was meant to oversee the Gaza ceasefire, many see it as an attempt by Trump to rival the UN Security Council’s role in preventing and ending conflicts around the world.
Critics have described the board, which Trump chairs, as a “parallel system” that risks undermining the UN’s authority and operations.
Trump himself appeared to position his Board of Peace as an oversight body for the UN in Thursday’s remarks.
The Board of Peace, he said, “is going to almost be looking over the United Nations and making sure it runs properly”.

He will be deeply missed, and lovingly remembered always. Eric adored his fans and is forever grateful for the outpouring of love and support he’s received. The family has asked for privacy as they navigate this impossible time.”
ALS, also known as motor neurone disease, is an incurable condition that affects nerve cells in the brain and spinal cord and causes increasing muscle paralysis over time.
Dane married fellow actor Rebecca Gayheart in October 2004, and they had two daughters together. Gayheart filed for divorce in 2018, citing "irreconcilable differences,” but called the proceedings off after Dane was diagnosed with ALS.
“We are best of friends. We are really close,” Gayheart said in April 2025. “We are great co-parents. I think it’s important to not look at a relationship that ends as a failure.”
“It wasn't a failure,” she continued. “It was a huge success. We were married for, I mean, we are still married, but together for 15 years, and we had two beautiful kids so I think that's a successful relationship, and that's how we look at it.”
Dane was born in San Francisco on November 9, 1972. At high school he was an athlete who played on the water polo team, but he discovered a love for acting when he was cast in a production of Arthur Miller's All My Sons.
He moved to Los Angeles and at the age of 19 landed his first television role on teen sitcom Saved By The Bell, playing Tad Pogue, a former boyfriend of Leah Remini's character Stacey Carosi.
Dane followed that appearance with small roles in The Wonder Years, Roseanne, and Married... with Children before he landed a recurring role in medical drama Gideon's Crossing in 2000. He then had a significant role as the newspaper owner Jason Dean in the fifth and sixth season of fantasy series Charmed.
He is perhaps best known for playing Dr. Mark Sloan in Grey’s Anatomy, a character nicknamed “McSteamy” who famously appeared in the show’s third season wearing only a towel. He had first been introduced in the second season and became a main cast member until his character was killed off in the ninth season.
His film roles included playing Multiple Man, one of the X-Men in 2006’s X-Men: The Last Stand, and appearing in the 2010 romantic comedy Valentine's Day.
Dane was introduced to a new audience in 2019 when he was cast in teen drama Euphoria as Cal Jacobs, a father hiding the fact that he is gay. In interviews, he discussed the awkwardness of wearing a prosthetic to simulate nudity.
In September 2025, Dane pulled out of presenting an award at the Emmys shortly before the ceremony. In a video statement shared later, he spoke out in support of the charity I Am ALS and their Push for Progress campaign to find the “fastest path to a cure.”
One of Dane’s final on-screen appearances came in November when he guest starred on the NBC medical drama Brilliant Minds.
He played Matthew Ramati, a firefighter struggling to share his ALS diagnosis with his family. The episode shone a light on some of the symptoms of the neurodegenerative disease, with Dane’s character losing the use of his hands and struggling to breathe hard into a tube.

Slovakia extends temporary protection for Ukrainians until 2027
That is according to SME.sk, Ukrinform reports.
Slovakia's Ministry of Interior said the decision was adopted in line with an implementing decision of the Council of the European Union. At the national level, the extension was formalized by a government decree dated February 21, 2025.
The validity of temporary protection can be checked via the ministry's online portal.
The ministry explained that after registration, individuals receive an A4-format paper confirmation. This document serves as a temporary residence certificate and is valid for up to 90 days while the residence card is being issued.
If an application for a residence card was not submitted during initial registration – for example, due to the absence of a delivery address – it can be filed later. In such cases, applicants must make a new appointment through the ministry's reservation system.
Temporary protection grants the right to reside in Slovakia, as well as access to healthcare, education, and the labor market.
Since March 2022, the European Union has offered shelter to more than four million displaced Ukrainians. Refugees from Ukraine will benefit from temporary protection in the EU until March 4, 2027.
Last September, the Council of the EU approved a common framework for displaced Ukrainians aimed at ensuring their sustainable return and reintegration into Ukraine when conditions permit, as well as a gradual transition to other residence statuses for those eligible.

Eric Dane, the actor known for memorable television roles in shows including Grey’s Anatomy and Euphoria, has died. He was 53.
Dane’s family provided a statement to People magazine announcing his death Thursday following what they called “a courageous battle with ALS,” the disease he revealed in April 2025 that he had been diagnosed with.
“With heavy hearts, we share that Eric Dane passed on Thursday afternoon following a courageous battle with ALS,” read the family’s statement to People. “He spent his final days surrounded by dear friends, his devoted wife, and his two beautiful daughters, Billie and Georgia, who were the center of his world.

‘Now he’s sweating’: what the papers say about the arrest of Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor

The ramifications of Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor’s relationship with convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein escalated dramatically on Thursday, with the former prince arrested on suspicion of misconduct in public office.
The arrest, related to allegations that Andrew shared confidential material with Epstein, is an unprecedented nadir for the modern monarchy.
Here is how UK newspapers responded to the news.
“King says ‘law must take its course’ after Andrew arrest,” is the splash on the Guardian, featuring a photograph of a stunned Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor leaving Aylsham police station on the day he was arrested on suspicion of misconduct in public office.
“The arrest of Andrew,” says the Times, summing up the dramatic development.
“Now he’s sweating,” quips the Sun, referencing a 2019 interview Andrew did with the BBC’s Newsnight in which he claimed he was not able to sweat due to a medical condition. Former prince Andrew, notes the paper, is the first royal to be held since Charles I in 1647.
“The law must take its course,” says the Daily Express, quoting a response from King Charles on the arrest of his brother on his 66th birthday.
“Taxi for Andy,” is the headline over at the Star, featuring the same photo of the former prince looking absolutely shellshocked in the backseat of a car as he is driven away from the police station after his arrest.
“King: my brother must face the law,” is the headline on the i paper on Thursday. King Charles, who said he had no advance warning of his brother’s arrest, issued a personal statement in support of British law enforcement.
“Downfall,” is the one word headline at the Daily Mail. The paper writes: “Looking haggard, shamed and haunted, Andrew is released from police custody 11 hours after his arrest plunged the modern monarchy into its gravest peril.”
As questions mount over what happens next, the National led its cover with a photograph of the late Queen, alongside then Prince Charles and Andrew beneath the probing headline: “What did they know?”.
Finally Scotland’s Daily Record with; “We can see you sneaking out.” And the Daily Telegraph (below) with the succinct splash: “Andrew arrested.”

Nancy Guthrie’s abduction highlights shared anguish between US, Israel - opinion

Nancy Guthrie has been missing for just over two weeks. Her whereabouts are unknown. Her state of health is also unknown. And the emotional state of the country is palpable, even from Israel. People all over the world wait with bated breath for every new detail.
On Feb. 1, 84-year-old Nancy Guthrie, Savannah Guthrie’s mother, was abducted from her home in the early morning hours. Since that fateful moment, nothing publicly verifiable has been heard of Guthrie’s condition beyond a ransom note. The message was cryptic and demanded an apparent staggering sum for her return.
The most troubling complication beyond the abduction itself is that Nancy Guthrie is dependent on a number of life-sustaining medications that she does not have with her. This raises serious concerns about her ability to survive this long without them.
Savannah, the co-anchor of NBC’s Today show, and her siblings have issued repeated heartfelt pleas that seem to have only fallen on deaf ears. Multiple ominous ultimatums have since passed, and the public is unaware of any other contact from the kidnappers.
The most significant piece of evidence is the video footage of the kidnapper collected from the Google security camera. The images show the masked individual attempting to obstruct the camera’s view with various objects from the yard.
Nancy Guthrie's abduction highlights sanctity of life worldwide
According to media reports, the FBI and local law enforcement don’t seem to be coordinating at an optimal level. There is history between Chris Nanos, the Pima County Sheriff, and the FBI’s Assistant Special Agent in Charge, Jon Edwards, that may be contributing to coordination challenges in the investigation.
This case has specific resonance for the Jewish community because we suffered the same angst for the last two years, multiplied by 250.
Israel is a small country. Whenever tragedy strikes, which is unfortunately too often, it touches so many who actually knew the victims or personally identify with them. Judaism isn’t just a religion; it’s a clan, one big family.
We always joke that we’re all related either because of our limited gene pool or because we all stood at Mount Sinai when the Torah was first given.
The impact of 250 individuals held in Hamas dungeons for over 800 days is yet to be fully understood. But the torture didn’t begin there. The return of the final hostage just months ago marked the first time in more than a decade that an Israeli wasn’t held hostage by a terrorist organization.
We longed for the return of our sons and daughters, mothers and fathers, and even our grandparents every day for years on end.
Now that this chapter in Israel’s history has finally come to a close, watching similar events unfold in America leaves us longing for similar outcomes for families like the Guthries. Jewish law dictates that, in most circumstances, we must do all we can to return the captured. That commitment has cost us dearly.
However, there’s another way to view this moral obligation; it defines us as a people who value life. We will stop at nothing to save a single individual. In watching the anguish gripping America, it has reinforced that both countries are cut from the same cloth. The unbreakable relationship between Israel and America stems from this sanctification of life. And it is not our weakness, it’s our greatest strength.
May Nancy Guthrie be returned safely to the waiting arms of her family, and may we all never know such pain again.

Trump claims Obama revealed classified information when he said aliens are real

US President Donald Trump said on Thursday he will direct Pentagon chief Pete Hegseth and other relevant agencies to begin identifying and releasing government files related to alien and extraterrestrial life, unidentified aerial phenomena (UAP), and unidentified flying objects (UFOs).
Donald Trump on Thursday accused former President Barack Obama of disclosing classified information when he recently said that aliens were real, but Trump did not cite any evidence to support the allegation.
"He took it out of classified information ... He’s not supposed to be doing that," Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One while traveling to Georgia. "He made a big mistake."
During an interview with podcast host Brian Tyler Cohen released on Saturday, Obama was asked if aliens are real.
"They're real, but I haven't seen them, and they're not being kept in ... Area 51. There's no underground facility unless there's this enormous conspiracy and they hid it from the president of the United States," Obama said.
Area 51 is a classified Air Force facility in Nevada that fringe theorists have speculated holds alien bodies and a crashed spaceship. CIA archives released in 2013 said it was a test site for top-secret spy planes.
No indication of classified information
There was no indication in his remarks that the former president relied on classified information.
“I saw no evidence during my presidency that extraterrestrials have made contact with us. Really!” Obama said in an Instagram post on Sunday.
In the post, Obama explained his belief that aliens exist by saying the statistical odds of life beyond Earth were high because the universe is so vast. He added that the chances of extraterrestrial life visiting Earth were low, given the distance.
On Thursday, Trump said, "I don’t know if they’re real or not" when asked whether he had seen evidence that aliens exist.
The White House said it had nothing to add to the president's comments. Obama's office did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
The Pentagon, in recent years, undertook a push to investigate reports of unidentified flying objects, and senior military leaders said in 2022 they found no evidence that aliens have visited Earth or crash-landed here.
A 2024 Pentagon report said US government investigations since the end of World War II have found no evidence of extraterrestrial technology, and most sightings were misidentified as ordinary objects and phenomena.

JFNA chief Eric Fingerhut outlines security demands ahead of State of Jewish Union

Speaking from Washington, DC, on Thursday, the president and CEO of the Jewish Federations of North America, Eric Fingerhut, laid out his assessment of the state of Jewish life in America.
“The state of the Jewish union in America is strong, but it is being tested,” said Fingerhut. “We are united in our commitment to America and to Jewish life, even as we worry about the real threats of violence and the growing acceptance of antisemitic rhetoric.”
During his remarks, which was billed as JFNA’s inaugural “State of the Jewish Union” address ahead of President Donald Trump’s State of the Union address next week, Fingerhut issued six recommendations to Congress, which centred on increasing security for Jewish communities.
They included providing federal support for security personnel, expanding FBI capabilities to counter domestic terrorism, increasing support for local and state law enforcement, prosecuting hate crimes aggressively and holding social media companies accountable for amplifying antisemitic rhetoric.
“Jewish children and teens are facing growing risks online, including antisemitic harassment, bullying and extremist content,” said Fingerhut. “We recognize the difficulty of legislating in this field, but states are moving forward, and it’s time for Congress to move forward as well.”
Fingerhut also called on Congress to increase funding for the Nonprofit Security Grant Program to $1 billion annually, and “make the program more flexible and simpler to use.” (This year, the program is requiring recipients to support federal immigration enforcement and avoid programs advancing diversity, raising concern among many Jewish groups, including JFNA.)
Rising antisemitism tests Jewish life in America
At the beginning of his address, Fingerhut also emphasized the ties between the American Jewish community and Israel, which have come under scrutiny since JFNA published a survey earlier this month, which found that only one-third of American Jews say they identify as Zionist.
“The focus of today’s talk will be about the state of Jews in America, but it is not possible to have that conversation without acknowledging and addressing the emotional, familial and religious connection between the American Jewish community and the people of Israel,” said Fingerhut.
Fingerhut’s remarks come shortly after Bret Stephens, the right-leaning Jewish New York Times columnist, argued during his 92NY’s annual “The State of World Jewry” speech that groups devoted to combating antisemitism, including the Anti-Defamation League, should abandon their strategy and instead focus on bolstering Jewish education and communal infrastructure.
During Fingerhut’s address, which largely centred on the security burdens placed on Jewish communities and concern for changes to social services funding, he also pivoted to a broader vision of Jewish life beyond the need for protection alone.
“It is important for the Congress to know that Jewish life is not only what we are protecting, but what we are building,” said Fingerhut. “It is Jewish education and Jewish experiences, but it is also human services, dignity and belonging.”

Iranian citizens' freedom may depend on cooperation with Israel, says PJAK commander

A free Iran may come from a cooperation between Iranians and Israel, said Peyman Vian, one of the most wanted women by Tehran authorities, in an interview with the Israeli journalist Itai Anghel, N12 reported on Thursday.
Vian is the commander of the Iranian-Kurdish PJAK, the fighters of the Kurdistan Free Life Party, an underground movement of Iranian exiles who operate against the Islamic regime. According to N12, they are the "most powerful" guerrilla force fighting against the Islamic Republic's current government.
Vian's dream is to expand protests in Iran and achieve freedom through the revolution, she told Anghel.
“Kurdish women have always been the ones standing at the forefront of the struggle for freedom throughout the Middle East, and they are now providing inspiration to women in Iran,” Vian added.
'For some of us to live, some of us must die'
Anghel met with a number of other Kurdish women fighters, who, he said, are integral to the fight.
“When the time comes, and everything is ready, we will attack the bases and the centers of the regime. We will return to our country, even to Tehran itself, to continue our struggle,” says Rovar, a company commander, in an interview with Anghel. She is one of the Iranian-Kurdish women PJAK fighters training to fight for the liberation of the Kurdish regions.
Those women decided to fight for their people's freedom, the Israeli journalist reported.
“For some of us to live, some of us must die. I will definitely fight and sacrifice myself if necessary,” said Govand, another one of the underground fighters.
'Where can I find justice for these tortures?'
In addition to the PJAK fighters, Anghel also met with a regime opponent who spoke openly about the torture he endured at the hands of the Revolutionary Guards.
Near the Iraq-Iran border, the Israeli journalist interviewed Jafar, a social activist who came to the Revolutionary Guards' radar years ago and was especially active during the 2022 “Women, Equality, Freedom” protests, according to N12.
“We transferred medicines to the wounded, provided shelter for the injured, and also sent money to prisoners they refused to release. The intelligence services summoned me again and again and tortured me,” said the activist.
Jafar said that he had to hide the fact that he had been raped by three men, who beat the activist and filmed the sexual assault.
"Where can I find justice for these tortures?” he asked.

The silent crisis facing Malaysian women stranded in Indonesia
Trapped by financial woes after marrying local men in Lombok, many Malaysian women struggle to return home
Reading Time:1 minute
Why you can trust SCMP
The 18-year ordeal of Norida Akmal Ayob, 45, has cast a spotlight on a silent crisis: an unknown number of Malaysian women remain stranded in “dire straits” across Indonesia, unable to afford the journey home.
According to Kosmo, many of these women share a similar trajectory – falling into financial ruin after marrying local men in Lombok and finding themselves trapped by the high costs of returning home.
“Money remains the main factor, as earning is difficult. My children and I were at the mercy of locals to get by,” Norida said from her hometown of Kampung Bukit Sapit in Lenggong, Malaysia’s Perak state.

Norida’s own journey began nearly two decades ago when she moved to Lombok with her then two-year-old daughter, Nur Fateen Akmadiana.
After her husband divorced her, she was left to fend for herself, working as a sweeper to survive.

While she eventually gave birth to a son, Muhamad Sabani Daniel, in Indonesia, the prospect of returning to Malaysia remained a distant dream due to the expense.

ROSTOV-ON-DON, February 20. /TASS/. Andrea Lucidi, editor-in-chief of the Italian office of International Reporters and Russian passport holder, who was detained in Istanbul, was planning to work there as part of a delegation gathering information on Turkish isolation prisons, International Reporters’ editor-in-chief Viktoriya Smorodina told TASS.
"The editor-in-chief of the Italian office of International Reporters, Andrea Lucidi, was detained this morning in Istanbul. He was placed in a center for refugees and immigrants. Neither he nor his lawyers have been informed of the reason for his detention. There is currently no contact with him. Andrea arrived as part of an international delegation investigating Turkey's S-, R-, and Y-type isolation prisons," Smorodina said.
She noted that this was the second time of one of their journalists had been detained in the past six months.
Earlier, the Corriere della Sera newspaper reported that the Italian journalist had been apprehended in Istanbul. Lucidi has worked in Donbass and holds Russian citizenship, which he received a year ago.
Since 2022, Lucidi has been residing permanently in Russia, covering the course of the special military operation. On November 10, 2024, he submitted a request to President Vladimir Putin for Russian citizenship due to persecution in his home country, and was granted it on January 29, 2025.

North Korea’s Kim Jong Un launches key party congress held every 5 years
Kim focuses on improving economic activity in opening speech at Ninth Congress of the Workers’ Party of Korea.
North Korea has kicked off a rare party congress of the ruling Workers’ Party, held once every five years, that will see the leadership in Pyongyang set major policy goals in defence, diplomacy and the economy, state media reports.
The Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) said on Friday that the Ninth Congress of the Workers’ Party of Korea (WPK) was under way, marking the start of the country’s most consequential political event since 2021.

“The Ninth Congress of the WPK opened with splendour in Pyongyang, the capital city of the revolution,” KCNA said, reporting that the high-level meeting started on Thursday and observers say it is expected to run for several days.
South Korea’s official Yonhap News Agency said the gathering will be closely followed for any signs regarding North Korea’s development of nuclear weapons or overtures towards the administrations in Seoul and the United States, which the North considers its chief foes.
Yonhap reports that North Korea’s leader, Kim Jong Un, made no mention of relations with either South Korea or the US in his opening speech to the congress on Thursday and, instead, focused on boosting the country’s economy.
“Ahead of our party are heavy and urgent tasks of advancing economic development and improving people’s livelihoods, and transforming all aspects of social life in the country as quickly as possible,” Kim said, according to KCNA.
While the true state of North Korea’s often struggling economy is hard to gauge, The Associated Press news agency reports that outside experts suggest the country has seen a gradual recovery in economic activity, helped by a post-COVID boost in trade with China and the export of weapons to help Russia in its war against Ukraine.
Several thousand North Korean troops have fought on Moscow’s side against Ukraine, and Pyongyang is believed to have exported large amounts of ammunition to help the Russian invasion of its neighbour.
North Korea’s ‘biggest enemy’
South Korea’s spy agency said last week it was monitoring the congress for any sign that Kim will officially designate his teenage daughter, Kim Ju Ae, as his potential successor, formalising her position as heir apparent in a fourth-generation succession of the Kim family as North Korea’s leaders.
At the previous party congress five years ago, Kim declared that the US was his nation’s “biggest enemy”, and there is deep interest in whether the North Korean leader will soften his rhetoric – or double down – at this year’s congress, particularly amid the US presidency of Donald Trump.
Trump – who met Kim in 2019 when he briefly stepped foot into North Korea to shake Kim’s hand and pose for photos – said during a tour of Asia late last year that he was “100 percent” open to meeting Kim again.
So far, Kim has demurred on Trump’s overtures to meet again.
Observers of North Korean politics are reported to be scouring satellite imagery for any signs of the vast military parades that have accompanied previous congress meetings in Pyongyang.
Such parades will be closely watched for signs of a shift in North Korea’s weapons capabilities, as the country has used previous processions to show off its newest and most advanced weapons.
Kim held a ceremony on Thursday to unveil the deployment of 50 new launch vehicles for nuclear-capable short-range missiles as the congress kicked off.
According to Yonhap, the congress brings together some 5,000 party representatives from across the country, including 200 senior officials from the WPK’s headquarters. More than 4,700 officials from regional and industrial sectors are also in attendance.

Club stabbing accused asks for time to prepare defence
A kitchenhand accused of stalking and repeatedly stabbing a waitress at a busy leagues club in front of shocked customers has finally fronted court.
Cameron William Leslie Clark, 33, on Friday appeared by video link in Brisbane Magistrates Court charged with the attempted murder of 20-year-old colleague Zoe Samson-Wood.
He is accused of slashing Samson-Wood and two others with a large carving knife at Brisbane’s Easts Leagues Club before being overpowered by patrons and staff on February 12.
Two earlier scheduled appearances were adjourned due to the accused undergoing medical treatment after police said he suffered a hand wound in the incident.
Four supporters of Samson-Wood were in the gallery for the brief hearing before declining to comment outside court.
Legal Aid lawyers have been unable to speak with Clark since his arrest and did not know he had been released from the hospital, the court was told.
Clark did not apply for bail and asked for more time to seek legal advice.
“I’d like to adjourn it so I can prepare a little bit better,” he told the court.
Clark was excluded from the leagues club about 2pm on the day of the alleged attack over complaints of “unwanted and unsolicited attention” to the waitress, police said.
About three hours later, he allegedly arrived at the club with the knife and attacked Samson-Wood as dozens of people were dining.
“She was confronted in a hallway where she had little chance to escape,” Detective Superintendent Andrew Massingham told reporters.
A 61-year-old chef at the leagues club – identified in court documents as Craig Geddes – came to her aid and was stabbed in the hip.
It gave Samson-Wood time to escape to the main dining area where patrons and staff helped her, police said.
Clark allegedly attacked her again in the busy dining area, inflicting defensive wounds to her hands and 10-centimetre cuts to her head and wrist.
Her sister, Ruby Samson-Wood, said her sibling was stabbed 15 times but put up a “hell of a fight”.
She said Samson-Wood had suffered nerve damage and would require reconstructive surgery.
A 41-year-old female patron suffered a hand laceration as up to eight people overpowered Clark, holding him down until police arrived minutes later.
Samson-Wood’s sister later paid tribute to the good Samaritans on social media.
“Thank you to anyone who helped, even if it gave Zoe an extra millisecond to get away, you saved her life,” she wrote on Instagram.
Clark was also charged with stalking, acts intended to cause grievous bodily harm, unlawful wounding and going armed to cause fear.
After a brief hearing, he was remanded in custody to appear in court on March 16.

'Paradoxically, the French economy is experiencing a renewed sense of optimism'

The uncertainty that weighed on the French economy following the dissolution of the Assemblée Nationale in June 2024 – which paralyzed business leaders and intimidated investors – appears to be behind us. Since the start of 2026, a slight but real wind of optimism has emerged in the services and construction sectors, where sustained activity is expected, as well as in aerospace and defense, where order books are full. The electrical and electronics industries anticipate benefiting both from the rise of artificial intelligence – which requires massive infrastructure such as data centers – and from the momentum of decarbonization.
Investments are also showing a modest increase. One sign: In Dunkirk on February 10, work began on the construction of the Taiwanese company ProLogium's giant battery factory for electric vehicles – an investment of €5.2 billion. Even consumers seem to be regaining confidence: Purchases began to rise again at the start of the year, and spending on services, tourism, restaurants and leisure remains robust.
Yet the overall context has not radically changed. After months of debate, France has adopted a budget for 2026 that fails to address any of the country's fundamental problems, neither aging, nor pensions and social accounts, nor the level of public spending. US President Donald Trump, more unpredictable than ever, continues to alternate between hot and cold signals. China has taken advantage of the relative decline of American power to push its "low-cost" advantage further into European markets. As for Russia, it has maintained its grip on the war in Ukraine. In short, nothing truly invites great optimism.
According to French business executive Marie Guillemot, the chair of the management board at audit and consulting firm KPMG, uncertainty loses its power when it drags on. "Many of our clients adapted to the succession of shocks we experienced in 2025," she explained. "Executives are confident in their own company's ability to overcome them. They are working on innovation, finding new markets and striving to reduce their exposure to risks." Thus, paradoxically, the French economy is experiencing a renewed sense of optimism. The unknown, in a way, has become just another adjustment parameter – like the cost of capital or market size – that business leaders incorporate into their strategic plans.

Trump orders agencies to identify and release government files on 'aliens'

US President Donald Trump has said he will direct the Pentagon and other relevant agencies to begin identifying and releasing government files related to alien and extraterrestrial life, as well as unidentified aerial phenomena and unidentified flying objects.
Speaking on Thursday, Trump said he would instruct Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth and other agencies to "begin the process of identifying and releasing Government files related to alien and extraterrestrial life, unidentified aerial phenomena (UAP), and unidentified flying objects (UFOs)."
In a post on Truth Social, he said the move was being made "based on the tremendous interest shown."
The announcement follows a recent podcast interview in which former President Barack Obama said that aliens were “real”.
Obama later clarified that he meant "the odds are good there's life out there," and that he saw "no evidence" of aliens while president.
Asked about Obama's remarks, Trump said the former president had given classified information.
"He's not supposed to be doing that," Trump added.
In 2024, after a congressional hearing on unidentified aerial phenomena in which officials called for greater transparency, the Pentagon said it had received hundreds of reports.
Of those, 21 merited "further analysis" because of "anomalous characteristics and/or behaviours."
However, the Pentagon said it had found no evidence of extraterrestrial activity.

Twelve or 16? Extent of age limit for e-bike riders under scrutiny

Twelve or 16? Extent of age limit for e-bike riders under scrutiny
E-bike riders will have to be at least 12 years old to use them, as part of a bid to crack down on unruly behaviour, although existing owners of high-powered bikes will have a three-year grace period before tougher standards are enforced.
The NSW government is considering raising the age limit for e-bike riders to as old as 16, although Transport Minister John Graham said he wanted time to decide exactly what it should be, and “whether it should be 12 or 16”.
“It’s not a simple call, and it’s one that we’ve got to make, not just for Sydney, but for all of NSW,” he said, adding that a higher age limit might be a concern in regional areas where teenagers used e-bikes to get to school.
A review led by Transport for NSW will recommend a legal minimum age between 12 and 16 for riding an e-bike in the state, while considering whether children and teenagers have the skills, maturity and awareness of potential dangers required to safely carry passengers.
Advice and findings will be provided to Graham and Roads Minister Jenny Aitchison by June, and the government will make a final decision on an age limit and passengers.
“At the moment, it’s legal for a primary school kid with no peripheral vision who can barely lift one of these bikes to ride it on NSW streets. We want that to change,” Graham said. “It’s simply dangerous to have kids as young as 10 or 11 on these high-powered bikes.”
The government will also adopt a European safety and performance standard – known as EN15194 – to ensure e-bikes are like bicycles, and that high-powered, illegal motorbikes masquerading as e-bikes are pulled from roads and footpaths.
However, a three-year transition period will be applied given that many e-bikes were purchased legally under a rule change several years ago which increased the allowable power from 250 watts to 500 watts. While NSW will adopt the European standard next month, it will not be enforced on e-bikes that fail to meet it until March 2029.
Bicycle NSW chief executive Peter McLean said it was the “gold standard” for e-bikes across the world, making them safe and high quality. “It’s safe for the riders, and it is safe for all road users, including, of course, pedestrians,” he said.
An advocacy body for retailers and wholesalers said the European standard had an anti-tampering clause, which required manufacturers to take all necessary steps to prevent modifications to e-bikes.
“It’s going to make sure that these bikes that are compliant cannot be adapted to or modified to a greater speed or a greater power,” Bicycle Industries Australia director Mark Eedle said.
Under the European standard, e-bikes must have a maximum power output of 250 watts and power assistance must cut out at 25 kilometres an hour. No power assistance is delivered at all after 6km/h if a rider is not pedalling the bike.
Coalition transport spokeswoman Natalie Ward said the government’s latest plans for e-bikes did not answer the question of how behaviour would be enforced.
“Until you enforce the rules and have accountability, nothing will change. Police need a clear tool for enforcement of rider behaviour,” she said, citing the opposition’s proposal for an e-bike licence plate registration.
The government has faced increasing pressure to crack down on the proliferation of high-powered e-bikes on Sydney streets after mass ride-outs which resulted in young riders taking over roads and golf courses.
Two weeks ago, Graham announced that police will be given new powers to seize and crush illegal e-bikes that breach legal limits after roadside testing.

Where on the northside needs more buses? Commuters have their say, with review planned
New bus routes to surrounding suburbs and more frequent city services are wanted by public transport passengers in Chermside.
This masthead spoke to commuters as the Brisbane City Council recommitted this week to a promised review of the transport network.
Commuters said while public transport was largely effective in the city’s northside, there was room for improvement, which a review could deliver.
“I would say more buses are probably needed in the outer suburbs around Nundah and places like that, and probably even more services here at Chermside to the CBD,” said Matilda, who frequently used the 333, 340 and 330 services.
“There’s basically nothing after 9 o’clock at night and if people want to go into the city … it’s very limited and they’re just not frequent.”
Fellow commuters John and Sara echoed the concerns about access to nearby suburbs, while another passenger, Sonia, agreed more buses into the city would be beneficial.
All stressed the importance of expanding Metro services.
“It works pretty well … it can be a bit of a hassle, but that’s life,” said another commuter, Robin.
“Of course some buses are going to be late, that’s just the council for you.”
A northside bus review was announced in July 2024 as part of a multimillion-dollar funding agreement with the state government.
That evaluation would have explored where improved services were needed, as a southside review had done.
LNP councillor Steve Toomey suggested on Tuesday the promised review was no longer being done after a new government agreement was signed, but he later clarified an equivalent review would be done, alongside future Metro expansion.
“The existing agreement doesn’t include a deadline for a review, however, a review will be undertaken,” a council spokesperson said.
“We also continue to undertake ongoing analysis and improvements of the bus network in collaboration with the state government.”
The Labor opposition questioned if this review would be completed before the 2032 Olympic Games.
“How can the lord mayor of Brisbane sit in the back of a chauffeur-driven car and think congestion will sort itself out?” leader Jared Cassidy said.
“Where is his leadership? Why isn’t he bashing down the door of the state government?”
Brisbane City Council rolled out its New Bus Network in June.
Most trips have become quicker or been unchanged, but about 15 per cent are slower than previously.
Several groups have complained about increased travel times and longer walks to bus stops – though the highest-profile cases have been on the southside.
Karen Smith, who relied on the 175 service to reach the Mater Hospital for cancer treatment at the time, found she required an additional bus change mid-journey.
“What if you don’t meet up with the [second] bus … you could miss your appointment,” she said.
“I’m going through treatment and my balance is not good, so having to get off and on is not going to be good.”
In January a group of residents in Acacia Ridge raised concerns about a “ghost stop” on Gregory Street, where buses no longer stopped.
“No one takes it seriously because we’re regarded as a low-income area,” Sandra said at the time.
“It’s like [they think] rejects live out here or misfits, and I feel that we’re personally being discriminated against because of our postcode, because we’re a lower-class people.”

As European heads roll from Epstein links, US fallout muted

Heads roll in Europe over Epstein files while US justice declines to act
The arrest of Britain’s former prince Andrew underscored the stark contrast between Europe's response to the Epstein files and that of the United States, where only Ghislaine Maxwell is facing justice for her links to the convicted sex offender. Members of Congress from both parties have called for more accountability. "Now we need justice in the United States," said one lawmaker.
The arrest of former prince Andrew has underlined the striking contrast between Europe, where high-profile, powerful people are being held to account over their links to Jeffrey Epstein, and the United States, where the fallout has been limited.
Only one person has been arrested or convicted in the United States in connection with the activities of the late sex offender – Ghislaine Maxwell, Epstein's ex-girlfriend and accomplice.
Maxwell is serving a 20-year prison sentence after being found guilty in 2021 of providing minor girls to the wealthy financier, who died in a New York jail cell in 2019 while awaiting trial for sex trafficking.

Epstein cultivated a global network of powerful politicians, business executives, academics and celebrities – many of whom have been tainted by their association with him.
A number of prominent Americans – from former president Bill Clinton to Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates – have had their reputations damaged by their friendships with Epstein, but no one other than Maxwell has faced legal consequences.
And a top US Justice Department official suggested recently that no prosecutions may be forthcoming.
"In July the Department of Justice said that we had reviewed the quote Epstein files and there was nothing in there that allowed us to prosecute anybody," Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche told CNN.
"And that's where we remain for what we've seen and what we've released from the Epstein files," said Blanche, who is also President Donald Trump's former personal attorney.
That explanation has not satisfied a number of US lawmakers, both Republicans and Democrats, who accuse the Trump Justice Department of dragging its feet.
"The UK has officially done more to prosecute Epstein predators than our own government. Shameful," Representative Nancy Mace, a Republican from South Carolina, said on X.
"A nation that allows the powerful to escape justice is not a nation of laws," Mace said. "It is a nation of exceptions. And the exceptions always seem to apply to the same people."
Another Republican lawmaker, Thomas Massie of Kentucky, welcomed Andrew's arrest but said "now we need justice in the United States".
"It's time for @AGPamBondi and @FBIDirectorKash to act!" Massie said on X, referring to Attorney General Pam Bondi and FBI Director Kash Patel.
Epstein files lower trust
Senator Ruben Gallego, an Arizona Democrat, blamed the lack of accountability in the United States squarely on Trump, who was once a close friend of Epstein and moved in the same social circles in Florida and New York.
"Countries across the world are holding their Epstein class accountable," Gallego said on X. "It isn't happening in America because we have a pedo protector in the Oval Office running a government coverup for him and his friends."
Trump fought for months to prevent release of the Epstein files but eventually signed the law passed by Congress requiring their publication. The 79-year-old Republican's name appears in the files repeatedly but he has not been charged with any wrongdoing.
Trump's right-wing base has long been obsessed with the Epstein saga, and the belief the financier oversaw a sex trafficking ring for the world's elite.
Trump was asked Thursday if any Epstein associates in the United States will "wind up in handcuffs".
The president sidestepped the question, reiterating his claim that he personally has been "totally exonerated". He called Andrew's arrest a "very sad thing".

A Reuters/Ipsos poll published this week found a majority of Americans – 53 percent – say the Epstein files have "lowered their trust in the country's political and business leaders".
Sixty-nine percent told pollsters the Epstein files "show that powerful people in the US are rarely held accountable for their actions".
While there have been no prosecutions beyond Maxwell, several prominent Americans have resigned from high-profile positions after the files revealed they maintained relations with Epstein after his 2008 conviction for sex offenses.
Former US treasury secretary Larry Summers resigned from the board of the OpenAI foundation, and billionaire Thomas Pritzker left the executive chairmanship of Hyatt hotels.
Goldman Sachs announced last week that general counsel, Kathryn Ruemmler, a White House lawyer under president Barack Obama, would leave the Wall Street bank at the end of June.

Trump orders government agencies to release all UFO and alien files

President Donald Trump said Thursday he is directing the Pentagon and other government agencies to identify and release files related to extraterrestrials and UFOs, citing “tremendous interest.”
Trump made the announcement in a social media post hours after accusing former President Barack Obama of disclosing “classified information” when Obama suggested in a recent podcast interview that alien life could exist.
Speaking to reporters aboard Air Force One, Trump said, “I don’t know if they’re real or not,” and added of Obama, “I may get him out of trouble by declassifying.”
In a post on his social media platform Thursday night, Trump said he was directing agencies to release files related “to alien and extraterrestrial life, unidentified aerial phenomena (UAP), and unidentified flying objects (UFOs), and any and all other information connected to these highly complex, but extremely interesting and important, matters.”
Obama, who made his comments during a podcast appearance over the weekend, later clarified that he had not seen evidence that aliens “have made contact with us,” but said “statistically, the universe is so vast that the odds are good there’s life out there.”
Trump told reporters Thursday that regarding the prospect of extraterrestrial visitors, “I don’t have an opinion on it. I never talk about it. A lot of people do. A lot of people believe it.”
Trump’s daughter-in-law, Lara Trump, said this week on a podcast that the president had prepared a speech about aliens that he would deliver at the “right time.” The White House appeared unaware of such plans. Press secretary Karoline Leavitt laughed when asked about it Wednesday and said, “A speech on aliens would be news to me.”
Public interest in UFOs and the possibility of government secrecy resurfaced in 2017 after former Pentagon and government officials provided Navy videos of unidentified objects to The New York Times and Politico. The renewed scrutiny led Congress to hold its first UFO hearings in 50 years in May 2022. Officials later said the objects, which appeared as green triangles above a Navy ship, were likely drones.
Since then, the Pentagon has pledged greater transparency. In July 2022, it established the All-domain Anomaly Resolution Office, or AARO, to centralize reports of military encounters with unidentified aerial phenomena, replacing an earlier task force.
In 2023, then-AARO director Dr. Sean Kirkpatrick told reporters he had seen no evidence “of any program having ever existed to do any sort of reverse engineering of any sort of extraterrestrial unidentified aerial phenomena.”
Public reports show that while many military UFO sightings remain unexplained, identified cases are largely benign.
An 18-page unclassified report submitted to Congress in June 2024 said service members filed 485 reports of unidentified phenomena over the previous year. Of those, 118 were determined to involve “prosaic objects such as various types of balloons, birds, and unmanned aerial systems.”
“It is important to underscore that, to date, AARO has discovered no evidence of extraterrestrial beings, activity, or technology,” the report said.

Indonesia's president reaches a trade deal with US while in Washington for Trump's Board of Peace

Indonesia seals ‘great’ US trade deal and pledges 8,000 troops for Gaza
Deal struck during president Prabowo Subianto’s Washington visit slashes US tariffs from 32% to 19%
- Bookmark
The White House announced a reciprocal trade agreement with Indonesia on Thursday while president Prabowo Subianto was in Washington to attend the first meeting of US president Donald Trump’s Board of Peace.
Under the agreement, Southeast Asia’s largest economy will eliminate tariffs for 99 per cent of American goods while the US would maintain tariffs on most Indonesian goods at 19 per cent, the White House said. That is the same rate the US has set for Cambodia and Malaysia. Indonesia also agreed to address non-tariff barriers to US goods and to remove restrictions on exports to the US for critical minerals and other industrial commodities, the White House said.
Indonesian and US companies also reached 11 deals this week worth $38.4bn, including purchases of US soybeans, corn, cotton and wheat, cooperation in critical minerals and oil field recovery, and joint ventures in computer chips.
“We have negotiated very intensively over the last few months, and I think we have reached solid understandings on many issues,” Mr Prabowo told business executives on Wednesday at the US Chamber of Commerce.
A White House statement called it a “great deal” and said it “will help both countries to strengthen economic security, promote economic growth, and thereby continuously lead to global prosperity”.
The agreement was later signed by representatives of Indonesia and US Trade Representative Jamieson Greer.
Indonesia’s pledge for Gaza stabilisation force
The agreement was announced the same day that Mr Prabowo, leader of the world’s most populous Muslim country, reiterated his pledge at the Board of Peace meeting to send 8,000 troops or “more if necessary” for an international stabilisation force in Gaza.
Indonesia was among the first to make a firm commitment to a critical element of Trump’s postwar Gaza reconstruction plan.
“President Prabowo of Indonesia, thank you very much,” Mr Trump said at the Board of Peace meeting. “It’s a big country you have, and you do a great job.”
Mr Prabowo praised Mr Trump in return. “We are very optimistic with the leadership of President Trump, this vision of real peace will be achieved,” Mr Prabowo said. “There will be problems, but we will prevail.”
Cambodia and Vietnam are the two other Southeast Asian countries that joined the board, which was originally envisioned as overseeing the Gaza ceasefire but has taken shape with wider ambitions to broker other global conflicts.
Their leaders also came to Washington for the inaugural meeting. Cambodia has already inked a trade deal with the US, while Vietnam has reached a framework agreement.
Critical minerals play into Indonesia deal
Indonesian companies agreed this week to buy 1 million tons of soybeans, 1.6 million tons of corn and 93,000 tons of cotton from the US. They also pledged to buy up to 5 million tons of US wheat by 2030.
The countries agreed to cooperate on critical minerals, though details were not immediately available.
Washington is seeking Indonesia’s agreement to lift restrictions on critical mineral exports, which the Trump administration argues could safeguard US manufacturers from supply‑chain disruptions. The administration has sought to defend against China’s stranglehold on the key elements needed for everything from fighter jets to smartphones.
At the Chamber of Commerce event, Mr Prabowo said Indonesia can serve as a “bridge” and “honest broker” between great powers, apparently referring to the US-China competition.
Vietnam’s leader makes first visit to the US since being reelected
At the Board of Peace meeting, Mr Trump called Vietnam “incredible as a country and as a force” and told leader To Lam that it was “a really great honour to have you”.
Mr Lam’s visit to the US is his first since he was reelected as the head of Vietnam’s ruling Communist Party last month. Typically, China is an initial stop in a nod to the countries’ ideological ties and Beijing’s status as Vietnam’s largest trading partner. Mr Lam visited China in August 2024 before travelling to the US during his first term.
Analysts say Mr Lam’s visit to the US before travelling to Beijing this time around is a notable shift in sequencing. Hanoi describes its foreign policy as independent and balanced among major powers.
Trade negotiations between Vietnam and the United States are ongoing following the Trump administration levying 20 per cent tariffs on Vietnamese exports. The latest, sixth round of talks concluded in early February.

Zenith tightens grip on WA gold play with savvy land grab
Brought to you by BULLS N’ BEARS
Zenith Minerals has kicked its exploration momentum up another gear, snapping up a key neighbouring mining lease beside its Consolidated Dulcie gold project in Western Australia.
Hot on the heels of a barnstorming resource upgrade yesterday to 675,000 ounces grading one gram per tonne (g/t) gold, the company has quickly upped the ante again by locking in one of the most strategic mining leases in the Southern Cross-Forrestania belt. The deal secures a prized piece of ground that neatly completes the puzzle for Zenith’s future development plans at Dulcie.
Mining Lease M77/599 sits adjacent to the company’s 300,000-ounce Dulcie Far North deposit and its newly categorised Dulcie and Dulcie North deposits to the south, which collectively host 375,000 ounces of inferred gold resources. Notably, the new lease lies directly in line with Zenith’s existing grounds and gives the gold explorer a further six kilometres of chunky gold-bearing strike.
The acquisition will cost Zenith $1.5 million in cash, including a $50,000 non-refundable deposit, plus a two per cent net smelter return royalty over minerals produced from the tenement once commercial production begins.
‘Securing M77/599 is a logical and disciplined step in consolidating our position within the broader gold system.’Zenith Minerals managing director Andrew Smith
What really sweetens the deal, though, is the new lease lies in a central position to Dulcie’s emerging geology. Zenith believes the mineralisation is taking the shape of a textbook stacked lode system, with more than 10 individual gold lodes now defined within a broad, gently dipping shear zone.
Rather than a single narrow vein, the gold is distributed across multiple sub-parallel horizons, giving the project both scale and continuity – and M77/599 sits smack bang in the middle of the structure.
This style of mineralisation is well suited to open-pit mining, particularly as many of the lodes sit close to surface and remain open along strike and down dip.
The timing of Zenith’s latest move could hardly be better. With a consolidated resource now in hand, pulling M77/599 into the fold cleans up boundary complexities. It also adds valuable flexibility as the company begins weighing up staged open-pit mining and potential toll-treatment routes.
Just as importantly, the cleaner tenure allows the company to zero in on mine design, fine-tune pit shells and put the economics through their paces without the usual distractions of fragmented ground.
The Dulcie project conveniently sits within trucking distance of established processing hubs, including the Marvel Loch processing plant, giving Zenith multiple low-capex pathways should it decide to move towards production. That optionality is proving gold dust for juniors in a market increasingly rewarding projects that can be brought online quickly and cheaply.
Zenith Minerals managing director Andrew Smith said: “Securing M77/599 is a logical and disciplined step in consolidating our position within the broader gold system. M77/599 carries legacy royalty arrangements, which are well understood and have been incorporated into our development assessment.”
The next steps are largely procedural, with ministerial approvals and royalty-related conditions to be ticked off ahead of settlement. Once complete, Zenith is set to emerge with a cleaner, more cohesive land position over one of its most advanced gold assets.
With gold prices hovering near record highs and appetite growing for capital-light development stories, Zenith’s tightened grip on Dulcie looks like a rolled-gold opportunity.
As scoping studies progress and development options crystallise, the company’s methodical consolidation strategy may be laying the groundwork for Dulcie’s next phase as a genuine Western Australian gold development contender.

Russia-Ukraine war: List of key events, day 1,457
These are the key developments from day 1,457 of Russia’s war on Ukraine.
Published On 20 Feb 2026
Here is where things stand on Friday, February 20:
Fighting
- Russian forces launched 448 attacks on 34 settlements in Ukraine’s front-line Zaporizhia region in a single day, injuring a six-year-old child and damaging homes, cars and other infrastructure, regional governor Ivan Fedorov wrote on the Telegram app.
- Russian drone, missile and artillery attacks on Ukraine’s Kherson region injured five people and damaged homes, including seven high-rise buildings, the local military administration said on Telegram.
- Russian attacks also continued in Ukraine’s Dnipropetrovsk and Sumy regions, but local officials there noted that “fortunately, no people were injured”. According to the Kyiv Independent news outlet, overnight was “unusually quiet” following weeks of “heavy fire” in the two regions.
- A man was killed by shrapnel from a Ukrainian drone attack on Sevastopol, in Russian-occupied Crimea, Governor Mikhail Razvozhayev said on Telegram.
- A Ukrainian drone attack caused a fire at an oil depot in Velikiye Luki in Russia’s Pskov region, local official Mikhail Vedernikov said, according to Russia’s state TASS news agency.
- Russian forces shot down 301 Ukrainian drones, 10 missiles and two guided bombs in a 24-hour period, Russia’s Ministry of Defence said, according to TASS.
Peace process
- United States President Donald Trump’s Board of Peace held its first meeting in Washington, DC, without Belarus participating, despite Trump extending an invitation to the Russian ally.
- Belarus’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs said in a statement that its delegation to the meeting did not receive the necessary visas to enter the US “despite carrying out all the required procedures”.
- The Foreign Ministry questioned, “What kind of peace and what kind of sequence of steps are we talking about if the organisers cannot even complete basic formalities for us to take part?”
-
France’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesperson Pascal Confavreux expressed surprise to see the European Commission had sent a commissioner to participate in Trump’s meeting, noting that it “does not have a mandate from the [European] Council to go and participate”.
- Confavreux also said France would not take part in Trump’s initiative until the Board of Peace returned its focus to Gaza in line with a United Nations Security Council resolution.
- Several European Union member states have said they will not participate in the peace board after Trump extended an invitation to Russian President Vladimir Putin, who launched the invasion of Ukraine in 2022 and is subject to an arrest warrant by the International Criminal Court.

Regional Security
- Dutch intelligence services AIVD and MIVD said on Thursday that European countries, including the Netherlands, were facing increased hybrid threats from Russia, including cyberattacks, sabotage, influence campaigns and disinformation.
Energy
- Ukraine’s Russian-held Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant is operating on its sole remaining main power line after losing its only backup power line more than a week ago, head of the International Atomic Energy Agency, Rafael Grossi, said in a statement.
- Hungary is considering halting power and gas exports to Ukraine and will take such steps unless Ukraine resumes the flow of crude oil shipments via the Druzhba pipeline, Prime Minister Viktor Orban’s chief of staff told a briefing.
- The Druzhba pipeline, parts of which run through Ukraine, is crucial for the transfer of Russian crude oil to Hungary and Slovakia. Oil flows have reportedly halted since an attack on the pipeline in January, which Kyiv has blamed on Russia.
- France’s Minister of the Economy, Finance and Industry Roland Lescure said his country would provide 71 million euros ($83.5m) in additional funding for Ukraine for services including energy, health and clearing land mines.
Politics and diplomacy
- The head of Russia’s FSB security service accused Telegram messaging app founder Pavel Durov of condoning criminal activity on the platform, in an escalation of Moscow’s rhetoric as it moved to restrict the service that is used by many Russians and Ukrainians to communicate about the war.
-
Dismissing a Russian government allegation that foreign intelligence services are able to see messages sent by Russian soldiers on Telegram, the popular platform said it had not found any breaches of its encryption codes and called Russia’s claims a “deliberate fabrication”, according to the Reuters news agency.
Military aid
- Sweden announced a 12.9 billion crown ($1.42bn) military aid package for Ukraine that will include air defences, drones, long-range missiles and ammunition.

In China’s tight economy, a fake exam-takers scheme has touched a nerve
A bizarre case of inflating applicant numbers to deter potential job candidates has become a national talking point
In the cutthroat world of Chinese civil service exams, the most dangerous opponent is not necessarily the person in the next seat: it is the “ghost” candidate designed to scare you away before you even show up.
A bizarre case of inflating applicant numbers to deter potential candidates has become a national talking point, as tougher job prospects raise interest in civil service examinations on the mainland.
First reported by state media in December, the case involved the illegal purchase of personal information to mass-register fake exam-takers, thereby inflating enrolment figures to “intimidate” competitors.
According to a court ruling cited by Chinese media, the scam surfaced when a candidate applying for a civil service exam at an unnamed location in February last year discovered that his identity had been used to register for an exam he never took.
After the candidate reported the matter to authorities, police discovered that a person identified only as Li had collaborated with a teacher Zhou from a civil service exam training institution.

Drones strike Crimea, air bases may have been targeted – video
A series of explosions were heard in temporarily occupied Crimea on the night of 19-20 February. The Belbek and Saky air bases, used by Russian forces, may have been targeted.
Source: Krymskyi Veter (Crimean Wind), Exilenova+ and Supernova+ Telegram channels
Details: Krymskyi Veter wrote that Russian forces had attempted to down drones near the Kacha and Belbek air bases. Meanwhile, air-raid warnings were issued several times in Sevastopol due to the threat of UAVs and Russian air defence systems were actively responding in the city of Bakhchysarai.
Local residents reported that the blasts had shattered windows in residential buildings in Sevastopol.
Mikhail Razvozhayev, the Kremlin-appointed "governor" of Sevastopol, confirmed the attack and claimed that Russian air defence, together with the Black Sea Fleet, had downed over 16 drones.
Telegram channels suggested that Russian military facilities in temporarily occupied Crimea, including the Belbek and Saky air bases, may have been targeted.
Background: Drones attacked Russia's Pskov Oblast on the night of 18-19 February, causing a fire at an oil depot in the city of Velikiye Luki.

Alberta plans referendum to wrest control over immigration from Canadian government
Sign up now: Get ST's newsletters delivered to your inbox
CALGARY, Feb 19 - Alberta will hold a referendum this fall to ask residents if its government should limit the number of new international students, temporary foreign workers and asylum seekers arriving in the oil-rich Canadian province.
The move, announced by Premier Danielle Smith in a televised address on Thursday evening, represents an attempt by Alberta to wrest control of a key issue from the federal government. Immigration policy in Canada is primarily the responsibility of Ottawa, not the provinces.
It marks a potential blow to Canadian unity at a time when Prime Minister Mark Carney has made efforts to improve relations with western, resource-rich provinces and head off a simmering Alberta separatism movement.
Smith said her government is facing what will be a significant deficit in next week's provincial budget, partly because of a decline in provincial resource royalties due to lower global oil prices.
But she also blamed Alberta's fiscal challenges on the province's exceptionally rapid population growth, the strongest in Canada. Alberta's population, which ticked past the 5 million mark in 2025, according to Statistics Canada, added more than 600,000 people in the past five years - something Smith said has been putting a strain on provincial resources.
"Throwing the doors wide open to anyone and everyone across the globe has flooded our classrooms, emergency rooms and social support systems with far too many people, far too quickly," she said in her address.
Alberta is not the only province with a growing population attributable to immigration. After several years of a welcoming immigration policy under former Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, Canada has recently begun reducing its immigration targets and imposing caps on temporary residents, citing pressure on housing, infrastructure and social services.
The main difference between Alberta and the other provinces, according to an ATB Financial analysis, is that Alberta has a very high level of interprovincial migration from Canadians seeking better opportunities and more affordable housing.
But Smith said that Albertans identified international immigration as one of their top concerns in a recent series of town hall panels, and so she will seek a referendum mandate to pursue changes.
She said the changes could include passing a law mandating that only Canadian citizens, permanent residents and individuals with an "Alberta approved immigration status" will be eligible for provincially funded programs such as health, education and other social services. REUTERS

World leaders to present joint approach to AI at India summit close
Dozens of world leaders and ministers are expected Friday to present a joint approach to artificial intelligence, concluding a five-day summit in New Delhi where industry figures urged faster oversight. OpenAI chief Sam Altman warned regulation is “urgent” as booming generative AI fuels profits and societal and environmental concerns.
Dozens of world leaders and ministers are expected to deliver on Friday a shared view of how to handle artificial intelligence, wrapping up a five-day summit focused on the technology.
It comes a day after OpenAI chief Sam Altman told the meeting in New Delhi that the fast-evolving sector needs regulation "urgently".
Frenzied demand for generative AI has turbocharged profits for companies, while also fuelling fears about the impact on society and the planet.
Altman, CEO of the company behind ChatGPT, has called for oversight in the past but said last year that taking too tight an approach could hold the United States back in the AI race.
"Centralisation of this technology, in one company or country, could lead to ruin," the 40-year-old said on Thursday.
"This is not to suggest that we won't need any regulation or safeguards. We obviously do, urgently, like we have for other powerful technologies."
Read moreEurope will be a 'safe space' for AI innovation, Macron tells India summit
India's AI Impact Summit is the fourth annual gathering to discuss the risks and opportunities posed by rapidly advancing computing power.
It is the largest yet and the first in a developing country, with India taking the opportunity to push its ambitions to catch up with the United States and China.
India expects more than $200 billion in investments over the next two years, and US tech titans unveiled new deals and infrastructure projects this week.
'Common good'
Many say stronger action is needed to combat emerging issues, such as job disruption, online abuse and the electricity demands of data centres.
But the broad focus of the New Delhi event, and vague promises made at the previous summits in France, South Korea and Britain, could make concrete commitments unlikely.
Even so, "governance of powerful technologies typically begins with shared language: what risks matter, what thresholds are unacceptable", said Niki Iliadis, director of global AI governance at The Future Society.
"It's true that AI companies are influential, but they are not sovereign," she told AFP.
Read moreAlly or threat? Paris summit weighs AI's impact on democracy
Discussions at the Delhi summit, attended by tens of thousands from across the AI industry, including top tech CEOs, have covered big topics from child protections to job losses and the need for more equal access to AI tools worldwide.
"We are entering an era where humans and intelligence systems co-create, co-work and co-evolve," Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi said on Thursday.
"We must resolve that AI is used for the global common good."
UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres called on tech tycoons to support a $3 billion global fund to boost AI skills and make computing power more affordable.
"The future of AI cannot be decided by a handful of countries – or left to the whims of a few billionaires," he said.

Trump defends tariffs in pre-midterms appearance in battleground Georgia
Unknown
Unknown Publisher

01:54:22 UTC
10:54:22 KST

Donald Trump forcefully defended his tariffs on Thursday, claiming “tariffs are my favorite word in the dictionary” and promoting their use to empower American manufacturing at an event in north-west Georgia.
“Without tariffs, this country would be in so much trouble right now,” Trump said during his remarks at Coosa Steel Corporation, a steel-processing and distribution firm in Rome, Georgia.
He lamented having to wait for the US supreme court’s decision on the constitutionality of his trade policy, attributing the lawsuit to “China-oriented” people and Canadian partisans.
“I’m waiting for a decision from the supreme court,” he said, complaining about having to “justify this, because people come from other countries and have ripped us off for 50 years”.
Trump’s visit to Georgia, a key battleground state in this year’s midterm elections, was ostensibly to promote his economy amid lagging approval numbers. But Trump spent a large portion of his remarks focused on his repeated, unverified claims of voter fraud.
Trump unloaded on Democratic unwillingness to back the Save America Act, which would curtail voting by mail, require voters to present photo ID at the ballot box and require proof of citizenship when registering. The legislation passed in the House last week, but is unlikely to move in the Senate without lawmakers first ending the filibuster.
“The Democrats don’t want to give us voter ID, because they want to cheat … They say they don’t want voter ID because it’s racist,” Trump said. “We want voter ID and proof of citizenship … they’re fighting that.”
Trump also argued against mail-in ballots, saying mail-in voting should be reserved for deployed military service members, or people who are ill or away from home: “With mail-in ballots, they cheat.”
Mail voting fraud is exceptionally rare, and Trump has provided no evidence of Democrats using the system to attempt to fraudulently win elections.
And while addressing the court case emerging from an FBI raid seizing 2020 election material last month, Trump described the fight to return ballots to Fulton county control as nefarious.
“Why don’t they want them to see the ballots after all these years? It’s because they cheated,” he said. “They cheated like dogs.”
An affidavit unsealed after the raid revealed that the rationale for the investigation was based on debunked claims from conservative activists who have long denied the 2020 election’s results.
Trump chose contested territory for his visit Thursday: Marjorie Taylor Greene’s former district. The former US representative’s resignation in January left a seat open with Republicans holding a razor-thin majority in the House. Early voting is under way in the 10 March election, which appears likely to result in an April runoff between the top two candidates.
Trump’s visit reinforced his endorsement of Clay Fuller, a north Georgia district attorney and former White House fellow who serves as a reserve lieutenant colonel in the air force. The president’s endorsement has helped to whittle the field, which now stands at 18 candidates, including three Democrats. With less fracturing among Democrats, the retired army general and 2024 nominee Shawn Harris is likely to make a runoff against the top Republican vote-getter.
Appearing at Thursday’s event, Fuller praised Trump’s approach to the economy and the “war on inflation that President Trump had to inherit form President Biden”. He joked with Trump, asking for a pardon for his child who got in trouble for skipping school to attend the rally.
Trump also offered praise for the lieutenant governor Burt Jones, who is running for governor in a field recently joined by the billionaire founder of Jackson Healthcare, Rick Jackson. Jones “has been with you and been with me from the beginning,” Trump said.
Democratic National Committee chair Ken Martin released a statement as Trump spoke, noting that healthcare premiums will double on average for 1.4 million Georgians this year and 500,000 will lose their healthcare altogether “because of Trump’s Big Ugly Bill and refusal to extend ACA subsidies”.
Democrats who are “captive” to the insurance companies are holding up a Republican initiative to redirect insurance subsidies into direct payments to beneficiaries, Trump claimed in his remarks, saying: “We’re slashing drug prices … we were paying the highest drug prices in the world, and now we’re paying whatever the lowest prices are in the world.”
Trump also reiterated comments he made last month about a supposed deal with French prime minister Emmanuel Macron to raise drug prices in France, set after threats of tariffs on French exports. Macron has forcefully denied this claim, writing on social media platform X that: “It is being claimed that President @Emmanuel Macron increased the price of medicines. He does not set their prices. They are regulated by the social security system and have, in fact, remained stable. Anyone who has set foot in a French pharmacy knows this.”

Australian PM says former prince Andrew has suffered ‘extraordinary fall’ but that won’t prompt another republic referendum

Anthony Albanese has described Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor’s arrest as an “extraordinary fall from grace” but says the latest crisis facing the British royal family won’t prompt another referendum on Australia becoming a republic.
The former prince, the brother of King Charles III, was arrested overnight on suspicion of misconduct in public office.
He was taken to Aylsham police station in Norfolk for questioning about allegations he shared confidential material with the convicted child sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.
In his first comments about the arrest, Albanese told the Guardian’s Australian Politics podcast that Mountbatten-Windsor had lived a life of absolute privilege.
“These are very serious allegations, and because they will be, no doubt, the subject of court action, I’m limited in what I can say,” the prime minister said.
“But people will be following the detail here. This appears to be about [classified] documents, and whether they were inappropriately forwarded on to someone who wasn’t eligible. But, of course, there’s the bigger issue as well when it comes to Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor. No doubt, we will wait and see where this all goes.”
Despite his longstanding support for an Australian republic, Albanese said the government was not planning another referendum.
“I’m a republican but we had a referendum during the last term,” the Labor leader said. “Referendums are hard to pass in Australia.
“I have respect for King Charles, I must say, and for Queen Camilla. I have had a good relationship with him. He very much loves Australia. And his visit here, I must say, was a very positive one.
“But that doesn’t change the fact I think there should [eventually] be an Australian head of state.”
In October 2023, after the Indigenous voice to parliament failed, Albanese ruled out another referendum during his first term in office.
Albanese then scrapped the ministerial portfolio for a republic in July 2024.
Last September, he shut the door on the prospect of another referendum while he was prime minister, noting: “We’re concentrating on cost of living.”
Albanese said on Friday that Mountbatten-Windsor had suffered “quite an extraordinary fall from grace … from someone who had such an esteemed position and was in a position really of absolute privilege.
“To see this decline and fall is extraordinary.”
Mountbatten-Windsor denies all the allegations against him.
Albanese said he was not aware of any ongoing investigation or inquiry in Australia related to the Epstein revelations.
Former chair of the Australian Republican Movement and ex-Socceroo Craig Foster said Australia’s ties to the monarchy should be reconsidered.
“It should spark a national conversation about the standards we will accept, how we want to see ourselves, be seen in the world, and particularly what we want our next generation of Aussies, in all of our beautiful diversity, to understand as our value set,” he said.
“No Australian could possibly support what we have seen.”
Foster stepped down as chair of the body in 2024.
The Australians for Constitutional Monarchy convenor, David Flint, called for Mountbatten-Windsor to be removed from the line of succession.
“He’s not going to succeed. He’s eighth in line, and you’d have to have a major calamity for seven people to pass away before him. Some of them are very young. But I think as a matter of propriety, it’s inappropriate to have him there.”
Flint noted it was difficult to amend the relevant legislation to change the order of succession because it requires all 15 realms of the Commonwealth to agree. It was last amended in 2011.
Andrew is no longer a prince after being stripped of many of his titles in October but he remains in the line of succession.
Flint said Andrew’s arrest wouldn’t be a boon for the republican movement.
“I don’t think people are going to think deeply about it, like they’re thinking about the cost of living or housing or those things which really affect them.
“I just don’t think it’s going to be significantly damaging to the monarchy.”

Slavery exhibit removed by Trump administration returns to Philadelphia’s Independence Mall after judge’s order

Slavery exhibit removed by Trump administration returns to Philadelphia’s Independence Mall after judge’s order
The Trump administration is appealing the decision restoring the exhibit about history of slavery
- Bookmark
- CommentsGo to comments
Parks workers have restored a series of exhibition panels about the history of slavery at a Philadelphia historical site that the Trump administration had removed last month, after a federal judge ordered the materials put back on the President’s House site earlier this week.
Pennsylvania leaders cheered the development on Thursday.
“Today we celebrate the return of our history at this important site,” Philadelphia Mayor Cherelle L. Parker, who sued the administration over the removal, wrote on X. “We are thankful for all the supporters across the city to get us to this point. We know that this is not the end of the legal road. We will handle all legal challenges that arise with the same rigor and gravity as we have done thus far.”
Parker visited the site, the first official U.S. presidential residence, and thanked the workers restoring the exhibition panels, which detailed the history of slavery and the lives of the people enslaved at the site by President George Washington.
“It’s our honor,” a National Park Service worker told Parker.
“Donald Trump will not prevail in his attempts to whitewash our shared history — especially not here in Pennsylvania,” Gov. Josh Shapiro wrote on X.
The Trump administration took down the historical materials, installed as part of a joint city-federal agreement in 2006, in late January, on the eve of Black History Month, part of the White House’s campaign to remove historical references to the history of slavery and racism in America.
The city sued, arguing the administration ignored its rights to jointly approve the final design of the exhibit.
In a scathing ruling on Monday, U.S. District Judge Cynthia Rufe compared the Trump administration’s conduct to that of the totalitarian regime in George Orwell’s 1984 and ordered the exhibit restored to its previous condition.
“As if the Ministry of Truth in George Orwell’s 1984 now existed, with its motto ‘Ignorance is Strength,’ this Court is now asked to determine whether the federal government has the power it claims — to dissemble and disassemble historical truths when it has some domain over historical facts,” she wrote Monday. “It does not.”
The Trump administration, which has pushed to remove materials from U.S. museums and historic sites that depict “founding principles and historical milestones in a negative light,” argued it was planning to replace the placards at the President’s House with updated materials, including the history of the nine enslaved people who lived there.
“The National Park Service routinely updates exhibits across the park system to ensure historical accuracy and completeness,” the Interior Department previously told The Independent in a statement. “If not for this unnecessary judicial intervention, updated interpretive materials providing a fuller account of the history of slavery at Independence Hall would have been installed in the coming days.”
The Trump administration has appealed the order to restore the materials to the site, accusing Philadelphia of acting as a “backseat driver holding veto power” over federal officials.
Last year, the president signed an executive order aimed at “restoring truth and sanity to American history.”
In practice, the order has often meant federal officials diminishing information describing the history of subjugation and violence against Black people in America.
The administration, as part of its review of materials at Smithsonian-affiliated museums, has railed against the museums for focusing on “how bad slavery was.”
It also reportedly removed examples of a famous 1863 photograph of an enslaved man’s scars, The Scourged Back, at multiple national parks, and edited out references in visitor brochures that the murderer of civil rights activist Medgar Evers was a member of the white supremacist terror group the Ku Klux Klan.

US Secretary of State Marco Rubio has discussed the development of Pakistan's critical minerals and energy sectors with Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif during talks in Washington, DC.
The meeting took place on Thursday on the sidelines of the inaugural session of the Board of Peace, where Pakistan participated as a founding member.
According to a statement by State Department principal deputy spokesperson Tommy Pigott, Rubio thanked Pakistan for its ongoing support of President Donald Trump's 20-point plan for Gaza and for taking part in the board's first meeting.
Attacks in the country
He also welcomed Pakistan's participation in a recent critical minerals ministerial held in the US capital.
"The officials discussed critical minerals and energy sector development, as well as commercial investment opportunities for American companies," Pigott said.
The talks focused on cooperation in developing Pakistan's natural resource base and expanding prospects for US private sector involvement.
Separately, Rubio offered condolences over what he described as the "horrific" attacks on January 31 by the outlawed Balochistan Liberation Army in the southwestern province of Balochistan, as well as the February 6 suicide bombing at a mosque in Islamabad.
He reaffirmed the importance of US-Pakistan cooperation in counterterrorism efforts and underlined the countries' partnership in addressing security challenges.

Bikie David Pye guilty of ordering hit on Rebels boss Nick Martin in Perth’s underworld ‘trial of the century’
Updated ,first published
Perth bikie David Pye has been found guilty of masterminding the murder of rival underworld heavyweight Nick Martin.
The 43-year-old appeared via video link to hear Supreme Court Justice Joseph McGrath’s decision on Friday morning following his dramatic trial in October last year.
Pye’s case was dubbed “the trial of the century” after he was accused of ordering the hit on Martin at Kwinana Motorplex in 2020.
The bikie denied being the person responsible for paying a former soldier to shoot Martin dead in front of thousands of people – and the only real evidence police had was the word of the man who carried out the killing.
The former soldier, who cannot be identified as his identity is suppressed, previously admitted to murdering Martin while he sat watching the races with his family, but the hitman said he was paid to do so by Pye, with whom he had struck up a friendship over drugs and his work overseas.
Pye emphatically denied the accusation and took the matter to trial, launching a security nightmare for police who escorted him to and from Perth’s District Court daily with multiple armed vehicles and an armed helicopter watching his every move.
The building itself was also unusually heavily guarded throughout the trial, with multiple armed tactical response units watching each entry and exit point like hawks throughout the hearing.
The majority of the evidence in the case was the word of the former soldier who is currently serving a 20-year sentence for Martin’s murder – significantly reduced on the basis he would testify against Pye.
The 39-year-old gave days of testimony from behind bullet-proof glass, claiming the bikie boss asked him to kill Martin shortly after he turned down a request to kill Pye’s ex-girlfriend.
“He basically wanted to blow holes in him with a .357 [pistol],” the ex-soldier claimed.
The soldier said he agreed to “look into it”, considering the job for the paltry sum of $150,000.
He said he “tailed” Martin for weeks as he came and went from his house, trying to find a pattern of behaviour that would enable him to set up and carry out the kill.
He bought a drone, the court was told, and flew it over his house to assess his security set up.
But the former soldier later decided the best place to murder the 51-year-old was in front of 2000 people, in the dark, from 365 metres away.
He sat among some bushes, he said, on the far side of the Kwinana Motorplex on December 12, 2020, and watched Martin through the lens of his rifle. He claims he turned off his phone and then took the shot, firing one single bullet through Martin’s chest as he sat next to his wife, Amanda, his step-daughter Stacey and a bunch of horrified friends and onlookers.
The bullet exited Martin’s back, brushing past the leg of his step-daughter’s boyfriend, Ricky Chapman, before embedding itself in his arm. The then 31-year-old survived the shot but died 16 months later from an unrelated medical episode.
The soldier was caught soon after and quickly struck a plea deal, telling police he was paid to carry out the job.
But Pye’s lawyers told the trial the man is a pathological and compulsive liar.
During cross-examination, he was repeatedly exposed for lies he told and exaggerations made about killing conquests.
The trial also did not expose any real evidence connecting Pye to the killing, save for the soldier’s word, and while police bugged conversations between the pair, the conversations played in court fell short of ever hearing them both discuss the murder of Martin.
In contrast, prosecution argued Pye had the motive for wanting Martin dead.
Former friends and allies, the pair had become enemies after Pye defected from Martin’s Rebels gang to the Comancheros. It was said Martin wanted Pye dead as much as, allegedly, Pye wanted to return the favour.
But the trial was also told there were around 60 other people who also wanted Martin killed and Pye’s lawyers took the opportunity to deflect the heat off their client and point the finger elsewhere.
Unlike any ordinary trial, this one was not heard in front of a jury as it was decided that finding a group of unbiased people to decide Pye’s fate would be impossible. Instead, one man only was charged with deciding Pye’s fate.
Pye was also found guilty of inciting the former soldier to kill another rival bikie boss, Ray Cilli, who was living in Thailand.
The sniper told the court Pye had offered him $800,000 to do the job, but he was arrested over Martin’s death before he could carry out the hit.
On Friday, McGrath also told the court Pye was guilty of assaulting an ex-girlfriend and two counts of dealing with money that was intended to be used in an offence of murder.
Pye will be sentenced at a later date.

How Reuters captured the photo of former Prince Andrew leaving custody

Feb 19 - Slumped in the back seat of his Range Rover, a visibly shaken man once referred to as the "Playboy Prince" stares ahead of him as the car leaves Aylsham police station in Norfolk, England.
The photo, taken by Reuters photographer Phil Noble, went viral when it was published late on Thursday. It shows Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor, the younger brother of King Charles, after he was released from police custody following a day of questioning over allegations he sent confidential government documents to convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.
When news that Mountbatten-Windsor had been arrested broke early on Thursday, Manchester-based Noble began the six-hour drive south to Norfolk.
Journalists knew the former prince had been arrested in Norfolk - the county that is home to the royal Sandringham estate where he resides. Since officers from Thames Valley Police - covering southeast England - were questioning him, there were potentially 20 or more police stations where he could have been held.
Following a tip, Noble headed to the police station in the historic market town of Aylsham.
Not much was going on, Noble said. There were a couple of other members of the media there, including Reuters video journalist Marissa Davison.
Six or seven hours went by. Darkness fell. Still, nothing was happening. It seemed like this was the wrong station - after all, it was well over an hour's drive from Mountbatten-Windsor's home.
The team of two Reuters journalists decided to book rooms at a hotel. Noble packed up and started heading down the road towards it.
Minutes later, he got a call from Davison. Mountbatten-Windsor's cars had arrived.
Noble raced back, just in time to see the two vehicles leaving, at high speed. The front car contained two police officers, so Noble aimed his camera and flash at the car behind.
He took six frames in all - two showed police, two were blank, one was out of focus. But one captured the unprecedented nature of the moment: for the first time in modern history, a senior royal was being treated as a common criminal.
The image was used extensively by media worldwide.
"You can plan and use your experience and know roughly what you need to do, but still everything needs to align," said Noble. "When you're doing car shots it's more luck than judgment."
He hadn't looked closely at the former prince's expression, the photographer added. He was just relieved it was him.
"It was a proper old school news day, a guy being arrested, who can we call, tracking him down," he said.
Mountbatten-Windsor, the second son of the late Queen Elizabeth, has always denied any wrongdoing in relation to Epstein, and has previously said he regrets their friendship. The current police investigation, which is not related to any allegation of sexual impropriety, involves the suspicion of committing misconduct in public office, according to a statement released on Thursday by Assistant Chief Constable Oliver Wright.
The former prince's office did not respond to a request for comment on Thursday. He has not spoken publicly since the release of millions of pages of documents by the U.S. government relating to Epstein, who was convicted of soliciting prostitution from a minor in 2008. REUTERS

‘Been a long time coming’: Andrew was the only one stunned by his arrest
Updated ,first published
London: Standing outside Buckingham Palace, British visitors to London’s royal precinct had a swift response to the arrest of Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor. First, they welcomed the news. Next, they had a question about the authorities: what took them so long?
“I think it should have happened a long time ago,” said Mark Hoskins, an office worker from Bristol on a visit to the capital on Thursday afternoon (London time). “They should have thrown him under a bus when it all came out years ago.”
James Burnett, a builder from Warwickshire, had the same sense of doubt about the time taken to hold the former prince to account. “It’s been a long time coming,” he said. “There was a lot of unfair protection.” In other words, this suspect was shielded from scrutiny for too long.
There is no sympathy for Mountbatten-Windsor. His arrest earlier on Thursday has come years after the revelations of his ties to sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, and years after the publication of the notorious photograph showing him with his hand on the waist of Virginia Roberts Giuffre, who accused him of sexual assault.
Born into privilege, he is now a pariah. So, what happens next in the investigation into his past? And will any of it go before a court of law in the future?
Mountbatten-Windsor looked stunned by the cold reality of police custody when he emerged from more than 11 hours of detention. He slouched in the back seat of a vehicle to try to avoid being photographed as he was driven away from a Norfolk police station.
Thames Valley Police did not name him in an official statement, but confirmed the arrest of a man “in his sixties” on suspicion of misconduct in public office. “The arrested man has now been released under investigation,” the police said. There was no mention of any charges.
Police have searched Mountbatten-Windsor’s former home, Royal Lodge at Windsor, and his temporary home at Wood Farm in Sandringham (before he moves to another home on the same country estate). The sheer length of custody on Thursday suggests the police had a long list of questions.
As the inquiries continue, more will emerge. We will find out more about Mountbatten-Windsor’s work as a trade envoy for the British government and how this gave him access to foreign leaders, diplomats, business chiefs and investors. We will find out more about the documents he received, and which ones he forwarded to Epstein.
This shifts the focus from Epstein’s sexual abuse and the accounts of women such as Giuffre. In a sense, that is because the most recent disclosures from the US Department of Justice, with millions of files released in searchable chaos, shed so much light on the way Epstein assembled a network of people with influence.
Epstein did not just message his contacts about girls. He messaged about money, and deals, and information. Those who traded with Epstein in this way are now being caught out – including former British cabinet minister Peter Mandelson and a chorus line of former political leaders and business chiefs.
The former Prince Andrew was part of this network. And he had useful information for at least a decade. He was made the UK’s special representative for international trade and investment in 2001, upon his retirement from the Royal Navy. He kept that post until 2011, when the first wave of the Epstein scandal forced him out.
His decade in that post gave him access to the diplomatic corps in an official role that added to his royal status, opening doors to investors around the world. It also coincided with his friendship with Epstein, whom he had met in 1999.
The case against Andrew
One document highlights the way Mountbatten-Windsor got in touch with his friend as soon as confidential information came his way. In October 2010, he made sure that Epstein knew the details of a trade mission to Vietnam, Singapore, Hong Kong and Shenzhen. On November 30 that year, he received a set of “visit reports” from one of his advisers about each location. He forwarded these documents to Epstein five minutes after receiving them.
Thanks to the BBC, which found these emails in the US Department of Justice searchable archive, we can see this example of the tight links between the two men. But we cannot see the documents because the attachments were not released.
Given this was almost 16 years ago, one of the challenges for the police investigation is to find out more about the documents being sent to Epstein and estimate the financial value of the information.
Later in 2010, he was in touch with Epstein about investments elsewhere. On Christmas Eve, at 3.24 in the afternoon, Mountbatten-Windsor sent Epstein a government document about opportunities in Helmand province in Afghanistan.
“Attached is a confidential brief produced by the Provincial Reconstruction Team in Helmand Province for International Investment Opportunities,” he wrote. “I am going to offer this elsewhere in my network (including Abu Dhabi) but would be very interested in your comments, views or ideas as to whom I could also usefully show this to attract some interest.”
Again, the Department of Justice files do not appear to include the attachments to the message. It will be up to British investigators to see if they can find this document and others in UK government files, or can get them from the US authorities.
What other information did the trade envoy share with his friend in New York? Was there a pattern of regular contact to forward British government documents? Everything depends on how much the British investigation can uncover about the number of documents exchanged, the importance of those documents, and any evidence from officials that might support a case that this amounts to misconduct in public office.
Without that evidence, the concerns about Mountbatten-Windsor may fall short of the key tests in the British law regarding misconduct in public office – such as the requirement that a suspect “wilfully neglects” to perform their duty.
This means Mountbatten-Windsor may be remembered as the former prince who was arrested on suspicion of misconduct, rather than being charged with misconduct, let alone being found guilty of it in a court of law.
A man shunned
But this is only one line of inquiry into Mountbatten-Windsor. The claims against him by Giuffre who took her own life in Western Australia last year, still hang over him despite his financial settlement with her four years ago. Members of the US Congress still want him to appear before their inquiry into Epstein.
The Metropolitan Police in the UK are carrying out initial inquiries into whether Mountbatten-Windsor asked members of his personal security team, while Duke of York, to look into Giuffre in an attempt to discredit her.
The concerns about Mountbatten-Windsor appear to worry a former prime minister, Gordon Brown, the Labour leader in Number 10 Downing Street from 2007 to 2010. Already incensed at the way Mandelson shared information with Epstein, Brown made another statement hours after the arrest at Sandringham.
“I have submitted a five-page memorandum to the Metropolitan, Surrey, Sussex, Thames Valley and other relevant UK police constabularies,” Brown said. “This memorandum provides new and additional information to that which I submitted last week to the Met, Essex and Thames Valley police forces where I expressed my concern that we secure justice for trafficked girls and women.”
Brown did not name Mountbatten-Windsor, but he has raised concerns in recent days that Epstein had regular access to Stansted Airport, outside London, for the private jet that became known as the “Lolita Express” because of the young girls it carried as passengers. The BBC reported last year that there were at least 87 flights linked to Epstein through UK airports including Stansted. There is still more to be investigated about the most alarming of all the aspects of Epstein’s sordid career: the reports of trafficking in girls and young women.
Mountbatten-Windsor can still be drawn into the inquiries into Epstein’s network, although the latest documents raise questions about personal behaviour rather than being proof of wrongdoing. There is the photo of the prince, as he was at the time, on all fours over a woman lying on a floor. There is the email from Epstein in August 2010 saying he has a friend – her name is redacted – who would like to have dinner in London. “She 26, russian, clevere beautiful, trustworthy,” Epstein writes, in his usual haphazard way.
One day the emails were about documents, the next they were about girls.
What next for the royal family?
The drama of the arrest at Sandringham was followed by business-as-usual at Buckingham Palace. The word from the palace was that the police had not given the royal family any advance notice that the King’s brother would be arrested, although it emerged later that the police told the Home Office. The most important message was that King Charles and Queen Camilla stuck to their scheduled events.
This led to the jarring contrast of the King attending a fashion event in London, and the Queen meeting fashion magazine editor Anna Wintour, while Mountbatten-Windsor was photographed leaving a police station. But the contrast was the point because the objective was to isolate the former prince and show the royal family will continue in an entirely different world.
The King took time to decide on this course. He took no action for much of last year, before arranging on October 17 for his brother to voluntarily give up his titles, such as the Duke of York. With more claims emerging, including in a memoir by Giuffre, the King took the tougher approach of stripping his brother of his remaining titles on October 31.
There has been no similar reluctance this year to be firm. On February 10, Charles approved a statement saying he would assist police if asked to help with any inquiries into Mountbatten-Windsor. Nine days later, soon after the arrest, he issued a statement in his own words expressing his concern about the arrest and promising “full and wholehearted” cooperation.
He referred to Mountbatten-Windsor without calling him his brother. And he concluded with this: “Meanwhile, my family and I will continue in our duty and service to you all.” The subtleties send the message that the former prince is no longer in the family.
But nobody should be leaping to conclusions about the decline of the monarchy.
Yes, the public has turned on Andrew. He is disliked by 76 per cent of British voters, says polling firm YouGov. But he no longer has any royal duties and has been stripped of his titles. And Charles remains immensely popular.
YouGov finds that 60 per cent of British voters have a positive view of the King, while 31 per cent have a negative view. This has been relatively steady over the past year of royal tumult. And the next royal generation is immensely popular, with 77 per cent of voters having a positive view of Prince William and 74 per cent being positive about Princess Catherine.
“Overall, there’s little desire to see the monarchy come to an end,” says YouGov. It finds that 64 per cent of Britons believe the UK should continue to be a kingdom, consistent with findings throughout Charles’ reign.
The British public can condemn the man they once knew as Prince Andrew at the same time they support the King and the monarchy.
Neil Gorton, a scientist from Manchester on a visit to London, said the authorities should not spare Mountbatten-Windsor. “If he’s guilty, then he deserves everything he gets under the law,” he said, as he stood near the gates of Buckingham Palace. But he added that this did not tarnish the King and Queen inside the palace gates.
“There’s always a black sheep in every family,” he said. And his support for the monarchy? “100 per cent.”

Climber convicted of manslaughter after leaving girlfriend on Austria’s highest peak to get help

An Austrian court has found a 37-year-old amateur mountaineer guilty of manslaughter over his girlfriend’s death near Austria’s highest summit, after he left her to fetch help when she could not go on.
The case is unusual because while climbing accidents are common, prosecutions over them are rare.
The court in the western city of Innsbruck handed the Austrian man a five-month suspended prison sentence and a €9,400 ($11,100) fine for causing her death in January 2025 by gross negligence, an offence that carries a maximum prison sentence of three years.
The trial has raised questions about the extent of legal liability in the high mountains, an inherently dangerous environment that climbers generally explore at their own risk.
After a day’s climbing in which they fell far behind schedule, the 33-year-old woman was exhausted and unable to go on, after they reached about 50 metres below the summit of the Grossglockner mountain on a freezing winter’s night, the court heard.
The defendant, identified as Thomas P, left his girlfriend Kerstin G exposed to strong winds without wrapping her in her emergency blanket or bivouac bag for reasons he could not fully explain, to fetch help in a shelter on the mountain. The equipment stayed in her rucksack.
When asked why, he told the court the situation had been particularly stressful.
A short call to the mountain police did not trigger a search since the police said he did not make clear they needed rescuing, and he failed to answer calls back or WhatsApp messages asking if they needed help. The defendant said his phone had been in airplane mode to save battery.
Prosecutors called an ex-girlfriend of his as a witness, who testified that they too had climbed the Grossglockner together in 2023 and after an argument over the route he left her alone at night, crying as her headlamp ran out of battery.
The presiding judge, Norbert Hofer, himself an experienced mountaineer, ruled the defendant should have realised Kerstin G would not be able to complete the climb well before they ran into difficulty.
“I do not see you as a murderer. I do not see you as cold-hearted,” Hofer told Thomas P as he read his ruling, accepting that he had indeed gone to fetch help.
He added, however, that the defendant was a better mountaineer than his girlfriend by “galaxies”, and that she had placed herself in his care.
“What I want to say is that I am so terribly sorry,” the defendant, who pleaded not guilty, said earlier on Thursday.

Japan’s Takaichi pushes to scrap food tax, ignoring economists’ warnings
The newly reappointed prime minister is gambling 5 trillion yen a year on a popular election promise that could backfire badly
Food consumption tax is going to be scrapped, and nothing is going to stop her.
Formally confirmed in office after the Diet voted to reappoint her – following a landslide victory in the House of Representatives election on February 8 – Takaichi reiterated her commitment to eliminating the 8 per cent levy on food and announced plans to establish a cross-party “national council” to examine the matter before summer.
Analysts expect the panel to report by late autumn, with any cuts potentially taking effect in early 2027.
The pledge proved enormously popular among voters battered by years of rising prices. But critics also found it deeply alarming.

Why you can trust SCMP
The Hong Kong government has started the year with initiatives that have far-reaching impacts on the city’s long-term growth.
Chief Executive John Lee Ka-chiu announced that he is spearheading Hong Kong’s inaugural five-year plan, which will promote broader integration with China’s five-year plan and ensure a bigger role for the city in the nation’s economic development. He also reaffirmed deeper engagement with countries in Southeast Asia, Eastern Europe and Central Asia to open up new markets for local enterprises.
The city’s leadership has made significant inroads in building trust and partnerships across promising emerging markets, reinforcing Hong Kong’s role as a vital bridge between China and the world.

Taken together, the countries of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (Asean) make up the world’s fifth-largest economy and have strong cultural and economic ties with Hong Kong, so the importance of the grouping is obvious.
Since taking office, Lee has undertaken several high-profile trips to the region, visiting seven of the 11 Asean member states. Thirteen minister-level visits have taken place in the same period, attesting to the high level of intergovernmental ties.

The average viewer numbers for the Super Bowl increased to 125.6 million after Nielsen released its final viewer figures on Thursday for the Feb. 8 game.
It was a 700,000 increase from the original number of 124.9 million, which was released on Feb. 10.
Nielsen attributed the update to a Big Data provider not properly collecting data from its devices on Feb. 8. Nielsen began using its Big Data + Panel methodology for all events last September with the start of the current television season.
Seattle’s 29-13 victory over New England was on NBC, Peacock, Telemundo, NBC Sports Digital, and NFL+.
That fell short of the 127.7 million U.S. viewers that tuned in for Philadelphia’s 40-22 victory over Kansas City last year on Fox.

Venezuelan parliament passes law granting amnesty to political prisoners

CARACAS, February 20. /TASS/. Venezuela’s National Assembly (the country’s parliament) approved new legislation allowing the release of political prisoners convicted between January 1, 1999 and the law’s enactment in 2026.
"The Law on Amnesty for Democratic Coexistence has been passed unanimously by the deputies," Parliament Speaker Jorge Rodriguez said on the Venezolana de Television TV channel following the vote.
The initiative for a general amnesty was proposed in late January 2026 by Venezuela’s authorized President Delcy Rodriguez. The release of political prisoners is intended to promote national reconciliation, peace, and democratic reforms in the country, Rodriguez said.
The amnesty excludes individuals convicted of serious crimes against humanity, human rights violations, murder, corruption, or drug trafficking. The law will take effect once it is signed by the authorized president and published in the Official Gazette of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela.

New Mexico reopens criminal probe related to Jeffrey Epstein’s Zorro Ranch
State officials say the information in unsealed FBI files ‘warrant further examination’ of a case closed in 2019.
New Mexico has reopened an investigation into possible illegal activity at a ranch formerly owned by disgraced financier and convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.
Attorney General Raul Torrez made the announcement on Thursday. He referenced new information revealed in documents recently released by the United States Department of Justice.

More than three and a half million government files related to Epstein were published online on January 30, in response to a law compelling their release.
The New Mexico’s office said “revelations outlined in the previously sealed FBI files warrant further examination” of an earlier state investigation into Epstein’s Zorro Ranch, near the town of Stanley.
That probe had been ended at the request of federal prosecutors in New York in 2019, the same year Epstein was arrested and charged with trafficking minors for sex.
Months later, in August 2019, Epstein was found dead in his cell at a federal detention facility in Manhattan, in what medical examiners described as a suicide.
New Mexico’s announcement came hours after Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor, a former prince in the United Kingdom’s royal family, was arrested on suspicion of misconduct in public office.
The arrest was connected to allegations that the ex-prince sent confidential government documents to Epstein.
The Epstein scandal has also forced high-profile resignations in the UK government. But in the US, critics point out that no such government shake-ups have occurred following the files’ release.
Mountbatten-Windsor’s arrest on Thursday has renewed calls for accountability for those in the US involved in Epstein’s crimes.
There has long been speculation about the financier’s influential social circle, which included a past friendship with US President Donald Trump and ties to foreign governments, including Israel.
Critics have questioned how those relationships might have shielded Epstein during his lifetime.
In 2008, he was convicted of solicitation and procuring a minor for sex in Florida, but he entered into a plea deal widely considered lenient. He ultimately served 13 months of an 18-month sentence.
The US Department of Justice has maintained that it has found no evidence of criminal conduct beyond the charges against Epstein and his former girlfriend, Ghislaine Maxwell, who is serving a 20-year sentence.
US lawmakers, however, have repeatedly accused the Justice Department of not being fully transparent.
In New Mexico, pressure has been intensifying to investigate Epstein’s connections to the state. A truth commission launched by state lawmakers held its first meeting earlier this week.
The four-member panel of state representatives is tasked with probing allegations that the Zorro Ranch may have been a site of sexual abuse and sex trafficking.
State lawmakers have also called for answers as to why Epstein was not registered as a sex offender in New Mexico after he pleaded guilty in 2008 in Florida.
Torrez’s office said it would work with the commission and seek access to the complete, un-redacted federal case files related to Epstein.
“As with any potential criminal matter, we will follow the facts wherever they lead, carefully evaluate jurisdictional considerations, and take appropriate investigative action, including the collection and preservation of any relevant evidence that remains available,” the office said in a statement.
Epstein purchased the 2,480-square-metre (26,690sq ft) Zorro ranch in 1993 from Democratic Governor Bruce King. The property was sold by Epstein’s estate in 2023.

'Lawless zones around Israel are the result of the Pax Judaica made possible by uncontested military hegemony'

The Board of Peace that was initiated by Donald Trump is meeting on Thursday, February 19, in Washington. Perhaps we will finally learn what its purpose might be, beyond collecting exorbitant membership fees, the use of which will ultimately be decided by a single person – the president of the United States. Initially intended for Gaza, the council's charter now boasts ambitions as global as they are uncertain. Yet, there is an urgent need to return to its original mission.
When Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu made the first of his five visits to the White House since Trump's return to power a year ago – in addition to two meetings in Florida – he expressed his ambition to "change the face of the Middle East." "Our decisions and the courage of our soldiers have redrawn the map. But I believe that working closely with President Trump, we can redraw it even further, and for the better," he stated.
One year later, this new map has not only been marked by the near-disappearance, under US-supplied bombs, of the pro-Iranian "axis of resistance." It now differs from the past through the emergence, upon Israel's initiative, of zones with an indeterminate status along the country's periphery, particularly in Gaza.
On the eve of the massacres of October 7, 2023, that were perpetrated by Hamas, along with the bloody destruction of the narrow strip of land that followed, Israel was still considered by most law experts to be an occupying power, in spite of its "Gaza Disengagement" of 2005. Since then, the country has added direct military occupation, which covers more than half of this overcrowded and now devastated territory, to its remote control. Predicting when this might end would be risky.
Although a ceasefire, which officially remains in effect, was celebrated with great fanfare by Trump at the Sharm El-Sheikh summit on October 13, 2025, it has been contradicted by the ongoing Israeli strikes that have killed hundreds of Palestinians ever since. Despite the official end of fighting, the Israeli army has continued to ban international media from entering the enclave. This unprecedented blackout from a US and European ally has been exacerbated by the exclusion, contrary to humanitarian law, of non-governmental organizations such as Doctors Without Borders, which have refused to submit to Israeli authority.

Venezuela approves amnesty law that could free hundreds of political prisoners
Venezuela’s National Assembly on Thursday unanimously approved an amnesty law expected to free hundreds of political prisoners, marking a major shift after years of socialist rule. The measure now heads to interim president Delcy Rodríguez, who proposed it following the removal of former leader Nicolas Maduro during a US military raid on January 3.
Venezuela's National Assembly on Thursday unanimously approved a long-awaited amnesty law that could free hundreds of political prisoners jailed for being government detractors.
But the law excludes those who have been prosecuted or convicted of promoting military action against the country – which could include opposition leaders like Nobel Peace Prize winner Maria Corina Machado, who has been accused by the ruling party of calling for international intervention like the one that ousted former president Nicolas Maduro.
The bill now goes before interim president Delcy Rodriguez, who pushed for the legislation under pressure from Washington, after she rose to power following Maduro's capture during a US military raid on January 3.
The law is meant to apply retroactively to 1999 – including the coup against previous leader Hugo Chavez, the 2002 oil strike, and the 2024 riots against Maduro's disputed reelection – giving hope to families that loved ones will finally come home.

Some fear, however, the law could be used by the government to pardon its own and selectively deny freedom to real prisoners of conscience.
Article 9 of the bill lists those excluded from amnesty as "persons who are being prosecuted or may be convicted for promoting, instigating, soliciting, invoking, favoring, facilitating, financing or participating in armed actions or the use of force against the people, sovereignty, and territorial integrity" of Venezuela "by foreign states, corporations or individuals".
Venezuela's National Assembly had delayed several sittings meant to pass the amnesty bill.
"The scope of the law must be restricted to victims of human rights violations and expressly exclude those accused of serious human rights violations and crimes against humanity, including state, paramilitary and non-state actors," UN human rights experts said in a statement from Geneva Thursday.

Genuine will?
Hundreds, perhaps thousands, of Venezuelans have been jailed in recent years over plots, real or imagined, to overthrow the government of Rodriguez's predecessor and former boss Maduro, who was in the end toppled in the deadly US military raid.
Family members have reported torture, maltreatment and untreated health problems among the inmates.
The NGO Foro Penal says about 450 prisoners have been released since Maduro's ouster, but more than 600 others remain behind bars.
Family members have been clamoring for their release for weeks, holding vigils outside prisons.
One small group, in the capital Caracas, staged a nearly weeklong hunger strike which ended Thursday.
"The National Assembly has the opportunity to show whether there truly is a genuine will for national reconciliation," Foro Penal director Gonzalo Himiob wrote on X Thursday ahead of the vote.
On Wednesday, the chief of the US military command responsible for strikes on alleged drug smuggling boats off South America held talks in Caracas with Rodriguez and top ministers Vladimir Padrino (defence) and Diosdado Cabello (interior).
All three were staunch Maduro backers who for years echoed his "anti-imperialist" rhetoric.
Rodriguez's interim government has been governing with US President Donald Trump's consent, provided she grants access to Venezuela's vast oil resources.

USSF Wants to Get Battle Management Tools from Lab to Operations Faster
Unknown

The Space Force team responsible for developing advanced battle management capabilities wants to create a better pipeline for mature space domain awareness tools to move from the lab into the hands of operators.
Lt. Col. Collin Greiser, system program manager for advanced space battle management, said the service has already taken a key step toward strengthening that connection by moving a key experimentation lab under his portfolio—the Space Domain Awareness Tools, Applications, and Processing Laboratory, or SDA TAP Lab. The hub was established in 2023 to help hone new C2 tools from industry and academia and quickly deliver them to users.
Speaking Feb. 19 during a SpaceNews webinar, Greiser said that over the next 18 months, his team is working to funnel more of those SDA TAP Lab tools, as well as other capabilities from industry, into a key space battle management system called Kronos.
“We have to get things to a program of record or, at the and of the day, it just doesn’t matter to me or the warfighters,” Greiser said. “Moving the lab underneath Kronos has really started that transition. . . . In the short-term, my goal is really to boost the amount of capability that we’re taking from the lab and putting in my program.”
Through Kronos, the Space Force has been consolidating legacy systems that provide operators—battle managers in particular—with intelligence tools and command-and-control capabilities to help decipher threats and make rapid decisions about how to respond. The system is used by the National Space Defense Center, Space Force component commands, and the multinational Combined Space Operations Center.
In November, Space Systems Command released a commercial solutions opening for Kronos, a mechanism to draw in more innovative tools from industry on a faster and more regular cadence. Specifically, its looking for solutions across three areas: command and control, battle management, and space intelligence. These include advanced cloud-native services and infrastructure, AI decision support tools, and a “space attack planning toolkit” meant to improve coordination between tactical and operational units and speed up decision-making.
Maj. Sean Allen, who leads the SDA TAP Lab, said tools that increase automation and shorten decision-making timelines are particularly important for space battle managers who must make sense of indications and warnings and determine what’s a threat and what isn’t.
“Prior to a military action, all of the intelligence prep of the battle space, all of the hostile intent assessments, all the planning that goes into how to I respond, all those nonlethal actions—there’s a great deal of opportunity to integrate services together into automated workflows to aid the human in interpreting that data,” Allen said during the same event.
The program received a flood of responses to its November notices and is holding an industry day next month to give companies more insight into its vision.
While creating stronger integration and collaboration is a near-term goal, in the longer term, Greiser and his team are considering building an unclassified environment where tools matured through the SDA TAP Lab can be funneled even more directly into Kronos.
“We’re looking at, do we build an environment—unclassified—that has a natural pipeline to Kronos, it’s already connected, so that once applications are done, they just click a button and move them right over if they’re ready,” Greiser said. “Then, by nature of being under a program, you now have access to contracting resources and funding and kind of more government support that can really help some of these companies.”
Greiser noted that the commercial solutions opening will help build a pool of capabilities that can be accessed as needs arise and new threats emerge. Allen noted that the TAP Lab, similarly, has a catalog of tools on standby.
“We’re basically lining up the lab and the Kronos program to be able to have that catalog so that when an operator comes to me, because I talk to them all the time, and says, ‘I need an answer to this challenge,’ I can be like, ‘I’ve got one right here. Let’s work on getting that on contract,’” Greiser said.

Former MP Rory Amon allegedly sexually abused 13-year-old in carpark bathroom

Former MP Rory Amon’s alleged child sexual assault victim breaks down in court
Updated ,first published
Warning: Graphic content
A man has broken down in court as he described alleged sexual assaults by former NSW MP Rory Amon in a car park bathroom when he was 13, saying his feelings quickly turned from “giddy and excited” while they chatted online to fear once they met up in person.
Amon, 35, has pleaded not guilty to 10 counts over two alleged incidents while he was a Northern Beaches councillor, including five counts of sexual intercourse with a child between the ages of 10 and 14, two counts of indecent assault of a person under 16, two counts of attempted sexual intercourse with a child between the ages of 10 and 14, and committing an act of indecency with a person under 16.
During opening addresses on Friday, Crown prosecutor Meaghan Fleeton told the jury they will hear evidence that the boy told Amon he was 15 at the time they connected on a dating app in June or July 2017.
The defence argued that Amon, who was 27 at the time, believed he was communicating with someone aged at least 16.
While testifying, the now-22-year-old described making a profile on a gay dating app when he was 13 and in year eight because he wanted “connection [and] attention”, adding he was “very insecure”.
He said he lied about his age to create a profile, as the minimum age was 18, using a photo of his upper body because he wanted to remain anonymous.
While he could not remember whether he first reached out to Amon, he said he was surprised that most of the users were older men and did not think he would have spoken first.
The man - who cannot be identified for legal reasons – said the pair spoke briefly on the app before moving to Snapchat at Amon’s request, as messages and photos are deleted there.
He testified that he remembered telling a friend that he was “essentially excited and felt a bit giddy … and felt it was the precursor to something romantic”.
The complainant said the pair discussed meeting up in person. Amon offered to pick him up but because he was a stranger, they agreed on meeting outside the then-teenager’s parents’ northern beaches apartment, where he lived.
Despite there being parking available out the front, the man said, Amon chose to park further down the street. He told his parents he was going for a run and met Amon out the front before taking him into a communal courtyard.
At this point, he said, Amon asked to go somewhere “more quiet”.
“He was looking around and noticed a flight of stairs and that leads down to the garage and I kind of followed him,” the man said.
“I said we could just hang out in that corridor that leads down to the garage because I was feeling a bit scared by this point”.
‘I knew it was so gross, and I didn’t want to do it again ... I just got stressed out and blocked him on Snapchat.’The complainant
The boy said he followed Amon into a bathroom in a shared garage car park and closed the door.
As Fleeton showed the boy photos of the corridor and bathroom, he put his head in his hands and broke down. Asked by the judge if he wanted a break, he said he did not, and continued answering questions.
Amon is accused of committing several sexual assaults inside the bathroom, including oral sex. After the alleged acts, which are too graphic to detail, Amon allegedly asked the boy if he “had ever done anything like this before”, and he replied “no”, to which Amon said “good”.
Later that night, he said, Amon sent him a sexual message via Snapchat.
The pair continued communicating over the next few days and arranged to meet a second time inside the same bathroom, the man said.
This time, Amon brought a towel with him before allegedly committing the second set of sexual assaults.
After the alleged assaults, the pair parted ways. The man described Amon being “very insistent” on meeting again for more sexual acts, but he “didn’t know how to say no”.
“I still didn’t have the vocabulary to describe what, like, happened in terms of how it made me feel,” he said.
“But I knew it was so gross, and I didn’t want to do it again … I made up that I was moving away … And I just got stressed out and blocked him on Snapchat”.
This was the last time the pair met in person.
The court heard that afterwards, the complainant told his school’s wellbeing teacher about the alleged sexual assault, but was reluctant to provide details.
The experience worsened his anxiety and depression, he said.
“I just felt very detached from reality; I just kind of would go from having, like, outbursts of cries and kind of just sitting in bed staring at the wall,” he said.
The court earlier heard that the teacher told police and the boy’s mother about the disclosure. Police spoke briefly with the boy, but the investigation was suspended as he still did not feel comfortable elaborating. The court heard the boy also confided in his friends and psychologist, who will be called to testify.
Some time in 2019 or 2020, the pair reconnected on Snapchat for “just a couple of weeks”, Fleeton said in her opening address, adding that the boy “found out some information that identified this accused as being the councillor for the Narrabeen Ward of the Northern Beaches Council”.
“That was the first time he became aware of the identity of the accused,” she said.
In late June 2022, the complainant formally reported the matter to police. He was by then 18.
One month later, the Crown alleges, there was “some brief contact” between the pair on the dating app Grindr.
Amon was first spoken to by police in March 2024 and was arrested three months later.
“It is very important to note that due to the complainant’s age, he could not consent to … any of the sexual acts that comprise counts on the indictment,” Fleeton said.
Delivering his opening address, Amon’s lawyer Matthew Johnston, SC, did not dispute that the pair connected online and engaged in sexual activity, but disputed that they met up twice.
He argued that “at no point did the complainant provide Mr Amon his real age”.
Johnston said that Amon’s case was that he “held an honest and reasonable belief at all times that [the boy] was at least 16 years of age, and that is an innocent state of mind”.
The trial before Acting Justice Robert Allan Hulme continues.

Austrian climber found guilty after girlfriend froze to death on mountain

Austrian climber found guilty after girlfriend froze to death on mountain
An Austrian climber has been found guilty of gross negligent manslaughter after his girlfriend froze to death on Austria's highest mountain last year.
The man, named only as Thomas P in line with Austrian privacy laws, has been given a five-month suspended sentence and fined €9,600 (£8,400).
His girlfriend, Kerstin G, died of hypothermia during a climbing trip on the Grossglockner mountain in January 2025.
In a statement sent to the BBC, the court said it considered Thomas P's previous clean record and the loss of a person close to him "to be mitigating factors".
It said it also took into account "the public discussion on social media, which was incriminating for the defendant".
The judge, Norbert Hofer, himself an experienced climber who works with mountain and helicopter rescue teams in Tyrol, said Thomas P was an excellent Alpinist, but that his girlfriend was light-years behind him in terms of her climbing abilities.
He said the couple should have turned back as Kerstin G did not have enough experience in winter conditions.
The court also heard from Andrea B, a former girlfriend of Thomas P, who described how he had left her alone on a previous tour on the Grossglockner in 2023.
She said she had been at the end of her tether, feeling dizzy and her headlight had gone out.
She said she was crying and screaming when he suddenly disappeared, walking ahead and leaving her behind.
According to reports in the Austrian media, the court heard how the mountain rescue team found Kerstin's body hanging upside down from a rock face.
"We were amazed that she remained in that position," one of the rescuers told the court. If the wind had been any stronger, "she would have fallen over the south face".
The prosecution said there were strong winds of up to 74 km/h (45 mph), and was very cold. It was -8C, with a windchill temperature of -20C, they said.
They argued that as the more experienced climber, Thomas P was "the responsible guide for the tour".
They said he failed to turn back or call for help in time to help his girlfriend.
Thomas P should never have allowed himself to get into this situation, the prosecutor said.
Thomas P pleaded not guilty. He told the court he was deeply sorry. He said he had loved his girlfriend, who was very sporty and that they had planned the trip together.
His lawyer Kurt Jelinek said the couple had found themselves in a really difficult and stressful situation.
He said Kerstin was not inexperienced and knew what she was getting into.
Prosecutors say the couple got stuck on the mountain and that the man failed to call the police and did not send any distress signals when a police helicopter flew overhead at around 22:30.
Video footage from the helicopter showed the couple still climbing. The judge noted that no distress signals were sent.
The defence argued that at that point Thomas P and girlfriend still felt fine and did not call for help as they were close to the summit.
Webcam images show lights from their torches as they scaled the mountain.
But shortly afterwards, the defence said the situation changed dramatically, when Kerstin became exhausted close to the summit.
The defence said that she told Thomas P to go to get help.
At 00:35 on 19 January, he called the mountain police. The content of the conversation is disputed. Rescuers said it wasn't an emergency call but the lawyer says he denies telling police that everything was fine.
He scaled the summit and descended on the other side, leaving Kerstin behind. Prosecutors say he left her at 02:00 am.
Webcam images show his torchlit figure coming down from the summit.
The trial sparked interest and debate, not just in Austria but in mountain climbing communities far beyond its borders, raising questions about when personal judgement and risk-taking become a matter of criminal liability.
The case is subject to appeal.

How U.S. Women’s Hockey Took Gold and Glory in Incredible Overtime Win Over Canada
Unknown
Unknown Publisher

01:10:03 UTC
10:10:03 KST

Megan Keller’s move on the Milan ice, in the women’s Olympic hockey gold medal game between the most heated of rivals, the United States and Canada, was one of the filthiest things you’ll ever see on a frozen surface. Beautiful, thrilling, absolute filth; something so dirty, so nasty, you’ll want to relive it over and over again, to appreciate it, and respect it. Even if you’re pulling for Canada, the victim of the American’s killer stickwork. Because as a Canadian, you love your national pastime. And Keller honored the hell out of it.
Keller, in the fifth minute of sudden-death overtime on Thursday, received a long pass from Taylor Heise. It was the kind of pass that Olympic overtime rules—3 skaters versus 3 skaters instead of the usual 5 on 5, leaving more open space than a Saskatchewan prairie—encourage.
“Meg was flying up the ice, and she was calling for the puck,” says Heiss. “So I chucked it up to her.” Keller took the puck up the left side as Canada's Claire Thompson charged towards her. Keller read Thompson’s movements like a physicist. As she flicked the puck past Thompson, who couldn’t stop her momentum, Keller at the same time skated around her. PhD-level juke job.
She then sealed the deal. Keller retrieved the pass to herself, and one-timed a backhander underneath Canadian keeper Ann-Renée Desbiens.
“Pretty sick move,” says Swiss bronze medalist Alina Müller, Keller’s teammate with the Boston Fleet of the Professional Women’s Hockey League.
“Unbeliveable,” says Team USA’s Laila Edwards. “It doesn't surprise me. Because I know she's got those things up her sleeve.”
The goal gave the United States a 2-1 victory, and its third-ever women’s Olympic hockey gold medal. Either Canada or the U.S. has won every single Olympic gold since women’s hockey was introduced to the Games in 1998. Canada has 5, the U.S. 3. They’ve met in all but one final. The U.S. last won eight years ago, in PyeongChang, against—who else?—Canada.

Kudos to both of these teams. They’re in the habit of delivering gold medal epics, and the 2026 version ranks right up there as one of the most intense sporting events one can witness. And though Milan’s Santagiulia Ice Hockey Arena has been much maligned, for barely being ready in time for the hockey tournament, its acoustics met the moment.
Canada came into the game in an unfamiliar position: as the underdog. The U.S. had outscored its opponents 31-1 in the Milano Cortina Olympic tournament before this game. The team embarrassed Canada, 5-0, in the preliminary round, and swept the North American neighbor in four straight Olympic tune-ups.
But to no one’s surprise, Canada fought to prevent an American coronation. After a scoreless first period, the defending Olympic gold medalists, too prideful to roll over, got on the scoreboard first. Early in the second period, Kristin O’Nell converted a 2-on-1 opportunity to give Canada a 1-0 lead. In the hunt for their own goal, the Americans kept knocking on the door, but couldn’t break through. A Britta Curl-Salemme hit on Canada’s Erin Ambrose, with just over six minutes left in the game, charged the arena. The penalty felt like American frustration. But over the next two minutes, the United States locked in to kill Canada’s advantage, and kept pushing and pushing, and the noise grew louder and louder. Gold medal hockey sparks a beautiful sound.
With just over two minutes left, the United States pulled stalwart goaltender Aerin Frankel off the ice, for the 6-on-5 advantage. Off a faceoff, with just over two minutes remaining in the game, Edwards blasted the puck towards the Canadian net. U.S. captain Hilary Knight got a stick on it, producing enough misdirection to sneak it past Desbiens. Game tied, United States survival, pandemonium. Knight’s goal, in her fifth and last Olympics, gave her 15 career goals and 33 points in the Games, both new American Olympic records. “She’s the best player of all-time,” says U.S. defenseman Lee Steicklein.
Knight, in turn, gives her teammates their flowers. “This is the best U.S. hockey team I’ve ever been a part of,” she says.
“We’re going to win the game. It’s that simple,” Knight recalls thinking after her late-game score tied the game, at 1-1. “Here we go. This is ours.”
Knight didn’t only break individual records and win a second gold medal in the 2026 Games. She also proposed to Britanny Bowe, the U.S. speedskater, yesterday. The couple is now engaged. “I was more nervous for the proposal than I was for the gold medal game, to be honest,” Knight said. “My legs felt like jello.”
In overtime, Keller—a Michigan native who attended Boston College and was playing in her third Olympics—went to work. After the game, some American players said they hadn’t seen Keller’s goal, as it happened in a flash. They were too busy mobbing each other to immediately check their devices for a replay. “I’m very excited to get to my phone after this and really burn it into my memory,” says Heise.
Keller says she may have made that juke move in practice: a few of her U.S. teammates attest that they’ve seen it before. “I wasn’t really thinking, or had planned anything,” she said. When the United States last bested Canada and won gold in women’s hockey in PyeongChang, it did so in similarly memorable fashion. During a shootout, a dipsy-do from Jocelyne Lamoureux-Davidson gave the Americans the score that ultimately won them the gold. A coach had given that maneuver a name: the “Ooops … I Did It Again.”
Does Keller have a name for hers?
Not yet, she says.
Knight chimes in with a suggestion.
“The Megan Keller.”
That works.

Police in Idaho search for suspect who stole ambulance, drove into building that houses DHS offices
Authorities in Idaho are searching for a suspect who they said stole an ambulance outside a hospital, poured an accelerant over it and drove it into a nearby building housing U.S. Department of Homeland Security offices

Authorities in Idaho were searching Thursday for a suspect who they said stole an ambulance outside a hospital, poured an accelerant over it and drove it into a nearby building that houses U.S. Department of Homeland Security offices.
Meridian Police Chief Tracy Basterrechea didn't identify the substance poured on the inside and outside of the ambulance. “It appears the suspect was unable to ignite the accelerant before being scared off by responding agencies,” he said in a statement.
The incident occurred at about 11:10 p.m. Wednesday in the Boise suburb of Meridian, police said.
The suspect took the ambulance from St. Luke's hospital and drove it north through a parking lot, Basterrechea said. The suspect then retrieved gas cans from nearby vegetation, he said.
Images broadcast on television show shattered glass doors at the entrance to an office building.
The building is owned by St. Luke's Health System, and is one of several in a large business complex known as The Portico, next door to the hospital. Other tenants at Portico North include health insurance company SelectHealth Inc., St. Luke’s Home Health and Hospice and Quest Diagnostics.
The hospital has faced criticism for leasing space to the Department of Homeland Security while President Donald Trump's administration carries out his immigration enforcement crackdown.
“There has been a lot of rhetoric” on the issue of the lease, Basterrechea said, adding that “comments on social media such as ‘property damage isn’t violence’ is absolutely false.”
He called the incident “a serious criminal act.”
“This was absolutely an act of violence, and if the suspect had not been interrupted, there is no doubt this building would have been burned, putting the lives of first responders and others at risk,” Basterrechea said.
He said his department was leading the investigation and was working with the Federal Bureau of Investigation, DHS and other agencies.

Indonesia seals ‘great’ US trade deal, agrees to send 8,000 troops to Gaza
A US general said Jakarta will take a deputy commander role in the international stabilisation force in Gaza
Indonesia also agreed to address non-tariff barriers to US goods and to remove restrictions on exports to the US for critical minerals and other industrial commodities, the White House said.
Indonesian and US companies also reached 11 deals this week worth US$38.4 billion, including purchases of US soybeans, corn, cotton and wheat, cooperation in critical minerals and oilfield recovery, and joint ventures in computer chips.
“We have negotiated very intensively over the last few months, and I think we have reached solid understandings on many issues,” Prabowo told business executives on Wednesday at the US Chamber of Commerce.
A White House statement called it a “great deal” and said it “will help both countries to strengthen economic security, promote economic growth and thereby continuously lead to global prosperity”.

Ohio sex worker sentenced in ‘serial murder’ case after killing 4 men
Rebecca Auborn, 35, received four consecutive life sentences after intentionally overdosing the men, believed to be customers
- Bookmark
A sex worker from Ohio has been sentenced in what the state’s attorney general called a “serial murder” after killing four men.
Rebecca Auborn, 35, received four consecutive life sentences with the possibility of parole after 60 years during a Thursday hearing where her victims’ loved ones spoke out.
"No matter how much torment this has caused, I could not ever bring myself to hate you and I never will," Christyn Crockett, the daughter of victim Wayne Akin, told the court, per The Columbus Dispatch.
From December 2022 to June 2023, Auborn met men for sex in exchange for money across Columbus and then intentionally overdosed the victims with fentanyl to steal from them, according to Ohio prosecutors.
Four men overdosed as a result of Auborn’s actions: Joseph Crumpler, a 30-year-old from North Linden who died in January 2023; Robert Snoke, a 54-year-old from Pataskala who died in April 2023; Wayne Akin, a 64-year-old from the Northeast Side who died in April 2023 and Guy Renda, a 42-year-old from Belpre who died in June 2023.
Akin’s daughter has said it’s unclear whether her father was Auborn’s client, per NBC News.
Another man, 61-year-old Richard Bixler of Columbus, had survived Auborn’s attempted overdose.
Auborn was indicted in September 2023 and pleaded guilty to four counts of murder and one count of felonious assault last December.
“This sentence reflects the defendant’s disregard for life and the callousness not only to kill, but to do it repeatedly,” Ohio Attorney General Dave Yost said. “My heart goes out to the families who lost a loved one – I pray that this measure of justice brings them closure and peace.”
Crumpler’s brother, Mark Crumpler, said of Auborn in court, “I hope at the end of the day hell denies her the peace my brother now has,” The Columbus Dispatch reported.
Auborn’s attorney, Mark Hunt, said his client had been abused since before she was a teenager.
He said she is a different person now, and “if she had not confessed to these, you guys aren’t getting justice at all,” per The Columbus Dispatch.

MELBOURNE, Fla—Contractors Northrop Grumman and Embraer are teaming up to offer the Air Force and U.S. allies a tactical mobility aircraft—designed for aerial refueling and cargo transport—to support Airmen operating from remote airfields with soft-soil airstrips, company officials said Feb. 19.
The Northrop-Embraer partnership, formalized in a memorandum of understanding, will focus on modifying Embraer’s KC-390 Millennium aircraft to refuel the F-35 and other fixed wing aircraft used by the U.S. Air Force and other NATO allies, some of whom already own KC-390s. As part of the partnership, the companies plan to develop autonomous refueling boom for the KC-390 to augment its wing-mounted probe and drogue refueling system.
The KC-390 was designed to be a multimission aircraft capable of carrying up to 35 metric tons of fuel—23 in the wing-mounted fuel pods and 12 in additional tanks inside the central cargo area—over distances of 4,570 nautical miles. It can also carry 26 metric tons of cargo or 80 passengers.
Northrop and Embraer officials say they’re making the partnership will both address a gap in the air mobility market and respond to customer demands for the KC-390 to have even more more versatility.
“As I look at the marketplace and the installed base within our customers, really the next logical step for growth for recapitalization is the mobility market, and that is both in terms of cargo transport aircraft as well as tankers and refueling aircraft,” Tom Jones, president of Northrop Grumman Aeronautics Systems, told a group of reporters at Northrop’s Melbourne facility.
Aviation Week reported Feb. 18 that Northrop is pitching the upgraded KC-390 as one-third of a “family of systems” to the Air Force, which is seeking industry ideas for the future of its tanker fleet under a program dubbed Next-Generation Air Refueling System. The outlet reported that Northrop’s proposed family would include a large, blended-wing refueler, the KC-390 as a midsize tanker, and a small, uncrewed tanker.
Northrop Grumman officials declined to confirm the report.
Currently, the Air Force has a tanker fleet of roughly 500 aircraft, of which about 375 are KC-135 Stratotankers that average more than 63 years old. The service continues to buy new KC-46 Pegasus tankers and decided last July that it would forgo a competition for a “bridge tanker” between the Pegasus and the as-yet-undefined NGAS and buy more of KC-46s instead.
Northrop and Embraer officials are making the case that the midsized KC-390 would augment the strategic KC-46 as a tactical refueler/cargo aircraft that is suited for agile combat employment, or ACE—the Air Force’s strategy for deploying small groups of Airmen to stand up ad hoc airfields in austere locations. The KC-390 is equipped with eight wheels to distribute the weight of the aircraft during takeoffs and landings using soft-soil airstrips. It’s also capable of takeoffs and landings using air strips just under 1,000 feet, Embraer officials said.
“This is an agile combat employment type of aircraft when the KC-46 is not,” Jones said. “You can’t overlook the modularity aspect of this, if you’re fighting a dispersed conflict.”
Frederico Lemos, chief commercial officer for Embraer Defense and Security, said that allied countries are acknowledging the need for distributed battlefield operations, adding that the KC-390 is “already operational, already validated by allies and is aligned with agile combat employment.”
“Operations are moving closer to the fight and supporting dispersed forces across a wider battlespace,” he said. “And at the same time, the legacy tanker fleet faces a lot of challenges. … They are not fit for that mission.”
It’s still unclear how long it will take to develop an autonomous refueling boom, which could be mounted on the rear of the KC-390.
“We recognize that a dynamic environment associated with aerial refueling is difficult,” said Craig Woolston, vice president and general manager for research & advanced design at Northrop Grumman Aeronautics.
Woolston would not comment on specific details about the autonomous refueling boom programs but said “we believe we have all the pieces to integrate. Certainly, we are at the beginning of this journey. … I’ll say we’ve got an investment plan or a development plan laid out over the next couple of years.”
Jones added that Northrop is hoping “we get to demonstrations of the technology, I’ll say, in low single digit years.”
Embraer officials say the KC-390 can be reconfigured from a cargo aircraft to a refueler in less than five hours. It’s equipped with IAE V-2500 engines capable of a top speed of 470 knots or .8 Mach.
“We designed the 390 to be built for the future with the right architecture to be able to absorb new integrations, new systems that address the future challenges that we don’t see yet,” Lemos said. The aircraft features fly-by-wire technology and other autonomous systems in the cockpit “to ease up the work of our crews so that they can focus on the mission,” he said.
“It’s a nondevelopmental platform that we can enhance its capabilities to bring the right solution to add volume, agility and responsiveness to this force structure, while freeing strategic assets to do the missions that they are best suited to do.”
This is not the first time Embraer, a Brazilian firm, has tried to break into the U.S. market. It previously teamed with L3Harris to pitch the KC-390 as a tactical mobility aircraft before that partnership ended, and the U.S. Air Force bought a few of its A-29 Super Tucano aircraft as part of its Light Attack experiment, leading the firm to pitch it for the Armed Overwatch program.

Deadly California avalanche highlights inherent risks in the backcountry
The recovery of skiers killed in the deadliest U.S. avalanche in almost 45 years is dragging out because of what experts say is a prime rule for rescuers: Don’t make yourself a victim
- Bookmark
The recovery of skiers killed in the deadliest U.S. avalanche in almost 45 years is dragging out because of what experts say is a prime rule for rescuers: Don't make yourself a victim.
A storm that continued lashing California’s remote Sierra Nevada wilderness Thursday meant more avalanches were possible in the backcountry area where authorities said eight people died and one was still missing two days after their group was caught in the deadly slide. Six people survived.
Rescuers faced the same potential perils that killed the backcountry skiers and professional guides, as they pursued a sport with inherent risks that were compounded by several feet of new snow. Recovery efforts were set to resume Friday.
Last day of the trip
Backcountry winter travelers from skiers and snowboarders to snowmobilers and mountaineers lean on avalanche forecasts to help them gauge the danger. Yet conditions quickly shift because of turbulent mountain weather.
To supplement forecasts or if none is available, experienced skiers and guides will dig a pit in the snow to test how stable it is. They can also search out less-hazardous terrain, such as slopes that are not as steep or that are sheltered from known avalanche routes.
As the snow from the storm system hitting the Sierras this week piled up, the group of 15 skiers caught in Tuesday's avalanche were on the last day of a multiday trip and heading for the trailhead.
“It was, quite likely, very necessary for them to leave the backcountry so their hazard wasn’t increased further,” said Anthony Pavlantos of Utah-based Prival USA, who makes avalanche safety equipment and runs mountain safety programs.
“What’s really hard to say is like ‘why were they moving?’ You can’t ever start placing blame on events like this because we can all be there.”
‘Luck runs out’
It’s not uncommon for people to venture into the backcountry to ski or snowboard during times of heightened danger: A dangerous storm also means lots of fresh snow that many skiers crave.
And because fatal accidents are rare, the risk takers most often survive, said Dale Atkins, who has been involved in mountain rescues and avalanche forecasting and research in Colorado for five decades.
“It’s not about not going; it’s about where and when you go,” Atkins said.
But Atkins added that coming out of the backcountry unscathed can create a false sense of security in a pursuit where luck – or not enough of it – also plays a role.
“It’s really easy to be fooled by the snow and avalanches," he said. “We keep going out even in the worst of storms because that’s what we did last time, and then our luck runs out.”
Typically the best hope for someone to survive burial in an avalanche is to dig themselves out or be rescued by a companion. That is because slides often occur in remote areas.
It took rescuers six hours to reach the victims of Tuesday’s avalanche after the first report came in. By comparison, the chances of survival for someone buried for an hour is only about one in 10, Atkins said.
The surviving skiers in California found three of the victims while they awaited rescue. Authorities haven’t given a detailed account about how they located the other victims.
The probe line
A debris field from a major avalanche like the fatal one in California will stretch over a huge area, making it difficult to figure out where someone ends up if they are caught and dragged beneath the surface.
The first thing to look for is clues such as a glove or ski pole that could reveal a victim's location, said Anthony Stevens, chief adviser for the search and rescue team in Teton County, Wyoming, home to Grand Teton National Park.
Skiers in guided groups typically carry transceivers, known as avalanche beacons, that send out signals showing where they are. The devices can also receive other signals, displaying the direction and approximate distance to a victim.
If that doesn't work, rescuers can line up and use long, slender poles to probe into the snow in hopes of finding someone, said Ethan Greene, director of the Colorado Avalanche Information Center.
Time is of the essence throughout a rescue, and once someone is found they have to be dug out. The average depth of burial is roughly a meter, or just over 3 feet, Atkins said. And because snow and ice in an avalanche get heavily compacted, digging out someone from that depth requires moving at least a ton of material, he said.
Rarely will people survive being buried for long. Atkins said he knew of two people who survived being buried 22 and 24 hours respectively following an avalanche in the 1990s in Washington state. A third member of their party did not survive.
“It's very unusual for a rescue team to find a buried person alive. But it happens, and that gives us hope,” he said.

China ‘history fangirls’ visit mausoleums, write books, marking rapid growth in heritage tourism
Devotees of historical figures make pilgrimages to ancient sites to pay tribute, but concerns mount over environmental pollution
In quiet corners of China, a growing community is forging a deep, almost personal connection with history.
Known as “history fangirls”, they visit the museums and mausoleums, write books about them and are keen on related merchandise.
One such devotee, a woman known online as @bufashi, spent the past year visiting 52 gravesites, travelling through remote mountains and forests in search of the resting places of ancient Chinese figures.
Each solo trip is more than an act of remembrance; it is a way to connect with long-dead idols whose lives have shaped the present.
The phenomenon first gained traction last April, when some young people shared their Ching Ming Festival travels online, posting photographs of themselves leaving unusual tributes at mausoleums.
They offered painkillers and snacks to generals, wine and calligraphy brushes to poets.

WASHINGTON, February 20. /TASS/. US President Donald Trump announced that 50 million barrels of oil were being transported from Venezuela to Houston, Texas in the United States.
"We have a great relationship with a country named Venezuela. <...> They got a lot of oil, we do too. But we’re helping them a lot. We took 50 million barrels of oil. It's right now floating very nicely in extremely large ships to Houston," Trump said on Thursday, addressing his supporters at a steel plant in the state of Georgia.
On January 3, Washington announced a military operation in Caracas, as a result of which US servicemen captured Venezuelan leader Nicolas Maduro and his wife. On January 5, the couple appeared before a federal court in the Southern District of New York. They are charged with involvement in drug trafficking. Neither Maduro nor his wife pleaded guilty. Delcy Rodriguez, who served as executive vice president under Maduro, is currently acting as head of state in Venezuela.
On January 6, the US leader said Venezuelan authorities would transfer between 30 million and 50 million barrels of oil to the United States for sale, with him personally overseeing the proceeds from the transaction. Trump later noted that Venezuela would use the funds generated from the new oil deal solely to purchase US-made products.

‘Now he’s sweating’: British papers savage Andrew after shock arrest
The arrest of Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor on Thursday predictably dominates the front pages of the British press, with many papers pulling no punches on the latest ignominious episode for the former prince, which has left the monarchy reeling.
Mountbatten-Windsor’s glazed expression, slumped in the back of a Range Rover after 11 hours in police custody, stares out from newspapers across the board.
Leading the charge, The Sun makes a stinging callback to Mountbatten-Windsor’s infamous 2019 interview with Emily Maitlis on the BBC’s Newsnight program in which he claimed he was unable to sweat.
The paper says Mountbatten-Windsor appeared “stunned and wild-eyed” hours after being arrested on the morning of his 66th birthday, and notes he is the first member of the British royal family to be detained since King Charles I in 1647.
The Daily Mail, meanwhile, carries a stark single-word headline: “Downfall”. It suggests that Mountbatten-Windsor, “looking haggard, shamed and haunted”, has plunged the modern monarchy into its “gravest peril”.
Other papers, including The Guardian, The i Paper and the Daily Mirror, focus on King Charles’ reaction to his younger brother’s arrest with the statement that “the law must take its course”.
The Guardian notes it had been “an extraordinary day that could have profound effects for the royal family”.
Its front page points to an editorial suggesting that the old royal model of “discreet exile and silence” was now finished, with a case that “forces Britain to confront whether privilege can coexist with democratic scrutiny and the rule of law”.
Meanwhile, the UK’s last major broadsheet newspaper, The Daily Telegraph, as well as The Times keep it simple with variations of “Andrew arrested”.
The Times says the arrest has prompted the biggest crisis for the monarchy since the 1936 abdication, while the Telegraph writes that Mountbatten-Windsor, “born in a palace and spending his birthday in a police station”, emerged looking “like a man with the full weight of the past and the future on his shoulders”.
One Sandringham local told the Telegraph: “I think he should have been locked up a long time ago, a lot of us do. He’s always so miserable when you see him at Christmas. He’s got a miserable face”.
With a lighter touch, the tabloid Daily Star opts for a ribald “Taxi for Andy” splash.
“Ordinary Andy Windsor gets a lift away from a cop shop in Norfolk after being arrested on suspicion of misconduct in public office,” the paper opens with.
Taking a different angle, Scotland’s pro-independence daily The National throws the spotlight on other leading royals, including King Charles and the late Queen Elizabeth II. “What did they know?” the paper asks, above an image of Mountbatten-Windsor, Charles and their mother taken months before Epstein’s 2019 arrest.

‘My mother poisoned my father, and I had to live with the aftermath’

‘My mother poisoned my father, and I had to live with the aftermath’
They were more like sisters than mother and daughter because there was only a 17-year age difference.
Tracey Moss adored her mum, Lorraine. “To me, she was very beautiful, with straight, shoulder-length, mousy brown-coloured hair, much like mine,” she recalls.
She also loved her dad, John, who with his swept-back rocker-style black hair resembled an Australian larrikin version of Elvis. Tracey remembers family camping trips, teasing John about his concealed bald patch, and growing up in what she believed was a loving family.
Until it wasn’t.
Long before Erin Patterson used poisonous mushrooms to kill three family members and nearly a fourth with deadly homemade beef Wellingtons, Lorraine was lacing her husband’s food with arsenic.
In the Patterson case, it would take just days for her three victims to die. In the Moss case, it would take more than five agonising years in what a homicide detective would later describe as “cold-blooded torture”. When he died, John Moss was found to have 80 times the normal level of arsenic in his system.
As his health collapsed, he developed a tolerance to arsenic, until he ingested four massive doses in the eight weeks before he died.
Now, 42 years later, Tracey is ready to tell her story. How she became estranged from her mother, how she had to live with rumours that she was responsible for the death, the years not knowing what had happened to her father, and the battle to win back custody of his grave from the woman who killed him.
It wasn’t a shotgun wedding, but close to it. Lorraine was 17 and already pregnant; Johnny was 21 and working at a local meat-processing plant.
They had met only months earlier in 1965 at the Golden Square Fire Brigade country dance.
They had two girls and a boy in four years and bought a weatherboard home in Upper Road, California Gully, Bendigo. He worked at Mayfair Hams & Bacon in the gut line, where his job was to open up slaughtered pigs.
He was tough, having survived a near-fatal road collision, and was rarely sick.
In November 1978, he became ill, and began to suffer from unexplained night sweats, stomach cramps and diarrhoea. After he died in January 1984, homicide detectives asked Lorraine if there had been arsenic in the house.
The widow responded: “There’s never been any of that around here.” But her 17-year-old daughter, Tracey, remembered differently: “Yes we did, remember – we bought it for Dad once, years ago.”
Police later found a tin of Lanes brand arsenate bought from a local nursery in 1978 – around the time Johnny Moss first reported feeling ill.
After tests ruled out gastroenteritis, doctors looked to his workplace, suspecting leptospirosis – a disease found in vets, slaughter men and those who deal with domestic animals. Johnny Moss was an obvious candidate, and it was suggested he had been infected from the slaughtered pigs.
He recovered, but entered a cycle of ill health, suffering bouts of fatigue, dizziness and numbness in his fingers and toes. In September 1982, he went to his doctor after a vomiting attack. Tests were inconclusive and within weeks Moss recovered – temporarily.
The pattern continued for two years. He would appear to improve, then each relapse left him weaker than before.
Tracey writes in the diary she is publishing: “By mid-April/May [1983], my dad started becoming more noticeably ill with bouts of ‘flu-like’ and ‘gastro-like’ symptoms. A mystery illness, initially thought to be an animal disease from his workplace handling pigs and cattle, but was evading detection from diagnosis and the theories of doctors.”
Her father was moved to Melbourne for specialist care. “My mum would stay at the hospital accommodation, about 100 metres from the Austin Hospital,” Tracey writes.
“Mum was there to help him with almost every task. Showering, going to the toilet, and helping to lift him every time he needed to transfer from where he was lying or seated. He had become very picky with food as he often had mouth ulcers, stomach pains and nausea.
“Mum set up a mattress in our lounge room, so Dad could lie and watch the television and be with us all as a family. He was no longer comfortable sitting in our lounge chairs.
“He went from a walking frame to a wheelchair and back to a walking frame, each time needing to relearn how to move his legs and walk again. He was so determined and motivated to beat this horrible, unexplained illness he was suffering so dreadfully from.”
Playing the dutiful wife, Lorraine would take him in a wheelchair to the local pub to see his mates.
In August 1983, doctors took nail and hair samples to test for lead arsenic poisoning. In an act described by a Supreme Court judge nine years later as “gross carelessness”, the results were mislaid and didn’t get to the doctors at the Austin Hospital until January 12, 1984. It was too late – Johnny Moss died the next day. He was 40.
If the tests had been checked earlier, it is likely he would have survived, as the fatal doses were delivered months later.
“Dad was released from the hospital just before Christmas 1983, and we spent the next few weeks together as a family,” Tracey writes. “Dad’s condition had stabilised, but there were still some worrying factors about his condition. He had lost weight but looked bloated from medications.
“Although I didn’t know it, I said goodbye to my dad for the final time on the morning of Wednesday, January 11, 1984. I shared a kiss with both my parents and told them I would see them soon.”
She stayed with her grandparents that night and on January 13, John died. The case was referred to the homicide squad.
“Detective Jack [Jacobs] from the homicide squad in Melbourne introduced himself and his colleague, then sat beside me on the couch and said: ‘Your dad had high levels of arsenic in his system, and we are here to find out how it got there.’
“I will never forget those words. My first reaction was total disbelief and thinking that was a crazy statement to make,” Tracey recalls.
From the beginning, police suspected the killer was a family member, and Tracey would later find out some relatives considered her a suspect, nominating her as “just as nutty as Lorraine”.
For the homicide squad, it soon became clear that Lorraine was the killer. They concluded she hated her husband and was having an affair. They also established that his condition improved when he was in hospital and deteriorated in his wife’s care.
Tracey remembers how her mother had changed after John’s death, dyeing her hair blonde and wearing heavy make-up. “She lost a lot of weight and began wearing revealing clothing, such as short skirts and singlet tops. And Dad’s friend, Bobby, soon became ‘Mum’s friend’.”
Soon, he moved in and Tracey moved out. The mother and daughter who had been so close were estranged.
When they tried to re-engage years later, Tracey suspected her mother was trying to reinvent history. “Mum started asking about the past,” she writes. “About the police statements. About the decisions I had made as a terrified young girl caught in the middle of something far bigger than herself.
“These weren’t questions rooted in curiosity or healing, though – they were interrogations.”
In July 1986, Lorraine was charged with murder, but the case was dropped before trial. An inquest returned an open finding, leaving Tracey with no answers.
With no victim support group, Jacobs kept in touch with Tracey, an act of kindness she hasn’t forgotten. “Detective Jack contacted me occasionally. His calls were always kind, gentle and unexpected. There was something comforting in hearing from someone who understood the case.”
Lorraine carried her secret, but it was eating her soul. Believing there was a 15-year statute of limitations, she waited 16 years to let the demon out.
In April 2000, Lorraine told daughter Colleen: “I think I killed your dad, Col.”
When Tracey heard of her mother’s confession, she rang the man she knew had not forgotten the case: Jack Jacobs.
The retired detective contacted the homicide squad, and on January 17, 2001 – 17 years to the day after her house was first searched for poisons, and 15 years after she was first charged with murder – Lorraine was arrested again.
After her family confession, she overdosed on pills, confessing again to nurses. This time when police approached, she was broken. “Just lock me up,” she said.
Convicted, she was sentenced to a minimum of 18 years’ jail.
“She is a convicted killer,” Tracey writes. “She took my dad’s life. She caused lifelong trauma to her own children. She shattered our sense of safety, direction and belonging. She altered the entire course of our lives more than once.”
Finally, Tracey had some answers, but her battle was not over. She was to discover her father’s killer had custody of his grave.
It was not a one-off case. Several high-profile murder cases in which the killers had custody of the graves led to the government changing the law for cases from 2005 – too late for Tracey.
She battled bureaucracy and was forced to write a sugary-sweet letter to her mother asking her to relinquish control of the grave. She agreed.

Daytona 500 and NBA All-Star Game surge in viewers despite competition from Winter Olympics
The Daytona 500 and the NBA All-Star Game drew bigger TV audiences over last year, even with the Winter Olympics on
- Bookmark
The Daytona 500 and NBA All-Star Game posted audience gains on Sunday despite going up against the Winter Olympics.
Tyler Reddick’s win in the Daytona 500 drew an average of 7.49 million viewers on Fox, up 11% from last year. It was the most-watched NASCAR season opener since 2023, when 8.17 million viewers tuned in.
It was also the most-watched non-Olympic sporting event last week, according to Nielsen.
The audience peaked at 9.15 million for the finish.
The race also did not have a rain delay for the first time in three years, which helped bring in more viewers. Last year, the race was delayed for more than three hours, and the 2024 race was moved to Monday.
The NBA All-Star Game on NBC averaged 6.73 million viewers, but the total audience across NBC, Peacock, and Telemundo was 8.8 million, according to Nielsen and Adobe Analytics.
It was the most-watched NBA All-Star Game since 2011, which was also in Los Angeles and averaged 9.1 million.
This was the first time since 2002 that the All-Star Game was shown on network television. From 2003 to 2025, it was shown on TNT.
The total viewership was an 87% increase over last year (4.7 million). It peaked at 9.8 million viewers from 7-7:15 p.m. Eastern for the closing minutes of the USA Stripes’ 48-45 victory over the World team.
The All-Star Game aired between NBC's afternoon and prime time Olympics coverage.

As Netanyahu vows disarmament, new IDF assessment shows Hamas reasserting control in Gaza

An internal IDF assessment warning that Hamas is rebuilding its rule in Gaza has cast doubt on the viability of U.S. President Donald Trump’s Board of Peace initiative, even as Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu vows the terrorist organization will be disarmed “one way or the other.”
Reuters reported ahead of Thursday’s inaugural Board of Peace meeting in Washington that the IDF presented Netanyahu in late January with a detailed warning outlining steps Hamas has taken to preserve and restore its grip on the Strip following the October ceasefire.
According to the report, the IDF assessment warned that Hamas is working “from the bottom up” to maintain influence by embedding loyalists in government ministries, security bodies and local authorities. Fourteen of 17 Hamas-run ministries are currently operating, compared with five at the height of the war, and at least 13 of 25 local municipalities have resumed activity.
Reuters also reported that Hamas has appointed officials linked to its military wing to senior posts, replaced top figures in the interior and economy ministries, and continued collecting taxes, including on smuggled goods such as cigarettes, batteries, solar panels and mobile phones.
The IDF assessment cautioned that even if a U.S.-backed technocratic Palestinian committee formally assumes governance, Hamas could continue to wield real power absent disarmament.
IDF officials told Reuters that Hamas has used the ceasefire to rebuild its strength and consolidate control in areas under its authority. One Israeli source was quoted as saying that within territory not under IDF control, there is currently no effective opposition to Hamas.
A senior Israeli government source dismissed the possibility that Hamas would retain a governing role in Gaza, calling it a “distorted fantasy” and saying the terrorist organization is “finished as the governing authority in the Gaza Strip.”
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu reinforced that message in remarks delivered in Israel shortly before the Washington conference.
“We agreed with the United States — there will be no reconstruction of the Strip before the Strip is demilitarized,” Netanyahu said at a military officers’ graduation ceremony. “Very soon, Hamas will face a dilemma — to disarm peacefully or be disarmed forcefully.”
He added that Hamas would be disarmed “one way or the other” and that Gaza would no longer pose a threat to Israel.
Board of Peace launches amid uncertainty
The IDF warning came as Trump convened the first meeting of the U.S.-led Board of Peace for Gaza, unveiling financial pledges and security plans aimed at rebuilding the enclave once Hamas disarms.
At the meeting, Trump announced that contributing nations had raised $7 billion as an initial payment toward Gaza reconstruction and pledged an additional $10 billion from the United States. He did not specify the source of the U.S. funds or whether congressional approval would be required.
Contributing countries include Kazakhstan, Azerbaijan, the United Arab Emirates, Morocco, Bahrain, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Uzbekistan and Kuwait. The Board of Peace includes Israel but does not include Palestinian representatives.
Estimates for rebuilding Gaza — much of which has been reduced to rubble — range as high as $70 billion.
Trump acknowledged that Hamas’ disarmament remains uncertain.
“I think Hamas will give up their weapons — that’s what they promised. If not, the response they get will be very tough. Very tough,” he said.
He also said he expects to know within 10 days whether a deal can be reached with Iran over its nuclear program, warning that without a “meaningful deal,” “bad things will happen.”
Trump said the United Nations would provide $2 billion in humanitarian assistance and that FIFA would raise $75 million for soccer-related projects in Gaza. He added that Norway would host a future Board of Peace event, though Norway later clarified it was not joining the board.
International force and new police plan
A central component of the plan is the creation of an International Stabilization Force, or ISF, intended to help maintain security once deployed.
According to details presented at the meeting, the ISF would be led by U.S. Gen. Jasper Jeffers with an Indonesian deputy. It would initially deploy in Rafah, in southern Gaza, an area under full Israeli control after Israeli forces depopulated and demolished large sections during the war.
The force would include up to 20,000 troops and expand gradually across Gaza, which would be divided into five sectors, each assigned a battalion.
Indonesia, Morocco, Kazakhstan, Kosovo and Albania have agreed to contribute troops. Jordan and Egypt will not send forces but have pledged to assist in training. Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan expressed readiness to send Turkish troops, though Israel is expected to oppose such a move.
Alongside the ISF, the Board of Peace envisions establishing a new Palestinian police force to operate under a U.S.-backed technocratic committee led by Ali Shaath, intended to replace Hamas in governing Gaza.
Shaath said restoring security through the new police force is his top priority and announced a goal of recruiting and deploying 5,000 officers within 60 days, with the force eventually reaching 12,000. Training would involve Egypt and the ISF.
Nickolay Mladenov, a senior official involved in the Board of Peace, said recruitment began Thursday morning and that 2,000 Palestinians had applied within hours.
According to Reuters, eligibility criteria do not explicitly bar members of Hamas, raising concerns in Israel that the terrorist organization could attempt to infiltrate the new force. Hamas is believed to have around 10,000 personnel in its existing police apparatus.
Hamas has said it is prepared to hand over administration to the U.S.-backed technocratic committee but has not declared a willingness to disarm.
Hamas spokesperson Hazem Qassem said in a statement that the real test of the Board of Peace “lies in their ability to compel the occupation to halt its violations of the ceasefire” and begin a genuine reconstruction process.
U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio underscored the stakes.
“We have to get this right. There is no plan B for Gaza. Plan B is going back to war. No one here wants that,” Rubio said.

MOSCOW, February 20. /TASS/. Russian forces intensified strikes on Ukrainian military-industrial complex facilities and supporting energy sites in response to Kiev’s terrorist attacks in 2025, First Deputy Chief of the General Staff of the Russian Armed Forces and head of the Main Operational Directorate of the General Staff Sergey Rudskoy said.
"Last year, in response to terrorist attacks by the Kiev regime on civilian infrastructure in Russia, the Russian Armed Forces increased the intensity of strikes using long-range precision weapons and unmanned aerial vehicles on Ukrainian military-industrial complex sites and energy infrastructure supporting their operations," he told the Krasnaya Zvezda newspaper.
These measures have significantly reduced Ukraine’s capabilities to produce and equip its army with weapons and military equipment, Rudskoy noted.

Where King Charles’ brother Andrew shows up in the Epstein files
Sign up now: Get ST's newsletters delivered to your inbox
King Charles’ younger brother, Mr Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor, was arrested on Feb 19 on suspicion of misconduct in public office over allegations that he sent confidential government documents to the late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.
He was released later in the day and has not been charged with a crime.
The arrest follows the release by the US Justice Department of millions of Epstein-related documents, which have laid bare the close ties many prominent political and business figures had with the wealthy financier, who died in prison in 2019.
The former prince, 66, has already been stripped of his royal titles and evicted from his mansion due to his social and business relationships with Epstein.
In 2022, he settled a civil lawsuit brought by one of Epstein’s victims, who accused him of sexually abusing her when she was a teenager. He did not admit fault as part of the settlement, and his arrest was not related to her allegations.
Mr Mountbatten-Windsor has denied wrongdoing and expressed regret for his friendship with Epstein. He has said he never saw any sex crimes. His office did not respond to a request for comment following his arrest and he has not spoken publicly since the files became public.
Here is what the documents suggest about the relationship between Epstein and Mr Mountbatten-Windsor:
Internal government documents
E-mails released by the US appeared to show that Mr Mountbatten-Windsor forwarded official documents and other internal materials to Epstein in 2010, when he was a government envoy. Trade envoys are usually barred from sharing such materials under confidentiality rules.
In one message from November 2010, Mr Mountbatten-Windsor sent Epstein four British government visit reports covering Vietnam, Singapore, Hong Kong and Shenzhen, which had been provided to him minutes earlier by his palace adviser following an official trade trip to southern China and South-east Asia.
On the same day, Mr Mountbatten-Windsor also forwarded Epstein a series of files labelled “Overseas Bids 301110” that he had just received from his private office.
The documents also include detailed assessments of expenses relating to his commercial and charity work. A separate e-mail from Dec 24, 2010, showed Mr Mountbatten-Windsor sending Epstein a document he described as a “confidential brief” produced by the Provincial Reconstruction Team in Afghanistan, relating to proposed international investment opportunities. He asked Epstein for his comments and ideas.
Another e-mail from May 2010 referred to an earlier private discussion with Epstein about how to handle “responsibility” for financial matters. It was not clear whether the former prince was discussing actions in relation to his role as trade envoy or in another context.
Mr Mountbatten-Windsor wrote that there were “no problems” as long as he delegated any responsibility for investing to trusts, banks, investment vehicles or “trusted individuals”.
Additional correspondence showed Mr Mountbatten-Windsor sharing sensitive or internal information with an Abu Dhabi-based banker, including details relating to a possible approach to luxury carmaker Aston Martin. An aide of the former royal forwarded that exchange to Epstein. Other messages included discussions about financial issues and preparations for a planned trip to China in his role as trade envoy.
Investment possibilities
Other e-mails showed that Mr Mountbatten-Windsor appeared to be exploring a possible private venture with Epstein, called the Green Park Group, in 2010 while still serving as trade envoy. Separate messages showed discussions with a mutual acquaintance about an investment vehicle referred to as Witan Holdings.
A separate e-mail chain from July 2010 showed Mr Mountbatten-Windsor discussing a proposed US$8 billion “cash-for-oil” arrangement involving contacts in Abu Dhabi, Dubai and Libya. The e-mails described potential roles for senior figures in the United Arab Emirates and Libya, including an introduction to a top aide to Libya’s late ruler, Muammar Gaddafi.
A further set of e-mails showed Mr Mountbatten-Windsor discussing China-related commercial engagement in 2010, including preparations for a trip to Beijing and an “exchange deal of private placement for oil”.
Women
The documents showed that Mr Mountbatten-Windsor socialised with Epstein both before his 2008 conviction on charges of soliciting prostitution from a minor and afterwards.
In a 2009 deposition, Epstein’s former house manager Juan Alessi testified that Mr Mountbatten-Windsor stayed for weeks at a time at the disgraced financier’s estate and received “daily massages”. Mr Alessi was not reachable for comment. Mr Mountbatten-Windsor has denied any wrongdoing regarding his time with Epstein.
In 2010, shortly after Epstein’s house arrest ended, he e-mailed Mr Mountbatten-Windsor about a “beautiful” and “trustworthy” 26-year-old Russian woman with whom he thought the then Prince might enjoy having dinner. Mr Mountbatten-Windsor responded that he would be “delighted” to see her and asked: “Will she be bringing a message from you?”
The documents also included photos of Mr Mountbatten-Windsor lying across the laps of several women, whose faces were redacted. REUTERS

Jane Hume’s straight talk can get her in trouble, but she says the ‘time for timidity is over’

Jane Hume’s straight talk can get her in trouble, but she says the ‘time for timidity is over’
There’s a saying that Jane Hume cites often in interviews, particularly when she’s asked for advice: “Don’t get bitter, get better.”
After last year’s bruising election defeat, that’s what the Victorian Liberal senator sought to do.
She travelled to the United Kingdom and organised her own study tour with Conservatives who were involved in rebuilding the party in the 2000s, and others now grappling with the rise of Nigel Farage’s Reform.
Demoted to the backbench, Hume started working on policies that interested her, including a private bill that would allow couples to split their superannuation.
And she pushed through in public. “Rather than hide under the doona ... I was much more inclined to finally go to the hairdresser and get rid of the greys, and buy myself a new suit and a new lipstick, and put on the armour and get back out there,” Hume told the Future Women Leadership podcast last year.
As it happens in politics, fortunes turn: Hume, 54, is now back on the frontbench and her colleagues elected her deputy leader, 30 votes to 20, in last week’s spill.
She will take on the portfolios of workplace, industrial relations, productivity and deregulation in Angus Taylor’s new-look frontbench – an effort to spotlight the country’s productivity woes. After entering the Senate from the finance and banking sector 10 years ago, the mother of three from inner-city Melbourne is now the Liberal Party’s most senior woman.
This comes with the expectation she will appeal to urban professionals and women who have shunned the Liberals. Hume co-wrote the party’s 2022 election review, where she said those voters must be won back to form government. That didn’t happen, and with the party’s support at its lowest ebb in decades, her task is now far broader: she must help consolidate the Liberal base at large, and unite a fractured party room.
“The time for timidity is over,” Hume told this masthead this week. “I have no intention of being some sort of administrator or overseer of my party’s, and my country’s, orderly decline ... We shouldn’t be pussy-footing around trying to please everybody. We should be consistent about who we are and what we say.”
She said the Liberals had been risk-averse on health and childcare policy, as examples. “If we shy away from those conversations and putting forward genuine alternatives, well, we don’t deserve to win the hearts and minds of the people whose votes we seek.”
Hume isn’t much of a pussy-footer herself. For such a prolific media performer, that’s been problematic at times. Her resurgence is complicated by the fact she was the face of some of last year’s campaign’s major mistakes.
Her “Chinese spies” gaffe on morning television offended Chinese Australians and is credited for losing diaspora voters in droves. The work-from-home edict for public servants was so unpopular it was revoked before the election.
Hume has apologised for the “ill-considered” remarks and acknowledged the work-from-home crackdown policy was a mistake. In general, though, she doesn’t overdo contrition. “Look, haters are going to hate,” she says. “If I’m not going to do this, who will? You’ve got to be made of tougher stuff.”
Australians should expect more of Hume’s straight talking. Already this week, several days have involved back-to-back media interviews. “I don’t intend to waste a day,” she says. “If you’re not going to step out in front of the media … and articulate your principles, there’s no point being here.”
Hume knows being disliked is part of the job. She’s described an interaction on a quiet street, early one Saturday morning in the middle of a state election campaign: She was walking with her coffee and dry cleaning, dressed in activewear, when another woman came along.
“Just as she comes past me, she leans over and she goes: ‘You’re an idiot’. And then she kept walking,” Hume told the Future Women Leadership podcast. “That was the moment I realised I was really a politician because the first thing that went through my mind was: ‘Oh, my profile is improving.’”
But her charm and cheer also boost her appeal. Hume told that same podcast about working on a board with an intelligent and intense woman who would often, in the middle of explaining something or making an argument, break into a smile. “It’s impossible not to smile back – all of a sudden you’re drawn to this person,” she said.
“It was such a skill. So I have to admit, occasionally I use that trick if I feel like I’m in a difficult situation or a difficult interview: I will just beam for a moment. And it’s incredible the response you get.”
That’s even detectable at Senate estimates hearings – her welcome to ASIC chairman Joe Longo, for example, drew attention in 2024. (“Every time I see Mr Longo now, it seems to be at the gym on Saturday mornings, so I apologise for the Lycra. Less worthy men have seen me in far less,” Hume quipped, before a long pause. “Sorry, I forgot myself for a moment. I’m going to ask some questions about something serious now.” He joked in return: “I can reassure the committee that I will never be seen in Lycra.”)
Asked about this persona, Hume says: “You can be taken very seriously without losing your kindness. You don’t have to pick one or another.”
Hume grew up in a Liberal-voting household in Melbourne, handing out how-to-vote cards at election booths as a kid. Her parents had joined the Liberals during the Whitlam dismissal: her father was a small business owner and her mother a barrister.
Her first corporate job was in financial advice, soon after the introduction of superannuation, at the National Australia Bank. She then moved onto more senior roles at Rothschild, Deutsche Bank and Australian Super.
Politics had always been a hobby, until it morphed into something more, when Hume went back to university to study politics in her 30s while pregnant with her second child. She got more involved as a Liberal volunteer before the Victorian state president asked her to run for the Senate in the 2016 election.
She served as minister for financial services in the Morrison government, and was the finance spokesperson in the last parliament, before being dumped from the frontbench under Sussan Ley. That was fuelled by both her election errors and the fact MPs suspected Hume, a moderate, had backed Taylor, a conservative, in the first leadership ballot last May – it left a bitter taste for some of her like-minded colleagues, who were promoted to Ley’s shadow ministry.
From the backbench, Hume was frank about some of Ley’s calls. She said Ley’s demands for Kevin Rudd to be sacked as US ambassador were “a little bit churlish”, for example, and that she wouldn’t tell people what to wear, after Ley attacked Anthony Albanese’s Joy Division T-shirt. Last week, Hume was one of the first MPs to make the case for change, warning that the leadership and worsening polling results would lead to the Liberals being wiped out.
It has given some Liberal women the impression Hume was involved in undermining the party’s first female leader. But it also keeps with the character of a senator who hates group-think and describes herself as the first to interject when something’s off. “I actually think that we should have an obligation to dissent,” she’s said.
Hume is now keen to emphasise the common ground. “I believe the conservative-moderate divide in the Liberals is overblown. The things that we agree on are quite simple – lower taxes, fiscal responsibility, good economic management, and that the private sector should be encouraged,” she says.
“I just want the Liberal Party to be the best party it can be. I am very much a creature of my party, and I know that we can do this when we work together.”

Labor Secretary's husband barred from HQ after claims he sexually assaulted women there: MS Now

At least two female staffers have alleged that they were sexually assaulted at the Labor Department building by the husband of Labor Secretary Lori Chavez-DeRemer, MS Now confirmed on Thursday night.
Chavez-DeRemer's husband, Dr. Shawn DeRemer, has not been criminally charged, but has been barred from the Labor Department's headquarters in Washington, D.C., after the women detailed their claims to investigators, MS Now confirmed.
The New York Times first reported the situation on Thursday, citing people familiar with the situation and a police report.
"This is an active investigation by MPD's Sexual Assault Unit," a Washington Metropolitan Police Department spokesperson told CNBC when contacted about the Times' account of one accuser filing a police report in late January. "We cannot confirm the names of potential suspects or witnesses.
The women said Dr. DeRemer, who is an anesthesiologist in Portland, Oregon, "had touched them inappropriately at the Labor Department's building on Constitution Avenue," according to the Times.
"One of the incidents, during working hours on the morning of Dec. 18, was recorded on office security cameras," the Times reported, citing people familiar with the case.
"The video showed Dr. DeRemer giving one of the women an extended embrace, and was reviewed as part of a criminal investigation, one of the people said.
A source who spoke with MS Now said in that incident, Dr. DeRemer is seen giving that woman a hug that went on for too long and turned "creepy," according to that news outlet.
The Labor Department's inspector general, an internal watchdog, is investigating the situation, according to The Times. The paper also reported that Washington's Metropolitan Police Department on Jan. 24 filed a report about forced sexual contact at the department in December.
CNBC obtained a public copy of that police report, which says, "The complainant reported a sexual contact against her will" during an incident at 11:30 a.m. ET on Dec. 18 at the Department of Labor building.
The complainant's name was not given in the public copy of the report, nor was the name of the alleged assailant.
The inspector general's office would not confirm or deny it was conducting an investigation when contacted by CNBC.
Dr. DeRemer, the Labor Department, the Police Department and the White House did not immediately respond to requests for comment from CNBC.
The Times in late January reported that a member of Secretary Chavez-DeRemer's security detail with whom she had been accused of having a romantic relationship, had been placed on administrative leave pending an investigation by the inspector general.
The Labor Department's social media account in January posted a video that featured a slideshow of artworks depicting glorified scenes of American history.
The caption above that video said, "One Homeland. One People. One Heritage. Remember who you are, American."
Social media users noted similarities between the Labor Department's post and a Nazi Party slogan.
The slogan "Ein Volk, ein Reich, ein Führer," which the U.S. Holocaust Museum notes was used by Adolf Hitler and his Nazi Party, translates to "One People, One Country, One Leader."

Russia recruited over 1,000 Kenyans to fight in Ukraine – Le Monde
That is according to Le Monde, Ukrinform reports.
Kenyan MP Kimani Ichung'wah told parliament on Tuesday that "to date, more than 1,000 Kenyans have been recruited and have gone to fight in the Russo-Ukrainian war," citing a joint report from the intelligence services and the Directorate of Criminal Investigations. The figure is significantly higher than the 200 Kenyans previously mentioned by authorities.
He explained that the recruits leave the country on tourist visas and join the Russian army via Istanbul and Abu Dhabi. Kenyans working abroad also reportedly travel to Russia from their countries of residence. According to the MP, many signed military contracts promising monthly salaries ranging from EUR 920 to EUR 2,400 in Russia, arranged through a recruitment agency in Nairobi.
According to February estimates cited by the lawmaker, 28 recruits are missing, 35 are in camps or on military bases, 89 are on the front lines, and 39 have been hospitalized. Thirty Kenyans have reportedly been repatriated. Recruitment agencies are collaborating with corrupt employees at Nairobi airport, as well as with national employment services and employees of the Russian Embassy in Nairobi and the Kenyan Embassy in Moscow.
Uganda and South Africa are among the other African countries targeted for recruitment.

Death toll from Israel's genocide in Gaza higher than reported in first 15 months, says Lancet

According to a new study published in The Lancet Global Health, more than 75,000 Palestinians were killed in the first 15 months of Israel's genocide in Gaza, a figure significantly higher than the 49,000 deaths announced at the time by local health officials,
The peer-reviewed research has found that women, children and the elderly accounted for 56.2 percent of violent deaths during that period, a proportion it said broadly aligns with reporting by Gaza's health ministry.
The study, conducted by the Palestinian Center for Policy and Survey Research and led by Michael Spagat of Royal Holloway, University of London, surveyed 2,000 Palestinian households over seven days beginning on 30 December 2024.
"The combined evidence suggests that, as of January 5, 2025, 3–4 percent of the population of Gaza had been killed violently and there have been a substantial number of non-violent deaths caused indirectly by the conflict," the authors wrote.
16,300 non-violent deaths
Researchers estimated 75,200 violent deaths during the first 15 months of the carnage, along with 16,300 non-violent deaths linked to disease, accidents or other indirect effects of the Israel’s brutal war.
The authors described the survey as the first independent population-based assessment of mortality in Gaza that did not rely on administrative data from the health ministry.
Field staff conducted face-to-face interviews with households across Gaza's districts, asking respondents to list family members who had been killed.
Mortality estimates were calculated using weighted statistical analysis, and the results included a 95 percent confidence interval.
Gaza health authorities, whose figures the United Nations has long deemed reliable, now report more than 72,000 killed, with thousands believed to remain under rubble, including in half of Gaza that Israel now occupied.
The study's authors said their findings suggest the ministry’s figures may be conservative given the extreme conditions.

A week has passed since U.S. President Donald Trump's tantrum against President Isaac Herzog regarding the pardon the latter supposedly "refuses" to grant to the defendant Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. In the meantime, U.S. Ambassador to Israel Mike Huckabee, showered Herzog with compliments in an interview with Channel 12 and later sent him "reassuring messages" on WhatsApp, according to a source who saw them. At the President's Residence in Jerusalem, they want to believe that Huckabee was acting with the White House's approval.

Netanyahu Is Paving a One-way Street to a New Political Reality
President Herzog wants the attorney general to rescue him from the embarrassment of pardoning Netanyahu. The opposition party leaders have plenty of ideas, but implementing them is another story

Man emerges naked from stolen ambulance he took on joyride with patient inside
This is the moment that a naked man emerges from a stolen ambulance after he took a patient on a joyride.
On Tuesday (17 February), Wisconsin Rapids Fire Department responded to a call for medical service. As they were tending to the patient inside the ambulance, a 37-year-old man appeared and got into the vehicle’s driver seat.
He then drove the vehicle away with the patient still inside whilst the responders had exited the vehicle.
A police chase lasting over 40 minutes then followed, with the suspect only being stopped after a tire deflation device was deployed. Bodycam footage shows the moment the naked individual emerges from the vehicle.
He was booked at the Wood County Jail on an array of charges.
Both the suspect and the patient inside the ambulance were uninjured.

IMF to review new loan agreement for Ukraine in coming days
The International Monetary Fund has said its Executive Board will consider a new US$8.1 billion loan programme for Ukraine in the coming days.
Source: Reuters
Details: If approved, the new programme would replace the current US$15.5 billion IMF arrangement. It is intended to support Ukraine's economic stability and public spending as the country enters the fifth year of Russia's full-scale war.
IMF spokesperson Julie Kozack said Ukraine had met the prior conditions required to move forward with the request, including submitting draft legislation on the labour code and adopting the state budget.
She said that Ukraine's economic growth in 2025 is expected to be below 2%. The country's economy is expanding more slowly and with higher budgetary expenditure due to the war.
Quote from Kozack: "Russia's invasion continues to take a heavy toll on Ukraine's people and its economy."
Background:
- The IMF agreed to drop the prior actions required for a new US$8.1 billion lending programme for Ukraine, removing requirements on VAT for sole traders, duties on parcels, a tax on digital platforms and the retention of the wartime levy.
- It was also reported that the IMF Board of Directors may approve a new four-year Extended Fund Facility (EFF) programme for Ukraine in February, but this will depend primarily on whether Ukraine has fulfilled the previously agreed prior actions.

Ukraine war briefing: EU eager for membership talks with Kyiv to begin ‘as soon as possible’

The European Union is eager to begin Ukraine’s EU membership talks “as soon as possible”, European Council president António Costa has said, although he stopped short of setting a date. The US plan for an end to the war in Ukraine calls for Kyiv’s EU accession by January 2027, though experts generally consider that date highly unrealistic. “I cannot say if it’s in 2027 or even in 2026 or later, but what is important is we cannot lose the momentum,” Costa told reporters during a visit to Oslo.

The Russian-held Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant in south-eastern Ukraine is operating on its sole remaining outside power line after losing a backup line more than a week ago, the UN’s nuclear watchdog said on Thursday. In a statement, Rafael Grossi, director general of the International Atomic Energy Agency, said the Ferrosplavna-1 electric line went down on 10 February “reportedly as a result of military activity”. The plant, Europe’s largest with six reactors, was now operating with outside power only from the Dniprovska power line, he said.

More than 1,000 Kenyans have been lured to fight for Russia in its war with Ukraine, according to an intelligence report to the Kenyan parliament that highlights the scale of a Russian operation taking African men to the frontline. The majority leader of Kenya’s national assembly, Kimani Ichung’wah, said “rogue recruitment agencies and individuals in Kenya” were continuing to send Kenyan nationals to fight in the conflict. The figure of more than 1,000 individuals is a significant increase on the number given in a statement by Kenya’s foreign affairs ministry in November, which said that more than 200 Kenyans had travelled to fight in the war.

Poland’s defence minister Wladyslaw Kosiniak-Kamysz has told the AFP news agency that European allies – especially Italy, France and Spain – need to invest more in their defence spending. “The more Europe invests, the more seriously and respectfully America will treat us in these areas,” he said. Poland, which borders Russia and its close ally Belarus, has heavily ramped up its defence spending since the 2022 invasion of Ukraine.
-
Sweden has announced 12.9bn kronor ($1.4bn) in military aid for Ukraine, focused primarily on air defence capabilities. Defence minister Pal Jonson said that the military aid package was “the third largest so far that Sweden has delivered to Ukraine.”
-
Belarus, a close ally of Russia rarely invited to international gatherings, has said it had intended to attend the inaugural meeting of Donald Trump’s Board of Peace, but failed to receive the necessary visas. Belarus has long been subject to western sanctions over its human rights record and measures were intensified after president Alexander Lukashenko allowed his country’s territory to be used for Moscow’s 2022 invasion of Ukraine. Foreign minister Maxim Ryzhenkov had been due to attend the meeting in Washington, his ministry said, adding “what kind of peace and what kind of sequence of steps are we talking about if the organisers cannot even complete basic formalities for us to take part?”

Broncos fall short of another miracle comeback in World Club Challenge

The Brisbane Broncos have lost 30-24 to English champions Hull KR in the World Club Challenge.
Brisbane trailed 30-4 in the 57th minute before a stunning comeback effort fell just short.
What's next?
The NRL season kicks off in Las Vegas on March 1.
Hull KR have hung on to beat Brisbane and win their maiden World Club Challenge 30-24 after thwarting a late comeback by the visitors in freezing conditions.
The Robins deserved their victory and the title of the planet's greatest club rugby league side after dominating for the majority of the clash at Hull's MKM Stadium.
It was a triumph for the ages for coach Willie Peters, whose team had been written off before the match by pundits in Australia.
Peters and his team have now won the quadruple — the Super League major and minor premiership, the Challenge Cup title and the World Club Challenge.
It was five tries each with Broncos captain Adam Reynolds landing just two from five conversion attempts, his last two misses proving crucial.
The Robins led 30-4 in the 57th minute after Peta Hiku followed a Tyrone May grubber.
The Broncos, famous for their threecomebackwins in the finals series last year to win the NRL title, clicked into gear.
"It was the longest 20-odd minutes of my life," a delighted Peters said.
"I am just really happy with the way they scrambled, fought and dug in to win.
"We were the underdogs. Not many people thought we could win."
Bench prop Ben Talty burst through to put Pat Carrigan over and a minute later winger Deine Mariner streaked down the right touchline.
Reece Walsh threw a corker to put centre Gehamat Shibasaki over and the Broncos had three tries in five minutes.
Robins five-eighth Mikey Lewis failed to find touch from a penalty at the death and the Broncos went the length through Kotoni Staggs to set up a thrilling final three minutes.
But Michael Maguire's side could not pull off another miracle.

A Russian general promoted by Putin sent his wife a photo of severed ears taken from Ukrainian POWs. She said they reminded her of beer snacks. RFE/RL has the messages.
The abuse of Ukrainian prisoners of war — beatings, torture, and extrajudicial killings — has been documented throughout Russia’s full-scale invasion. What has been harder to document is the chain of command behind it: who is informed and who issues the orders. Through an archive of personal messages, photographs, and videos obtained from a source within the Ukrainian military, journalists now have rare insight into Russian war crimes in Ukraine. In a new investigation, journalists at Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty’s investigative projects Skhemy and Sistema examined the private correspondence of Russian General Roman Demurchiev. They found that he had boasted to close contacts and fellow service members about torturing, executing, and desecrating the bodies of Ukrainian military personnel, including prisoners of war. The archive spans 2022 to 2024 and reveals not only Demurchiev’s own conduct but also the complicity of his superiors, up to the commander of a combined-arms army numbering in the tens of thousands. Meduza summarizes RFE/RL’s findings.
Roman Demurchiev, 49, enjoys a good reputation within the Russian military. He has attended meetings with senior commanders and has received numerous decorations. In 2023, President Putin promoted him to major general. Demurchiev served as deputy commander of Russia’s 20th Combined Arms Army until at least December 2024, but open sources shed no light on his current posting.
The archive, obtained from a source within the Ukrainian military, contains not only messages but also videos and photographs documenting the torture and killing of Ukrainian service members. In his exchanges with fellow officers and his wife, the general repeatedly mentioned the severed ears of Ukrainian POWs. As proof of his claims, Demurchiev shared graphic photographs. In one such exchange with his wife, he sent a photo of several ears and said he would “string them into a garland and give them as a gift.”
“Like pig ears to go with beer,” his wife responded.
Demurchiev frequently discussed the treatment of prisoners of war with a military counterintelligence officer who went by the name “Roman.” In October 2023, the general asked the officer what to do with a Ukrainian captive — whether to kill the man or hand him over for torture. Demurchiev’s contact ultimately took the prisoner. The Ukrainian soldier mentioned in the correspondence later returned home through a prisoner exchange and confirmed that he had been severely beaten and tortured with electric shocks.
The messages shared with RFE/RL also indicate that Roman would send prisoners and detainees to the general, requesting that they be killed.
In December 2024, Demurchiev discussed a video with his subordinates showing Russian prisoner recruits — convicts inducted into military service — capturing three Ukrainian service members and then beating them to death with shovels. The correspondence indicates that Demurchiev also reported the incident to his superior — 20th Army commander General Oleg Mityaev — who ordered that the prisoner recruits be decorated.
Mityaev’s decision to decorate the former convicts was not an aberration. RFE/RL found that the abuse and extrajudicial killings of Ukrainian POWs are common practices in the Russian military, actively encouraged by its leadership, even among senior commanders.

Argentina's striking workers clash with police over Milei labor reforms
Shops and supermarkets shut, flights were canceled and garbage piled high across Argentina on Thursday as unions staged a 24-hour general strike against President Javier Milei’s contentious labour reforms. Transport was largely halted and protesters blocked key roads into Buenos Aires, with some clashes reported.
Shops and supermarkets closed, flights were canceled and garbage piled up Thursday as Argentine workers staged their fourth general strike of President Javier Milei's term, some clashing with police.
The few buses running in Buenos Aires were nowhere near full, although car traffic was unusually heavy as many workers observed the 24-hour strike against a contentious labour reform.
Dozens of flights were canceled and train stations were left deserted with only a handful of buses running.
On roads leading into the capital, small groups of protesters blocked traffic.
Later in the day, several thousand demonstrators gathered outside parliament, where a few dozen participants engaged in running battles with police, throwing bottles and stones.
Officers replied with tear gas, water cannons and rubber bullets to clear the area.
Police were observed making about a dozen arrests.

The CGT labour federation said more workers adhered to the walkout call than during any of the previous three strikes.
"It has levels of compliance like never before under this government," union leader Jorge Sola told Radio con Vos, claiming that "90 percent of activity had stopped".
The contested reforms pushed by budget-slashing Milei, an ideological ally of US President Donald Trump, would make it easier to hire and fire workers in a country where job security is already hard to come by.
It would also reduce severance pay, limit the right to strike, increase work hours and restrict holiday provisions.
The measure was approved by the senate last week and is meant to come before the chamber of deputies on Thursday.
If approved, it will go back to the Senate for a final green light.
"I want to work because I am afraid of losing my job but I cannot get there. I will have to walk," Nora Benitez, a 46-year-old home caregiver, said ahead of a 5- kilometre trek to her job along streets reeking of uncollected garbage.

Reforms spark protests
The labour action comes as Argentina's economy is showing signs of a downturn in manufacturing, with more than 21,000 companies having shuttered in two years under Milei.
He had come to power after wielding a chainsaw at rallies during the 2023 election campaign to symbolize the deep cuts he planned to make to public spending.
Unions say some 300,000 jobs have been lost since Milei's austerity measures began.
Most recently, Fate – Argentina's main tire factory – on Wednesday announced the closure of its plant in Buenos Aires, prompting some 900 job cuts.
The last general strike in Argentina was on April 10, 2025, but adherence was uneven as workers in the public transport system did not join.
Last week, thousands of people demonstrated in Buenos Aires as senators debated the reform bill, and clashes with police resulted in about 30 arrests.

On Tuesday, the government issued an unusual statement warning reporters about the "risk" of covering protests, and announced it would establish an "exclusive zone" from which the media can work.
"In the event of acts of violence, our forces will act," a statement from the security ministry said.
Almost 40 percent of Argentine workers lack formal employment contracts, and unions say the new measures will make matters worse.
But the government argues they will in fact reduce under-the-table employment and create new jobs by lowering the tax burden on employers.
Milei, in office since December 2023, has achieved at least one of his macroeconomic goals: bringing annual inflation down from 150 percent to 32 percent in two years.
But it is a success that has come at the cost of massive public sector job cuts and a drop in disposable income that has sapped consumption and economic activity.
Milei will follow Thursday's events at home from Washington, where he attended the first meeting of Trump's "Board of Peace", which has drawn criticism as an attempt to rival the United Nations.

How AI is helping workers take on their bosses in workplace disputes

How AI is helping workers take on their bosses in workplace disputes
An explosion in disputes brought before the workplace watchdog is being blamed on artificial intelligence making it easy for workers to lodge unfair dismissal, or other claims, even if they have little chance of success.
In a presentation to the Victorian Bar Association on Wednesday, Fair Work Commission president Justice Adam Hatcher said it became clear last year that the tribunal’s operations are being “significantly disrupted” by the widespread availability and use of AI tools.
Applications to deal with contraventions involving dismissal jumped 62 per cent over six months to December last year, compared to the three-year average between 2022 and 2025. Applications to deal with other contraventions leapt 135 per cent.
As generative AI tools become more accessible and widely used, disgruntled workers are finding it easier to use these tools to file formal complaints against their employers.
Hatcher said he didn’t realise, until recently, how easy AI had made the process of getting information and then lodging applications and submissions for remedies under the Fair Work Act.
“The penny really dropped when I tried this exercise myself on ChatGPT late last year,” he said.
“I told ChatGPT that I had been dismissed and asked it what I could do. After I provided it with few basic facts, including the reason for my dismissal and my view that I had been dismissed because I made a complaint a few years earlier, ChatGPT prepared an application under section 365 of the FW [Fair Work] Act that was in a form ready to file together with a witness statement which contained a substantially invented story about my dismissal.”
Hatcher said it took less than 10 minutes, with the AI telling him that a “realistic scenario” was that he would get compensation in the range of $15,000 to $40,000.
But based on the facts he fed to ChatGPT, the case could not actually have been assessed as having reasonable prospects of success, he said.
Although there have also been legal changes, such as Secure Jobs, Better Pay and Closing Loopholes legislation, they have not been “principal drivers” of the Commission’s sudden jump in workload, he said.
Aside from concerns about AI’s accuracy, Hatcher said the increased workload was putting stress on the commission’s staff.
Until 2023, the commission was getting about 30,000 lodgements a year. After that year, there was a sudden increase. The total number of lodgements climbed to 40,000 in 2023-24, then 44,000 in 2024-25, breaking previous records.
Hatcher said this financial year, he expected closer to 55,000 cases to cross the commission’s table.
“There is no sign of this growth trend plateauing out, and we have no idea what the ‘new normal’ will be.”
“The bottom line is that, by the end of this financial year, it is likely that the FWC’s total workload will have increased by over 70 per cent in the space of three years,” Hatcher said.
That largely reflects a growing share of people — 84 per cent in the year to February 2024, up from nearly 76 per cent the year before – contesting their dismissals according to rough calculations by the commission.
While there used to be a clear correlation between the number of dismissal-related applications and the state of the labour market, with these cases tracking the number of retrenchments, Hatcher said that statistical relationship had broken down over the past couple of years.
“That [the increased workload] is principally being caused by the increasing use of AI tools by potential litigants is, in my view, the only reasonable inference which can be drawn,” he said.
The key to this conclusion, Hatcher noted, became apparent in the widespread use of AI-generated language in the applications being filed.
“Once you learn what this looks like, it becomes pretty easy to spot,” he said.
“If you’re offered an appointment to the FWC, don’t accept it on the basis that you think you will have a better work-life balance,” he warned. “You won’t.”
Crucially, it is also affecting the commission’s performance, Hatcher said, including timelines to process, hear and resolve applications, but also to deal with major cases of considerable public importance such as gender-based undervaluation matters and enterprise bargaining agreements.
While Hatcher said AI brought some benefits, including helping workers gain awareness of the commission and its processes, the tool could be harmful if it invented facts or glossed up a general protections claim for someone who didn’t meet the criteria.
In response to the growing use of AI and increasing workloads, the commission will make changes including requiring people to disclose the use of AI in forms and documents.

Hong Kong budget 2026-27: beyond balancing the books, what’s at stake?
Analysts are upbeat amid city’s booming IPO sector and thriving financial market, but warn of geopolitical headwinds
Simon Leung has been without a full-time job since his contract ended in March 2024, after the Hong Kong government cut its budget for NGOs by 7 per cent.
The social work event coordinator, who is in his late forties, now makes ends meet through gig jobs.
“They should increase the budget back to the previous level,” the civil engineering graduate from Queen’s University in Canada told the South China Morning Post.
Like other Hongkongers, Leung hopes his sector will receive attention in next Wednesday’s budget.
Yet, others question whether such relief measures ought to be weighed against plans for the longer-term future riddled with uncertainty. Even short-term measures, they argued, must be plugged into the big picture of the city’s ambitions – to stay ahead as an international financial centre while ensuring a liveable, affordable home for its residents.

Epstein victim's brother hopes ex-Prince Andrew's arrest signals 'house of cards' collapsing

The brother of one of Jeffrey Epstein’s most prominent accusers has welcomed the arrest of Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor, saying he hopes it marks the start of a wider reckoning in the long-running scandal.
In an interview with Reuters news agency, Sky Roberts — whose sister Virginia Roberts Giuffre took her own life in April 2025 — said he believed the arrest could signal the beginning of the collapse of a "house of cards" surrounding the late convicted US sex offender.
"This is where the house of cards starts falling," Roberts said in a joint interview with his wife, Amanda Roberts.
The release of millions of records linked to Epstein has roiled politics and business as details emerge about his extensive social connections.
The case has also become a persistent political issue for President Donald Trump, who previously raised suspicions about Epstein and his associates.
Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor, the brother of King Charles, was arrested in Britain on suspicion of misconduct in public office over allegations he sent confidential government documents to Epstein.
He was later released from police custody.
Calls for accountability
In 2022, he settled a civil lawsuit in the United States brought by Giuffre, who accused him of sexually abusing her when she was a teenager at properties owned by Epstein or his associates.
He has always denied wrongdoing and said he regrets his friendship with Epstein.
The current police investigation is not related to that civil case or to any allegation of sexual impropriety.
Americans widely view the Epstein case as an example of powerful figures avoiding accountability and believe the US government is withholding information about Epstein’s clients, according to Reuters/Ipsos polling.
"We are trailing too far behind in justice, especially when we are sitting on the mountains of information that we have," Amanda Roberts said.
"The world is looking at us to do the right thing here."
Epstein pleaded guilty in 2008 to a Florida state prostitution charge and later faced federal sex trafficking charges in 2019.
His death in a Manhattan jail cell that August was ruled a suicide.
Amanda Roberts described learning of the arrest as "a mixed bag of emotions", saying: "Initially we were … vindicated… And then it just hits you — that gut punch of the fact that she’s not here to see this."

Andrew could turn to ‘last-man-standing’ friend as legal fight looms

Andrew could turn to ‘last-man-standing’ friend as legal fight looms
Buckingham Palace will ensure the taxpayer does not foot Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor’s legal bill, the London Telegraph understands.
If the former Duke of York is unable to pay for his own legal representation, the financial burden “will not fall on the public purse,” a well-placed source said.
It is unclear from which pot the royal household will find the money, although sources suggested that the King would not pay his younger brother’s bills himself.
Mountbatten-Windsor was arrested on Thursday at his home in Sandringham on suspicion of misconduct in public office.
Police are assessing allegations that Mountbatten-Windsor shared sensitive information with Jeffrey Epstein when the former was a trade envoy.
On the question of who might help Mountbatten-Windsor – and defend him in court – there is one man who remains in his circle: lawyer Gary Bloxsome.
“He’s the only man still by his side,” one source admitted on Thursday.
Following Andrew’s arrest, Bloxsome’s services will be needed now more than ever.
The criminal defence solicitor was taken on by the former prince in 2020 when the FBI was circling with questions about his friendship with paedophile financier Epstein.
As it turned out, it was an inspired hire.
While other friends and associates slowly peeled themselves away from the tawdry crisis that engulfed the beleaguered royal, Bloxsome stood firm.
He went on to become Andrew’s closest confidant, his “lawyer on call”, as one source described it, spending as much time with him on the golf course as he did poring over legal paperwork.
Until at least very recently, he was still visiting Royal Lodge in Windsor for tea with his high-profile client.
‘Who else could he call on?’
Now, it seems Bloxsome is the likely candidate to represent Mountbatten-Windsor as he faces allegations of misconduct in public office.
“Who else would he possibly call on?” a well-placed source said. “He’s a criminal lawyer. This is Gary’s speciality, there is no better man for the job.
“It wouldn’t make any sense for him [Mountbatten-Windsor] to go anywhere else. He knows all the history, and they have a good relationship.”
As police raided Wood Farm, Andrew’s temporary accommodation on the King’s Sandringham Estate, Bloxsome told the Telegraph he had “no knowledge at all” of the unfolding drama.
It is not yet known whether he attended the police station where Andrew was being questioned on his 66th birthday.
His arrest came barely two weeks after he was banished from Royal Lodge in Windsor to begin his new life in exile in Norfolk.
With very few friends left – bar the ever-loyal Bloxsome – concerns have been raised for Andrew’s mental health.
Prior to the move, he went riding daily but, beyond that, was isolated at his vast Windsor mansion. He reportedly stopped following the news some months ago.
Sources have noted that as the walls closed in, he has been “very, very flat”.
In December, he was forced to surrender his firearms licences and shotgun certificates following a visit by the Metropolitan Police.
Gun licences are regularly reviewed, and their surrender can be requested if a person is found to be “not fit to be entrusted with a firearm” or “a danger to public safety or to the peace”.
No further explanation was forthcoming, but it has become increasingly clear that his welfare has remained a key family consideration. Palace sources have stressed that there “remains a duty of care” for the wellbeing of all family members.
Similar concerns have been raised for Sarah Ferguson and their two daughters, princesses Beatrice and Eugenie, who are said to be “in a state” following their father’s arrest.
One source close to the former Duchess of York told the London Telegraph on Thursday: “This is catastrophic for her and the girls.
“She seems to be doing her best to put a brave face on it. Her desperation for money was clear stupidity, but does that equate to what she’s going through now?”
For now, Mountbatten-Windsor’s fate is in the hands of the police and whichever legal representative he chooses to hire.
Bloxsome, a partner at London-based Blackfords law firm, may prove a welcome sight.
The lawyer has long been dubbed “Good News Gary” owing to his insistence on only briefing the embattled royal with the best-case scenario, even when things were going disastrously wrong.
When Andrew was last embroiled in a damaging legal drama – fighting sex abuse allegations made by the late Virginia Giuffre – Bloxsome was his self-appointed gatekeeper.
Insiders said the lawyer replaced Amanda Thirsk, Andrew’s former private secretary, as his “inner circle of one” by insisting that all communication went through him.
Bloxsome, who is described as “absolutely brilliant” and “sharp as a blade”, was born and raised in south-east London, where he lives with his wife, a nurse.
He has been a partner at Blackfords for more than 40 years and defended British troops against war-crimes allegations as well as footballers in assault cases.
Should he be instructed, he may take comfort in the knowledge that his legal bills would be covered.
Mountbatten-Windsor has been under significant financial pressure in recent years and is not thought to have any notable private funds at his fingertips.
In 2024, it emerged that the King had cut his brother off financially, drawing a line under his personal allowance and security payments as he sought to smoke him out of Royal Lodge, his Windsor home.
When, amid mounting pressure last October, the monarch removed his royal titles and forced him to finally give up the lease on the property, it was made clear that “appropriate private provision” would be made to ensure Andrew had funds to live on.
By relocating him to Sandringham, he is said to have wanted to “contain” his errant sibling and to ensure he did not have to support himself by independent means, which has long led to scandal.
Regardless of his current financial circumstances, Buckingham Palace is keen to avoid the unseemly spectacle of Mountbatten-Windsor claiming legal aid.
Those who require support to cover their defence costs must apply for the means-tested benefit, which takes into account income, family circumstances and living costs.
When Andrew was a working royal, he, like the rest of the royal family, was represented by a team at Harbottle and Lewis, led by partner Gerrard Tyrrell.
However, when he was cut adrift in late 2019, following his disastrous BBC Newsnight interview, he was forced to hire his own independent team.
Until her death, Queen Elizabeth II privately funded his subsequent legal fight with Giuffre – who accused Andrew of having sex with her, aged 17, after she was trafficked to London by Epstein – stumping up most of the £12 million ($22.9 million) settlement costs to draw a line under the litigation in early 2022.
King’s ‘profound concern’
It was claimed this month that the King had contributed £1.5m to the pot, but Buckingham Palace sought to distance him from the payout, with a source insisting this was not the case.
Just days earlier, the King had expressed his “profound concern” over the onslaught of revelations about Mountbatten-Windsor contained in the Epstein files as Buckingham Palace confirmed it would support the police investigation if required.
On Thursday, some two hours after Thames Valley Police confirmed he had been arrested on suspicion of misconduct in public office, the King released a personal statement in which he said “the law must take its course”.
He said: “I have learnt with the deepest concern the news about Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor and suspicion of misconduct in public office. What follows is the full, fair and proper process by which this issue is investigated by the appropriate authorities.
“In this, as I have said before, they have our full and wholehearted support and co-operation. Let me state clearly: the law must take its course.”

The Russian village that lost its men to war

The Russian village that lost its men to war
In the fishing village of Sedanka, in Russia's Far East, life is hard.
Most homes lack basic amenities such as running water, indoor toilets and central heating, despite temperatures routinely falling to -10C (14F) during the winter months.
Ringed by forest-tundra and bogs, its district centre can only be reached from May to October by river boat or vehicles with tracks, and in winter only by snowmobile or helicopter.
There are few local jobs and most villagers survive by fishing and growing their own food.
And now almost all of Sedanka's men aged 18 to 55 have gone, according to locals, having joined Russia's war in Ukraine.
'No-one to chop fire wood'
"It's heartbreaking - so many of our people have been killed," says Natalia, a villager whose name we've changed for her security, in an interview with the BBC World Service.
"My sister's husband and my cousins are at the front. In almost every family, someone is fighting."
Located on the north-west edge of the Kamchatka Peninsula, near the Sea of Okhotsk, Sedanka is more than 4,300 miles (7,000km) from Ukraine's front lines.
The American city of Anchorage, across the ocean, is roughly half that distance.
Thirty-nine men from the village signed contracts with Russia to fight in the war from a total population of 258. Of these, 12 have been killed and another seven are missing.
"All our men have left for the special military operation," a group of women told the regional governor when he visited in March 2024, using the Kremlin's language for its war in Ukraine.
"There is no-one to chop firewood for winter to heat our stoves," they added in an exchange shown on state TV.
The BBC, along with Russian news outlet Medizona and volunteer researchers, has so far verified that 40,201 Russian soldiers were killed in 2025.
According to our analysis, we estimate that the total number killed in 2025 will reach 80,000, which would be the most deadly year for Russian losses in Ukraine since the full-scale invasion was launched on 24 February 2022.
This calculation takes into account obituaries that cite 2025 as the year of death or burial, but we have not yet fully processed or cross-checked.
Confirmed deaths for 2024 now stand at 69,362 - roughly comparable to the combined totals for 2022 and 2023 - and the curve has steepened since late 2024.
We have confirmed the deaths using official reports and a probate data registry - an official registry of cases after someone dies - as well as newspaper articles, social media posts from relatives or close friends and data from new memorials and graves.
In total, the BBC has now identified the names of 186,102 Russian soldiers killed in the war.
The true death toll is generally accepted to be much higher, as many deaths on the battlefield are not recorded.
Military experts believe our analysis might represent 45-65% of the total, putting the potential number of Russian deaths at between 286,000 and 413,500.
Ukraine has also sustained heavy losses.
Last month, President Volodymyr Zelensky told French broadcaster France 2 that "officially" 55,000 Ukrainians had been killed on the battlefield.
In addition, a "large number of people" are considered officially missing, he said, though he did not give an exact figure.
Based on estimates from sources including the UA Losses website, which the BBC has cross-referenced, we estimate that the number of Ukrainians killed is as high as 200,000.
Most Russians killed in the war have Slavic surnames.
But losses are disproportionately high among small indigenous groups, especially in economically depressed areas of Siberia and the Far East, such as Sedanka.
Sedanka is home mainly to Koryaks and Itelmens - indigenous groups who, under wartime rules, can be exempted from mobilisation.
Anti-war activist Maria Vyushkova says Russian state TV amplifies stereotypes about indigenous communities being "born warriors" and skilled shooters in order to encourage them to join the war.
"Many indigenous communities take pride in that heritage as part of their identity. The Kremlin uses this pride to recruit for war," Vyushkova says.
One of the men from Sedanka who joined the conflict was Vladimir Akeev, 45, a hunter and fisherman, who signed a contract with the army in the summer of 2024.
Four months later he was killed in combat.
Mourners at his funeral in November 2024 were only able to reach the cemetery by snowmobile, and Akeev's coffin arrived on wide wooden sleds.
Elsewhere, confirmed losses from indigenous groups include 201 Nenets, 96 Chukchi, 77 Khanty, 30 Koryaks and seven Inuit.
As a proportion of males between the ages of 18 and 60, this equates to an estimated 2% of Chukchi, 1.4% of Russian Inuits, 1.32% of Koryaks and 0.8% of Khanty.
The BBC's analysis shows that 67% of the dead are from rural areas and small towns - classed as those with populations under 100,000 people - even though 48% of Russia's population lives there.
The rate of losses was smallest in major cities, with Moscow having the least deaths per capita - five people for every 10,000 males, or 0.05%.
In poorer regions, such as Buryatia in eastern Siberia, and Tuva in southern Siberia, the death rate is 27 to 33 times higher respectively than in the capital.
The main driver of this gap between cities and rural areas is the difference in economic development, pay and education, says demographer Alexey Raksha.
As a result, soldiers from poorer regions and ethnic minorities make up a larger share of the army and of the dead than the overall population, he says.
Regions with a high share of losses had lower life expectancy even before their men joined the war, another Russian demographer told the BBC.
"For many, the driver is not only poverty but a lack of prospects - the feeling that there is nothing to lose," he says.
In Sedanka, a monument to "participants of the special military operation" was unveiled in autumn 2024.
Last year, the regional government pledged to bestow the honorary title of "village of military valour" for the participation of its men in the war.
It also promised a support programme for families of Sedanka's soldiers.
Yet the village has still not received its honorary title nor has much of the promised support for soldiers' families arrived.
Roofs on the homes of four contract soldiers were fixed after falling into disrepair, but only after significant media attention.
One in five houses, built during Soviet times, has been deemed by the state to be unsafe.
Its sole school has been classed by officials as being in a state of emergency, with some walls at risk of collapse.
All of this has been compounded by the loss of the village's working-age men to Russia's war in Ukraine.

FBI Director Kash Patel takes agency jet to Italy and plans to attend Olympic hockey games
The FBI director’s trip is not for ‘personal’ reasons, and was planned ‘months ago,’ an agency spokesperson said

FBI Director Kash Patel has taken an agency jet to Italy, where he has plans to hold official meetings and watch Olympic hockey games, CBS News first reported.
Patel reportedly took off Thursday morning and landed in Italy hours later. He’s expected to attend meetings with law enforcement officials and watch the men’s USA Olympic hockey team compete in Milan, sources told CBS News.
FBI directors must use government planes for both personal and official travel to ensure they maintain access to secure communications and can move quickly in an emergency, according to CBS News. They’re also required to reimburse the government for personal flights.
Ben Williamson, the FBI’s assistant director for public affairs, responded to the CBS News report in a post on X: “No, it’s not a personal trip. Director Patel is on a trip that was planned months ago.”
“It includes: partner meetings with Italian law enforcement and security officials (they invited the Director last July), meeting with Ambassador Fertitta (as a follow up to our law enforcement roundtable he hosted in January), meetings with Legat staff, and more,” Williamson wrote.
“The FBI also has a major role in Olympic security - as we do with the World Cup, F1, and more - so we have a U.S. consulate briefing on Olympic security and current FBI posture, as well as thanking FBI personnel on the ground,” he continued.
In a follow-up post, Williamson added: “Kash just called me and told me to add ‘Please tell them yes, I am rooting for the greatest team on earth from the greatest country on earth.’”
When reached for comment, the FBI referred The Independent to Williamson’s statement on X.
Patel has previously faced scrutiny for his use of government jets.
Late last year, top Democrats on the House Judiciary Committee said they were “demanding answers” after reports emerged that Patel had used government jets for “personal travel,” including a “date night” with his girlfriend, country musician Alexis Wilkins.
When Fox News host Laura Ingraham asked Patel about these reports in December, he was quick to defend himself.
“It’s simple,” Patel said. “The FBI director — all FBI directors — are required users of the FBI plane. They don’t let me fly commercially. But my predecessors wasted millions of dollars because they were too lazy to drive an extra 20 minutes and go to Andrews Air Force Base.”
“They used D.C. Reagan National as a personal hub, costing the taxpayers $4 million. I shut that policy off and mandated the use of government airfields,” he added.
It was also revealed in November that Patel’s girlfriend receives protection from a security detail.
“Ms. Wilkins is receiving a protective detail because she has faced hundreds of credible death threats related to her relationship with Director Patel, whom she has been dating for three years. Out of respect for her safety, we will not be providing additional details,” an FBI spokesperson told MS NOW.

Venezuela legislature passes limited amnesty bill critiqued by rights groups

Feb 19 - Venezuela's ruling party-controlled legislature on Thursday approved a limited amnesty bill that human rights organizations say falls short of offering relief for hundreds of political prisoners in the country.
Interim President Delcy Rodriguez, who took power last month after the U.S. ouster of President Nicolas Maduro, has bowed to Trump administration demands on oil sales and released hundreds of people who human rights groups class as political prisoners, as part of a normalization of relations between the countries.
The government has always denied holding political prisoners and says those jailed have committed crimes.
The law was approved after a second debate in the legislature, headed by Rodriguez's brother Jorge Rodriguez.
The approved law provides amnesty for involvement in political protests and "violent actions" which took place during a brief coup in 2002 and demonstrations or elections in certain months of 2004, 2007, 2009, 2013, 2014, 2017, 2019, 2023, 2024 and 2025. People convicted of "military rebellion" for involvement in events in 2019 are excluded.
The law does not detail the exact crimes which would be eligible for amnesty, though a previous draft laid out several - including instigation of illegal activity, resistance to authorities, rebellion and treason.
It also does not return assets of those detained, revoke public office bans given for political reasons or cancel sanctions against media outlets, as at least one previous draft would have.
Many members of the opposition and dissident former officials live in other countries to escape arrest warrants they say are politically motivated.
Though the law allows people abroad to appoint a lawyer to present an amnesty request on their behalf, they would have to appear in person in Venezuela to have it granted and the law will only cover "people who have ceased the execution of the actions which constitute crimes," a specification which may leave out many who have continued their activism from other countries. The law removes international arrest warrants for those granted amnesty.
Tribunals must decide on amnesty requests within 15 days, according to the law.
Delcy Rodriguez signed the amnesty law following its approval by the National Assembly, describing the law as the start of a process for offering and receiving forgiveness.
HUNGER STRIKE
The law does not provide amnesty for those convicted of human rights violations, war crimes, murder, drug trafficking, corruption or anyone promoting, supporting or committing "armed actions" against Venezuela and its people by foreign states or entities.
The government regularly accuses members of the opposition of working with entities such as the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency to harm the country and attack its infrastructure, accusations the opposition has always denied.
Attorney General Tarek Saab told Reuters last week that he hopes the amnesty will result in “a 100% pacified country" and also insisted that those who are imprisoned committed crimes and were not political detainees, repeating assertions he made in 2024 before thousands were arrested for participating in protests amid a contested presidential election.
The ruling party has a super majority in the legislature, but the law was supported by members of opposition parties, who won some changes to the bill in committee sessions.
The law is "not perfect", said lawmaker Nora Bracho of the Un Nuevo Tiempo party, urging full government compliance with the bill, which she added "will without a doubt mitigate the suffering of many Venezuelans."
The government says nearly 900 people have been released from prison over more than a year, while legal rights group Foro Penal has counted nearly 450 releases of people they classify as political prisoners since January 8.
Opposition politician Juan Pablo Guanipa, a close ally of Nobel Peace Prize winner Maria Corina Machado, had a house arrest order against him lifted, his brother, lawmaker Tomas Guanipa, told Reuters late on Thursday night.
Guanipa was freed from jail and recaptured within hours earlier this month after speaking to media in Caracas and seeing supporters. Guanipa was imprisoned for more than eight months on accusations of leading a terrorist plot, which he has denied.
Advocacy groups including Foro Penal have critiqued the limits of the law.
"If the amnesty is not as broad as we would have liked it to be, that does not mean that the fight for the freedom of all the imprisoned and pursued is over," Foro Penal Vice President Gonzalo Himiob said on X.
"Total liberty will come when the apparatus and culture of political repression are dismantled."
Hundreds of students and families of prisoners have gathered to demand releases in recent weeks, the most vociferous displays of public protest in Venezuela since after the 2024 elections.
Ten family members of detainees have participated in a hunger strike outside the Zona 7 police facility in the capital Caracas in recent days, begun after a deadline for releases from the facility promised by Jorge Rodriguez passed last week.
By late on Thursday afternoon just one striker remained. Narwin Gil, 40, is the sister-in-law of detainee Jose Gregorio Farfan and is approaching six days without food. REUTERS

Giant Trump banner hanging outside DOJ building stirs strong reactions online: ‘Full blown North Korea vibes’
The administration framed the banner as part of U.S. 250th anniversary celebrations
- Bookmark
- CommentsGo to comments
Workers installed a huge banner featuring President Trump’s face and the words “Make America Safe Again” on the front of Justice Department headquarters in Washington on Thursday, provoking online outrage and comparisons between the administration and authoritarian regimes.
California Gov. Gavin Newsom, a frequent Trump critic, said the gesture was “beyond parity.”
“How many dictatorship-style monuments, building name changes, and fake awards do Americans have to endure?” he wrote on X, echoing another commentator who said the banner had totalitarian “North Korea vibes.”
Since Trump took office, the president and his allies have renamed the Kennedy Center and the U.S. Institute of Peace to include Trump’s name.
Newsom wasn’t the only Democratic lawmaker sounding off on the banner.
“Americans believe in the rule of law,” Rep. Ted Lieu of California wrote on X. “MAGA Republicans believe in the rule of Trump. November is coming.”
Others argued the image undermined the Justice Department’s position as an independent institution tasked with impartially applying the law.
“Trump is plastering his face on the building that’s supposed to investigate him,” Rep. Jimmy Gomez, also of California, added on X. “There was once a time when a president couldn’t boss the Attorney General around like his own personal lapdog.”
Some commentators and reporters were also critical of the move.
“Could also be Germany 1930s, Soviet Union 1950s,” The Atlantic’s Tom Nichols wrote on X. “Could be many places, but shouldn't be America.”
Others, like Ken Dilanian, argued the banner was highly ironic given Republicans’ longstanding claims that the Biden administration had politicized the DOJ.
“This is a stunning confirmation of the grim reality, which is that Donald Trump has seized control of the once independent Justice Department and is using it to pursue his political objectives—including trying to punish his perceived enemies,” he wrote on X. “Exactly what his supporters baselessly accused the previous administration of doing.”
Critics of the administration have pointed to federal prosecutions of Trump critics like former FBI Director James Comey and New York Attorney General Letitia James, as well as Democrats who encouraged military members to ignore illegal orders in a video last year, as evidence of this alleged erosion in the separation of powers.
The Trump administration defended the symbol, arguing it was a part of the larger efforts to celebrate the U.S.’s 250th anniversary.
“We are proud at this Department of Justice to celebrate 250 years of our great country and our historic work to make America safe again at President Trump’s direction,” a DOJ spokesperson told The Independent.
Similar banners of the president’s face have previously hung at the Departments of Agriculture and Labor, at a cost of thousands of dollars to taxpayers.

Virginia Giuffre's family says U.S. government response to Epstein files is "shameful"

Virginia Giuffre's family says U.S. response to Epstein files is "shameful" after former Prince Andrew's arrest in U.K.
The family of Virginia Giuffre, who alleged she was trafficked by convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein to engage in sex with former Prince Andrew, said they are happy about the arrest of Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor in the U.K., but said it is "shameful" that there haven't been similar repercussions in the United States.
Mountbatten-Windsor was arrested Thursday for suspected misconduct in public office stemming from revelations in the Jeffrey Epstein files.
Giuffre's brother, Sky Roberts, told CBS News chief Washington correspondent Major Garrett in an emotional interview that he learned about the arrest at 3 a.m.
"We had this just like boost of adrenaline that it almost felt surreal," he said.
"And then, you know, following that boost of emotion or that boost of joy, really, vindication for Virginia," he said. "I mean, I can tell you, it's been kind of an up and down day. We've had a lot of a mix of emotions. I found myself crying in a restaurant earlier for really no other reason than just that we miss her. We wish she was here to see this, and this is a day for her survivor sisters. This is a day that they were wanting for a long time, and I think it gives a little bit of vindication to her and to her survivor sisters."
Giuffre died by suicide last year at age 41. She had accused Mountbatten-Windsor, former Prince Andrew, of assaulting her on three separate occasions when she was 17. He has denied those allegations. Mountbatten-Windsor reached a settlement with her in 2022, paying her some $16 million, according to British media reports.
"We would have been calling Virginia and screaming and rejoicing with her," said Amanda Roberts, Sky's wife and Virginia's sister-in-law. "And so the flood of that, like, mixed emotion, you know, we've had some really rough moments today, but we also want to continue on the path of victory. We want to take this as a win and keep pushing forward."
Mountbatten-Windsor, the younger brother of King Charles III, was arrested on his 66th birthday. The arrest wasn't directly related to accusations of sexual trafficking or abuse, but came about two weeks after an anti-royal organization called for police to investigate documents in the Epstein files that indicated the former prince had shared confidential government information with the late American sex offender when the royal worked as a British trade envoy.
The Thames Valley Police said Thursday it had arrested a man in his 60s "on suspicion of misconduct in public office." Mountbatten-Windsor, 66, was released after about 12 hours but is still under investigation.
"We're incredibly proud of her," Sky Roberts said of Giuffre. "And there's one moment that really resonates in my mind. And I remember the moment where she said, 'He knows what he did. I know what he did, and there's only one of us telling the truth, and I know that's me.' And that keeps resonating in my head today."
Amanda Roberts said the former prince's arrest was Giuffre's "character coming to fruition today."
Mountbatten-Windsor was stripped of his royal titles last year amid renewed criticism over his relationship with Epstein and Giuffre's allegations.
Amanda Roberts said Thursday's charges, while not directly related to her sister-in-law's allegations, are still very serious.
"I do want to reiterate that is punishable by life in the U.K. So that is a very extreme punishment, and we welcome that," she said. "But we also want to say that this is the beginning of the web. This is the thread that we need to continue to pull to uncover the further allegations. We hope the U.K. is persistent in that, and we know that if they really follow this trail, they will get there as well."
"And we're expecting the same acts to happen here in the United States," she added. "And it's been very shameful to not see that come from our own government."
Sky Roberts also criticized the contrasting responses between the U.S. and U.K. governments, saying, "You have our own administration here basically telling the American public that, you know, we're going to move on from this. And the reality is that the American public is screaming back at them, along with survivors and our survivor sisters, saying well, you might be ready to move on, but we're not."
"This is a stain on American history," he added.
Amanda Roberts said she had "zero confidence" in Attorney General Pam Bondi or the Justice Department to carry out proper investigations into those implicated in the files.
"We need to look at our representatives. We need to look at Congress to take whatever actions necessary to keep pushing this forward," she said. "It must be uncovered. We must see further indictments. And I would say this: Anyone in our administration, especially in the Department of Justice, if you are not willing to expose predators and do right by the survivors in this case, then you should resign."
Sky Roberts also had harsh words for previous administrations, saying, "Quite frankly, every administration prior to this, they're in the same boat where they likely didn't do right by survivors."
"My hope is that this is just a cause-and-effect moment, that the domino has finally fallen, that the next series of house of cards are about to show their face," he said. "We have to take action off of this. And the way that the U.K. responds, the way that they treat this investigation, is going to set the tone for the rest of all of the other investigations that are going to take place."
Speaking to members of the U.S. government, Sky Roberts said, "Pick up your baby girls tonight, look them in the face, tell them you did nothing. Or pick them up and tell them, you know, 'Mommy and daddy are fighting. We're going to do this for you. This next generation deserves better.'"
Amanda said that while the issue may be political, "it's not partisan."
"I also want to tell every single survivor out there that this day is for you, and that ordinary people like Virginia can do extraordinary things, no matter the trauma and pain that you've lived through," she said. "And we're here for you. We see you, and we're going to keep fighting, and we're going to pull you over that finish line."

Big Tech is building its own ‘power grid’ to help fuel data centers desperately needed for AI
‘It is catastrophic for climate goals,’ Michael Thomas, founder of Cleanview, an energy industry research group

Big tech companies are reportedly developing their own isolated, off-grid data centers where they can consume resources to provide the storage and compute needed for AI development and other digital services, according to a new report.
The GW Ranch project will see 8,000 acres of land in West Texas turned into an entirely off-grid data center facility that will consume more energy than the entire city of Chicago, according to The Washington Post.
The new project will generate all of its own electricity through natural gas and solar panels and—crucially for tech companies—won't have to wait around for utilities to solve power availability issues.
The GW Ranch project is just one of several off-grid data center undertakings planned at sites in Wyoming, New Mexico, Pennsylvania, Utah, Ohio, and Tennessee, according to regulatory filings, permits, and other documents reviewed by the Post.
Several of the projects are already under construction. The builds are being pushed by big-name players in the world of tech: Meta, OpenAI, Oracle, and Chevron, to name a few.
Some states have already passed legislation making it easier for data center projects to set up shop.
In West Virginia, a new off-grid data center is being planned near the city of Davis. The project will include a gas plant large enough to produce enough power to fuel every home in the state.
“They removed local control completely for this speculative gold rush,” Amy Margolies, a resident fighting against the development, told the paper. “Everything is shrouded in secrecy, and the public is removed from the process.”
Some 5,246 data centers are operating in the U.S., according to the most recent information from the Data Center Map project, collectively consuming at least 17 gigawatts of power. A large nuclear power generator produces 1 gigawatt of energy, which can power between 300,000 and 750,000 homes.
In the race for AI dominance, countries are rolling out data centers at breakneck speed to cope with the immense amounts of compute needed.
Though the off-grid centers will incorporate solar power, most will rely on natural gas because more sustainable fuels provide less consistent output. Without an electric grid to act as a backup, natural gas will be the primary power source for the facilities. That will no doubt mean an increase in emissions at a time when human-driven climate change is already causing more frequent severe weather across the country.
“It is catastrophic for climate goals," Michael Thomas, founder of Cleanview, an energy industry research group, told the Post. Cleanview has identified 47 off-grid data center projects across the country.
Even though the data centers will be off-grid, that doesn't mean that typical ratepayers are isolated from the consequences of these developments.
Jigar Shah, an energy entrepreneur who helped manage federal energy investments under the Joe Biden administration, told the Post that tech companies, with their virtually limitless resources, will now be competing for maintenance and equipment against public utilities.
If it takes longer—or becomes prohibitively expensive—for utility companies or public utility agencies to access equipment, they will have to pour more money into trying to maintain older infrastructure. The cost of those rising maintenance expenses will almost certainly be passed on to ratepayers. In other words, their bills will go up.
“This whole thing feels like a fairy tale concocted on the back of a napkin,” Shah said.
Tech companies trying to build data centers on regional power grids have, in some cases, been throttled by how much energy grid operators can provide to their projects while still serving regular ratepayers.
That's one of the reasons Elon Musk opted last year to build an entirely off-grid data center in Memphis. Bypassing the local grid allowed him to get the data center—used by his xAI company—running in a matter of months rather than years. His project is powered by dozens of portable gas generators: efficient, but not without environmental costs.
The Environmental Protection Agency ruled last month that Musk's setup illegally breached emissions rules and told xAI to obtain permits for its generators.
When data centers do try to set up shop in populated areas, they've faced opposition from locals who do not want the noise and emissions pollution in their neighborhoods or who balk at the massive water and energy use—and the inflated energy bills that come along with the projects.
A large data center can consume up to 5 million gallons of water per day—the equivalent of a town of 10,000–50,000 people—according to the Environment and Energy Institute.
A group of concerned citizens in Tucson, Arizona, managed to defeat a proposal for a large data center in the city called "Project Blue," citing water usage in the already parched desert and the potential for increased energy bills.
Data center operators no doubt hope to mitigate some of the public's concerns by building off-grid.
“As designed, it is intended to operate independently and does not rely on ratepayer-funded infrastructure or impact existing residential customers,” Fundamental Data, the company building the Davis, West Virginia, data center, told the Post.
Though many of the tech companies backing the off-grid data centers have kept their names off the projects until they've gone through the permitting and clearance process, Meta has been upfront about its upcoming builds.
The parent company of Facebook has one project underway called Socrates in New Albany, Ohio, that will use a pair of off-grid gas power plants to provide its energy needs. That site is scheduled to go live later this year.
Meta is also building data centers in El Paso, where it's working with a local utility provider to build a gas-generating facility through the linking of 813 smaller generators. Local and city officials protested the project, claiming Meta only received approval to build by stating the site would use clean energy.
El Paso Electric, Meta's local energy partner, wrote in regulatory filings that to power the site using solar panels and battery storage, it “would require thousands of acres adjacent to the Data Center site which are not available," according to a Texas Tribune report.
Meta said in a statement to the Post that it plans to fulfill its clean energy obligation by buying clean energy and adding it to the grid.
“As with all of our data centers, including dozens of renewable projects throughout Texas, we work to add energy to the grid and match our data center’s electricity use with 100% clean and renewable energy,” the statement said.
Shah is skeptical about the projects, noting that even with tech companies' deep pockets, they can't ensure uninterrupted reliability without the security of a major grid.
“I get that cost is no object for these companies and they just want to get online," Shah told the Post. “But they have not figured out even with unlimited funds how to make these plants run with 24/7 reliability.”

New Mexico reopens investigation of Epstein ranch
Sign up now: Get ST's newsletters delivered to your inbox
New Mexico’s attorney-general on Feb 19 ordered the reopening of the state’s criminal investigation into alleged crimes at a ranch owned by late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, based on new information made public by the US Justice Department, the state’s Department of Justice said.
The US Justice Department on Jan 30 made public millions of Epstein-related files
New Mexico Attorney-General Raul Torrez ordered the reopening of the investigation of Epstein’s ranch south of state capital Santa Fe after his predecessor, fellow Democrat Hector Balderas, closed it in 2019 to avoid overlap with federal probes. Pressure to uncover Epstein’s crimes has become a political headache for President Donald Trump, a Republican.
“Revelations outlined in the previously sealed Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) files warrant further examination,” New Mexico Department of Justice spokesperson Lauren Rodriguez said in a statement.
The renewed probe comes two days after New Mexico’s Democratic-controlled legislature launched what lawmakers said was the first comprehensive investigation into Epstein’s alleged crimes at Zorro Ranch, which is 48km south of Santa Fe.
The lawmakers have opened a committee that will take testimony at the state house. The investigation announced on Feb 19 is a separate, criminal probe and led by the state’s top prosecutor.
As part of the New Mexico criminal investigation, special agents and prosecutors will seek immediate access to the US Department of Justice’s complete, unredacted case file on Epstein and work collaboratively with the legislature’s investigative committee, Ms Rodriguez said.
The criminal investigation will include the “collection and preservation of any relevant evidence that remains available”, she added.
The US Justice Department and the FBI did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
Epstein died in what was ruled a suicide in a New York jail in 2019 while facing federal sex-trafficking charges.
Zorro Ranch was sold by Epstein’s estate in 2023 to Texas businessman and politician Don Huffines. A spokesperson for Huffines, in a statement, said the owners had never been approached by law enforcement requesting access to the ranch, but would “grant full and complete cooperation” in the event they were.
In a social media post on Feb 16, Mr Huffines said he planned to turn the ranch into a Christian retreat.
The New Mexico Department of Justice on Feb 18 said it was investigating an allegation, which emerged from the US Department of Justice release, that Epstein ordered the burial of the bodies of two foreign girls on hills outside Zorro Ranch. REUTERS

IMF warns Venezuela’s economy and humanitarian situation is ‘quite fragile’
Figures show Venezuela’s public debt sits at roughly 180 percent of its GDP as the country struggles with tumult.
The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has described Venezuela’s economic and humanitarian situation as “quite fragile”, pointing to an estimated triple-digit inflation and a sharply depreciating currency.
In a briefing on Thursday with reporters, spokeswoman Julie Kozack said the organisation continues to closely monitor developments in the South American nation, even though the IMF has had no formal relations with the Venezuelan government since 2019.

Kozack emphasised that any decision to re-engage would depend on guidance from the IMF’s member countries and the broader international community.
Economic and political crises in Venezuela have driven massive emigration: Since 2014, roughly a quarter of Venezuela’s population – about 8 million people – has left the country, creating one of the largest displacement crises in recent history.
The Venezuelan economy in 2026 remains in a state of deep structural crisis.
It is currently navigating a period of unprecedented volatility and rapid policy shifts, following years of hyperinflation and a contraction of its gross domestic product (GDP).
The United States military’s abduction of former President Nicolas Maduro last month has triggered a seismic shift in both the political and economic landscape.
While Maduro remains in US custody facing narco-trafficking charges, the acting administration under interim President Delcy Rodriguez has moved swiftly to implement a plan for stabilisation, recovery and transition.
“Venezuela is undergoing a severe and prolonged economic and humanitarian crisis,” Kozack said during Thursday’s briefing. “Socioeconomic conditions remain very difficult. Poverty is high, inequality is high, and there’s widespread shortages of basic services. The situation overall is quite fragile.”
The IMF figures show Venezuela’s public debt sitting at roughly 180 percent of its GDP right now, before factoring in any court rulings or arbitration payouts from old defaults.
Kozack said the global lender was still gathering information and facts on the best way to proceed with the South American country.
The IMF hasn’t had any formal dealings with Venezuela in more than 20 years. Its last official assessment of the country came in 2004.
In 2007, Venezuela paid off its last World Bank loan under Maduro’s predecessor, the late Hugo Chavez.
If the IMF restores ties with Venezuela, the South American oil exporter would have access to about $4.9bn worth of Special Drawing Rights (SDRs) that were frozen seven years ago, after the IMF refused to recognise Maduro’s leadership.
SDRs are reserve assets whose values are tied to five currencies: the US dollar, the euro, the Chinese renminbi, the Japanese yen and the British pound sterling.
But US engagement in Venezuela could also create change in the country’s economy.
US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said last month that the administration of President Donald Trump would be willing to convert Venezuela’s SDRs to dollars to help rebuild the country’s economy.
And last week, the US Department of the Treasury announced it was easing some sanctions on Venezuela’s energy sector.
The Trump administration has placed a heavy focus on Venezuela’s vast oil reserves, even going so far as to claim that the natural resource rightfully belonged to the US.
Citing US oil exploration in the area in the 20th century, Trump has called Venezuela’s decision to nationalise the oil sector the “largest theft of property in the history” of the US.
His government has encouraged foreign investment in Venezuela’s oil sector since Maduro’s removal.
It has also issued two general licences, including one that allows energy companies Chevron, BP, Eni, Shell and Repsol to conduct further oil and gas operations in Venezuela. Those companies already have offices in the country and are among the main partners of state-run oil company PDVSA.
The second licence allows foreign companies to enter new oil and gas investment contracts with PDVSA.

Philadelphia-based mosaic artist Isaiah Zagar, known for creating mirrored dreamscapes on buildings across the city, has died, according to a nonprofit art center he created.
Zagar died Thursday at home of complications from heart failure and Parkinson’s disease, Philadelphia's Magic Gardens announced in a statement. He was 86.
Born in Philadelphia, Zagar returned to the city with his wife, Julia, in 1968 after a Peace Corps stint in Peru. Over the years, he created hundreds of public mosaics, many of them along the city’s funky South Street corridor, where they lived.
“He loved South Street, the city of Philadelphia, and the community fostered here with all of his heart," Emily Smith, executive director of the nonprofit, said in a statement.
Zagar used broken glass, tile, mirrors and other found objects in his work, which adorned buildings, walls and alleyways to create what the foundation called “an everlasting mark on our city.” His immersive Magic Gardens on South Street draws thousands of visitors each year.
Development threatened some of his art, including a huge mosaic on an Old City neighborhood building that was home to The Painted Bride Art Center, which he worked on throughout the 1990s. After a long legal fight, demolition on the building began in December, but some of Zagar’s work is being salvaged.
"While Isaiah lived with ups and downs of mental health struggles, and later with Parkinson’s Disease, he endlessly turned to his art-making to not only express himself, but as a tool to survive,” Smith said.
He is survived by his wife, whom he called his muse and artistic partner, and two sons, including Jeremiah Zagar, a filmmaker who directed a 2008 documentary about his father, "In A Dream.”

Judge dismisses ex-NYPD commissioner's lawsuit alleging 'systemic corruption' in police department

A federal judge has dismissed a lawsuit filed by New York City’s former interim police commissioner that accused the previous mayor, Eric Adams, and his top deputies of operating the NYPD as a “criminal enterprise.”
The racketeering lawsuit was originally filed in July by Thomas Donlon, a longtime FBI official appointed by Adams to stabilize the scandal-scarred police department.
Instead, Donlon said he encountered “systemic corruption and criminal conduct” enabled by Adams and his allies, who routinely inflated overtime, blocked internal investigations and punished whistleblowers.
In a ruling Wednesday, Judge Denise Cote said the alleged misconduct did not meet the definition of racketeering activity because the lawsuit did not describe the defendants acting with “a common purpose."
A spokesperson for the city’s Law Department said they were “pleased the court agreed there was no legal basis for this case to continue.” An inquiry to Adams' spokesperson was not returned.
John Scola, an attorney for Donlon, said his client had already appealed the decision.
“Mr. Donlon confronted corruption within the NYPD’s highest ranks and was forced out for refusing to engage in illegal conduct,” Scola said. “We are confident the Second Circuit will allow his claims to proceed.”
Donlon was appointed by Adams following the resignation of the previous police commissioner, Edward Caban, whose phone was seized by federal officials as part of a sprawling probe into the administration.
He served as the interim commissioner for about two months, and was later replaced by Jessica Tisch, who continues to lead the department.
Donlon’s lawsuit was one of several filed by veteran police officials that described a culture of rampant corruption and cronyism within the department under Adams.
In recent weeks, federal prosecutors have also brought multiple bribery cases against former police officials who served under Adams.

Loose Women star opens up on son Jamal Edwards’ death: ‘I’m trying to carry on his legacy’
A new community hub has opened in west London to mark four years since Jamal Edwards’ death

Brenda Edwards has spoken of the "scary" passage of time since her son Jamal's death, as she marked the four-year anniversary by opening a new community hub in his memory.
The Loose Women panellist described the launch as an "amazing feeling".
The Jamal Edwards Self Belief Trust unveiled its Self Belief Creative Community Hub in west London on Friday.
The opening coincided with the anniversary of the passing of the pioneering DJ and music entrepreneur, who died on 20 February 2022 at the age of 31.
Established by Edwards and her daughter Tanisha Artman soon after Jamal’s death, the charity is dedicated to fostering community and supporting young people, aiming to "carry on his legacy".
Edwards said that her work with the trust has been "absolutely pivotal", describing it as the "driving force" in navigating her grief.
She said: “The fact that I know that I’m trying to carry on his legacy to help young people is an amazing feeling.”
Edwards added: “I’m literally transforming what he was doing and what he wanted me to address, which was helping young people and bringing everybody together as a community.”
Speaking about her son’s death, she said: “It’s really quite scary to think that it’s four years this Friday.
“There’s not a day that I obviously don’t speak to him in my mind. I really feel his presence and that that really helps me.
“It’s really hard every day. But I know he is watching saying: ‘Come on, mummy, come on.'”
Jamal gained fame after setting up the music platform SBTV in 2006, and was credited with helping to launch a string of UK music acts to stardom, including Dave, Jessie J and Ed Sheeran.
He was also an ambassador for the Prince’s Trust, a charity headed up by the Prince of Wales, and in 2014 was awarded an MBE for his services to music.
Brenda described her son as “very selfless” and said he was “always thinking of others”, adding: “I think he got such a great joy out of that, and it’s taught me a lot as well.”
The Self Belief Community Hub is a space “dedicated to empowering young people”, giving them a space where they can “build their futures”, according to the trust.
The trust said the hub will host a programme of events focused on creativity, wellbeing, life skills and employability, and has facilities including music and podcast studios, co-working spaces and a subsidised kitchen with daily meals.
Brenda said it is about bringing the community together and offering support, and said that Jamal came up with the idea “the year before he became forever 31”.
She said: “Everything that I’m doing is based on his letter of wishes that he left for me with his will.”
Brenda called the letter a “guiding force” for her, adding: “In the letter, he said that he wanted young people to be at the forefront of everything that I do.
“His whole mantra was self belief. That legacy will always remain, and people will always be speaking about him and know of him as somebody that wanted to bring communities together.”
The hub is located on the housing estate in Acton where Jamal grew up, which Brenda said makes her feel “so close” to him.
She called it “totally full circle”, and added: “It was really weird. It’s a major feeling.
“Bittersweet, because I know he would have wanted to see this in fruition, but I get the strength from the fact that I know that he’s there and he’s watching.”

‘I feel like I’m failing my son’: Parents of disabled children say they are paying thousands over ‘broken system’

‘I feel like I’m failing my son’: Parents of disabled children say they are paying thousands over ‘broken system’
‘For our family, the budgeting never really ends,’ one parent said
- Bookmark
- CommentsGo to comments
Many parents of disabled children are being forced to pay thousands a year out of pocket as special educational needs and disabilities (SEND) provision continues to fall short, new research has found.
Children who need additional support in nursery, school or college currently access help through the SEND system, with their parents applying for an Education, Health and Care Plan (EHCP).
But long delays, inconsistent decisions and plans that don’t fully meet needs are causing many children with complex needs to miss out, disability charity Sense has warned.
Mother-of-one Natalie, 38 and from the West Midlands, said securing the right educational support from her seven-year-old son Azuriah has often caused her to “struggle to pay the bills,” despite having an EHCP in place for him.
Azuriah is autistic, non-verbal, has global development delay and was recently diagnosed with ADHD. To ensure she can care for him, Natalie is only able to work part-time as an HR adviser in the health sector.
Her son started at special school a year later than his peers, after he had already turned five, because they were offered a place at a school too far away initially and had to turn it down.
Three years on, Natalie continues to pay for four hours of therapy a week for Azuriah to develop his communication and social skills, costing £140 a week, or £7,280 a year. She claimed his EHCP does not fully meet his needs, with his school delivering little speech therapy, so she must fill in the gaps.
Natalie said: “For our family, the budgeting never really ends and I still feel like I am failing Azuriah. He’s non-verbal and ideally, he would have speech therapy on top of the therapy sessions I already pay for to help his communication and social skills – but that could easily cost more than £10,000 a year and I can’t afford that.
“Looking back, I can see paying for the extra therapy has helped Azuriah but I shouldn’t need to do this alone. He has an EHCP and, to me, this is basic support that should be offered in school. With speech therapy, he started at his special school with that being in place as a basic but now it’s been cut back to almost nothing.”
She added: “Our family has had so many years of financial and emotional shocks because the right support just isn’t there – sometimes it feels as if you need to be rich to be disabled. The SEND reforms need to make sure the system is properly funded, so every disabled child can access the therapies they need from a very early age.”
There are around 482,000 school children with EHCPs in the UK, rising to around 639,000 when including those aged up to 25 and/or not in school.
The number of EHCPs has increased by 166 per cent between January 2015 and January 2025.
As demand for provision grows, many councils have raised concerns about the unmanageable cost of provision, prompting the government to announce earlier that it will write off 90 per cent of the SEND deficits accrued.
The government has also indicated that it will be publishing its plans to reform the SEND system in the schools white paper, expected early this year.
Ahead of this, Sense has urged the government to ensure adequate funding for the SEND system, robust legal rights for disabled children, and joined up support between education, health and social care professionals supporting disabled children.
The charity’s survey of 1,000 parents, carried out by Censuswide, found:
- 42 per cent of parents had paid for private assessments to secure SEND support for their child, spending an average of £1,791 in the past six months
- 44 per cent had paid privately for therapies – such as speech and language therapy, physiotherapy or occupational therapy – that should have been funded by their local authority, spending an average of £1,680 in six months
- 39 per cent had made their own transport arrangements because their local authority would not fund home-to-school travel, spending an average of £1,567 over six months
James Watson-O’Neill, Sense chief executive, said: “It is unacceptable that so many families are being forced to shoulder such a huge financial burden because an underfunded SEND system is failing their children.
“Parents are doing everything they can to stop their children from falling through the cracks or waiting years for vital assessments and essential therapies. They know that their child’s wellbeing, happiness and future life chances hang in the balance.
“Too often, families are left with an impossible choice: pay out of pocket for support that should be guaranteed by law, or watch their child go without. For those who simply cannot afford it, it is their children who bear the greatest cost.”
A Department for Education spokesperson said: “We are determined to seize this once in a generation opportunity to reform the broken SEND system and transform life chances for children with additional needs so every child can thrive in a school that meets their needs, close to home.
“For too long, families have been forced to fight for support that should be routinely available when and where it is needed. We’re laying the groundwork for an inclusive education system where all children are supported at the earliest stage and can thrive in a school that meets their needs, getting the support when they need it, closer to home
“Our reforms in the upcoming schools white paper will create a better system for all families, where support is delivered earlier and closer to home, while retaining legal rights to support.”

The new ‘drones squad’ that tracks illegal waste dumps from the air
The Environment Agency will use the technology to gather crucial evidence of illicit dumping
- Bookmark
- CommentsGo to comments
Waste crime teams across the UK are set to deploy drones equipped with advanced laser mapping technology to pinpoint illegal waste dumps from the air, the government has announced.
This new aerial surveillance initiative aims to bolster efforts to track and prosecute environmental offenders.
The Environment Agency (EA) confirmed the formation of a dedicated "drones squad," comprising 33 specially trained pilots. Their mission is to gather crucial evidence of illicit dumping, ultimately facilitating the prosecution of those responsible for waste crime.
In addition to the drone programme, the environmental watchdog has developed a sophisticated new screening tool. This technology allows officers to cross-reference lorry licence applications against existing waste permit records, enhancing their ability to detect suspicious activity.
Furthermore, the Joint Unit for Waste Crime has seen its specialist team expand from 13 to 20 members, who are collaborating closely with law enforcement agencies to dismantle organised crime networks.
These measures come as waste crime continues to escalate across the country, leading to widespread public anger over high-profile illegal tips. Notable incidents include a 150-metre-long dump discovered near the River Cherwell in Oxfordshire and a staggering 30,000-tonne heap found within the protected Hoads Wood area in Kent.
Figures obtained under freedom of information laws by the BBC found some 517 waste tips were operating at the end of last year, including 11 “super sites”.
But the EA has also ramped up action to tackle the problem, saying it shut down 751 sites in a record year last year.
Phil Davies, head of the Joint Unit for Waste Crime Unit, said: “Illegal waste dumping is appalling, and we are determined to turn the tide on this heinous crime.
“With organised criminals becoming ever more sophisticated, we are adopting new technologies to find and, importantly, stop them.
“Through the greater use of drones, stronger partnerships and more officers on the ground, we will build on our action so far and send a clear message to those committing waste crimes – we will stop you.”
The EA has already been flying drones from a dedicated aircraft, mainly to capture flood information – racking up a total of 272 hours in flight time since July last year.
But the 54 drones will soon be equipped with light detection and ranging (Lidar) technology, which fires millions of laser points per second towards the ground below to create a detailed map of illegal waste sites.
The watchdog said that installing this more precise mapping technology on to drones will allow teams to pinpoint exactly where waste has been dumped and use the maps as evidence in court.
Meanwhile, the EA’s new licence screening software will allow officers to check the official weekly listings of all new applications for heavy goods vehicle operator licences against the EA’s register of waste permits and waste carrier licences.
This means the teams will be better able to identify and target potential offenders before they begin operating.
The new measures come after the Government increased the Environment Agency’s budget for waste crime enforcement by more than 50% this year to £15.6 million.
Environment Secretary Emma Reynolds said: “This Government is aggressively pursuing waste criminals and bringing offenders to justice.”
She added: “From advanced laser mapping to drone surveillance and new vehicle scanning tools, this technology is helping us track, expose and stop waste crime, ensuring those who blight our communities are held to account.”

The Sopranos star reveals toll hit show took on James Gandolfini
Gandolfini died of a heart attack on holiday in Rome in 2013 aged 51
- Bookmark
- CommentsGo to comments
James Gandolfini found the relentless violence inherent in his iconic role on The Sopranos deeply challenging, a co-star has revealed.
Steve Schirripa, who portrayed mobster Bobby Bacala, explained that while the series captivated millions for almost a decade, the demands of playing its titular character began to weigh heavily on Gandolfini.
"That bothered him, having to be angry all the time, that started getting to him," the 68-year-old told the Press Association.
Schirripa noted this struggle intensified towards the latter half of the show’s run.
He highlighted Gandolfini’s gruelling schedule, which involved "16-hour days, five days a week," where he "had to kill people, he had to yell, be angry, every day, every day, every day."
Reflecting on the toll, Schirripa added: "For some people, it’s easy. For some people, it’s not. I think it started bothering him." Gandolfini tragically died from a heart attack in Rome in 2013, aged 51.
Schirripa, speaking ahead of the Talking Sopranos tour with co-star Michael Imperioli, who played Christopher Moltisanti, said while Gandolfini “was not without his problems”, he cared about people.
“He was a good guy,” he said.
“[He was] a lot of fun. We had a lot of laughs. As a cast, a lot of us hung around together off camera and we had a lot of fun.
“We travelled together a lot. We knew each other’s families. You’re together nine or 10 years, people went through marriages, divorces, had babies, so it really did become like a family.
“A lot of parties, a lot of cast parties, Christmas parties. Every time somebody got killed off, we took them out to dinner.
“Jim was a good guy, a generous guy, not without problems, which has been said over and over, but a nice guy, and he gave a shit about people.”
Schirripa said the show would go from “hysterical” to “extremely violent” with a single episode, or even scene – but he said that showed the brilliance of the writing.
He said: “I think that’s why it’s still endorsed because it was funny, it was sad, it was violent. It was all of these things.
“It wasn’t one thing, you know, it wasn’t just a mob show. It went deep. It’s about capitalism. It’s about family. It’s about a lot of things.
“It’s not just about mob guys hanging out in the strip club, killing people. It’s much deeper and much more complicated. It’s a very smart show.”
The honesty and realism of the show, Schirripa said, was its strength – and that included “horrible” scenes where viewers would turn away, including of murder and rape.
But Schirripa does not think any of it was too far, because ultimately it was a show about bad people.
He said: “I think the show shows what these guys are all about.
“I think the writers, you know, when you’re saying it’s funny, I think the writers knew it was funny, and this is a great show, and then they took you back to reality, that these are bad people.
“Let’s not bullshit ourselves. These guys are bad guys. They’re not, you know, fun-loving characters.
“They take you back to reality to show you these are bad guys, you know, they’re sociopaths, they’re psychopaths.
“They kill in a drop of a dime and then go sit down and eat a steak dinner.”
This type of writing, Schirripa says, is the reason the show “still holds up very much like it was written today”.
“I think 50 years from now people will still be watching it,” he added.
Talking Sopranos will be in Edinburgh on Saturday and Glasgow on Sunday before heading to other UK cities.

Wales becomes UK launchpad for next generation autonomous technology
Welsh communities will benefit from high-skilled roles as a landmark £50 million Defence Growth Deal boosts autonomous technology
- Welsh communities to benefit from high-skilled roles as landmark £50 million Defence Growth Deal boosts autonomous defence technology.
- Welsh SMEs will gain greater direct access to secure defence contracts by removing barriers to working with the MOD.
- Work to establish a new Defence Technical Excellence College to train the next generation of defence engineers.
Thousands of skilled workers in Wales will be involved in the design, testing and manufacture of innovative technologies, as a landmark deal positions the nation at the forefront of Britain’s defence future.
Defence Secretary John Healey MP, Wales First Minister Eluned Morgan and Secretary of State for Wales Jo Stevens signed the £50 million Wales Defence Growth Deal, which will maximise Wales as a UK launchpad for autonomous technology and uncrewed systems, such as for use in intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance, and one-way drones.
The deal – signed at Cardiff Castle – will widen access to MOD test ranges across Wales, including at MOD Aberporth, and working with the Civil Aviation Authority and its military counterpart, air corridors across central Wales will also be expanded to enable testing of uncrewed aerial systems by industry and the military.
Additionally, it will be made easier for Welsh small and medium-sized businesses to gain greater direct access to secure defence contracts by ensuring they have the proper clearances and access, creating a level playing field with major defence companies and unlocking homegrown talent. This will break from SMEs needing to go through Prime contractors to gain access to certain classified work.
Furthermore, our intention is to work collaboratively to establish a new Defence Technical Excellence College by September 2027. The college will train the next generation of defence engineers to support Britain’s growing autonomous capabilities.
It is the latest example of the Welsh and UK Governments putting Wales on the front foot, supporting Welsh jobs and getting Britain building again. Earlier this week, both governments announced that seven new railway stations are set to be built across Wales, creating thousands of jobs across the country, boosting the construction industry and driving real change that communities will see.
Defence Secretary John Healey MP said:
We pledged a Defence Growth Deal for Wales and this is the UK Government delivering on that commitment.
Wales is central to the defence of the UK and I am proud to launch this new partnership that will transform the nation into a centre for innovation. It will create good jobs and drive growth in Wales.
We’re investing £50 million in this deal to make Wales the UK’s launchpad for uncrewed systems. Expanding test ranges and opening up Welsh skies will help put Britain at the forefront of the autonomous defence technology that our Armed Forces need to fight and win.
The First Minister of Wales Eluned Morgan said:
Wales will play its part to secure our national defence in an increasingly unstable world.
The aerospace and defence sector in Wales is vitally important to the economy and directly employs over 16,000 highly skilled workers. The backbone of the sector is the huge number of small and medium size companies across the whole of Wales who are the life blood of development and innovation.
The duel use nature of the deal means that its benefits will be felt across the wider Welsh economy. It is vital now that we see this commitment from the MOD filter down to the SMEs quickly and improves the defence capability of the UK.
Secretary of State for Wales Jo Stevens said:
Today’s deal will shape the future of the defence industry for years to come and will deliver economic growth and thousands of skilled well-paid jobs.
We are building on Welsh expertise and our strong base by investing £50 million so Wales can lead the way in 21st century autonomous defence technology.
Kevin Craven, CEO of ADS, the trade association representing more than 1800 businesses throughout the UK in aerospace, defence, security and space:
The Defence Growth Deals were a standout feature of the Defence Industrial Strategy – aiming to leverage both well-established and developing strengths of the defence industrial base across the UK. Here in Wales, where the industrial footprint includes particular strengths in unmanned capabilities, world-renowned componentry and cutting-edge dual use technologies, this support is particularly pertinent.
Today’s Wales Defence Growth Deal dovetails the two core motivations of industry and government alike: building UK and effective deterrence capabilities, while providing high-quality, high-value employment that strengthens local communities.
ADS are delighted to have worked in concert with our regional partners, the Ministry of Defence team and of course our brilliant members on how this support can truly unlock Wales’ potential. We look forward to building on this further.
Almost 4,000 people in Wales are currently employed through MOD industry spending, as part of the more than £1 billion spent with the Welsh defence industry.
Today’s investment will see innovative defence platforms designed, built and tested in Wales, helping to power autonomous systems across land, sea and air. And as part of the Defence Growth Deal, work will take place on developing the sovereign capabilities for critical materials resilience and assurance.
Defence Growth Deals are being created under the Defence Industrial Strategy as part of a bold initiative to support the growth potential of the defence industry, underpinned by the largest sustained increase in defence spending since the end of the Cold War - hitting 2.6% of GDP from 2027.

Why plan by US and Japan to relocate Okinawa airbase is hitting turbulence
The US does not intend to vacate the current airbase for now due to disagreement over runway length at a replacement site, a report says
The US military would not return its Futenma airbase to Japanese control until Tokyo builds a longer runway than the one being built at a replacement site in the northeast of Okinawa prefecture, according to a report.
If the US refuses to relocate its forces to the new facility at Henoko, the already prolonged transfer could face further delays, a scenario that analysts say risks reigniting sentiment among residents in Okinawa against the American military presence and complicating plans between the US and Japan to realign their forces in the Indo-Pacific.
Futenma has a single runway measuring 2.74km (1.7 miles). The replacement facility at Camp Schwab, in the village of Henoko, is designed to have two runways in a V configuration once offshore reclamation and construction works are completed, with each envisioned to be 1.8km in length.
Proposals to close Futenma date back five decades, although they only gained traction in the late 1990s when Henoko was identified as the replacement site. Critics have described Futenma as the most dangerous airfield in the world, as many residents live in the vicinity of the airbase.

International aid convoy to arrive in Cuba in March: Organisers
Sign up now: Get ST's newsletters delivered to your inbox
HAVANA – An international convoy with humanitarian aid for Cuba, which is battling an economic crisis worsened by an oil blockade imposed by Washington, will arrive in Havana on March 21, organisers said on Feb 19.
The organisers, Nuestra America Convoy to Cuba, say they will deliver the aid by air, land and sea to the communist island which has risked being plunged into darkness since US President Donald Trump vowed to starve it of oil in January.
“The convoy will deliver urgently needed food, medicine, medical supplies, and essential goods to communities facing acute shortages as a result of the intensified US siege that has disrupted fuel imports, grounded flights, and strained hospitals and critical infrastructure,” the group said in statement.
It describes itself as an international coalition of trade unionists, parliamentarians, humanitarian organisations and public figures including Swedish activist Greta Thunberg – who was expelled from Israel in 2025 after trying to board a flotilla with aid destined for Gaza.
“I support this convoy to Cuba not only because its people need all the aid that the convoy can deliver,” she was quoted as saying in the statement.
“I also support it because international solidarity is the only force powerful enough to push back against imperial figures like Trump and (Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin) Netanyahu that would prefer to see our fundamental rights in ruins.”
The statement did not specify whether Ms Thunberg would participate in person.
Cuba, a Caribbean country of 9.6 million people, lost its main oil supply line when Mr Trump in January ordered the ouster of Nicolas Maduro, the long-term leader of Cuban ally Venezuela.
Mr Trump said no more Venezuelan oil would go to Cuba and also threatened tariffs for any other country stepping in with crude supplies.
No foreign fuel or oil tanker has arrived in Cuba in weeks, experts in maritime transport tracking have told AFP, and emergency measures kicked in earlier in February to conserve fast-dwindling fuel stocks.
The government shuttered universities, reduced school hours and the work week, and slashed public transport as it limited fuel sales.
Cuba, under a US trade embargo since 1962, has for years been battling extended power cuts and shortages of fuel, medicine and food. AFP

Austrian climber guilty of manslaughter after girlfriend froze to death on mountain
Kerstin G died of hypothermia after being left alone on Austria’s highest peak
- Bookmark
An Austrian court has found an amateur mountaineer guilty of manslaughter over his girlfriend’s death near the nation’s highest summit, where he had left her to fetch help, local media reported.
The court in the western city of Innsbruck on Thursday gave Thomas Plamberger a five-month suspended prison sentence and a fine of €9,400 (£8,200) for causing the woman’s death in January 2025 by gross negligence. The offence carries a maximum jail sentence of three years.
Plamberger, 37, who pleaded not guilty, told the court he was “terribly sorry”.
The victim, named during court proceedings as Kerstin G, 33, died of hypothermia just metres below the summit of Grossglockner, which rises 3,798 metres in the Hohe Tauern range and is considered one of the most demanding winter ascents in the Alps.
“I loved Kerstin,” Plamberger said, “we always made decisions together on the mountain.”
The case is unusual because while climbing accidents are common, prosecutions over them are rare, even in situations where various mistakes are made.
The trial raises questions about the extent of legal liability in the high mountains, an inherently dangerous environment that climbers generally explore at their own risk.
Legal experts say the proceedings effectively test Austria’s “duty of care” doctrine, under which a person who assumes responsibility for another in a hazardous situation can be held criminally liable if they fail to act appropriately. Prosecutors argued that Plamberger, as the more experienced alpinist, bore that responsibility during the climb.
After a day’s climbing in which they fell behind schedule, the woman was exhausted and unable to go. She stopped about 50m below the Grossglockner summit on a freezing winter night, the court heard.
The defendant left his girlfriend exposed to strong winds, without wrapping her in her emergency blanket or bivouac bag for reasons he could not fully explain, to fetch help in a shelter on the other side of the summit. The equipment stayed in her rucksack.
Austrian media reported that wind speeds reached about 74kmph and temperatures dropped to around -8C, with wind chill making it feel closer to -20C. Rescue workers later told the court that when they recovered Kerstin’s body, she was still wearing her rucksack, her gloves were off and her boots open.
A short call to the mountain police did not trigger a search because, the police said, Plamberger did not make clear they needed rescuing, and he failed to answer calls back or WhatsApp messages asking if they needed help.
The defendant said his phone had been in airplane mode to save battery.
Prosecutors said a police helicopter had flown over the area earlier in the evening but did not spot any distress signals.
Webcam footage shown in court captured the couple’s headlamps near the summit late at night and the defendant’s light descending alone in the early hours.
During the trial, an ex-girlfriend testified that Plamberger had left her alone during a previous ascent of the same mountain in 2023 after an argument over the route. She described feeling dizzy and frightened in the dark after her headlamp failed, The New York Times reported.
The defence objected to suggestions that the earlier incident demonstrated a pattern of behaviour.
The presiding judge, Norbert Hofer, himself an experienced mountaineer and rescuer, said he did not consider the defendant a murderer but found that he had failed to properly assess his partner’s limits in extreme winter conditions.
“You have borne an incredible burden – you lost a person,” Mr Hofer told Plamberger. “You are an excellent alpinist, but someone who finds it very difficult to make the switch between your own limits and those of others.”
The court said mitigating factors included the defendant’s previously clean criminal record and the personal loss he had suffered. The verdict is subject to appeal.

Controversial ‘Luna Park’-style outdoor luge approved on Mornington Peninsula

Controversial ‘Luna Park’-style outdoor luge approved on Mornington Peninsula
A controversial multimillion-dollar tourist attraction on the Mornington Peninsula has been approved by the state government, ignoring concerns from the community about environmental and landslide risks.
The project on Arthurs Seat – a 300-metre summit 85 kilometres south-east of Melbourne – was granted a permit from Planning Minister Sonya Kilkenny on Thursday.
Part of a redevelopment project that is set to cost $25 million, it will include an outdoor luge and a 34-metre observation tower.
Arthurs Seat Eagle CEO Matthew Mulkearns said the major development would expand the area’s $1.8 billion local visitor economy.
“This upgrade lets us share the magic of the Mornington Peninsula in bold new ways … We’re building a truly world-class experience worthy of this incredible landscape,” Mulkearns said.
But the development has faced fierce opposition from locals and environmental activists. Resident Kylie Greer from activism group Save our Seat said adding “Luna Park attributes” to a state park was an irresponsible decision.
“A luge is not an appropriate activity centre for a state park. It will ruin the hill,” Greer said. “Save our Seat are not anti-tourism. We are not anti-development. We’re for sensible tourism on the hill.”
“Minister Kilkenny will go down in history as the person who signed off on the destruction of the natural heritage and beauty of one of Victoria’s most treasured places.”
The original plans for the attraction were adjusted in July 2025 following community concern. Changes included shortening the luge track, removing a pedestrian bridge and redesigning the 34-metre observation tower.
The final permit includes a long list of conditions, including maintaining the natural slope, retaining existing vegetation along the luge corridor and regular consultation with Parks Victoria about impacts to local trees and flora.
Landslide and erosion risks were also assessed by a qualified geotechnical expert, according to a government letter. Arthurs Seat is a 10-minute drive from McCrae, which dealt with a major landslide incident last January. A controversial interim erosion management overlay plan has since been introduced to the Mornington Peninsula.
Environment Minister Steve Dimopoulos said in a statement that the development would strengthen Victoria as a long-term tourist destination.
“The upgraded Eagle shows exactly how Victoria can create new tourism and recreation experiences while protecting the natural environment that defines our state,” Dimopoulos said.
Mornington Peninsula Shire councillors were divided when it came to the major development. During a meeting on December 2, the council ultimately voted against a formal objection to the plans despite being recommended to do so by officers.
The officer report raised concerns about the limited detail provided around landslide susceptibility, vegetation clearance and the impact on wildlife on the proposed site.
The council had no authority to make decisions about the project, but could only give recommendations to the planning minister.
The planning permit application was originally lodged with the Department of Transport and Planning by Arthurs Seat Eagle in September 2024, before undergoing a period of community consultation.
The project was submitted under the government development facilitation plan, which aims to fast-track projects which meet specific criteria.
Arthurs Seat Eagle has a 50-year lease agreement with the state government, which it signed in 2015. The company is owned by billionaire Peter Gunn and NAB director Simon McKeon.

Memorial services for Rev. Jesse Jackson expanded to include South Carolina and Washington, DC
Memorial services honoring the life of the late Rev. Jesse Jackson Sr. will be expanded beyond Chicago with events in Washington, D.C., and South Carolina
- Bookmark
Memorial services honoring the life of the Rev. Jesse Jackson Sr. will be expanded beyond Chicago with events in Washington, D.C., and South Carolina, the late civil rights leader's organization announced Thursday.
Jackson, a protégé of the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. and two-time presidential candidate, died earlier this week at age 84 after battling a rare neurological disorder that affected his ability to move and talk.
Jackson will still lie in repose next week at the Chicago headquarters of his Rainbow PUSH Coalition with a public celebration of life and homegoing services to follow, though dates for Chicago events have been changed. Formal services were added, scheduled from March 1 to March 4 in Washington, D.C., and South Carolina, where Jackson was born and raised.
Rainbow PUSH did not offer further details.
Jackson’s adult children gathered outside the family home in Chicago on Wednesday, saying the funeral services would be large gatherings where everyone would be welcomed. They also vowed to continue his decades of advocacy.
“Although his body is absent from us, his spirit suffuses and infuses us, and it charges us to continue with the work,” said Santita Jackson, his eldest child.
In Chicago, a public celebration of life will be held at House of Hope, a 10,000-seat church, on March 6, followed by private homegoing services the next day at Rainbow PUSH, which will be livestreamed.
Jackson rose to prominence six decades ago as a protégé of King, joining the voting rights march King led from Selma to Montgomery, Alabama. King later dispatched Jackson to Chicago to launch Operation Breadbasket, a Southern Christian Leadership Conference effort to pressure companies to hire Black workers. Jackson was with King on April 4, 1968, when the civil rights leader was killed.

Iran tells UN chief it will respond 'decisively' if subjected to military aggression

Iran told UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres on Thursday that Tehran will consider bases, facilities, and assets of the "hostile force" in the region as legitimate targets if it faces military aggression.
US President Donald Trump's rhetoric towards Iran "signals a real risk of military aggression," Iran's permanent mission to the United Nations said in the letter, adding that Iran did not want a war.
The letter cited Trump's social media post in which he wrote, "Should Iran decide not to make a deal, it may be necessary for the United States to use Diego Garcia and the Airfield located in Fairford in order to eradicate a potential attack."
Iran prepared to respond 'decisively'
The letter claimed that should the US approach talks with "seriousness and sincerity and demonstrate genuine respect for the principles of the Charter of the United Nations and the peremptory norms of international law," a "durable and balanced solution" could be achieved.
However, if subjected to military aggression, Iran will respond "decisively," the letter said.

Trump considers limited strike on Iran, most air power since 2003 arrives in Middle East - WSJ

US President Donald Trump is considering an initial limited strike on Iran to force it to agree to his demands regarding a deal, a military action designed to be small enough not to inspire major retaliation, the Wall Street Journal reported Thursday night.
While Trump has not decided on any attack, officials said he is continuing options ranging from a weeklong campaign with the goal of regime change to a smaller wave of strikes designed to force Iran to agree to a deal favorable for the US.
A smaller attack would target a few military or government sites, starting limited in scope with the option to increase them until the Iranian regime agreed to Trump’s terms or fell, the Journal cited people familiar with the matter as saying.
US Middle East presence grows
This comes as the US sends more jet fighters and support aircraft to the Middle East, culminating in the greatest amount of air power in the region since 2003 when the US invaded Iraq, according to the Journal.
This is in addition to the naval support the US has in the region, including the aircraft carrier USS Lincoln and the USS Gerald R Ford, which is on its way.
Additionally, some weapons do not need to be in the Middle East for an attack. B-2 stealth bombers could carry out an attack directly from the US, as they did during Operation Midnight Hammer.
The extensive arsenal would allow the US to carry out a campaign to kill scores of Iranian political and military figures, the Journal reported.

New Mexico reopens investigation of Epstein ranch

New Mexico’s attorney-general on Feb 19 ordered the reopening of the state’s criminal investigation into alleged crimes at a ranch owned by late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, based on new information made public by the US Justice Department, the state’s Department of Justice said.
The US Justice Department on Jan 30 made public millions of Epstein-related files
New Mexico Attorney-General Raul Torrez ordered the reopening of the investigation of Epstein’s ranch south of state capital Santa Fe after his predecessor, fellow Democrat Hector Balderas, closed it in 2019 to avoid overlap with federal probes. Pressure to uncover Epstein’s crimes has become a political headache for President Donald Trump, a Republican.
“Revelations outlined in the previously sealed Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) files warrant further examination,” New Mexico Department of Justice spokesperson Lauren Rodriguez said in a statement.
The renewed probe comes two days after New Mexico’s Democratic-controlled legislature launched what lawmakers said was the first comprehensive investigation into Epstein’s alleged crimes at Zorro Ranch, which is 48km south of Santa Fe.
The lawmakers have opened a committee that will take testimony at the state house. The investigation announced on Feb 19 is a separate, criminal probe and led by the state’s top prosecutor.
As part of the New Mexico criminal investigation, special agents and prosecutors will seek immediate access to the US Department of Justice’s complete, unredacted case file on Epstein and work collaboratively with the legislature’s investigative committee, Ms Rodriguez said.
The criminal investigation will include the “collection and preservation of any relevant evidence that remains available”, she added.
The US Justice Department and the FBI did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
Epstein died in what was ruled a suicide in a New York jail in 2019 while facing federal sex-trafficking charges.
Zorro Ranch was sold by Epstein’s estate in 2023 to Texas businessman and politician Don Huffines. A spokesperson for Huffines, in a statement, said the owners had never been approached by law enforcement requesting access to the ranch, but would “grant full and complete cooperation” in the event they were.
In a social media post on Feb 16, Mr Huffines said he planned to turn the ranch into a Christian retreat.
The New Mexico Department of Justice on Feb 18 said it was investigating an allegation, which emerged from the US Department of Justice release, that Epstein ordered the burial of the bodies of two foreign girls on hills outside Zorro Ranch. REUTERS

In Dhaka, Sheikh Hasani's palace has been turned into a museum honoring victims of the July 2024 uprising

Within the grounds of the Ganabhaban – the "People's House" in Bengali –the clamor of the Bangladeshi capital seems like a distant murmur. The property, which is located in the heart of Dhaka just a stone's throw from Parliament, was once the official residence of Sheikh Hasina, the former prime minister who was ousted in August 2024 following a student-led movement. Once the nerve center of power, it has been transformed into a museum commemorating the victims of the "Iron Lady's" regime. The museum will open to the public in the coming weeks, with admission set at 100 takas, or about €0.70.
"When the tyrant leaves, citizens reclaim their rights and the 'People's House' belongs to us again," said Mostofa Sarwar Farooki, who served as minister of culture in the interim government led by Nobel Peace Prize laureate Muhammad Yunus. Yunus, who oversaw the transition for 18 months until the February 12 elections, was particularly committed to this project; around €8 million was devoted to its creation, and a small team worked day and night to complete the renovations in record time, just ahead of the vote that brought the Bangladesh Nationalist Party to power.

Pakistan are the previous winners of the competition, but sit outside those ranked as favourites in this edition, as do New Zealand.
Both, however, have the capability of taking down the game’s top names in an instant.

Pakistan look to shake ‘nearly men’ tag with T20 World Cup crown in sight
Shadab Khan said Pakistan believed they could go on and win the T20 World Cup after producing their best performance of the tournament to secure their last Super Eights berth on Wednesday.
Bowling out Namibia for 97 to win by a colossal 102 runs in Colombo meant Pakistan bounced back in style after a defeat to archrivals India had left them in danger of elimination.
“We didn’t take the [Namibia] game lightly after so much talk about one match against India,” said Shadab, who scored a brisk 22-ball 36 and grabbed 3-19 in the match against the Africans.
“We are on the right track to achieve the goal of winning the World Cup, and we are following a process,” he added.
Shadab warned that the Super Eights, however, will be a step up with England and co-hosts Sri Lanka awaiting Pakistan after the New Zealand test.
“There are eight good teams, so it will be a tough stage, and all matches will be high-pressure games,” said Shadab.
How did Pakistan reach the T20 World Cup Super Eights?
Pakistan rode on an undefeated maiden T20 international century by opener Sahibzada Farhan to post 199-3 in their win against Namibia.
Spinners Usman Tariq and Shadab Khan then shared seven wickets to rout Namibia in 17.3 overs.
It was a performance Pakistan desperately needed, as well as result, after an underwhelming win against the Netherlands to open their tournament. The victory against the USA that followed – avenging their 2024 edition reverse – was an improvement, but the hammering by India left a lot to be desired.
How did New Zealand reach the T20 World Cup Super Eights?
New Zealand capped their group stage with an eight-wicket win against Canada, but a scare was handed to the Kiwis by Canadian opener Yuvraj Samra scintillating 110 off 65 balls.
Glenn Phillips (76) and Rachin Ravindra (59) smashed unbeaten half-centuries as New Zealand chased down a target of 174 with 4.5 overs to spare for their third win in four matches.
It followed a heavy seven-wicket defeat by group winners South Africa, and victories against Afghanistan and the United Arab Emirates.
Group leaders South Africa had already advanced to the Super Eights after a hat-trick of wins.
Why didn’t Mitchell Santner captain New Zealand against Canada?
New Zealand T20 captain and key spinner, Mitchell Santner, sat out the win against Canada due to illness.
Daryl Mitchell stepped in to lead the Kiwis in the match after regular, but Santner is expected to return for the match against Pakistan.
With spin set to come to the fore once again in Colombo, Santner’s availability could be crucial. Ish Sodhi could come into the side at the expense of a seam bowler to bolster the spin options.
Will Shaheen Shah Afridi return for Pakistan to face New Zealand?
Shaheen Shah Afridi’s omission from the final group stage match against Namibia was a huge shock. Although underperforming in the first three games, Shaheen did claim a wicket in each, but his economy rate was deemed expensive.
Salman Mirza stepped in for the game against Namibia, and even though Shaheen’s absence was considered as the left-arm seamer being dropped, his return is expected against New Zealand.
What is New Zealand’s T20 World Cup record?
New Zealand are yet to claim a T20 World Cup title, coming closest in 2021 – at the delayed 2020 edition – when they were beaten by Australia in the final
What is Pakistan’s T20 World Cup record?
Pakistan are three-time finalists, but have only lifted the trophy once.
The first appearance in the final came in the inaugural competition in 2007, when India claimed a five-run win.
The second edition, in 2009, saw Pakistan beat Sri Lanka in the final, but a 13-year wait ensued for the next appearance in the showpiece finale – only for England to sweep to a five-wicket victory.
What happened the last time New Zealand played Pakistan in a T20?
The sides last met in a T20 in a five-game series in New Zealand last March.
New Zealand claimed the series 4-1, including winning the final match by eight wickets after restricting the tourists to 128-9 – of which Salman Agha scored 51 and Shadab Khan scored 28. Only one other Pakistani batter reached double figures, with opener Mohammad Haris making 11.
Head-to-head
This will be the 50th meeting between the countries in cricket’s shortest format. The victory margin for the teams is narrowly edged by Pakistan with 24 wins to New Zealand’s 23.

Kim Jong Un opens North Korea’s 9th party congress, highlights economic gains
North Korea has opened a major ruling party congress in Pyongyang, state media said on Friday, a rare gathering held roughly every five years that analysts say will set national priorities, including nuclear policy. The Workers’ Party congress is the regime’s top political event and often signals policy shifts or leadership changes.
North Korea has opened a key party congress, state media said Friday, a once-in-five-years showcase that analysts say will outline a wide range of national priorities, including nuclear objectives.
The Ninth Congress of the Workers' Party of Korea "opened with great ceremony in Pyongyang" on Thursday, the Korean Central News Agency said.
The congress is the ruling party's top gathering, a grand political set-piece that reinforces the regime's authority and can serve as a platform for announcements of policy shifts or elite personnel changes.
Since the 2021 event, North Korea has continued to develop its nuclear arsenal, repeatedly test-launching intercontinental ballistic missiles in defiance of bans ordered by the UN Security Council.
Pyongyang has also developed deep ties with Moscow during its war in Ukraine, with North Korean soldiers sent to fight alongside Russian forces.

In 2024, the two countries signed a treaty including a mutual defence clause.
Pyongyang's leader Kim Jong Un touted a newly built street of flats for families of soldiers killed supporting Russia's war against Ukraine, state media reported Monday.
Observers have been scouring satellite imagery for any signs of the vast military parades that have marked previous gatherings.
Any parade will be closely watched for signs of a shift in North Korea's military bearing.
Pyongyang has used previous processions to show off its newest and most potent weapons, a rare source of insight into the strength of its armed forces.
Biggest enemy
At the previous congress five years ago, Kim declared that the United States was his nation's "biggest enemy".
There is keen interest in whether he might soften this stance, or double down.
US President Donald Trump stepped up his courtship of Kim during a tour of Asia last year, saying he was "100 percent" open to a meeting.

He even bucked decades of US policy by conceding that North Korea was "sort of a nuclear power".
But Kim has so far refused to take the bait.
Kim appeared alongside China's Xi Jinping and Russia's Vladimir Putin at a grand military parade in Beijing last year – a striking display of his powerful friends and elevated status in global politics.
North Korea's economy has for years languished under heavy Western sanctions on everything from oil to seafood, measures that aim to choke off funding for its nuclear weapons programme.
Late last month, Kim oversaw the test launch of missiles from a multiple rocket launcher and said that "next-stage plans for further bolstering up the country's nuclear war deterrent" would be clarified at the upcoming party congress.
Kim was accompanied at the test by his daughter Ju Ae, believed to be his likely successor.
Close attention will be paid to whether Ju Ae will be given any official party titles at this year's congress.

New Mexico reopens criminal probe into Jeffrey Epstein’s Zorro Ranch

New Mexico’s attorney general on Thursday ordered the reopening of the state’s criminal investigation into alleged crimes at a ranch owned by late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, based on new information made public by the US Justice Department, the state Department of Justice said.
The US Justice Department on Jan. 30 released millions of Epstein-related files in the latest disclosure shedding new light on the financier’s criminal activities in New Mexico over three decades.

Scientists test universal vaccine for cold, flu, Covid and allergies
The nasal spray works to protect the lungs of mice, and could eventually replace multiple jabs if shown to be effective and safe for humans
The world is a significant step closer to a universal vaccine for cold, flu, Covid and allergies, scientists believe.
Experts at Stanford Medicine in the US have developed a universal vaccine that could be given as a nasal spray and could protect against a wide range of respiratory viruses, bacteria and allergy triggers.
Although the study, published in the journal Science, was in mice, they said the vaccine offered broad protection in the lungs for several months.
Vaccinated mice were protected against Covid and other coronaviruses, Staph (which can infect the skin and cause sepsis), Acinetobacter baumannii (which can cause infections in the blood, urinary tract, lungs or wounds), and house dust mites.
If translated into humans, such a vaccine could replace multiple jabs every year for winter respiratory infections. It could also potentially work against new pandemic bugs.
Bali Pulendran, director of the Institute for Immunity, Transplantation and Infection at Stanford Medicine and lead author, said: “I think what we have is a universal vaccine against diverse respiratory threats …

The Times of Israel is liveblogging Friday’s events as they unfold.
Istanbul police detain DW reporter for ‘misleading information,’ insulting Erdogan
Turkish authorities detain a veteran correspondent of German state-backed international broadcaster Deutsche Welle in Ankara, accusing him of “disseminating misleading information” and “insulting the president.”
Istanbul Chief Public Prosecutor’s Office says in a statement it detained Alican Uludag and launched a criminal investigation based on some of his social media posts. He will be brought before prosecutors today.
Deutsche Welle, or DW, says the correspondent, who has been working for the broadcaster for several years, was arrested in Ankara and taken to Istanbul police late yesterday.
DW Director General Barbara Massing calls the accusations baseless and says the arrest was “a deliberate act of intimidation and shows how severely the government is suppressing press freedom.”
DW says the allegations against Uludag relate to his criticism of Turkish government measures that led to the release of suspected Islamic State group operatives in a post on social media platform X he made about a year and a half ago.
It adds that his apartment was searched and IT equipment was confiscated.
Epstein estate agrees to settle victim claims totalling up to $35m
The estate of convicted US sex offender Jeffrey Epstein has agreed to pay up to $35 million to settle the outstanding legal claims of potentially dozens of victims, according to a proposed court judgment filed yesterday.
The settlement is related to victims who said they were “sexually assaulted or abused or trafficked by Jeffrey Epstein between January 1, 1995, and through August 10, 2019,” the date of the disgraced financier’s death in prison, the judgment says.
Epstein’s estate would pay $35 million if 40 or more women are eligible for compensation and $25 million if the number is lower than 40.
Hamas says political path for Gaza must begin with end to ‘aggression’
Discussions on Gaza’s future must begin with a total halt to Israeli “aggression,” the Hamas terror group says, after US President Donald Trump’s Board of Peace met yesterday for the first time.
“Any political process or any arrangement under discussion concerning the Gaza Strip and the future of our Palestinian people must start with the total halt of aggression, the lifting of the blockade, and the guarantee of our people’s legitimate national rights, first and foremost their right to freedom and self-determination,” Hamas says in a statement.
Israel currently controls just over half of the Gaza Strip, in accordance with a US-brokered ceasefire deal. Since the truce went into effect, Israel has accused Hamas of frequently violating it, and terror operatives have killed four Israeli soldiers. Israel has responded with airstrikes, targeting Hamas sites and operatives, which have killed hundreds.
Trump says he will declassify files on UFOs, citing ‘tremendous interest’
US President Donald Trump says he has instructed his defense secretary and other agency heads to “begin the process of identifying and releasing government files related to alien and extraterrestrial life, unidentified aerial phenomena (UAP), and unidentified flying objects (UFOs).”
In a post to his Truth Social platform, Trump cites “tremendous interest shown” in “these highly complex, but extremely interesting and important, matters.”
The move comes after former president Barack Obama said in an interview published last weekend that aliens are “real,” only to clarify later that he was speaking speculatively, writing: “I saw no evidence during my presidency that extraterrestrials have made contact with us. Really!”
Trump, asked about the incident, said Obama had revealed classified information, and then teased his own ability to disclose files.
Thousands of Palestinians cross into Jerusalem for first Friday prayers of Ramadan
Thousands of West Bank Palestinians have crossed Israeli checkpoints into Jerusalem this morning for Friday Ramadan prayers at the Al-Aqsa Mosque compound on the Temple Mount.
Israel said that it would cap the number of Palestinian worshipers from the West Bank attending the weekly prayers at 10,000.
Like last year, only males aged 55 and up, women 50 and up, and children 12 and below when accompanied by a first-degree relative will be permitted to attend prayers at Al‑Aqsa. The restrictions apply only to the 10,000 Palestinians traveling from the West Bank, and not to Muslim Arab Israelis.

Hisham Ibrahim, Jerusalem District police chief Deputy Commissioner Avshalom Peled, and Border Police chief Deputy Commissioner Brik Yitzhak are holding an assessment at the Qalandiya checkpoint, where some 2,000 Palestinians have crossed this morning, according to Israeli authorities.
Man in his 30s dies in apparent stabbing in Tel Aviv; no terror motive suspected
A man, reported to be in his 30s, has died in hospital with penetrating wounds, after being transferred in critical condition following a violent incident in Tel Aviv.
The incident took place on Ben Avigdor Street. According to the Israel Hayom daily, police are reviewing security footage from the area.
The incident is not believed to be terrorism-related.
National Committee for Administration of Gaza’s revamped logo still includes PA crest
The National Committee for the Administration of Gaza (NCAG) has again updated its logo, adopting a design resembling the Board of Peace emblem, while still maintaining the Palestinian Authority’s eagle and the Palestinian flag.
The NCAG, tasked with replacing Hamas in governing Gaza, had sparked uproar in Israel after it first updated its logo earlier this month to a design that was nearly identical to the one used by the PA.
US officials spent almost an entire day trying to negotiate between Israel and the NCAG in order to prevent a larger incident.
Ultimately, the NCAG issued a statement saying the updated logo wasn’t final and that it was toying with a series of ideas.
Israel has been adamant about not allowing the PA to play a substantive role in Gaza, arguing that it must undergo significant reforms before doing so. At the same time, it has withheld several billion dollars of funds that belong to Ramallah that has hampered the PA’s ability to operate and reform.
In the logo published on the NCAG’s website and social media accounts on Thursday, the eagle and Palestinian flag are flanked by gold olive branches identical to the ones in the Board of Peace emblem.
Iran tells UN chief that all Mideast assets of ‘hostile force’ are fair game if US attacks
Iran tells UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres that Tehran will consider bases, facilities and assets of the “hostile force” in the region as legitimate targets if it faces military aggression.
US President Donald Trump’s rhetoric toward Iran “signals a real risk of military aggression,” Iran’s permanent mission to the United Nations says in the letter, adding Iran does not want a war.
Iran will respond “decisively” if subjected to military aggression, the letter says.

Trump considering initial targeted strikes on Iran so it will accept his terms for nuclear deal — WSJ
US President Donald Trump is considering launching preliminary limited strikes on Iran with the aim of forcing the Islamic Republic to agree to his demands for a nuclear deal, according to the Wall Street Journal, stopping short of a full-scale attack that could trigger a major Iranian military response.
Citing people familiar with the matter, the US newspaper says the initial strikes could occur within days if ultimately okayed by Trump, with the attack targeting several military or government sites. If Iran still continues to reject Trump’s demand to give up its enrichment program, the report says the US will then broaden its military offensive to include regime targets, with the possible goal of removing it from power.
One source quoted in the report says Trump could start with more limited strikes before ramping them up until the regime either agrees to disassemble its nuclear program or is toppled.
Settler activists, including far-right MK, illegally cross into Gaza; IDF troops called to scene
A group of settler activists, among them far-right MK Limor Son Har-Melech, illegally breached into the Gaza Strip this evening, prompting the IDF to dispatch troops to the scene.
“We were privileged, with thanks to the blessed God, to enter the Gaza Strip, together with the Nachala movement and dozens of families, women, men, and children,” the Otzma Yehudit lawmaker writes on social media.
The activists from the ultra-nationalist Nachala settlement organization say they crossed the Gaza border with vehicles and planted trees in the area.
The IDF has not yet commented on the incident, but in previous similar cases has said that crossing the Gaza border “is dangerous and disrupts the activity of security forces in the area.”

Starmer’s Chagos Islands deal hits new crisis after judge blocks removal of islanders
Exclusive: A judge has ruled from 25,000ft in the air that a temporary injunction should be placed to block the UK government from removing Chagossians who landed on their islands this week
- Bookmark
- CommentsGo to comments
A dramatic late intervention by a judge has thrown Sir Keir Starmer’s beleaguered plans to hand over the Chagos Islands to Mauritius further into chaos.
Justice James Lewis ruled from a flight at around 25,000ft in the air on Thursday to temporarily block an order removing the islanders, who had landed earlier this week.
The decision adds to the prime minister’s growing nightmare over the islands after US president Donald Trump declared this week that he was opposed to the deal in a move which could veto Sir Keir’s plans.
The judgment comes after four Chagos islanders landed on one of the Indian Ocean archipelago's islands on Tuesday to establish what they say will be a permanent settlement, in a move they hope will complicate a British plan to transfer the territory to Mauritius.
The “advance party” was led by Misley Mandarin, the elected Chagossian first minister who has pledged to establish a permanent resettlement on Île du Coin, part of the coral atoll of Peros Banhos.
“We, the people of the Chagos Islands, stand today on the soil of our homeland,” the party announced in a “Declaration of Return”, adding: “We are the advance party. Hundreds more are following. We have come home.”
They were served with papers to leave the islands on Wednesday, but their lawyer James Tumbridge successfully applied for an injunction.
The move came as their representatives this week also applied for a new judge in the UK case to challenge the plans by Sir Keir’s government to hand over the islands to Mauritius.
The ruling by Justice Lewis, chief justice of the British Indian Ocean territory, was based on the delay in the UK case by the islanders challenging the government’s plans for the island and complaining they were not properly consulted.
The islanders were removed between 1967 and 1973 as part of the security arrangements for the top-secret Diego Garcia base operated by the UK and US.
Justice Lewis said: “There is no doubt the balance of convenience falls on the side of the claimants (the islanders). They are 120 miles from Diego Garcia and pose no threat to national security on the evidence before me.
“If they are deported they will have great difficulties in returning. In my judgment the claimants have made out their application in the light of no response or engagement by the commissioner.
“It follows that I grant a temporary injunction against the enforcement of the s.12 (removal) notices. This injunction will remain in place for seven days to allow the defendants to file a response.
“In the absence of a response the injunction will remain in force until determination of the judicial review application. At the expiry of seven days I will make further order if the defendant files a response.”
Meanwhile, sources close to the Trump administration have said that the president has decided to object to the deal because the US has learnt that China and India could be negotiating to get control of different islands in the archipelago.
President Trump is also believed to be angered by Sir Keir refusing the US permission to use RAF bases to strike Iran. There are also fears that the UK is now feeding Mauritius military information about the use of Diego Garcia in line with the deal to lease back the base.

Trump gives grim assessment on Nancy Guthrie case weeks after she went missing: ‘Boy, it’s so crazy, so bad’

Trump gives grim assessment on Nancy Guthrie case weeks after she went missing: ‘Boy, it’s so crazy, so bad’
Police believe the 84-year-old was abducted from her Arizona home as she slept more than two weeks ago
- Bookmark
President Donald Trump has given a grim assessment of Nancy Guthrie’s disappearance after she vanished from her Arizona home more than two weeks ago.
Nancy, the 84-year-old mother of Today show host Savannah Guthrie, was last seen at her home in the affluent Catalina Foothills, outside of Tucson, on January 31. Police believe she was taken from her home while she slept.
Police are yet to publicly identify Nancy’s suspected kidnapper, but have shared video of a suspect wearing a ski mask and gloves who appeared to have tampered with the missing woman’s front door camera on the morning she is believed to have been abducted.
Speaking to reporters on Air Force One Thursday, Trump, who has expressed support for the Guthrie family amid Nancy’s disappearance, said, “Boy, it’s so crazy, so bad.”
“I didn’t like when they were talking about going after the pacemaker, and you know, before they even started going after it, they’re coming and reporting it,” the president said.
“So if, in fact, they could do it that way, the person would say, ‘Well, I’m not going to let that happen,’ right? So bad things would happen,” Trump added. “It’s a very sad situation.”
NewsNation reported earlier this week that authorities used a “signal sniffer” device attached to a helicopter to try to detect Nancy’s pacemaker. Nancy’s pacemaker was disconnected from an app on her phone the morning she went missing, according to authorities.
Trump has threatened the death penalty if Nancy is found dead, telling the New York Post Monday that there would be “the most severe” consequences for those responsible.
Authorities are desperately trying to find Nancy, who needs medication for her health condition.
“Her health, her heart is fragile. She lives in constant pain. She is without any medicine. She needs it to survive. She needs it not to suffer,” Savannah said in a video posted to Instagram days after her mother’s disappearance.
Between the FBI and local officials, the reward for valuable information in Nancy’s case has grown to more than $200,000.
The Pima County Sheriff’s Department said Tuesday authorities are “looking into investigative genetic genealogy options” to identify possible matches to DNA evidence collected, according to reports.
The department announced on social media Tuesday DNA from a pair of gloves found two miles away from Nancy’s home “did not trigger a match” in the FBI’s national database and “did not match DNA found at the property.”
Most of the DNA profiles in the database are from convicted criminals. Genealogy databases from companies such as Ancestry and 23andMe can open up the pool of DNA profiles to police. But these companies do not voluntarily give up customer information, so authorities would have to go through a legal process to obtain it.
Earlier this week, Pima County Sheriff Chris Nanos told the Associated Press authorities are working with Walmart management “to develop further leads” as the backpack the suspect was wearing in the doorbell video was sold exclusively at the retailer’s stores.
Savannah and her family have yet to give up hope on finding Nancy, even offering to pay for her safe return following reports of unverified ransom notes.
“I wanted to say to whoever has her, or knows where she is, that it’s never too late,” Savannah said in a video posted to Instagram Sunday. “It is never too late to do the right thing.”
The Pima County Sheriff’s Department said in a statement shared with The Independent Thursday, “Currently, several hundred personnel are assigned to this case from various law enforcement agencies and are actively reviewing thousands of tips.”

Trump sets Iran nuclear deal deadline, Tehran threatens retaliation against US bases
US President Donald Trump warned on Thursday that Iran must reach a deal on its nuclear programme within 10 to 15 days or face “really bad things”. Tehran has threatened to retaliate against US bases if attacked, amid a large US military buildup in the Middle East that has fueled fears of a wider war.

President Donald Trump warned Iran on Thursday it must make a deal over its nuclear programme or "really bad things" will happen, and set a deadline of 10 to 15 days, drawing a threat from Tehran to retaliate against US bases in the region if attacked.
Amid a massive US military buildup in the Middle East that has fueled fears of a wider war, Trump said negotiations with Iran to end the tense standoff were going well but demanded that Tehran reach a "meaningful" agreement.
"Otherwise bad things happen," Trump, who has repeatedly threatened to attack Iran, told the first meeting of his Board of Peace in Washington.
Trump spoke of the US air strikes carried out in June, saying Iran's nuclear potential had been "decimated", adding "we may have to take it a step further or we may not".
"You’ll be finding out over the next probably 10 days," he said. Asked later to elaborate, he told reporters aboard Air Force One: "I would think that would be enough time, 10, 15 days, pretty much maximum.”

But he declined to be specific, except to warn again of "really bad things" and insist that Iran would have to make a deal one way or another.
In a letter to UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, Tehran said it would not start any war but that "in the event that it is subjected to military aggression, Iran will respond decisively and proportionately" in its exercise of the right of self-defence.
"All bases, facilities, and assets of the hostile force in the region would constitute legitimate targets," the letter said. "The United States would bear full and direct responsibility for any unpredictable and uncontrolled consequences."
'Good talks'
Trump's threats to bomb Iran, with the two sides far apart in talks on Tehran's nuclear programme, have pushed up oil prices, and a Russian corvette warship on Thursday joined planned Iranian naval drills in the Gulf of Oman, a vital sea route for global energy.
Iranian and US negotiators met on Tuesday and Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araqchi said they had agreed on "guiding principles." White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said on Wednesday, however, that the two sides remained apart on some issues.
Trump said "good talks are being had", and a senior US official said Iran would make a written proposal on how to address US concerns.
Trump called on Tehran to join the US on the "path to peace".

"They can't have a nuclear weapon, it's very simple," he said. "You can't have peace in the Middle East if they have a nuclear weapon."
Iran has resisted making major concessions on its nuclear programme, though insisting it is for peaceful purposes.
The US and Israel in the past have accused Tehran of trying to develop a nuclear bomb.
Trump's latest sabre-rattling came as he talked himself up as a man of peace in a long, meandering speech while hosting world leaders at the launch of his Board of Peace.
He proposed the body in September when he announced his plan to end Israel's war against Hamas in Gaza.
He later expanded the board's remit to tackle conflicts worldwide, prompting many key Western allies to stay away.
Earlier on Thursday, Russia warned against an "unprecedented escalation of tension" around Iran on Thursday and urged restraint amid the US military buildup in the region, which a senior American official said should be complete by mid-March.

Threat of war
Trump has sent aircraft carriers, warships and jets to the region, raising the prospect of another attack on the Islamic Republic. The United States and Israel bombed Iran's nuclear facilities and some military sites last June.
US Secretary of State Marco Rubio will meet Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to discuss Iran on February 28, the senior US official said.
Washington wants Iran to entirely give up uranium enrichment, a process used to create fuel for atomic power plants but that can also provide material for a warhead.
The US and ally Israel also want Iran to give up long-range ballistic missiles, stop supporting groups around the Middle East and stop using force to quell internal protests.
Iran says it refuses to discuss issues beyond the atomic file, calling efforts to limit its missile arsenal a red line.
Satellite pictures have tracked both Iranian work to repair and fortify sites since last summer, showing work at both nuclear and missile sites, as well as preparations at US bases across the Middle East over the past month.
Iran's joint exercise with Russia came days into an extended series of Iranian naval drills in the Gulf of Oman, with Iranian state television showing special forces units deployed on helicopters and ships.
In a sign of growing concern over the increased tensions, Poland on Thursday became the latest European country to urge its citizens to leave Iran, with Prime Minister Donald Tusk saying Poles may only have hours to evacuate.
Trump began threatening strikes on Iran again in January as Iranian authorities crushed widespread protests with deadly violence that left thousands dead across the country.

Los Angeles sues Roblox over child exploitation claim
Sign up now: Get ST's newsletters delivered to your inbox
LOS ANGELES – Officials in Los Angeles said on Feb 19 they are suing Roblox, alleging the popular online platform exposes children to sexual content, exploitation and online predators.
In a lawsuit, Los Angeles County said the company does not carry out adequate moderation and its age-verification systems are not fit for purpose.
The suit against Roblox, which contests the claims, is the latest effort to hold an online firm to account for alleged exploitative practices.
It comes as a trial unfolds in America’s second-largest city in which social media giants, including Facebook, are being sued over claims that their addictive algorithms target young teenagers.
“This lawsuit is about protecting children from online predators and inappropriate content,” said Ms Hilda Solis, chair of the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors.
“Roblox has a responsibility to keep kids safe, but instead it has allowed its platform to become a place where children can be exposed to grooming and exploitation.”
Roblox says it has around 144 million active users every day around the world, with more than 40 per cent of them under 13 years old.
‘Paedophile hellscape’
Users create, share and play various games and other experiences, chatting to one another and using customisable avatars.
While it is free to use, players can purchase a virtual currency that allows them to buy specific upgrades.
The firm has long faced accusations that it is not doing enough to protect children from violent and sexual content.
A 2024 report by Hindenburg Research described it as an “X-rated paedophile hellscape” that exposes children to grooming and pornography.
In February, Australia’s government said it is seeking an urgent meeting with the company about child safety.
The lawsuit filed on Feb 19 alleges that Roblox has failed to adequately moderate user-generated content, enforce age restrictions or disclose the extent of inappropriate material and risks posed by sexual predators on the platform.
“This is not about a minor lapse in safety. It is about a company that gives paedophiles powerful tools to prey on innocent and unsuspecting children,” Los Angeles County lawyer Dawyn Harrison said.
“The trauma that results is horrific, from grooming to exploitation to actual assault. This needs to stop.”
In a statement to AFP, Roblox rejected the allegations in the suit, insisting the platform is built “with safety at its core”.
“We have advanced safeguards that monitor our platform for harmful content and communications, and users cannot send or receive images via chat, avoiding one of the most prevalent opportunities for misuse seen elsewhere online,” a spokesperson said.
The company said it takes swift action against people found violating its rules and works with law enforcement to hold them accountable.
“There is no finish line when it comes to protecting kids, and while no system can be perfect, our commitment to safety never ends.” AFP

US-Iran news: '10 to 15 days' to reach a deal, Trump says
Published February 19, 2026last updated February 20, 2026What you need to know
-
Trump said the 'maximum' he would give Iran to make a deal is 10-15 days
-
Iran can't continue to threaten the stability of the region, Trump said
-
US first began building up military presence in region several weeks ago in response to repression by Iranian authorities
- Iran holds annual military drills with Russia amid US fleet movements
We're rounding up some of the major developments on US-Iran news here:
What military assets does the US have in the Middle East?
The United States is sending its largest force of warships and aircraft to the Middle East in decades.
One aircraft carrier already in the Middle East, another on the way
The US directed the aircraft carrier USS Abraham Lincoln and three guided-missile destroyers to the Middle East in January. The strike group, with some 5,700 service members, has been seen in satellite images off the coast of Oman in the Arabian Sea.
The USS Gerald R. Ford, the world’s largest aircraft carrier, started moving to the region last week. It briefly broadcast its location as being in the Atlantic off Morocco's coast on Wednesday. It appeared to be heading for the Mediterranean through the Straits of Gibraltar, according to Marine Insights, a maritime news site.
The USS Gerald R. Ford strike group is also accompanied by three more destroyers and has more than 5,000 service members.
This will bring the Navy's presence in the region to 14 ships, according to the AP news agency.
US moves significant airpower to Middle East
Numerous aircraft have been moved to bases in Europe and the Middle East.
The US dispatched F-15 Strike Eagles and F-16 Fighting Falcons normally based in Europe to the Middle East, Air and Space Forces magazine report.
It also reported that F-22 Raptors had moved from the US to the UK, presumably on their way to the Middle East, it said.
The US already has "multiple squadrons" of F-35 fighter jets in the Middle East as well as F-15s.
On top of the fighter planes, fuel tankers and cargo planes are continuing to head into the region, according to the Military Air Tracking Alliance (MATA), which uses open-source intelligence to track flights.
In their latest update from Wednesday evening, the account Defense Geek, who founded MATA, says they counted 109 aerial refueling tankers.
Iran warns it will respond 'decisively' to military aggression
Iran has told the United Nations it will consider bases, facilities and assets of the "hostile force" in the region as legitimate targets if it faces military aggression.
US President Donald Trump's rhetoric towards Iran "signals a real risk of military aggression," Iran's permanent mission to the United Nations said in a letter to UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres.
The letter added that while Iran did not want a war, the country's military would respond "decisively" if subjected to military aggression.
Trump gives Iran new ultimatum
US President Donald Trump has said 10 to 15 days would be enough to make a decision whether to strike Iran.
That is "pretty much the maximum" he would give Iran to make a deal over its nuclear program, Trump said.
"We're either going to get a deal, or it's going to be unfortunate for them," he told journalists on an Air Force One flight on Thursday.
Earlier in the day in Washington, Trump had given Iran a similar timeframe.
"Maybe we're going to make a deal [with Iran]. You are going to be finding out over the next, probably, 10 days," he said during his speech at the first meeting of his controversial Board of Peace.
Iran "cannot continue to threaten the stability of the entire region, and they must make a deal," Trump said.
He repeated that Iran must be prevented from having nuclear weapons. Iran has maintained that its nuclear program serves purely civilian purposes.
"Bad things" would happen without a meaningful nuclear agreement, Trump said.
US military buildup in Middle East 'not for show'
Matthew Hoh, a former captain in the US Marines and State Department official and now at the Center for International Policy, a US think tank, spoke with DW about President Donald Trump's military buildup in the Middle East and the likelihood of a US attack on Iran.
"I think this is serious, that this is not bluffing. This is not for show. This is not a stunt," he said. "The type of force the United States is putting into the Middle East is one that is capable of carrying out the operations that those in Washington, DC, want to carry out."
He said the US was spending an impressive number of Navy vessels, fighter jets and other aircraft to the region.
"We see the aircraft carriers, we see the destroyers, we see the fighter squadrons. But, more importantly, you're seeing the specialized aircraft," Hoh said. "The electronic warfare aircraft and the command and control aircraft that the US Air Force is only going to put into the region in the numbers that they're putting them into the region, if they're serious about using them."
Hoh also said the massive US military buildup would likely complicate diplomatic efforts to reach a new deal to limit Iran's nuclear program.
"First and foremost in the Iranians' minds has to be whether or not they can trust the Americans. Certainly, a deal was made with the Iranians more than a decade ago which limited Iran's nuclear activities, which the Trump administration in 2018 pulled out of unilaterally, as well as the history of US-Iranian military conflict," Hoh said. "The last decade or so of US and Israeli sabotage, assassinations of scientists, cyberattacks on Iran. All of these things have to add up for the Iranians to bring them to a place where how could they trust the Americans."
Oil prices rise amid tension
Oil prices continued Wednesday's fairly sharp increase on Thursday in trading in Asia, Europe and as the US markets started to open.
Brent crude moved back above $70 (just under €60) per barrel for the first time since last July, hitting $71.57 by 1630 GMT/UTC on Thursday, a daily increase of 1.7%.
West Texas Intermediate, meanwhile, rose by 2% to $66.37 by the same time. That's a six-month high for the US benchmark oil product.
Since a spike in early 2022 — in the weeks following Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine, when prices peaked at around $120 per barrel — the price of the black stuff has been relatively stable and typically on a gradual downward trajectory.
The last time it was above current levels was during a brief and fairly sharp rise in the summer of 2025, amid the conflict between Israel and Iran in which the US also struck Iranian nuclear program targets.
Polish PM calls on citizens to leave Iran and refrain from travel
Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk called on Poles on Thursday to leave Iran as quickly as possible and to refrain from travel to the country.
"Please leave Iran immediately and do not travel to this country under any circumstances," Tusk was quoted as saying by Poland's PAP news agency.
He said the possibility of a conflict was "very real" and that if people delayed a point might come when it was difficult of impossible to get out of the country.
Travel warnings for Iran are not uncommon in Western countries and several issued such alerts amid January's protests and crackdown.
Germany, for instance, has had a warning in place advising citizens against travel to Iran since January 21 this year. However, this advisory warns primarily of risks like the possibility of arbitrary detention and limited consular assistance, though it also says that "military clashes cannot be ruled out" and that restrictions to commercial air travel are possible "at any time."
Iran holds annual military drills with Russia amid US fleet movements
Iran held annual military drills with Russia on Thursday, including live-fire exercises in the Gulf of Oman and Strait of Hormuz that state news agency IRNA said were aimed at "upgrading operational coordination as well as exchange of military experiences."
The waters in question are crucial shipping lanes for access to Iran, Iraq and the Gulf region.
The annual exercises were first launched in 2019 and have been conducted seven times since.
This year the drills coincide with the US moving more naval assets into waters relatively close to Iran's coastline. A second aircraft carrier, the USS Gerald R Ford, was this week reported to be headed for the region. Its journey would be liable to take around three weeks.
Although neither sides' actions make conflict inevitable, both appear to be trying to project strength and the ability to deploy if necessary in the event of negotiations failing.
Iran's theocracy has come under severe strain in the past 12 months, firstly amid a brief period of conflict with Israel last summer, punctuated by advanced US strikes on key sites for its nuclear program. More recently, in January this year, widespread public protests broke out and were violently repressed by authorities.
Trump calls for 'meaningul deal' at 'Board of Peace' meeting
US President Donald Trump said in Washington on Thursday that "interesting" nuclear talks with Iran were underway in Geneva, brokered by Oman, and said he thought there could be progress by the end of next week.
"It's proven to be over the years not easy to make a meaningful deal with Iran," Trump told the inaugural meeting of his 'Board of Peace' body. "We have to make a meaningful deal otherwise bad things happen."
He was speaking as the US moves military assets including an aircraft carrier into waters relatively close to Iran.
Trump referred to the negotiations as "good talks" and spoke of "very interesting" meeting with Iranian officials as they entered their second day. But he also warned that Washington "may have to take it a step further" in the case of no agreement, saying "You're going to be finding out over the next probably 10 days."
His comments came shortly after a warning to Iran from Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who on Thursday said: "If the ayatollahs make a mistake and attack us, they will receive a response they cannot even imagine."
Iran says no country can deprive it of right to 'peaceful' enrichment
The head of Iran's atomic energy agency on Thursday said that no country could deprive Tehran of its right to enrich nuclear fuel, after US President Donald Trump's latest hint of military action.
"The basis of the nuclear industry is enrichtment. Whatever you want to do in the nuclear process, you need nuclear fuel," Mohammad Eslami said in a video published in Iranian media.
"Iran's nuclear program is proceeding according to the rules of the International Atomic Energy Agency, and no country can depirve Iran of the right to peacefully benefit from this technology," Eslami said.
Iran has long insisted that its enrichment of uranium is for peaceful power-generating and other civilian purposes, a position met with severe sketpicism by Israel, the US and Europe.
Trump had previously boasted that the country's nuclear weapons program had been "completely and totally obliterated" in strikes last summer by Israel and the US.
However, US and Israeli intelligence agencies and militaries and other sources less prone to exaggeration suggested far less long-lasting damage had in fact been done.
US military prepared for Iran strike this weekend but no final decision from Trump yet, US media report
The US military has informed President Donald Trump that it is ready to strike Iran as soon as this weekend, US outlets CNN and CBS report.
However, the US media reports say that Trump has not made a final decision on whether to attack Iran.
The USS Abraham Lincoln aircraft carrier, along with nearly 80 aircraft, was around 700 kilometers (435 miles) off Iranian shores as of Sunday. A second aircraft carrier group, the USS Gerald Ford, is also moving towards the region.
CBS reported that the Pentagon has also ordered some US troops out of the Middle East in case Iran launches a counterattack. The US military has multiple bases in the region such as Al Udeid Air Base in Qatar and Camp Arifjan in Kuwait.
US outlet Axios reported that a US military operation against Iran could last for weeks. Israel would also take part in the operation, Axios said.
US Secretary of State Marco Rubio is expected to visit Israel and meet with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in the coming weeks to discuss the negotiations regarding Iran's nuclear program. As of now, no concrete deal on Iran's nuclear ambitions has been achieved.
Welcome to our coverage
DW is bringing you the latest coverage on the current standoff between Iran and the United States over Tehran's nuclear program.
US President Donald Trump has repeatedly insisted that Iran cease its atomic program, which Washington sees as aimed at obtaining nuclear weapons.
Iran, which is adamant that its nuclear activities are and have always been civilian in nature, has expressed determination to continue them.
Talks in Geneva on Tuesday between US and Iranian negotiators appear to have borne little fruit, with the White House saying: "We're still very far apart on some issues."
Amid the tensions, the US has significantly built up a military presence near Iran, with multiple media reports on Wednesday suggesting that it could be ready to carry out strikes on Iran as soon as this weekend.

Abigail Spanberger to give Democratic response to Trump’s State of the Union address

Virginia’s governor Abigail Spanberger will deliver the Democratic response to Donald Trump’s State of the Union address next week, elevating a pragmatic voice whose affordability-focused gubernatorial campaign is seen as a model for the party to win back power in the November midterm elections.
The Democratic rebuttal will immediately follow Trump’s address to Congress on 24 February. Spanberger, a former undercover CIA officer who served three terms in Congress, became Virginia’s first female governor earlier this year, resoundingly winning an office previously held by a Republican. She won the race by a double-digit margin, campaigning on affordability and lowering costs for families.
In a statement, House minority leader Hakeem Jeffries and his counterpart, Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer hailed Spanberger as a public servant with a record of holding Trump accountable – and winning races in competitive territory.
“She stands in stark contrast to Donald Trump, who will lie, deflect and blame everyone but himself for his failed presidency on Tuesday evening,” Jeffries said in a statement announcing her selection. “As our nation marks its 250th anniversary this summer, Governor Spanberger embodies the best of America as a mother, community leader and dedicated public servant.”
“Gov Spanberger will lay out a clear path forward: lower everyday costs, protect healthcare, and defend the freedoms that define who we are as a nation,” Schumer added.
Spanberger said she planned to use her rebuttal to address Americans’ concerns with “rising costs, chaos in their communities, and a real fear of what each day might bring”.
“Next week, I look forward to laying out what these Americans expect and deserve – leaders who are working hard to deliver for them,” she said.
In choosing Spanberger, 46, Democratic leaders are handing the spotlight to a battleground-tested moderate with national security credentials and a reputation for message discipline, particularly on economic issues and highlighting the impact of federal policies on everyday Virginians. Her 15-point victory in a purple state last November, alongside Mikie Sherrill in the New Jersey’s governor’s race, provided a jolt of optimism for Democrats still searching for an effective response to counter a president who dominates the political national conservation.
As Trump contends with sagging approval ratings amid economic unease and a backlash to his deportation agenda, Democrats believe they are strongly positioned to win control of the House – and possibly even the Senate – in November.
The rebuttal slot is typically reserved for a rising star – an ascendant figure the party believes can carry its message and showcase its next generation. Last year, Democrats chose Michigan senator Elissa Slotkin, another centrist figure with an intelligence background who won her seat even as Trump claimed the battleground state in 2024. But unlike Slotkin, Spanberger is not seen as a potential 2028 contender.
Democrats also chose Senator Alex Padilla, to deliver the party’s Spanish language response. In a statement, the 52-year-old senator said he plans to discuss “a federal government that weaponizes enforcement agencies against immigrants and US citizens alike,” as well as the Trump administration’s “failed economic agenda” and its effort to restrict voting access.
“Americans don’t need another speech from Donald Trump pretending everything is fine when their bills are too high, paychecks are too low, and masked and militarized federal agents are roaming our communities violating constitutional rights on a daily basis,” Padilla said in a statement.
Padilla, the son of Mexican immigrants and the first Latino to represent California in the Senate, was tackled to the ground by federal agents and handcuffed after attempting to ask the homeland security secretary, Kristi Noem, a question at a news conference in Los Angeles during the administration’s immigration crackdown in the city last summer.
Democrats are heavily courting Latino voters who shifted toward Trump in the presidential election, but have soured on the president over his handling of the economy and his sprawling deportation campaign that has swept up long-settled immigrants, green-card holders and even US citizens.
“As Donald Trump, Kristi Noem and MAGA extremists have tried to silence the voices of our Latino brothers and sisters, Senator Alex Padilla has consistently fought back and proven Democrats will not bend the knee to this out-of-control administration,” Jeffries said in a statement.

To appease Herzog, Sydney has sacrificed hard won protest rights

To appease Herzog, Sydney has sacrificed hard won protest rights
I was a speaker at the Palestine Action Group rally in Sydney earlier this month, when abhorrent scenes unfolded as people protested the Australian Government rolling out the red carpet to the Israeli President Isaac Herzog.
Words cannot capture the outrage and indignity Palestinians have endured, and inviting a leader accused of inciting the genocide of Palestinians only deepens our wounds.
Palestinians have been operating in a constant state of grief over Israel’s genocide, and in a constant state of mourning throughout the 78 years of Nakba. Instead of investigating Herzog and arresting him for potential complicity in serious human abuses, the government embraced him with open arms.
Both Amnesty International and the UN Independent Commission of Inquiry have flagged that Herzog’s previous statements amount to direct and public incitement to genocide, including declaring that “an entire nation is responsible... [and] there are no uninvolved civilians.”
This is a president who has signed artillery shells inscribed ‘I rely on you’, shells subsequently fired into Gaza.
This is a president who, in December 2023, visited the Nahal Oz military base to encourage troops just two days before the wanton destruction of the Palestinian town of Khuza’a.
This is a president who, in August 2025, denied the existence of the very famine his state engineered in Gaza, impacting two million Palestinians.
It is undeniable that Israel has unleashed hell and destruction on Palestinians in the Strip, committing genocide openly, deliberately and brazenly with full impunity. And despite the International Criminal Court issuing arrest warrants for Benjamin Netanyahu and Yoav Gallant for war crimes and crimes against humanity, neither have been brought to The Hague.
No one should be treated as above the law. No president, and no prime minister.
Former Australian Human Rights Commissioner and member of the UN Commission of Inquiry, Chris Sidoti, argued that Herzog should be arrested on arrival for the alleged crime of incitement to genocide. He added that diplomatic immunity does not apply to him, because of the gravity of the crimes in which he may well be complicit.
Which is why tens of thousands of Australians took to the streets of major cities nationwide, to demand those responsible be held to account and brought to trial for genocide, war crimes and crimes against humanity. The Australian public protested for humanity, and for cycles of impunity to come to an end.
Indeed, the ongoing protests and rallies against Israel’s genocide are part of a greater global movement of people who stand on the side of humanity. They are made up of masses that exercise their fundamental civil and political rights peacefully and lawfully.
Sadly, it was on this day that Australians deemed it urgent enough to protest against Herzog’s visit, that our internationally protected and fundamental right to protest was denied and harmed.
It was on this day that the New South Wales (NSW) government punished those protesting a genocide, rather than those responsible for it.
Following the Bondi terror attacks, the NSW Government began systematically rolling out bans against protests in Sydney’s CBD with 14-day prohibitions issued through new expansion of executive and law enforcement powers. In the lead up to Herzog’s visit, the NSW Government invoked a Major Events Declaration, granting NSW Police sweeping powers to stop, search and fine people up to $5,500.
To be clear, the right to peaceful protest is enshrined in the very core of international human rights law. Australia has had a long and proud history of anti-war protests, including social movements opposing the Vietnam war, against nuclear weapon proliferation and the Iraq war.
Under international human rights standards, restrictions on protests can only be imposed if they are lawful, pursue a legitimate aim, and are necessary and proportionate. Blanket bans on demonstrations simply for their political message or location are unlawful and discriminatory.
During the speeches at the rally in Sydney, NSW Police surrounded all four corners of the square, effectively boxing in the crowd in. Thousands of attendees had no way to exit. Shortly after, state-sanctioned violence erupted at the hands of those who are entrusted with keeping the community safe.
Appalling scenes unfolded as police officers repeatedly punched protestors who were already on the ground and unable to move, sometimes up to18 times. First Nations Peoples and the elderly were violently attacked and pepper sprayed.
Amnesty supporters, including teenage children, were choked and punched. Members of the NSW Parliament also sustained injuries.
Horrifically, the police forcibly disrupted Muslims performing Maghrib Prayer. They used physical force against worshippers, grabbed Muslims off the ground, mid prayer, and dragged them away and threw some to the ground. What could be more non-violent than people in worship? What happened to freedom of religion?
To shield a president who has incited the commission of genocide, the NSW government has used violent tactics normally exhibited by authoritarian states.
The NSW government response also raises critical concerns regarding the rule of law, international justice and accountability. Our human rights are under attack. Our authorities have already physically and violently attempted to silence and stifle us. But we will not remain silent.
Herzog's visit is an affront to all Australians who believe in human rights, peace and justice. We will not stand silent in the face of injustice because justice for Palestinians cannot wait.
It should be the Israeli President who suffers the indignity of facing investigation for inciting and commissioning genocide, rather than Palestinians and Australians suffering the indignity of his visit.
Mohamed Duar is Amnesty International Australia’s Occupied Palestinian Territory Spokesperson and Deputy Chair of the Sydney Peace Foundation. He holds a Master of Human Rights from the University of Sydney.

Trump shifts into election mode and pitches his tariff economy to Georgia voters
Trump visited Rome, Georgia, to try and convince voters that his tariffs are saving, not hurting, the U.S. economy
- Bookmark
- CommentsGo to comments
Donald Trump made his midterm pitch to Georgia voters on Thursday as he campaigned alongside fellow Republicans and sought to boost their profiles at a rally in Rome.
The president’s fixation on an economic message was one tailored to protecting Republican majorities in the House and Senate and did not shy away from what experts argue is putting some of the greatest pressure on keeping U.S. consumer prices persistently high in the post-Covid economy: Tariffs.
He leaned heavily into the argument the White House has pushed for months, and insisted that his “reciprocal” tariff agenda had forced top trading partners like Canada to pursue U.S. markets and end malignant trade practices.
“Without tariffs, this country would be like your company was two years ago. What a difference it made,” he told the owners of Coosa Steel Corporation after touring the plant.
“It's all because you finally have a president who put America first. That's what it is, but it's also, it's also because I oppose powerful 50 percent tariffs on foreign steel when they were coming in and dumping crap all over our country, I ended every one of the Biden era exemptions, and on August 18, I added new tariffs to cover 400 derivative products, including steel racks, which is what you make,” said Trump. “So I say congratulations.”
The president’s appearance in the Peach State is the latest in a series of outings touted by the White House as part of a strategy to convince voters that his economic program, which consists largely of tariffs on imports imposed by executive fiat and the wholesale rollback of environmental regulations meant to curb greenhouse gas emissions, is making a dent in the post-Covid pandemic inflation that wreaked havoc on his predecessor’s approval ratings and led voters to return him to power in the 2024 election.
Previous economy-focused events in Pennsylvania, Iowa and Georgia over the last three months have seen Trump return to campaign rally-style speeches that invariably degenerated into grievance-laden rants interspersed with blatantly false assertions about his administration’s economic record.
He continued that trend in Rome, telling Georgia voters that prices were down across the board. In reality, Americans are facing persistently high prices in many sectors of the economy, including food and health care, where millions of Americans just experienced the shock of skyrocketing premium prices for health care plans on the Obamacare exchanges due to Congress's failure to extend federal subsidies. Trump opposed the extension.
On Thursday, the president campaigned alongside Republicans running in the upcoming midterm elections, including his pick to take on incumbent Democratic Sen. Jon Ossoff, Rep. Mike Collins. But the spectre of failure loomed large over the president’s shoulder at the event in the form of Herschel Walker, whose doomed Republican bid for Senate was responsible for giving Ossoff a Democratic colleague in Georgia’s Senate delegation in 2022, an embarrassing midterm year for Republicans.
Walker stumbled through remarks praising the president at the event, which veered quickly into attacks on transgender Americans.
“We’ve got to get out and vote and do the same thing [again], because if we do not do that, we will lose this country because men shouldn't be in women's sports, I know what a woman is,” insisted Walker from the microphone.
In a statement touting the president’s travel to Georgia, the White House said the Peach State is “seeing real recovery, safer communities, and renewed strength under his leadership.”
The White House also acknowledged that “more work remains” to undo “the economic damage of the Biden era” in what appears to be a tacit rhetorical nod to the fact that, thus far, voters aren’t happy with Trump’s work on the economy since he returned to office after promising to tackle inflation and address cost-of-living issues.
Administration officials have hailed modest reductions in the inflation rate as evidence that Trump’s policies are working, but an analysis of price levels earlier this month by nonpartisan economics site EconoFact found that, despite the president’s claims to the contrary, his tariffs have kept inflation plugging along. It is estimated that the August 2024 Consumer Price Index inflation rate of 2.9 percent would have been half a point lower, around 2.2 percent, had Trump left well enough alone and not imposed tariffs on so many goods.
A separate Federal Reserve report found that businesses are starting to pass tariff costs on to consumers, now that their pre-tariff inventory has been cleaned out, while a third analysis by the New York Federal Reserve branch determined that 94 percent of tariff costs were borne by American consumers over the first eight months of last year.
In a press release, the Democratic National Committee highlighted polls showing majorities of Americans believe that the economy has worsened during the first year of Trump’s second term.
“Donald Trump promised to lower costs on ‘Day One,’ but Georgians know that was just another one of Trump’s broken promises. As Donald Trump calls affordability a ‘fake word’ and ‘hoax’ and spends his time building gilded ballrooms, Georgia families are seeing costs rise, health care get more expensive, and jobs disappear. While Donald Trump and Georgia Republicans continue to make life more expensive for hardworking families, Democrats in Georgia and across the country won’t stop fighting to lower costs and protect health care,” said DNC chair Ken Martin.
Since taking office last year, Trump has claimed never-before-used emergency powers to slap tariffs on goods imported from nearly every country in the world as part of what he calls his push for “reciprocal” trade, to induce foreign companies to build production capacity in the U.S. and spur homegrown manufacturing after decades of de-industrialization.
The effect has been an increase in average tariff rates to around 17 percent, the highest level seen since Congress enacted the infamous Smoot-Hawley tariff at the height of the Great Depression.
The Supreme Court is currently considering whether to strike down Trump’s use of emergency powers to impose tariffs in a case Trump has repeatedly denounced as the work of “China-centric” litigants. He again trashed the court for taking “many, many months” to decide the case during his rally on Thursday.
Ahead of his remarks, he said it was “a disgrace that we even have to talk about this subject.”
“It's like, you know, the tariff is the greatest thing that's happened to this country. We're making a fortune. But more importantly, all of these factories are booming now, and they were all dead,” he said.

FSB agent preparing assassination attempt on government official detained in Kirovohrad region
According to Ukrinform, the SSU reported this.
It has been established that the detainee was cooperating with the Federal Security Service of the Russian Federation. He attempted to track down the official and blow him up with a homemade bomb near a local cafe.
The perpetrator was caught red-handed when he conducted reconnaissance at the site of the planned terrorist attack and reported to his Russian handler that he was ready to detonate the bomb.
The enemy accomplice turned out to be a 27-year-old conscript who had left his military unit of the Armed Forces of Ukraine without permission and was hiding in the Kirovohrad region.
The deserter came to the attention of the FSB while seeking “easy money” on Telegram channels. The identity of the Russian special services agent with whom he was in contact has already been established.
At the enemy intelligence officer's instructions, the perpetrator began following the head of the regional institution to determine the optimal time and place for his elimination. The agent studied the potential victim's daily routine, his main locations, and his routes through the city's streets.
After daily reconnaissance trips, the suspect sent the FSB the coordinates of the cafe near which the official was passing. He was then to receive instructions from the Russians on how to make a homemade explosive device for planting and remote detonation.
During the searches, law enforcement officers seized a smartphone from the detainee containing evidence of his work for the enemy.
The perpetrator was charged under Part 2 of Article 111 of the Criminal Code of Ukraine – high treason committed under martial law. He is being held in custody without the right to bail.
The enemy agent faces life imprisonment with confiscation of property.
As reported by Ukrinform, in December, a suspect was detained in Kyiv who, on behalf of the Russian FSB, attempted to kill an officer of the Defense Intelligence of the Ministry of Defense.

The days of free-roaming cats could be numbered in WA
By Hamish Hastie
Conservation groups are celebrating after the West Australian government moved on cat containment laws after a decade-long fight.
This week, the Cook government announced it was progressing amendments to the Cat Act that would give local governments the legal right to introduce and manage their own cat containment laws.
The federal government estimates pet cats kill about 1.5 billion native animals every year and in 2024 the feral cat working group in WA estimated in Perth that number was about 47 million.
More than 20 local governments have tried and failed to implement cat containment laws because they extend beyond the powers of the Cat Act, which does not prescribe rules on roaming pet cats.
State law takes precedence over local government laws, and every local government attempt has been quashed by an upper house committee that reviews local laws.
Transport Minister Rita Saffioti has apologised for speeding in a government vehicle.
Saffioti’s infringement for driving less than 9 kilometres per hour over the speed limit was revealed by WAtoday on Thursday alongside a raft of other fines from ministerial staffing offices.
At a press conference this morning Saffioti apologised for the fine.
“You never want to be doing the wrong thing. It was a mistake, and I apologise,” she said.

Man sentenced over conspiracy to traffic drugs into WA
By
Sticking with crime news, a 32-year-old man has been sentenced to 20 years behind bars for his involvement in a conspiracy to transport 50 kilograms of prohibited drugs into WA.
In 2020 the Serious and Organised Crime Division commenced an operation targeting a national drug syndicate trafficking prohibited drugs into the state.
In October that year, they seized approximately $6 million in cash from a residence in Stirling linked to the investigation.
In November, detectives uncovered the man’s plot, which involved using his established criminal network to transport 30 kilograms of methylamphetamine, 10 kilograms of cocaine and 10 kilograms of heroin.
He was arrested in Queensland and extradited to WA in April 2022, charged with two counts of conspiring to sell or supply a prohibited drug other than meth, conspiring to sell or supply meth and laundering property or money from the proceeds of a major offence.
On Monday, following a trial where a jury found him guilty of all four charges, he was sentenced.
Serious and Organised Crime Division Detective Superintendent Rob Scantlebury said police would continue to make Western Australia a “hostile environment” for organised crime groups that viewed WA as a profitable market.
“Let this be another message to those who want to do our WA community harm, wherever you are in the world,” he said.
“This sentence demonstrates you will be brought to justice, and you will face the consequences of your actions.”

‘Petty bikie politics’: WA’s top cop addresses Pye verdict
By
WA’s top cop has addressed the verdict handed down to David Pye in court this morning, and the police investigation that led to his arrest.
Pye was found guilty of masterminding the murder of rival underworld heavyweight Nick Martin at Kwinana Motorplex in 2020.
“David Pye, because of petty bikie politics, decided to pay someone to kill another person,” Police Commissioner Col Blanch said.
“Here we have grown adults planning murders of each other over silly things. I’m not even going to entertain how stupid they are because the level of buffoonery is extraordinary within outlaw motorcycle gangs.
“Nick Martin was surrounded by family, friends and young kids – he paid the ultimate price for petty bikie politics, but in the presence of families and young people – an eight-year-old young boy suffered injuries, another person suffered shrapnel wounds – these things should just not happen in Western Australia.”
Blanch said over 40 police vehicles responded to numerous triple zero calls after the shooting.
In response, they set up Taskforce Ravello with 700 members working to suppress outlaw motorcycle gang activities by executing search warrants on gang members.
Out of 286 search warrants, 271 people were charged.
That same team also conducted the homicide investigation into the shooting.
“They did an amazing job, I’m so proud of them because a life was lost in our community, families are grieving, but this is a result that delivers that justice,” Blanch said.
He was then questioned on whether he believed police would have found Pye if the shooter, whose name is suppressed, didn’t provide evidence against him, given part of bikie politics is related to a code of silence.
“The bikie code of silence is not real. They might not stand in front of cameras and say what they’re doing, but plenty of bikies ring Crime Stoppers, plenty of bikies tell police what’s happened. There’s no code of silence,” Blanch replied.

From court: WA bikie guilty of ordering underworld hit
By Rebecca Peppiatt
Perth bikie David Pye has been found guilty of masterminding the murder of rival underworld heavyweight Nick Martin.
The 43-year-old appeared via video link to hear Supreme Court Justice Joseph McGrath’s decision on Friday morning following his dramatic trial in October last year.
Pye’s case was dubbed “the trial of the century” after he was accused of ordering the hit on Martin at Kwinana Motorplex in 2020.
The bikie denied being the person responsible for paying a former soldier to shoot Martin dead in front of thousands of people – and the only real evidence police had was the word of the man who carried out the killing.
The former soldier, who cannot be identified as his identity is suppressed, previously admitted to murdering Martin while he sat watching the races with his family, but the hitman said he was paid to do so by Pye, with whom he had struck up a friendship over drugs and his work overseas.
Pye emphatically denied the accusation and took the matter to trial, launching a security nightmare for police who escorted him to and from Perth’s District Court daily with multiple armed vehicles and an armed helicopter watching his every move.
Cricketer becomes third WA player to join Yorkshire team
By Ian Chadband
WA’s Jhye Richardson, who dismissed Joe Root during Australia’s recent Ashes triumph, is now going to be playing alongside the England batting great for Yorkshire in the county championship.
The signing of the 29-year-old quick was being hailed as a real coup by the most historic of English teams, who will now have three West Australian players on their books this summer.
Richardson, whose form over the Australian summer was recognised with a fourth Test appearance and a second Ashes outing at the MCG, will play in the first block of county championship division one games this season with Yorkshire targeting the title.
“I’m really pleased to be joining Yorkshire. The history of the club and of Headingley goes without saying, so to be coming here and playing red-ball cricket for the first time is an immense privilege,” said Richardson, who’s a three-format international for Australia.
“Can’t wait to get over and represent the White Rose, and hopefully putting some performances on the board. Can’t wait to see you,” the county debutant added in a social media post.
Richardson’s WA colleagues Sam Whiteman and AJ Tye will also play for the Headingley-based county, with Yorkshire impressed by them being a key part of Western Australia’s and Perth Scorchers’ success in recent years.

WA shipbuilder’s order book given $4 billion boost
By Hamish Hastie
WA shipbuilder Austal’s order book has been given a significant boost with the announcement it had been selected to build eight Landing Craft Heavy vehicles at a cost of $4 billion.
Defence Industries Minister Pat Conroy will visit WA today to sign the deal which was struck under the Strategic Shipbuilding Agreement.
The 100-metre-long vessels are based on Austal’s Damen LST100 design and will be built at Austal’s facilities and the Common User Facility at Henderson south of Perth.
Construction will start later this year with the final vessel expected to be delivered in 2038.
Austal boss Paddy Gregg said the contract was another significant investment in Australia’s sovereign shipbuilding capability.
“Constructing the Landing Craft Heavy vessels at Henderson will create and develop thousands of new, skilled jobs in Western Australia and provide further opportunities for the local defence industry supply chain,” he said.
Austal USA is currently building 12 smaller landing craft for the US Navy at its Mobile, Alabama, US shipyard.

‘Wasting bucketloads’: Star power behind new Water Corp advert
By
New West Coast Eagle Brandon Starcevich hasn’t even played a game at his new team, but he is already the face of a new Water Corporation advert while wearing the blue and yellow, alongside AFLW player Charlie Thomas and Dylan Wyndler from the Perth Wildcats.
The Wasting Bucketloads campaign uses a familiar household item – a nine-litre bucket – to help visualise the amount of water lost through bad habits like long showers and overwatering gardens.
“You can’t see what you’re wasting until now,” Starcevich says, while pulling a bucket away from his head.
“When your shower runs over by just one minute, you waste one bucket of water a day and up to 36 buckets each month – that’s bucketloads.”
In the average home, each person showers for about six minutes a day – two minutes longer than recommended – using an extra 72 buckets of water, or 645 litres, every month.
Leaking taps waste about 27 litres a day and in the garden, 3132 litres are used monthly by watering an extra day a week.
The campaign follows new research which found one in five people were unaware of their watering days, while 64 per cent didn’t know showers should be four minutes or less.
The findings reflect a broader trend, with average household water use in 2023-24 its highest level in nearly a decade, reversing a nearly 20 per cent decline since the mid-2000s.
Water Corporation customer and community general manager Karen Willis with demand rising and rainfall decreasing, WA needed to be aware of how much water they were using.
“That means getting back to basics of shorter showers, fixing leaks, sticking to the sprinkler roster, and generally ensuring we’re still treating water like the precious resource it is,” she said.
“Seemingly small waterwise changes at a household level make a huge difference across the community and help ensure collective water security into the future.”

Strong wind warnings could spell the end for 2026 Rottnest Channel Swim
By
Swimmers hoping to take part in the Rottnest Channel Swim have an anxious wait ahead of them today, as a strong southerly wind still threatens the event.
Bureau of Meteorology duty forecaster Jonathan Howe said while sunny conditions and temperatures of around 19 degrees were predicted at dawn, when the swimmers first set out, that was “the end of the good news”.
“We are expecting a very windy day. Here at the Bureau we have issued a strong wind warning that covers all the beaches including Cottesloe and out towards Rottnest Island.
“When the first competitors take off in the morning we are expecting strong southerly winds between 20 to 30 kilometres per hour initially, but as soon as they get away from the shore that will pick up to 40 kilometres an hour.”
Those are just the average wind speeds, Howe said, with gusts of up to 50 to 60 kilometres per hour predicted.
A south-westerly wind change is then expected in the late morning or early afternoon, which would push people swimming away from Rottnest.
“We are expecting those wind speeds to reach up to 50 to 60 kilometres an hour,” Howe said.
Peter Galvin, who won the very first swim in 1991 and is hoping to swim again this year, said he was nervous about how it would play out.
“All I can do is cross fingers and toes and hope it goes ahead,” he said.
“It’s not just myself that would be disappointed, there is a whole lot of people who are involved – the paddlers the skippers and so on, but it could still happen.”

Russia’s Petrosyan finishes 6th in women’s figure skating at 2026 Winter Olympics in Italy

MILAN, February 20. /TASS/. Russian figure skater Adelia Petrosyan finished in the 6th place in women’s figure skating competition at the 2026 Winter Olympic Games in Italy.
The judges awarded Petrosyan 141.64 points for her free skate program on Thursday night, which combined with her 72.89 points short program and earned her an overall 214.53 points.
"My feelings are weird. I have lost my chance to take a higher place. There should have been two quadruples and I practiced two quadruples," the 18-year-old athlete told journalists after her Olympic skate program.
"I'm a little ashamed of myself, the federation and the fans. It will be psychologically difficult for me to return back to Russia after such a skate program," Petrosyan added.
The gold of the 2026 Winter Olympic Games in women’s singles went to US figure skater Alysa Liu, who won 226.79 points on the aggregate (76.59 points for short program and 150.20 for free skate). The silver was won by Japan’s Kaori Sakamoto with 224.90 points (77.23 + 147.67) and the bronze went to another Japanese figure skater, Ami Nakai, who flashed an overall score 219.16 points (78.71 + 140.45).
Petrosyan, born in 2007, is the three-time winner of the Russian Figure Skating Championships (2024, 2025, 2026) and the finalist of the Russian Grand Prix tournaments.
The 2026 Winter Olympic Games are taking place in Milan and Cortina d'Ampezzo, Italy, on February 6-22, 2026. Thirteen Russian athletes are competing under a neutral status in figure skating, speed skating, short track, freestyle skiing, cross-country skiing, alpine skiing, luge and ski mountaineering.
Late on February 19 afternoon, Russia’s Nikita Filippov won the silver medal in the Men’s Ski Mountaineering Sprint event and it was the first medal at the ongoing Olympics for the team of athletes competing under a neutral status.
Norway remains atop the Overall Medals Standings at this year’s Games with 34 medals (16 gold, eight silver and 10 bronze), followed by the United States (nine golds, 12 silver and six bronze) and hosts Italy (9-5-12).

Iran tells UN chief it will respond 'decisively' to US attack 
after Trump issues new ultimatum

Iran has told UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres that Tehran will consider bases, facilities and assets of the "hostile force" in the region as legitimate targets if it faces military aggression.
US President Donald Trump's rhetoric towards Iran "signals a real risk of military aggression," Iran's permanent mission to the United Nations said in the letter on Thursday, adding Iran did not want a war.
Iran will respond "decisively" if subjected to military aggression, the letter said.
Iran’s reaction came after Trump warned that Iran must make a "meaningful deal" in negotiations with Washington in the next 10 days or else "bad things happen", as he deployed warships, fighter jets and other military hardware to the region.
"It's proven to be over the years not easy to make a meaningful deal with Iran. We have to make a meaningful deal otherwise bad things happen," Trump told the inaugural meeting of the Board of Peace, his initiative to secure stability in Gaza.
He warned that Washington "may have to take it a step further" without any agreement, adding: "You're going to be finding out over the next probably 10 days."
Trump's comments came shortly after Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu issued his own warning to Iran saying, "If the ayatollahs make a mistake and attack us, they will receive a response they cannot even imagine".
Military buildup for Iran attack
The warnings were issued days after the US and Iran held a second round of Omani-mediated talks, this time in Geneva, with the US seeking to prevent Iran from getting a nuclear bomb, something it says it is not pursuing, and Iran seeking relief from US sanctions.
The US has been building up its military forces near Iran, including warships, fighter jets, and refuelling aircraft, laying the foundation for a potentially sustained offensive against Iran — should Trump give the order.
Washington has ordered a second aircraft carrier to the region, with the first, the USS Abraham Lincoln and its nearly 80 aircraft, positioned about 700 kilometres from the Iranian coast as of Sunday, satellite images showed.
Iran has sought to display its own military might, with its Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps holding war games earlier this week in the Strait of Hormuz.
Iranian politicians have repeatedly threatened to block the strait, a major global conduit for oil and gas, with fears of a US-Iran conflict sending oil prices surging this week.
The strait carries a quarter of the world's seaborne oil and a fifth of all liquified natural gas according to the International Energy Agency.

Judge orders takeover of health care operations in Arizona prisons after years of poor care

A federal judge has ordered a take-over of health care operations in Arizona’s prisons and will appoint an official to run the system after years of complaints about poor medical and mental health care.
The decision on Thursday by U.S. District Judge Roslyn Silver came after her 2022 verdict that concluded Arizona had violated prisoners’ rights by providing inadequate care that led to suffering and preventable deaths.
Silver wrote that the state hasn’t gotten a semblance of compliance with court-ordered changes and the Constitution after nearly 14 years of litigation, saying “this approach has not only failed completely, but, if continued, would be nothing short of judicial indulgence of deeply entrenched unconstitutional conduct."
The judge said prisoners still remain exposed to "an intolerable grave and immediate threat of continuing harm and suffering because the systemic deficiencies pervade the administration of health care.”
The Associated Press left a message for the corrections department after the order was issued. The state and attorneys representing prisoners have 60 days to submit a list of candidates to run health and mental health care operations in prisons.
“This decision means that an independent authority will be able to implement the systemic changes necessary to ensure that medical and mental health care meets constitutional standards," said David Fathi, one of the lawyers representing the prisoners. "This is a life-saving intervention, and it brings hope that the preventable suffering and deaths that have haunted Arizona’s prison system for over a decade can finally end.”
Lawyers for prisoners say Arizona has made few improvements since the verdict and asked the judge for the more drastic remedy of creating such a “receivership,” arguing system remains broken and prisoners who need care are still in danger.
For over a decade, state government has been dogged by criticism that its health care system for the 25,000 inmates in Arizona’s state-run prisons was run shoddily and callously.
The state had vowed to overhaul medical and mental health services for prisoners in a 2014 settlement, but was soon accused of failing to keep many of those promises. That led to $2.5 million in contempt of court fines against the state and, eventually, the revocation of the agreement by Silver, who explained that corrections officials had shown little interest in making the changes.
The judge then ruled against the state at a 2022 trial, issuing an injunction requiring corrections authorities to fix the constitutional violations.
While attorneys for prisoners say the state lacks the leadership to comply within a reasonable amount of time, the corrections department said it has transformed the prison health care system over the last two years, such as expanding access to treatments, increasing staff and opening medical housing units.
Corrections officials say the opposing side refuses to acknowledge their progress and “focus on the reputation and circumstances of the past rather than recognizing or even supporting the good work of the present.” Lawyers for the department say the agency’s leadership has been acting in good faith with the court’s orders.
In September 2019 lawyers representing the prisoners made a similar request for a takeover, but shied away from it, saying she would revive that possibility if the state acts in bad faith or fails to comply with the court-ordered changes. Past receiverships have been ordered for prisons in other states. In California in 2005, a federal judge seized control of the prison medical system after finding that an average of one inmate a week was dying of medical neglect or malpractice.
The Arizona lawsuit does not cover the nearly 10,000 people incarcerated in private prisons for state convictions.

USA's Alysa Liu wins the gold in Olympic women's figure skating

American Alysa Liu surged from third at the start of the day to win the Olympic women's singles figure skating gold with an electrifying performance at the Milan-Cortina Games on Thursday, February 19.
World champion Liu took the title ahead of Japan's Kaori Sakamoto who won silver with 17-year-old Ami Nakai winning bronze after the free skating final at the Milano Ice Skating Arena.
Liu hit a career-best score in the free skate and her overall 226.79 points was also a lifetime best as she grabbed her second gold in Milan after helping the US team to the title. The 20-year-old put the US women back on top of the Olympic women's podium in this event for the first time since Sarah Hughes took gold at the 2002 Salt Lake City Games.
Watched by 1956 women's champion Tenley Albright, the first American woman to win Olympic gold in the Cortina d'Ampezzo Games, Liu became the eighth US woman to take the title. The US women had not won a medal of any colour since Turin 2006.
Sakamoto left the ice in tears knowing that she had not done enough for gold in her final competition, achieving 224.90 for the silver. The effervescent Nakai scored 219.16 to snatch bronze having led Sakamoto and Liu after the short program.
Wearing a sparkling golden costume Liu, who stands out with her "halo" hairstyle and mouth piercing, outshone her rivals with her pulsating routine to Donna Summer's disco version of "MacArthur Park" which brought the crowd to their feet.
From the sixth to gold
Liu, the daughter of a Chinese immigrant who fled to the United States after participating in the Tiananmen Square protests in 1989, finished sixth at the Beijing Olympics four years ago at age 16. She retired from competing after taking bronze at the 2022 world championships but the Californian powered back last season, upsetting Sakamoto to take the world title and win the ISU Grand Prix final in December.
Sakamoto skated to a version of "Non, je ne regrette rien" sung by Patricia Kaas but lost points for not doing her planned triple-triple combination. The 25-year-old nevertheless achieved a fourth Olympic medal after singles bronze in Beijing four years ago, and two team silvers with Japan.
Nakai, the youngest competitor, skated last to "What a Wonderful World" and hit an opening three-and-a-half rotation triple axel but only achieved the ninth best score for her free skate.
Japanese skater Mone Chiba was fourth ahead of American Amber Glenn who rose from 13th after the short programme to fifth.
Glenn, the reigning and three-time US champion, delivered a spirited performance with an opening triple Axel jump in a routine only marred by her touching the ice on the final triple jump of eight on the night. Glenn, at 26 the oldest US woman to compete in the Olympics in nearly a century, earned her season's best 147.52 points for the free skate and 214.91 overall.
"It wasn't easy," said Glenn. "There's been a bombardment of attacks and hate on me, using my lacklustre performance as fuel for hate, and that was disheartening. "I just thought, I'm going do what I do best, which is enjoy skating, and that's what I did today."
Russia's Adeliia Petrosian, competing under a neutral flag, finished sixth after the 18-year-old fell on her opening attempt to land a quadruple four-rotation jump.

Potential 2028 Democratic nominee hits out at his own party: ‘I don’t answer to party bosses’
Maryland Governor Wes Moore has repeatedly denied wanting to run for president in 2028
- Bookmark
- CommentsGo to comments
Maryland Governor Wes Moore, a Democrat, has hit out at his own party and said he doesn’t “answer to party bosses” while speaking at Politico’s 2026 Governors Summit on Thursday.
The governor is widely considered a potential 2028 presidential candidate, even though he has repeatedly denied wanting to run, Politico reports.
“I don't come from a political world. I don't come from a political background, I don't come from the world of punditry. You know, when I first came on board, I was very clear that there is no political party that made me,” Moore said at the event.
“In fact, the Democratic Party put millions of dollars to try to stop me from winning. I don't answer to the Democratic Party, I don't answer to party bosses. I answer to the only people who made me the Governor of Maryland, which is the people of Maryland,” he added.
At the event, Moore once again dismissed the idea of a White House bid. Instead, Moore said he’s focused on this year and “not even thinking” about 2028. Earlier this week, Moore also told CBS News that he’s “not running for president.”
The Democratic governor, who is up for reelection this year, has faced some legislative challenges in recent months.
State Democratic lawmakers overrode more than a dozen of Moore’s vetoes in December, Politico reports. He’s also faced pushback from over his efforts to redistrict the state.
Oklahoma Governor Kevin Stitt, a Republican, defended Moore at Politico’s event.
“I have more respect for him now, knowing that he vetoed the bills,” Stitt said. “I have a super majority Republican, and I vetoed 67 bills last year, and I think they overrode probably 45 of them. So it happens to all of us.”
Moore has also faced criticism from President Donald Trump, who blamed him for the recent Potomac River sewage spill. The incident marks one of the largest sewage spills in U.S. history, according to the University of Maryland.
“There is a massive Ecological Disaster unfolding in the Potomac River as a result of the Gross Mismanagement of Local Democrat Leaders, particularly, Governor Wes Moore, of Maryland,” Trump wrote Monday on Truth Social.
Moore’s spokesperson, Ammar Moussa, was quick to hit back with a statement placing the blame on the Trump administration.
“The president has his facts wrong—again. Since the last century, the federal government has been responsible for the Potomac Interceptor, which is the origin of the sewage leak. For the last four weeks, the Trump Administration has failed to act, shirking its responsibility and putting people’s health at risk,” Moussa told The Hill.

The US State Department will subsidise companies to roll out cheap smartphones running American software in the Indo-Pacific region, part of its “Pax Silica” initiative that seeks to shore up the resilience of the US artificial intelligence supply chain and win the AI race with China.
The US has launched the Edge AI Package, which provides up to US$200 million of funding for mobile network operators and smartphone vendors to deploy “low-cost, high-performance” handsets in some partner nations in the Indo-Pacific, the Department of State said on Thursday.
These smartphones should run on “trusted” American mobile operating systems (OS), such as Android and iOS, and fully support the US software and AI ecosystem, the State Department said.

Companies interested in joining the programme should use US funding to lower the retail price of their handsets in Indo-Pacific countries “to a competitive level with untrusted market incumbents”, it said.
The initiative would “ensure that the digital infrastructure of our partners remains secure, autonomous, and free from coercion”, according to the State Department.
“This programme is going to make millions of smartphones more competitive vis-a-vis subsidised, low-cost competitors,” Jacob Helberg, the State Department’s Under Secretary for Economic Affairs, said in a CNBC interview on Thursday.

Trump announces $17 billion in pledges for Gaza at inaugural Board of Peace confab
Indonesia, Morocco, Kazakhstan, Kosovo, Albania agree to contribute to Gaza security force; Top official: Project hinges on disarmament of Hamas, which will soon be presented with proposal
Jacob Magid is The Times of Israel's US bureau chief
WASHINGTON — US President Donald Trump on Thursday announced pledges of some $17 billion for emergency relief and the reconstruction of Gaza, at the inaugural meeting in Washington of his Board of Peace.
The number was larger than previewed, with Trump revealing during the event’s opening remarks that $10 billion would come from the US alone and that Middle Eastern countries and others would tack on an additional $7 billion.
Large sums have been pledged by countries to rebuild the Gaza Strip after previous wars, though, and much of it was never actually delivered.
Regardless, the pledges provided the Trump administration with a much-needed boost to its efforts towards advancing the second phase of its 20-point Gaza peace plan, which envisions replacing Hamas with a transitional technocratic government overseen by the Board of Peace and effectively rebuilding the entire Strip after a US-brokered ceasefire in October ended two years of devastating war.
In addition to the financial pledges, Trump revealed that five countries — Indonesia, Morocco, Albania, Kosovo and Kazakhstan — agreed to contribute thousands of personnel to the International Stabilization Force, which is supposed to gradually replace Israeli troops in Gaza.
Israel, however, has declared it will not further withdraw from Gaza until Hamas is disarmed, and has even indicated that might still not be enough for it to pull soldiers out of the Strip.
Trump reiterated in his lengthy opening remarks that Hamas will “be harshly met” if the terrorist group does not agree to give up its weapons.
Speaking shortly after the US president, the Board of Peace’s High Representative for Gaza Nickolay Mladenov said the mediating countries — the US, Egypt, Qatar and Turkey — have agreed on a framework for the decommissioning of weapons, which would soon be presented to the armed Gaza-based factions for negotiation.
Given that the countries that expressed willingness to contribute to the ISF have conditioned their participation on limiting the force’s tasks to more modest tasks such as patrolling the border and securing humanitarian aid, a no less important body to Trump’s plan will be the yet-to-be-established Palestinian police.
Shortly before Thursday’s event, the National Committee for the Administration of Gaza (NCAG) — tasked with replacing Hamas in governing the Strip — published a job posting on its website for Palestinians interested in serving on the Gaza police force.

— اللجنة الوطنية لإدارة غزة (@NCAG) February 19, 2026
Mladenov said that thousands of people applied within hours, and NCAG Chief Commissioner Ali Shaath said in his remarks at the event that the goal was to deploy 5,000 police within 60 days. Those officers will be trained in Egypt and Jordan after being vetted by Israel, and the force will eventually grow to 12,000.
“We will help Gaza. We will straighten it out. We’ll make it successful,” Trump said, holding up a document with pledges before the disco beats of his adopted theme song “YMCA” came on the speakers at the end of the event.
Trump rally: Board of Peace edition
The gathering contained many of the features of a Trump political rally, from the music to the red MAGA-style “USA” hats placed on the seats of the senior representatives from nearly 50 countries.
The US invited heads of state to join Trump at the Washington confab, but many opted to stay home, with Bahrain’s King Hamad Al Khalifa the only leader of a Middle Eastern country to make the trip.
Ostensibly seeking to avoid criticism over the prominent Board of Peace roles given to Hamas-friendly countries Qatar and Turkey, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu opted to send Foreign Minister Gideon Sa’ar in his place.
Nonetheless, organizers placed Sa’ar right next to Qatari Prime Minister Mohammed Abdulrahman Al Thani for the group photo snapped at the beginning of the event.

After the photo, Trump proceeded to give a campaign-like speech that repeatedly went off script and lasted over an hour as he basked in his perceived accomplishments in the Middle East and beyond.
Trump declared that the Board of Peace will be the “most consequential” panel of world leaders ever formed.
While 28 countries have joined the Board of Peace, the vast majority of European countries avoided doing so amid concerns that the US will try to use the body — which gives Trump ultimate powers for life — to usurp the United Nations.
Trump sought to alleviate those concerns by insisting that he would work with the UN, adding that he planned to speak with UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres shortly.
Some European countries agreed to attend Thursday’s events as observers. Hungary’s Prime Minister Viktor Orban, whose country is the only European Union nation to be a full member of the Board of Peace, was also in attendance.
Trump said other countries are “playing cute” by not having joined yet, including some he does not want to join the body — although he did invite them.
The US president stated that the war in Gaza is over, even if there are “little flames” that persist.
Israel has been carrying out near-daily strikes across the Strip, targeting what it says are terror operatives violating the ceasefire. The Hamas-run health ministry says over 570 Gazans have been killed since the beginning of the October ceasefire.
While Hamas has pledged not to do so, Trump claimed that the terror group is going to give up its weapons.
“The world is now waiting on Hamas… It’s the only thing that’s right now standing in the way,” Trump said, appearing to downplay what has always been the main obstacle in rebuilding Gaza.
Billions of dollars in relief
Turning to the financial contributions, Trump revealed Kazakhstan, Azerbaijan, the United Arab Emirates, Morocco, Bahrain, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Uzbekistan and Kuwait all agreed to donate significant sums.
The UAE, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and Kuwait later confirmed donations of over $1 billion each, with those funds expected to go toward the initial humanitarian response.
Separately, the UN Office for Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs is raising $2 billion for Gaza support, Trump announced.
In addition, FIFA agreed to contribute $75 million towards building dozens of soccer fields, academies and stadiums in Gaza.
While Trump also claimed that Japan and Norway would host subsequent Board of Peace events, Oslo quickly issued a denial, explaining that it will not be joining the Gaza oversight panel.
Instead, it will host a meeting this spring of the Ad-Hoc Liaison Committee (AHCL) for Palestinian aid, as it regularly does.
A report published jointly this week by the World Bank, European Union and the United Nations placed the total cost of Gaza’s recovery at over $53 billion.
Aid diversion plummets as supply increases
After Trump’s remarks, participants heard from over a dozen other US officials and individuals tied to the Board of Peace
US Ambassador to the United Nations Mike Waltz used the opportunity to tout the aid effort for Gaza since the October 2025 ceasefire.
He said over 70 countries are participating in the US-led Civil-Military Command Center in southern Israel that has been monitoring the ceasefire.
Waltz said 4,200 aid trucks have entered Gaza each week for 13 consecutive weeks — “the longest stretch of high volume assistance to Gaza in years.”
While assistance has indeed increased significantly, aid organizations have argued that Israeli restrictions on “dual-use items” have prevented much-needed shelter supplies from entering the Strip.
Still, the uptick in aid has led to a massive decrease in diversion, which Waltz said is down significantly. Israel claimed throughout the war that Hamas was behind widespread looting of assistance, while aid groups argued that the phenomenon was due to insufficient aid entering the Strip, insisting that the problem would subside once supplies increased.
Giving the NCAG tools to succeed
In his remarks, NCAG’s Shaath said his technocratic committee has been given a “clear mandate” to govern Gaza but still faces “extremely difficult conditions.”
The NCAG has yet to actually enter since being formed last month, with Mladenov saying last week that it cannot do so as long as violations of the ceasefire persist.
Shaath highlighted the massive destruction in Gaza, where over three-quarters of the buildings have been destroyed. While basic assistance is indeed surging, humanitarian needs remain acute, and law and order remain fragile, he said.
He laid out the NCAAG’s top four priorities: Restoring security, reviving economic activity, ensuring sustainable emergency relief and restoring basic services, including electricity, water, health, and education.
“Our mandate is simple, step by step to build the foundation for lasting peace, dignity and prosperity for the people of Gaza, and this is where we count on your continued leadership and support,” Shaath said, turning to Trump. “Blessed is the peacemaker.”
Earlier Thursday, the NCAG again updated its logo, adopting a design resembling the Board of Peace emblem, while still maintaining the Palestinian Authority’s eagle and the Palestinian flag.
The NCAG sparked uproar in Israel after it first updated its logo earlier this month to a design that was nearly identical to the one used by the PA.
US officials spent almost an entire day trying to negotiate between Israel and the NCAG to prevent a larger incident.
Ultimately, the NCAG issued a statement saying the updated logo wasn’t final and that it was toying with a series of ideas.
Israel has been adamant about not allowing the PA to play a substantive role in Gaza, arguing that it must undergo significant reforms before doing so. At the same time, it has withheld several billion dollars in funds that belong to Ramallah, which has hampered the PA’s ability to operate and reform.
The logo published on the NCAG’s website and social media accounts on Thursday features the eagle and Palestinian flag flanked by gold olive branches identical to the ones in the Board of Peace emblem.
Mladenov said his Office of the High Representative will assist NCAG in “hopefully removing the roadblocks that they will be facing in taking over civilian and administrative control of the Gaza Strip.”
Mladenov said his office will coordinate with both Israel and the Palestinian Authority, showing a slide that confirms the creation of a coordination channel with the PA, as first reported by The Times of Israel on Wednesday.
“If I can ask one thing of all of us, it is to make sure that we have one message: there is no other option except the full demilitarization and decommissioning of all weapons in Gaza for reconstruction to begin and for people to have a new way of life going forward,” he said.
Mladenov said the disarmament process will be facilitated by the new Palestinian police force so that “all weapons are put under the control of one civilian authority.”

32,000 ISF personnel
A subsequent speech came from US Central Command Special Operations Commander Maj. Gen. Jasper Jeffers, who has been tasked with commanding the ISF.
Jeffers said his force would consist of 20,000 soldiers divided into five brigades, with the first deploying in Rafah, where the first new housing project is located.
The ISF commander added that Indonesia has agreed to fill the position of deputy commander of the force after Jakarta committed to contributing the largest number of soldiers, 8,000.
“The ISF will do two things: stabilize the security environment in Gaza and enable civilian governance,” Jeffers said, adding that the US has already established a joint operation center that is going to be the headquarters of the international force
A slide presentation showed that the base will be located in southern Israel.
Rebuilding and reconnecting Gaza to the world
Board of Peace Gaza Executive Board member Yakir Gabay said the reconstruction of Gaza begins with clearing over 70 million tons of rubble and unexploded ordnance, along with hundreds of miles of tunnels.
“We have a detailed master plan for housing and infrastructure of modern schools and hospitals, manufacturing and agriculture, roads and trains, water and energy plants, logistic hubs, telecom, tech and data centers, sports and leisure facilities, seaport and airport and much more,” said Gabay, an Israeli-Cypriot real estate mogul.
“The funding is ready and will be invested in a free economy,” Gabay said. “The local population will build [its] own cities, which will create hundreds of thousands of jobs and revive the economy.”
“The Gaza coastline is 26 miles long. It can be developed as a new Mediterranean Riviera with 200 hotels and potential islands. The value goes to the Gazans through the Gaza sovereign fund,” he clarified. “This plan is all subject to a full disarmament of Hamas.”
Board of Peace Executive Board member Marc Rowan detailed the housing plan for Gaza, saying it will begin with the rebuilding of the southern Gaza city of Rafah.
In the first phase, 100,000 homes will be built for 500,000 residents there.
Over time, 400,000 more homes will be built in other parts of Gaza, Rowan said. “This is not a problem of money or collateral. This is a problem of peace.”
A subsequent video presentation put together by the Trump administration declared that the goal is to fully rebuild Rafah within three years, at which point Gaza will also be “connected to the world through an Abrahamic gateway, linking it with Egypt, Israel, Jordan, Saudi Arabia, the UAE, and extending to India and Europe.
“By year 10, Gaza will be self-governed, integrated into the region with thriving industries and housing for all,” the narrator of the video added.
Board of Peace Executive Board member Ajay Banga said the World Bank, which he heads, has also created a Gaza Reconstruction and Development Fund.
The World Bank will manage contributions to the Board of Peace transparently and ensure that the money is used to promote peace, Banga said.
Israeli technology entrepreneur Liran Tancman said Gaza will be “digitally” reconnected to the rest of the world.
Tancman, who has been working with senior US officials on Gaza over the past year, said that by July, Gaza’s 2G network will be “upgraded with free, high-speed access.”
He added that the NCAG is building a secure digital platform to allow for electronic payments, financial services, virtual learning and healthcare services.
“In parallel, we’re advancing an Amazon-like logistics system to help Palestinian launch businesses, import globally, and trade securely,” he continued. “This will lower prices, drive growth and help transform Gaza into an open, transparent, corruption-free economic zone.”
Muslim countries stress adherence to the Trump plan’s pathway to Palestinian statehood
Over a dozen world leaders were subsequently given the opportunity to offer brief remarks, with each using the opportunity to heap further praise on Trump
Egyptian Prime Minister Mostafa Madbouly expressed his country’s support for the Trump plan’s recognition of the Palestinian right to self-determination.
“Egypt also appreciates President Trump’s firm position on rejecting the annexation of the West Bank,” he said against the backdrop of Israel adopting a series of measures in recent weeks that critics say amount to de facto annexation and a violation of international law.
“Preserving the institutional and geographical link between the West Bank and Gaza is vital for the Palestinian Authority to eventually resume its role in Gaza,” the Egyptian prime minister added.
Qatar’s prime minister said his country’s donation of over $1 billion to the Board of Peace will be “aimed at reaching a final resolution that fulfills Palestinian aspiration for statehood and recognition and the Israeli aspiration for security and integration.”
UAE Foreign Minister Abdullah Bin Zayed said that his country will contribute $1.2 billion to the Board of Peace, on top of the nearly $3 billion that it has already donated toward Gaza humanitarian aid since the beginning of the war.
Morocco’s Foreign Minister Nasser Bourita confirmed that Rabat will contribute police officers to the International Stabilization Force, help train Palestinian police, and build a military field hospital in Gaza.
“Morocco is ready to lead a de-radicalization program to fight hate speech and promote tolerance and coexistence,” Bourita added.
The Moroccan minister then stressed the importance of stability in the West Bank, where settler violence has reached record levels and settlement expansion is at a peak.
Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan lamented that the humanitarian crisis in Gaza is still ongoing and that violations of the ceasefire persist.
On top of the humanitarian aid it has already been providing, Fidan said Turkey is prepared to provide troops to the International Stabilization Force — something that Israel has adamantly rejected.
“We remain convinced that the foundation of such peace is a two-state solution. Let us work towards that objective for the benefit of all peoples of the region,” Fidan said.
Saudi Minister of State for Foreign Affairs Adel al-Jubeir reiterated his country’s support for a two-state solution under the terms laid out in the 2002 Arab Peace Initiative.
He also announced a pledge of $1 billion over the next several years to advance the Board of Peace’s mission.
Sa’ar stresses importance of disarming Hamas
Sa’ar used his remarks to hail Trump as well as Netanyahu for securing the October ceasefire and hostage release deal.
He then thanked Israel’s soldiers, including the 925 who lost their lives fighting during the last two-plus years of conflict.
Sa’ar highlighted the atrocities committed by Hamas during its October 7, 2023, invasion of Israel that began the war.
“All previous plans for Gaza failed because they never addressed the core issues: terror, hate, incitement, and indoctrination,” Sa’ar said, touting Trump’s plan for breaking that trend.
He highlighted the 20-point proposal’s requirements for Hamas to disarm, for Gaza to be demilitarize and for its population to be “deradicalized.”
He stressed the disarmament of Hamas must cover “all weapons, terror infrastructure, underground tunnel network, and weapons production facilities.”
Sa’ar said Israel supports Trump’s plan and “will work toward its success.”
Resolution on financial integrity adopted
The two-and-a-half-hour event concluded with Trump signing a resolution establishing the principles of financial integrity and transparency to guide the Board of Peace’s work.
Members voted on the resolution before the meeting and it passed unanimously.
The foreign dignitaries then gathered around Trump for another photo, as he signed the document before gaveling the meeting to a close.

Karl Rove reveals Gavin Newsom’s weakness as talk of 2028 presidential run heats up
California's governor is considered the front-runner for the 2028 Democratic presidential nomination
- Bookmark
- CommentsGo to comments
Gov. Gavin Newsom’s record in California is a major liability if the Democrat wants the 2028 presidential nomination, according to former George W. Bush White House official Karl Rove.
Rove, in an opinion piece on Wednesday in the Wall Street Journal, faulted the progressive Democrat for his state’s high taxes and “lackluster economy.”
The Republican strategist alleged that California “no longer has the quality of life that was long a gigantic magnet for jobs and commerce” that it once was under GOP heroes like Ronald Reagan, who was governor of the Golden State before becoming president.
Newsom’s office declined to comment.
Rove also claimed another potential 2028 candidate, Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker, would have similar liabilities on the campaign trail.
“Mr. Newsom has great hair and Mr. Pritzker a vast fortune,” Rove wrote. “But neither will matter nearly as much as their records as governor. Neither man can credibly claim that he has a solid record of economic achievement. That may not matter much to Democratic primary voters. It will in November 2028.”
Some on the left have voiced similar concerns, even as Newsom has emerged as a potential top pick for Democratic voters in 2028, alongside former Vice President Kamala Harris.
“During his tenure, the state has been a laboratory for some of the Democratic Party’s most politically fraught policies and instincts, which has left it less affordable and more culturally radical than it used to be,” Marc Novicoff and Jonathan Chait wrote in The Atlantic last month. “His record not only raises pressing questions about how effectively he could govern as president; it also provides opponents an endless buffet of vulnerabilities across social and economic issues.”
Throughout the last year, Newsom has worked to make himself a visible Democratic counterpoint to the media-dominating Trump, often trolling the president online and launching a podcast where he speaks with prominent conservatives.
The former Bush administration official has been equally critical of the Republican record, as Washington braces for midterm season.
He warned late last year that the GOP’s continued inability to pass a long-promised replacement to the Affordable Care Act meant the party was in “deep trouble” and congressional Republicans were “scared to death of the midterm election.”
Rove, in a separate Wall Street Journal column, criticized President Trump, arguing the president’s often vulgar statements on pop culture news and rosy claims about a soaring economy don’t land well with voters whose main concern is economic affordability.
“Mr Biden and his allies looked disconnected from reality when they proclaimed ‘Bidenomics is working’ even as ordinary Americans struggled with inflation,” Rove wrote. “Telling voters not to believe their own lying checkbooks was politically insane. Mr. Trump is doing the same thing.”

MOSCOW, February 20. /TASS/. Vladimir Zelensky, backed by European officials, is obstructing the efforts toward a Ukrainian settlement, Russian Federation Council Speaker Valentina Matviyenko told TASS, commenting on reports of a submission to the European Union of a list of demands to Russia regarding Ukraine.
According to her, the European officials’ demands are Russophobic, far-fetched, and directly undermine any efforts to achieve a sustainable peace.
"This looks like an outright and deliberate sabotage of the peace process. And Zelensky, backed by them, is increasingly sabotaging the peace process himself. How else can one interpret the fact that, during the talks in Geneva, he publicly and strongly rejects any substantive basis for a peace agreement? He is effectively blocking his representatives from working. It’s not the first time this is happening," Matviyenko noted.

UN knocks back bid for historic Parramatta precinct

UN knocks back bid for historic Parramatta precinct
Updated ,first published
The United Nations has rejected an attempt to put some of Australia’s oldest sandstone buildings on the World Heritage List, capping years of disagreement about the precinct’s future.
The United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation (UNESCO) informed the federal government late last year that the Parramatta Female Factory, in North Parramatta, would not be placed on the register of more than 1200 of the most precious natural and man-made places on the planet.
The sprawling precinct north of the Parramatta River opened in the 1820s as a home for female convicts and children, before later changed into an asylum, orphan school and industrial school. It is one of Australia’s most significant early colonial buildings, and is remembered for the particularly brutal experiences of women and girls who lived there.
In a detailed finding, the International Council on Monuments and Sites said the sandstone buildings, which sit on a six-hectare plot of land, had changed significantly over the years to the point that it was “difficult to see the preserved architecture”. It found Australia’s submission, which proposed a narrative of progress based on the decline of institutionalisation of vulnerable people, unconvincing.
“By constructing this modernist narrative, historical penal sites may be perceived as contributing to a myth of progress, where contemporary systems of punishment and regulation are legitimised and positioned as the natural evolution of civilisation,” the report read.
“These framings obscure the reality that the core mechanisms of control, discipline, and institutionalisation are not relics of the past but ongoing practices that have merely shifted in form and focus over time.”
In a joint statement, federal Environment Minister Murray Watt and state Heritage Minister Penny Sharpe said the finding was “very disappointing”, however “it does not diminish the recognised and intrinsic significance of the precinct to the nation, nor does it affect the strong statutory protections already in place”.
The rejection comes after a three-year fight over the state government’s master plan for at least 2500 new homes in North Parramatta, which includes the historic precinct as well as the new light rail, and which drove a wedge between the area’s Labor state and federal representatives.
While state MP Donna Davis supported the plan, federal member for Parramatta Andrew Charlton said the state government should “press pause” on the rezoning until the world heritage listing was decided. “This location is a mistake,” he said.
A UNESCO World Heritage listing would have brought the precinct in line with the Great Barrier Reef, K’gari (formerly Fraser Island), the Sydney Opera House and 11 convict sites across the country, including Tasmania’s Port Arthur. The site was put on the National Heritage List in 2017, which granted it significant protection.
Gay Hendriksen, president of the Parramatta Female Factory Friends, said the rejection was devastating for the community, which had worked to preserve stories of “the humanity, the strength of the mothers of the nation” who were institutionalised there.
“The world didn’t recognise it,” she said, “but the nation did.”

Macron and Meloni clash over killing of French far-right activist in Lyon
A war of words has erupted between the French president and Italian prime minister over the murder of Quentin Deranque.
French President Emmanuel Macron has clashed with Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni over the killing of a French far-right activist who was beaten to death by hard-left activists in Lyon.
Meloni, a conservative, said on social media on Wednesday that the killing “by groups linked to left-wing extremism … is a wound for all of Europe”. Macron responded angrily on Thursday as he spoke with reporters on a trip to India, saying that everyone should “stay in their own lane”.
“I’m always struck by how people who are nationalists, who don’t want to be bothered in their own country, are always the first ones to comment on what’s happening in other countries,” he said.
Asked if his remarks referred to Meloni, Macron replied: “You got that right.”
In response, Meloni said that Macron had misinterpreted her comments. “I’m sorry that Macron experienced it as interference,” Meloni said in a television interview with Italian news channel Sky TG24.
Deranque, 23, died after being beaten during a far-right protest in Lyon on February 12. Seven people, including an assistant to a member of parliament from the far-left France Unbowed (LFI), will face murder charges in the case, a prosecutor said on Thursday. They were among 11 arrested earlier in the week.
Lyon prosecutor Thierry Dran said Jacques-Elie Favrot, an assistant to LFI lawmaker Raphael Arnault, faces charges of complicity through instigation and was put in pre-trial detention. Favrot and the other suspects deny the accusations.
The incident has jolted France’s political class and fuelled tensions between the far-right and far-left ahead of municipal elections in March and the presidential race in 2027.
Opinion polls put the far right in the lead for the presidency in 2027, when centrist President Emmanuel Macron will have to step down after the maximum two consecutive terms in office.
Macron and Meloni tensions
Macron, a pro-Europe centrist, and Meloni, one of United States President Donald Trump’s closest European allies, have sparred in the past over issues ranging from the conflict in Ukraine to trade and European policy.
In her television interview on Thursday, Meloni alluded to Italy’s so-called “Years of Lead” between 1969 and 1980, when the country suffered attacks by a radical Marxist organisation, the Red Brigades.
Several former Red Brigades members fled to France, and their fate has been a sticking point between the two countries.
“The ruling classes must [reflect] on how to combat a climate that could take us back a few decades, a history that Italy knows very well and that France knows very well, having given political asylum to the cream of the Red Brigades,” Meloni said.

Ohio woman sentenced to life in prison for killing 4 men with fentanyl doses
A judge has sentenced an Ohio woman to four consecutive life sentences with the possibility of parole after 60 years after she pleaded guilty to charges alleging she used fentanyl to kill four men she was trying to rob
- Bookmark
A judge on Thursday sentenced an Ohio woman to four consecutive life sentences with the possibility of parole after 60 years after she pleaded guilty to charges alleging she used fentanyl doses to kill four men she was trying to rob.
Rebecca Auborn, 36, of Columbus, was indicted in 2023 following the accusation that she met men for sex before fatally drugging them. Auborn initially pleaded not guilty but changed that plea late last year.
A Franklin County judge sentenced her to the four consecutive life terms, each of which carries the possibility of parole after 15 years. Auborn also pleaded guilty to one count of felonious assault for an attempted overdose of another man, Ohio Attorney General David Yost said in a statement Thursday.
“This sentence reflects the defendant’s disregard for life and the callousness not only to kill, but to do it repeatedly,” Yost said. “My heart goes out to the families who lost a loved one - I pray that this measure of justice brings them closure and peace.”
Yost said the Central Ohio Human Trafficking Task Force received information that a sex worker was dosing men with intent to steal their belongings. The investigation followed. The crimes all happened in 2022 and 2023, authorities have said.

New Jersey man accused of boosting almost $200K of metal from Ferris wheel renovation site
William Morelli, 67, was arrested on a theft charge after taking a ‘large amount’ of metal near Adventure Pier, Wildwood police said
- Bookmark
A New Jersey man is accused of boosting nearly $200,000 of metal from a construction site for renovations of a famed Ferris wheel on Wildwood’s boardwalk.
William Morelli, 67, was arrested on a theft charge after taking a “large amount” of metal from the beach near Adventure Pier, Wildwood police said Wednesday. Adventure Pier is one of three Wildwood piers where Morey’s Piers operates amusement rides and attractions.
After stealing the metal over several days, Morelli sold it to a scrap yard, police said. The stolen materials were worth more than $175,000, according to reports.
The theft investigation began on February 4.
“The reporting party provided a suspect and vehicle description to police after reviewing surveillance video,” Wildwood police said, adding that investigators were later able to identify the suspect as Morelli.
Morey’s Piers took down the Ferris wheel, which sits on neighboring Mariner’s Pier, last fall and sent it to Philadelphia’s Navy Yard for repairs, CBS Philadelphia reported. The theft happened at a temporary work site for the popular attraction, according to the outlet.
Geoff Rogers, Morey's Piers chief operating officer, told news outlets his amusement company is “heartbroken by this incident.”
"The Giant Wheel holds deep sentimental value for not only the company and our team members, but the generations of families who have made memories on it,” Rogers said.
At a whopping 156 feet in height, the Giant Wheel is one of the largest Ferris wheels on the East Coast, according to Morey’s Piers. It’s been a staple on the boardwalk since 1985, reports say.
“While this theft has presented a challenge, it does not change our commitment to completing this project on schedule,” Rogers said.
The Ferris wheel is expected to return to the park in time for the 2026 season, which begins in May, according to reports.
Police said Morelli was charged with Theft of Moveable Property and later released. Information about his legal representation was not immediately clear.

Climber convicted after girlfriend freezes to death on Austrian mountain
Man gets a suspended sentence and a fine for girlfriend’s death during a climb on the country’s highest mountain
An Austrian court late on Thursday found a 37-year-old amateur mountaineer guilty of manslaughter over his girlfriend’s death of cold near Austria’s highest summit after he left her to fetch help when she could not go on.
The case is unusual because while climbing accidents are common, prosecutions over them were rare, even in situations like this one where a series of mistakes were made.
The court in the western city of Innsbruck handed the Austrian man a five-month suspended prison sentence and a €9,400 (US$11,100) fine for causing her death in January 2025 by gross negligence, an offence that carries a maximum prison sentence of three years.
The trial has raised questions about the extent of legal liability in the high mountains, an inherently dangerous environment that climbers generally explore at their own risk.
After a day’s climbing in which they fell far behind schedule, the 33-year-old woman was exhausted and unable to go on about 50 metres below the summit of the Grossglockner mountain on a freezing winter’s night, the court heard.
The defendant, identified as Thomas P, left his girlfriend Kerstin G exposed to strong winds without wrapping her in her emergency blanket or bivouac bag for reasons he could not fully explain, to fetch help in a shelter on the mountain. The equipment stayed in her rucksack.

Strike over labour reforms brings Argentina’s capital to a near-standstill

Strike over labour reforms brings Argentina’s capital to a near-standstill
The Chamber of Deputies is weighing a labour bill that would increase work hours, cut severance pay and ease firings.
A strike has ground much of Argentina’s capital Buenos Aires to a halt, as businesses close and demonstrators take to the streets to protest against President Javier Milei’s proposed labour reforms.
Thursday’s 24-hour general strike was the fourth of Milei’s term as president, though smaller strikes have also been a regular occurrence since he took office in 2023.

As a result of the protest, subways were shuttered in Buenos Aires. Fewer bus lines were running. And Aerolineas Argentinas, the state airline, anticipated cancelling 255 flights, at a loss of $300m. Even banks and schools were closed in solidarity with the strike.
One of Argentina’s largest unions, the General Confederation of Labor (CGT), called on citizens to show their opposition to the labour reform “in the streets, in Congress, in the courts and in every workplace”.
“If they attack workers’ rights, they attack national industry and the future of the country,” the union wrote in a social media post. “Rights are not negotiable.”
The general strike coincides with Argentina’s Chamber of Deputies debating the labour reforms on Thursday.
Milei, a libertarian politician, had campaigned on slashing regulations that he felt inhibited Argentina’s economy, famously wielding a chainsaw at rallies to illustrate his hardline approach.
His party, the right-wing La Libertad Avanza, has pushed a package of labour reforms that critics argue would weaken worker rights, reduce the number of jobs available, and set back the quality of life in the country.
The labour reform bill includes provisions to make it easier for companies to fire employees, as well as to reduce severance pay.
It would also lengthen the standard workday from eight hours to 12, and the right to strike would be curtailed, in part through an expansion in the definition of what constitutes essential work.
The Milei administration has argued that the measures are necessary to attract foreign investment and increase profitability by doing away with cumbersome labour restrictions.
Argentina’s ailing economy has long been a point of tension in Argentina, and at the time of Milei’s election, inflation had crested past 200 percent.
Milei, however, has the backing of United States President Donald Trump, a fellow right-wing leader whom he was visiting in Washington, DC, on Thursday for an inaugural gathering of the Board of Peace.
Before Argentina’s midterms last October, Trump pledged $20bn in a currency swap to the country — which he predicated on positive election results for La Libertad Avanza.
Milei’s coalition ultimately triumphed, earning more than 40 percent of the popular vote, more than any other party.
While his labour reforms are expected to face stiff opposition in the Chamber of Deputies, analysts believe they are projected to pass.
Already, a version of the bill passed Argentina’s Senate. If the Chamber of Deputies amends the legislation, as is expected, the reforms would have to pass back to the Senate for a final vote.
The General Confederation of Labor, however, argued that the general strike sent an important message to lawmakers.
“The strike was clear: There is widespread rejection of a labor flexibility law that we consider regressive and detrimental to the Argentine working class,” it wrote.
The union added that it would stand firm “against any attempt to roll back hard-won rights”.

Trump and Rubio suggest leveraging Board of Peace to mediate international conflicts

Washington DC — On Thursday, when President Donald Trump convened the first Board of Peace meeting to address Gaza's reconstruction and stabilisation, securing pledges of over $17 billion, Trump and his top diplomat Marco Rubio both signalled that the board's scope extended beyond the Palestinian territory.
Laying out the "strategic vision" of the Board of Peace, Rubio told the leaders and representatives from more than 45 countries, that situation in Gaza "was impossible to solve under orthodoxy, under existing structures."
"And so what we did is they went to the UN and they got the UN's approval to put this group together and bring these nations together to come up with a very specific solution – solutions – to a very unique and specific problem."
The top US diplomat hoped the Board of Peace can serve as a broader platform for mediating international conflicts.
"I hope that this (board) can serve as a model for other complex and difficult situations so they can be solved in the same way, but right now the focus is on this one (Gaza)."
The Board of Peace, formed in January 2026, initially tied to oversee Gaza's peace plan and reconstruction after the 2025 ceasefire between Israel and Hamas, which Israel keeps violating.
Its charter, however, allows a wider purpose to foster stability and lasting peace in conflict zones globally, not just Gaza.
'We will do things like that in other spots'
Trump who welcomed the "powerful people" who joined the board, vowed Gaza will be made "successful" and "peaceful", indicating that this model of intervention would be applied elsewhere.
"We will do things like that in other spots. Spots will come up, things will happen," said Trump, who said he "settled eight wars and a ninth to come" in his first year of second term.
"Some of the wars were 32 years long, 32, 34 to 37. That’s a long time. We ended in about two days, each one of those."
Trump's assertion of solving "eight wars" in a year involves a combination of complete ceasefires, agreements, and ongoing disputes.
The list he frequently cites includes conflicts such as Armenia–Azerbaijan, Democratic Republic of Congo–Rwanda, Israel–Iran, India–Pakistan, Thailand–Cambodia, and the Israel–Hamas ceasefire in Gaza — which the Board of Peace is currently attempting to make permanent — as well as Egypt–Ethiopia, and Serbia–Kosovo.
While laying the strategic vision of the board, the US president referred to the Board of Peace as the most consequential board, stating, "In terms of power and prestige, there has never been anything close."
Trump also used the event to retract some UN criticisms and pledged US funds for UN repairs, while positioning Board of Peace as a supervisory entity, saying it would "almost be looking over the United Nations" to ensure it "runs properly," provides better facilities, and gets necessary funding.
"We are going to strengthen up the United Nations. We’re going to make sure its facilities are good… we’re going to help them money-wise, and we’re going to make sure the United Nations is viable. I think the United Nations has great potential, really great potential. It has not lived up to [that] potential."

Army veteran sues federal government after ICE detained him for three days

An army veteran detained by federal immigration agents in southern California during his work commute in July has filed a lawsuit against the federal government.
According to the lawsuit, filed on Wednesday with the help of the nonprofit law firm Institute for Justice, George Retes was held in a detention center for three days without access to his family, an attorney, or any information about the charges against him, in what the suit argues was an unconstitutional detention.
Retes, a 26-year-old US citizen, was arrested while on his way to his job as a security guard at a farm in Ventura county, where a raid by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents was underway on 10 July. After Retes attempted to explain to agents blocking the roadway that he needed to get through to work, agents shattered his car window, removed him from the vehicle, and detained Retes without checking his identification. He was later held at the Metropolitan Detention Center in Los Angeles without a clear explanation of his detainment.
“George’s rights were violated, and he is filing this lawsuit, not only to protect his own rights, but to have the rights of others be protected too,” Andrew Wimer, director of media relations at the Institute for Justice, told the Guardian. “What happened to George is clearly wrong. No one can be held for three days without being told what they’ve done wrong, without being charged with a crime. Americans deserve justice when their rights have been violated.”
In an op-ed for the San Francisco Chronicle, Retes said he missed his daughter’s third birthday party. “Then I was just let go, with no charges, no explanation for why and no apology,” he added.
The lawsuit was filed against the United States government, which oversees the Federal Bureau of Prisons and the detention center where Retes was held, ICE, Customs and Border Protection (CBP), the US navy, and the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI).
Existing legislation allows individuals to sue state and local officials if those officials violate their constitutional rights. When it comes to federal officials, the process to file a lawsuit against them has become increasingly difficult. In recent decades, the supreme court has narrowed when lawsuits against federal agents can be brought.
“We fully expect this government will claim various immunities, that they will try to get the case dismissed before it can really get started,” said Wimer. “These cases present a lot of difficulties, we know what we’re in for, and it might be a years-long fight, but because we’re a public interest law firm that will not be charging George, this is a fight that we can take on.”
Retes’s case adds to the growing concern of arrests of US military veterans by federal agents. As the Trump administration ramped up its immigration crackdown in Minnesota, an army veteran was arrested while protesting a service at a church in St Paul, Mother Jones reported. In October, the Guardian identified eight cases where military veterans were prosecuted or sought damages after being detained by federal agents.
The Guardian has reached out to ICE and the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) for comment.

Why was former Prince Andrew arrested by UK police?
Mountbatten-Windsor, the former UK prince, has not been charged with a crime and was released under investigation.
What we know so far about arrest of UK's former Prince Andrew
King Charles’s younger brother, Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor, has been released after his arrest over allegations of misconduct in public office, becoming the first senior British royal in modern history to face arrest.
Mountbatten-Windsor, who turned 66 on Thursday, was questioned by detectives from Thames Valley Police about his links to the late convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.

The former prince has not been charged with a crime. Under United Kingdom law, police generally have about 24 hours to charge a suspect or release them pending further investigation.
In this case, he was released under investigation.
So what do we know about this case and the former prince’s arrest?
Who is Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor?
Born on February 19, 1960, Andrew is the third child and second son of the late Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Philip.
Andrew pursued a military career. He served for 22 years in the Royal Navy, flying helicopters in combat during the 1982 Falklands War.
Later, he spent a decade as a UK trade envoy between 2001 and 2011, a period that is under renewed scrutiny due to revelations about his long-term friendship with Epstein, who was jailed in 2008 for child sex offences.
In January, the United States Department of Justice released more than three million Epstein-related documents, including emails from Mountbatten-Windsor to Epstein. Some material suggests he shared official reports from a 2010 Southeast Asia trade trip with the financier.
“The fact that the former royal is in custody represents quite a stunning turn of events for the royal family,” Al Jazeera’s Camille Nedelec said, reporting from London.
“The former prince was at one time the favourite of the late queen, and now it’s the culmination of his slow descent into disgrace,” she added.
The arrest of the senior royal, eighth in line to the throne, is unprecedented in modern times.
Why was Mountbatten-Windsor arrested?
Mountbatten-Windsor was arrested on “suspicion of misconduct in public office”, Thames Valley Police said.
Thames Valley Police said earlier in February it was “assessing” reports that Mountbatten-Windsor sent confidential trade reports to Epstein in 2010, when he was the UK’s special trade envoy.
The Norfolk police said they were supporting Thames Valley Police in the investigation.
Both forces are involved because his former residence, Royal Lodge in Windsor, falls under the jurisdiction of Thames Valley Police. He has since moved to Wood Farm on his brother’s Sandringham estate in Norfolk, after King Charles asked him to leave the Windsor property on February 2.
Late on Thursday, the Thames Valley Police confirmed Mountbatten-Windsor was released and that the searches in Norfolk had concluded.
What is misconduct in public office?
The Crown Prosecution Service (CPS), which oversees prosecutions in England and Wales, describes it as a criminal offence “that concerns serious wilful abuse or neglect of the power or responsibilities of the public office held”.
The CPS says the offence is committed when the following circumstances apply: a public officer acting as such wilfully neglects to perform their duty and/or wilfully misconducts themselves to such a degree as to amount to an abuse of the public’s trust in the office holder without reasonable excuse or justification.
In the case of Mountbatten-Windsor, police are investigating allegations that he shared with Epstein confidential government information that he had access to because he was a UK trade envoy.
He also held the title of prince at the time, but that is not relevant to the misconduct in the public office investigation.
A conviction for that offence carries a maximum sentence of life imprisonment, but sentences can also be much shorter, depending on the seriousness of the specific case.
What is Andrew’s connection to Jeffrey Epstein?
The former prince first became publicly linked to Epstein in the early 2000s.
The two were photographed together on several occasions, including in New York in 2010, after Epstein had already served a jail sentence in Florida for child sex offences.
Mountbatten-Windsor said he met Epstein through UK socialite Ghislaine Maxwell.
The association came under intense scrutiny in 2014 after accuser Virginia Giuffre alleged that she had been trafficked by Epstein and his associate Maxwell and forced to have sex with Mountbatten-Windsor in the early 2000s when she was 17.
The former prince gave a widely criticised interview to the BBC’s Newsnight programme in November 2019, in which he denied wrongdoing and said he had “no recollection” of meeting Giuffre. Days later, he stepped back from public royal duties.
Giuffre filed a civil lawsuit against Mountbatten-Windsor in New York in 2021. In February 2022, the case was settled out of court, with the ex-prince making a financial settlement but admitting no liability. He was also stripped of his military titles.
Responding to Mountbatten-Windsor’s arrest, Giuffre’s family said they felt a sense of long-awaited accountability.
“At last, today, our broken hearts have been lifted at the news that no one is above the law, not even royalty,” Giuffre’s siblings said in a statement on Thursday. “He was never a prince.”
What has been King Charles’s reaction?
King Charles was seen arriving at the opening of London Fashion Week on Thursday – a public appearance that had been in his diary since well before the arrest.
“I have learned with the deepest concern the news about Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor and suspicion of misconduct in public office,” Charles said in a statement.
“What now follows is the full, fair and proper process by which this issue is investigated in the appropriate manner and by the appropriate authorities. In this, as I have said before, they have our full and wholehearted support and co-operation.”
“Let me state clearly: the law must take its course,” he added.

Radiographer struck off after making unwanted sexual advances towards women
- An NHS radiographer, Christopher Gyiripah, has been struck off for gross misconduct after making unwanted sexual advances towards female colleagues.
- Gyiripah, who worked at Frimley Health NHS Foundation Trust, was accused of asking personal questions, making inappropriate comments, and physically touching colleagues without consent.
- Incidents included asking a junior colleague if she had a boyfriend, telling another woman he 'felt like touching you, so I did' after squeezing her bottom, and asking a colleague to sit on his lap.
- A disciplinary investigation found that Gyiripah exploited his position of power for 'sexual gratification', despite his claims of being a 'friendly person' with 'platonic relationships'.
- Frimley Health NHS Foundation Trust confirmed Gyiripah was dismissed in April 2022 following an internal investigation, and his case was referred to the Health and Care Professions Council, leading to him being struck off the register in February 2026.

Hong Kong banks reward staff with gifts, extra holiday and lai see as they return to work
Bank of China (Hong Kong) is giving away hampers, ZA Bank is paying a HK$10,000 bonus, while HSBC and Hang Seng are offering HK$500
Thousands of Hong Kong bank employees will receive a return-to-work lai see on Friday, with some banks handing out extra benefits and gifts to their staff amid improving economic and market sentiment.
While it is a Chinese tradition for companies to give their staff lai see on the first working day of the Lunar New Year as a token of appreciation for their hard work, many banks nowadays give their staff lai see and other goodies before the holiday.
Bank of China (Hong Kong) is giving each of its 15,000 staff a HK$500 (US$64) laisee to mark the Year of the Horse, the same as in previous years. However, the bank’s gift hamper this year is bigger, with the number of items increasing to eight from six. The basket consists of mushrooms, morel mushrooms, dried scallops, fish maw, XO sauce, dried conch, pistachios and American ginseng.
HSBC and its subsidiary Hang Seng Bank are also distributing HK$500 to each of their combined staff of nearly 26,000 electronically, amounting to around HK$13 million, the largest payout among Hong Kong banks.
“The Year of the Horse symbolises vitality, speed and success – qualities that perfectly reflect the energy we’re bringing into 2026,” said Maggie Ng, CEO of HSBC Hong Kong, in her new year message to staff. “I’m confident that it’s going to be another exciting year where we will harness our collective strengths to create many opportunities for our customers.”

Trump mulling limited strike to pressure Iran into accepting new nuclear deal: Report
US president reviewing options ranging from targeted strikes to broader campaign amid warnings of regional escalation, officials say
ISTANBUL
US President Donald Trump is considering a limited military strike on Iran in a bid to pressure Tehran into agreeing to a new nuclear deal, a report said Thursday.
The Wall Street Journal, citing people familiar with the matter, said the initial operation — if approved — could take place within days and would target a limited number of military or government sites. The move is said to be designed to intensify pressure on Iran while stopping short of a full-scale attack that could provoke major retaliation.
If Iran refuses to comply with Trump’s demand to halt its nuclear enrichment activities, Washington could escalate its response to a broader campaign against regime facilities, potentially aimed at destabilizing the leadership in Tehran, the report added.
One source said the president could escalate gradually — beginning with smaller strikes and expanding operations if necessary — until Tehran either abandons its nuclear program or the regime collapses.
Recent discussions have reportedly shifted toward the possibility of broader military campaigns.
Officials said Trump has not made a final decision on launching an attack but is reviewing options including a short, intensive campaign aimed at forcing regime change and limited strikes on Iranian government and military targets.
Some US officials and analysts have cautioned that such action could trigger Iranian retaliation, potentially drawing Washington into a wider regional conflict and putting allies at risk.

Ex-Prince Andrew’s arrest spurs Epstein accountability calls from UK to US
US lawmakers call on the Trump administration to pursue justice for victims, as UN expert urges probes across the world.
Washington, DC – The arrest of former British royal Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor has sparked renewed calls for accountability for Jeffrey Epstein’s crimes and proper investigations into the late sex offender’s networks in the United States and across the world.
Police in the United Kingdom detained the ex-prince, brother of King Charles, on Thursday, with authorities saying that they had opened an investigation into possible misconduct in public office without naming Mountbatten-Windsor.

Reem Alsalem, the United Nations special rapporteur on violence against women and girls, said the arrest sends “an important message that nobody is above the law, irrespective of your wealth, your connections – even if you’re royalty”.
“At the same time, it’s important that we examine the involvement of anyone that has enabled, facilitated, the crimes committed by the Epstein criminal enterprise,” Alsalem told Al Jazeera.
She stressed the need for independent investigations into individuals and institutions who may have been involved in Epstein’s crimes.
Mountbatten-Windsor’s arrest came weeks after the latest release of US government documents related to the sex abuse case, which showed deep ties between the former duke of York and Epstein.
Some exchanges suggested that Mountbatten-Windsor, who previously served as the UK’s trade envoy, shared government information with Epstein.
The former royal was released later on Thursday.
Millions of files related to Epstein have been released by the US government over the past two months after Congress passed a law compelling the administration of President Donald Trump to make the documents public.
The files, which included emails and text messages, showed that the disgraced financier, whom authorities say died of suicide while in jail in 2019, maintained friendships and business relations with rich and powerful people across the world.
Some documents and photos suggested that some of Epstein’s associates participated in, or at least were aware of, his sex abuse ring.
One picture showed Mountbatten-Windsor crouched over a female victim who was lying flat on the floor.
The former prince has denied any wrongdoing related to Epstein’s sex crimes.
Calls for justice
On Thursday, US Congressman Thomas Massie, one of the leading legislators who pushed for the release of the files, called on FBI Director Kash Patel and Attorney General Pam Bondi to act and bring people involved in Epstein’s sex abuse to justice.
“Now we need JUSTICE in the United States,” Massie said, commenting on the arrest of Mountbatten-Windsor.
The Republican congressman shared a video of comments he made on the House floor last year during a debate on the Epstein files bill.
“How will we know if this bill has been successful? We will know when there are men – rich men – in handcuffs being perp-walked to the jail,” Massie said in his speech. “And until then, this is still a cover-up.”
Over the years, Epstein built a network of hundreds of girls and young women for sexual exploitation. Many of the victims were made to travel around with him and stay at his private island in the Caribbean.
But the Trump administration has all but ruled out further charges in the case.
Last year, before the release of the documents, the US Department of Justice denied that Epstein had a “client list” of powerful people to whom he trafficked his sex abuse victims.
Earlier this month, deputy US Attorney General Todd Blanche sparked outrage when he appeared to dismiss calls for prosecuting Epstein’s allies.
“We will always investigate any evidence of misconduct. But as you know, it is not a crime to party with Mr Epstein,” he told Fox News. “And so, as horrible as it is, it is not a crime to email with Mr Epstein.”
Alsalem, the UN expert, said Blanche’s comments were “dismissive” of the victims and “the horrific experiences” they endured.
She noted that it had been known that Epstein was convicted of sex abuse crimes in 2008.
“In light of everything that we know and was known even back then by those who engaged with him, nobody can claim unawareness,” Alsalem told Al Jazeera.
“But indeed, at the same time, everybody accused should still benefit from a fair and impartial trial, but that’s why we have to get to that impartial and fair trial, and then they can also explain themselves.”
The Trump connection
Epstein was given what is widely seen as a lenient plea deal during his first conviction, where he admitted to solicitation of prostitution with a minor and was sentenced to 18 months in jail that included work release privileges.
He was arrested and charged again in 2019 after media reports scrutinised the 2008 federal prosecution against him, which was led by Alexander Acosta, who served as labour secretary in the first Trump administration.
Trump himself has been accused of ties to Epstein, but the US president said that he only knew the late sex offender as a neighbour in Palm Beach, Florida, and eventually dissociated with him because he was a “creep”.
Last year, The Wall Street Journal released what it said was a sexually suggestive birthday card in the shape of a nude woman sent by Trump to Epstein. The US president denied sending the letter and filed a lawsuit against the newspaper over the allegation.
“If a Prince can be held accountable, so can a President,” Democratic Congresswoman Melanie Stansbury wrote on X after Mountbatten-Windsor’s arrest.
Congressman Robert Garcia, the top Democrat on the Oversight Committee, called the arrest of the former British royal an “enormous step forward” towards accountability.
“Oversight Democrats called for Mountbatten-Windsor to come clean about his ties to Epstein months ago, and Britain is now holding him accountable with this arrest,” Garcia said in a statement.
“Now it’s time for the United States to end this White House cover-up. President Trump and his Epstein Administration are not above the law.”
In a Reuters/Ipsos poll released earlier this week, a majority of US respondents – 53 percent – agreed that the Epstein files have lowered their “trust in the country’s political and business leaders”.
And 69 percent said their views were captured by the statement that the files “show that powerful people in the US are rarely held accountable for their actions”.
Trump’s allies often note that the administration of former Democratic President Joe Biden had four years to release the Epstein files, but chose not to do so.
Some powerful Democratic politicians and donors, including former President Bill Clinton and ex-Treasury Secretary Larry Summers, also had ties to Epstein.
‘Organised attack’ against women and children
The issue goes beyond the US. The Epstein files have rocked British politics and led to calls for the resignation of Prime Minister Keir Starmer, who appointed Epstein associate Peter Mandelson as ambassador to Washington.
France and Norway have also opened probes into corruption and sex abuse allegations related to Epstein.
Earlier this week, UN experts, including Alsalem, found that Epstein’s crimes “reasonably meet the legal threshold of crimes against humanity”.
Alsalem told Al Jazeera that there needs to be an “independent, impartial investigation that spans all the countries and all individuals” reported to be involved in Epstein’s network.
“Not only that, we have to also examine the architecture of the alleged enterprise – the organisational structure,” she told Al Jazeera.
“We have to shift this investigation from looking at individual crimes, isolated criminal transactions, to realising that we’re talking about an organised attack directed against vulnerable women and children, including girls.”

Democrats say citizenship question could derail census test and deter immigrants from participating
Congressional Democrats are warning that the U.S. Census Bureau risks undermining an upcoming test of the 2030 census by using a form that includes a citizenship question
- Bookmark
U.S. Census Bureau plans to use a questionnaire with a citizenship question as part of its practice test for the 2030 census could jeopardize the once-a-decade head count and scare away immigrants from participating, congressional Democrats warned Thursday.
Democrats on the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform urged the Census Bureau to drop plans to use the American Community Survey form, which includes the citizenship question, and instead use a traditional census questionnaire that omits it. The on-the-ground tests in Huntsville, Alabama, and Spartanburg, S.C., start next month.
“The Trump Administration is risking millions of taxpayer dollars to pursue policies which could fatally compromise the 2030 count before it even begins,” they wrote in a letter to acting Census Bureau Director George Cook and Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, whose department oversees the statistical agency.
The Census Bureau and Commerce Department didn't immediately respond to emails seeking comment.
The field test gives the statistical agency the chance to learn how to better tally populations that were undercounted during the last census. The head count determines how many congressional seats and Electoral College votes each state gets, as well as how $2.8 trillion in federal funding is distributed annually. Among the new methods being tested is the use of U.S. Postal Service workers to conduct tasks previously done by census workers.
In recent weeks, the Census Bureau made public plans for the 2026 test that would use the American Community Survey form, which asks a wide range of questions about participants, and eliminated four other planned locations — Colorado Springs, Colorado, western North Carolina, western Texas and tribal lands in Arizona.
The Democrats raised concerns that the citizenship question on the American Community Survey form being used would lead to an undercount by deterring immigrants, including legal residents, from participating.
“Many immigrants or citizens in mixed-status families, including green card holders and other legal permanent residents, face fear, chaos, and uncertainty over who the Trump Administration will target next for denaturalization and deportation,” they said in their letter.
In his first term, President Donald Trump unsuccessfully tried to add a citizenship question to the 2020 census form. The Republican president also signed orders that would have excluded people who are in the U.S. illegally from the figures used to divvy up congressional seats among the states and mandated the collection of citizenship data.
The attempt to add the citizenship question was blocked by the U.S. Supreme Court, and both orders were rescinded when Democrat Joe Biden took office in January 2021, before the 2020 census figures were released.
The Constitution’s 14th Amendment says “the whole number of persons in each state” should be counted for the numbers used for apportionment, the process of divvying up congressional seats, and Electoral College votes among the states. The Census Bureau has interpreted that to mean anybody living in the U.S., regardless of legal status.

Polish president ends special refugee support system for Ukrainians, shifts assistance to general foreigner protections
Polish President Karol Nawrocki signed legislation on Feb. 19 transferring support measures for Ukrainian refugees into Poland’s general Law on the Protection of Foreigners, ending a separate legal framework created after Russia’s full-scale invasion in 2022.
The earlier special assistance law had simplified residence, employment, access to social benefits, and education for Ukrainians fleeing the war.
Under the new rules, these provisions will be gradually incorporated into broader foreigner protection legislation, creating a unified temporary protection system applying to all foreigners.
“I sign this law with the conviction that it protects our state finances, streamlines the system, and restores a sense of basic justice," Nawrocki said.
The law also extends the legal stay of Ukrainian citizens in Poland until March 4, 2027. In addition, the legislation will preserve residency rights for Ukrainians already granted protection or whose documents were extended due to the war.
A key change introduces a requirement for refugees to apply for a "PESEL" personal identification number within 30 days of entering the country, with failure to do so resulting in the loss of temporary protection status.
Nawrocki previously signaled in November 2025 that the special assistance law would be signed for the final time, stating that Ukrainians would eventually be treated under the same legal framework as other foreign nationals.
Poland has emerged as a primary destination for Ukrainian refugees following Russia's full-scale invasion. By summer 2025, approximately 1 million Ukrainian refugees were residing in Poland, according to Vasyl Bodnar, Ukraine's ambassador to the country.

Hair stylists around the world should get their dye bottles ready. Everyone is going to want the Alysa halo.
With her unusual ring ’do on full display, Alysa Liu is the new Olympic women’s skating champion. Even Liu herself could not have predicted this outcome when she retired at 16 from competitive skating, then decided to return two years later.
Liu held off an onslaught from three strong Japanese skaters, including 2022 silver medalist Kaori Sakamoto, whose mistake in a jump combination cost her points. New Japanese talent Ami Nakai landed a triple axel and the same number of triple jumps as Liu, but couldn’t beat Liu’s triple lutz-triple toe loop combination, which outscored the triple axel.

Liu’s win is a victory for more than powerful skating. Her comeback is a statement about autonomy and the importance of making sure women—and, in sports like figure skating, girls—are heard. In returning to competitive skating, Liu made it clear to her coaches and her family that she, and no one else, would make all the decisions about her career—how much she trained, when she trained, even what she ate and what she wore. Teammate Amber Glenn said that Liu’s perspective on the sport is a healthy one that other skaters should emulate—one that focuses on the joy in the sport rather than the pressure and the competitiveness.
When asked after making the Olympic team whether she would feel pressure as a returning Olympian, Liu seemed baffled. “I don’t think anything is going to be hard about the Olympics,” she said. “What is there to lose? Every second you are there, you are gaining something.” In her case, that includes a shiny new gold medal.

Trump sees 'maximum' 15 days for Iran to make deal
France

President Donald Trump said on Thursday, February 19, that Iran had at most 15 days to make a deal on concerns starting with its nuclear program, suggesting the United States would attack if it did not.
"We're either going to get a deal or it's going to be unfortunate for them," Trump told reporters on Air Force One. Asked about his timeline, Trump said, "I would think that would be enough time – 10, 15 days, pretty much maximum."
Trump earlier Thursday had suggested 10 days for Iran's clerical state to reach an agreement. "It's proven to be over the years not easy to make a meaningful deal with Iran. We have to make a meaningful deal otherwise bad things happen," Trump told the inaugural meeting of the "Board of Peace," his initiative to secure stability in Gaza.
He warned at the event in Washington that the US "may have to take it a step further" without any agreement, adding: "You're going to be finding out over the next probably 10 days."
Later on Thursday, Iran responded, warning that US bases, facilities and assets would be "legitimate targets" if the United States follows through on its military threats and attacks.
Amir Saeid Iravani, the Iranian ambassador to the United Nations, made the remarks in a letter to UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres and the president of the Security Council that was seen by AFP.
President Donald Trump has deployed warships, fighter jets and other military hardware to the Middle East as he seeks to block Iran from building a nuclear bomb, something Tehran says it is not pursuing.
'Belligerent statement'
The letter cited a social media post by Trump on Wednesday, where he said the United States may need to use UK military bases, including one on an Indian Ocean island, "should Iran decide not to make a deal."
"Such a belligerent statement by the President of the United States...signals a real risk of military aggression, the consequences of which would be catastrophic for the region and would constitute a grave threat to international peace and security," Iravani wrote in the letter.
He called for the Security Council – the UN's top decision-making body where Washington has veto power – to "ensure that the United States immediately ceases its unlawful threats of the use of force."
The letter said Iran remains committed "to diplomatic solutions" and "on a reciprocal basis, addressing ambiguities regarding its peaceful nuclear program."
But Iravani warned if Iran faced military aggression, "all bases, facilities, and assets of the hostile force in the region would constitute legitimate targets in the context of Iran's defensive response."
Trump's friend and roving envoy Steve Witkoff and the president's son-in-law Jared Kushner met Tuesday indirectly in Geneva with Iran's top diplomat, who said that there was progress.
The talks come a month after Iranian authorities killed thousands of people as they crushed one of the biggest threats yet to the Islamic Republic established in the 1979 revolution that toppled the pro-Western shah.
Secretary of State Marco Rubio is expected to hold talks on February 28 in Israel with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who has long advocated tough action against Tehran and ordered a bombing campaign last year.

Revealed: Epstein cultivated relationship with CBP officer, causing US investigation
Unknown

07:47:36 KST

Federal investigators examined Jeffrey Epstein’s relationship with a Customs and Border Protection (CBP) officer who worked at the St Thomas airport to which Epstein regularly flew on his private planes before traveling by boat or helicopter to his private island, newly released documents reveal.
As part of that investigation, which did not result in any charges, investigators also issued subpoenas related to three additional CBP officers working at the Cyril E King airport (STT) on St Thomas, documents show. The Guardian also identified two other CBP officers on St Thomas and in Florida who were in contact with Epstein, based on emails and text messages between Epstein, his staff and the officers. It does not appear the FBI ever investigated those two officers.
The FBI in New York opened a preliminary investigation in October 2019 after receiving a report that a long-serving CBP agricultural inspector “had ongoing friendship with Mr Epstein … while working for CBP Pre-Clearance in Saint Thomas for over 7 years”. The email establishing the investigation into the agricultural inspector, Timothy “Bill” Routch, is among the millions of files related to Epstein’s crimes that were released by the Department of Justice (DoJ) this month.
Federal authorities interviewed Epstein’s longtime pilot about the convicted sex offender’s contacts with CBP agents.
US Customs and Border Protection is the federal law enforcement agency tasked with overseeing the entrance of people and goods through US ports of entry, including airports. It claims to be “uniquely situated to deter and disrupt human trafficking”, and is one of the four primary US agencies tasked with enforcing federal anti-trafficking law.
In July 2019, federal prosecutors in New York indicted Epstein on charges of sex trafficking minors as young as 14 in New York and Palm Beach, Florida. Following Epstein’s death by suicide in jail in August 2019, the attorney general of the US Virgins Islands – an unincorporated territory of the US that includes St Thomas and Epstein’s private islands, Little St James and Great St James – filed suit against his estate, alleging that Epstein “trafficked and sexually abused women and underage girls” on those private islands, using “private planes, helicopters, boat and automobiles to transport victims to, from and within the Virgin Islands”.
No CBP officer was ever charged for crimes related to Epstein, and the Guardian has not seen any evidence to suggest that CBP officers had direct knowledge or involvement in Epstein’s crimes. The FBI interviewed Routch and subpoenaed credit reports about him and three other CBP officers, but it is not clear whether the investigation went any further. The release of the government’s investigative files on Epstein has been delayed, redactions are inconsistent, and it is not clear how many more files will be made public.
Routch acknowledged interacting with Epstein “in the course of [his] employment”, visiting Epstein’s island, and being investigated by the FBI. He disputed many of the details contained in FBI and CBP documents. In emails with the Guardian, he characterized the FBI investigation as “a wild goose chase”, and said: “All my encounters were of a business nature … I never [witnessed] anything remotely related to trafficking.”
Epstein emailed and texted with CBP officers, invited them to his island, visited with them at the airport, and frequently sought to determine who was going to be on duty when he was traveling through STT, the released files show. Some officers received financial advice, others, small gifts, and employment opportunities. One officer was invited to perform the steel pan drums on Little St James on multiple occasions; Epstein tasked his assistant with helping another with an interest in accounting to find mentorship. That agent solicited Epstein for a “hard-money loan”, though he told the Guardian the loan never materialized.
Epstein also raised complaints about less-than-friendly treatment from other CBP officers with his friendly agents, twice eliciting promises from supervisors to look into the perceived ill treatment.
The Guardian contacted CBP and the Department of Homeland Security for comment. They did not respond by our deadline.
In March 2016, Jeffrey Epstein was burdened with logistical headaches. Eight years after pleading guilty to charges of child sexual exploitation, the billionaire continued to enjoy a jet-setting lifestyle, regularly travelling between his homes in New York, Florida, New Mexico and the US Virgin Islands on a fleet of private jets.
Travel between the mainland US and his compound on Little St James was complicated. Flights to St Thomas were treated like domestic flights, but flights departing St Thomas for a US airport had to clear customs and immigration control.
Epstein and his personal pilot, Larry Visoski, typically expedited this process by “pre-clearing” in St Thomas. Pre-clearance is a longstanding CBP program that allows travelers to go through CBP inspections at certain overseas airports rather than upon arrival. Emails between Epstein and Visoski suggest that they preferred to pre-clear whenever possible and that Epstein was often personally involved in those arrangements.
But on 1 March 2016, something went awry. About an hour out from Teterboro airport in New Jersey, a popular airport for private and corporate jets in close proximity to Manhattan, Visoski received a satellite call from his wife. A CBP officer had just called her as Visoski’s emergency contact and was threatening Visoski with some kind of fine. Visoski made contact with the Teterboro CBP officer, who told Visoski that he could “NOT let my passengers deplane and to bring the aircraft directly to the customs building upon arrival”, the pilot later recalled.
Visoski informed the CBP officer by satellite phone that he had pre-cleared customs in STT and eventually received what he described as “a sincere apology”. Epstein pursued the issue, however, seeking further information about CBP procedures at other airports and asking Visoski to get the name of the CBP officer’s supervisor.
Just two weeks later, another hiccup occurred. Upon arriving at the airport in Newark, New Jersey – and despite pre-clearing at STT – a CBP officer required Epstein’s passengers to pass through immigration control.
Darren Indyke, Epstein’s longtime lawyer, sent a formal complaint to the Department of Homeland Security’s private aircraft support office, noting that “in the course of N212JE’s numerous flights between St Thomas and Teterboro, and St Thomas and West Palm Beach, there has been a lack of uniformity in the clearance and pre-arrival requirements imposed by local CBP offices at each of those locations, and, at times, by different CPB officers within them”. Indyke followed up on 23 May and appears to have scheduled a conference call with staff from private aircraft support on 25 May.
But while Indyke was going through official channels, Epstein was taking a more direct approach. The billionaire emailed James Heil, a supervisory CBP officer based on St Thomas. “One off the passengers . a woman with an asylum application pending, work authorization and a social secirity card, was asked for her passport and in it given a B 2 tourist visa,” Epstein complained. (Epstein’s communications are littered with punctuation and spelling errors.) “The other passenger was stamped in as well , though they did not change her departure date.”
Heil offered to reach a supervisor “up there”, and said: “I apologize that you are experiencing these issues again.” It’s not clear what actions, if any, Heil took from there. Heil did not respond to queries from the Guardian.
Heil had been in direct communication with Epstein since at least 2014, documents show. An email from one of Epstein’s assistants suggests Heil was scheduled to visit Little St James by boat on 28 February 2014, though it’s not known whether the visit took place. Epstein regularly emailed or texted Heil about issues he had going through customs at various airports or to see if Heil was going to be on duty when he planned to depart STT.
The correspondence appears friendly. Epstein texted Heil a message of thanks on Christmas Day 2014. “It was my pleasure,” Heil responded the next day. “Feel free to utilize my not-so-insignificant IQ anytime, and also feel free to connect via social media. (We Brooklyn Boys stick together.)”
“Atta boy,” Epstein responded.
At one point during their text exchanges, Epstein, perhaps jokingly, invited Heil to “stop by at my house and I’ll make you an egg cream”. There is no evidence Heil took him up on the offer. On Christmas Eve 2016, Epstein texted Heil: “Just landed with your xmas cannolis . Where can I deliver them.” Heil was off work, so Epstein had his driver deliver the treats to Heil’s home. Twice, Epstein appears to have offered to bring Heil “something” from the mainland.
Epstein also regularly raised issues that he encountered with airport customs at STT and other US airports, and Heil said he was working to liaise with CBP officers in Florida, Massachusetts and New Jersey on Epstein’s behalf. At times, Epstein discussed with Visoski whether they should ask Heil to approve overtime – in an apparent effort to arrange for Epstein to get pre-cleared outside of CBP’s regular hours.
In November 2016, Epstein texted Heil that one of his agents had been “nasty”. “I will speak to him!” Heil responded. “I will handle it, formally.”
Records of Epstein’s direct interactions with the six CBP officers are mingled amid the bold-faced names that have dominated coverage of Epstein’s circle of influence. A memorandum of Epstein’s May 2013 schedule, included in an email to Indyke, records appointments with Mort Zuckerman, Leon Black, Bob Kerrey, Joel Klein, Joi Ito, Woody and Soon Yi Allen, and Tom Pritzker – as well as “Customs Agent Bill Routch”.
Routch is the first CBP officer to appear in the files, chronologically. Epstein appears to have begun contacting him in late 2012 and invited him to visit Little St James “for coffee” on 21 May 2013. Routch acknowledged visiting the island but said it was to perform an agricultural inspection of some trees.
In 2014, Epstein made contact with Heil as well as another agent, Jeff McNally, whom Visoski had flagged as being “nice”. McNally was scheduled for lunch on Little St James in May 2014, according to an email from one of Epstein’s assistants, though it is not known whether he attended. McNally did not respond to queries from the Guardian.
In 2015, Epstein got the name of another agent, Glen Samuel, from Heil, and asked Samuel to perform steel pan drumming on the island. Emails from Epstein’s assistants show that Samuel was scheduled to perform on the island at least twice, and that in 2016 he proposed offering regular lessons to Epstein’s “guests”. It’s unclear if the lessons ever occurred. Samuel did not respond to queries from the Guardian.
Epstein had received assurance from Heil that Samuel was allowed to undertake outside employment, but Samuel appears to have declined payment. “Mr. Samuel says he does not intend to charge you,” one of Epstein’s assistants wrote in an email. “He considers you a friend and was doing this for you. If you wish to give him something, he is appreciative, but there is no fee.”
Heil also appears to have introduced Epstein to Gerardo (Gerry) Martinez, a CBP supervisor at the airport in Palm Beach, Florida. The files show regular communication between Epstein and Martinez throughout 2018, with Epstein often flagging his arrival at the airport and seeking to meet. Epstein also complained to Martinez after “your guys busted my balls” when he told CBP agents he was carrying $3,000 in cash but actually had $11,800. Epstein repeatedly followed up with questions about the regulations on carrying currency between the US Virgin Islands and mainland US, with Martinez sending the question “all the way to chief counsel”.
In March 2019, Epstein appears to have asked Martinez for help or advice in obtaining a new passport, writing: “can i call you , ? not sure =hat to do, i need to get a new passport with the sex identifier on =t. is it ok to travel back and forth to the Virigi= islands without a valid passport?” Epstein made three attempts to meet with Martinez at the airport in the ensuing weeks, though it’s not clear if they met or why Epstein would turn to a CBP officer for help obtaining a passport.
Martinez acknowledged interacting with Epstein when reached by the Guardian by phone, but did not immediately respond to further queries.
Epstein was arrested at Teterboro airport on federal sex-trafficking charges on 6 July 2019, after flying in from Paris.
The emails provide extensive communication between Epstein and a St Thomas CBP agent, Alford Richards, with whom Epstein arranged more than a dozen meetings between 2015 and 2019. It is not clear how many actually occurred.
The emails show that Richards and Epstein first spoke about finance in August 2015, while Richards was working at the airport. Epstein had his assistants follow up, emailing Richards a link to Khan Academy, an online education company, as well as the billionaire’s advice that Richards start with “basic finance courses first”. Richards initially communicated with Epstein’s assistants, seeking further instruction on finance and investments, but was soon emailing regularly with Epstein himself.
“I’m in action mode right now and have dedicated everyday to getting there,” he wrote to Epstein about his plans for “financial freedom” in October 2015, after a meeting at Epstein’s helicopter hangar. “I only take advice from you and every time we speak i take every thing literal and go out and do it. I know this is the COST I must endure to get where I want to get and I will ‘never’ give up.”
In an interview, Richards acknowledged his numerous interactions with Epstein, including through meetings at Epstein’s office and on his private island “a couple of times”, but sought to minimize the extent of the relationship. “It wasn’t anything in-depth,” Richards said. “It’s like, hey, this guy is rich, let me hear his opinions.” Epstein was well-known on the island as a billionaire, and Richards was “just trying to get some financial insight”, he said.
By email, Epstein counseled Richards to take accounting courses and had one of his assistants try to find Richards “hand-on experience” in accounting with a company on the island, through part-time work, an internship, or some kind of mentoring. The assistant contacted multiple local companies with which Epstein did business on Richards’ behalf.
Much of the advice Epstein gave was “stuff I already found out by reading my books”, Richards said, but it “felt good that little me, who is no one” was getting financial tips from a billionaire. The internship “never came to fruition”, he said. “He’d give me like, vague tips, and then that was it,” Richards said. “I just wanted some hints and to get better at my finances.”
Early in their interactions, Epstein tasked Richards with finding out whether the fuel supplier for commercial airlines at STT would also sell to him, calling it a “good project” for Richards. Richards made inquiries and responded within a day. (Richards recalled the incident and said Epstein’s request had been “over my head” and “out of my league”.) The pair shared links to articles about investment prospects (in Belize, bitcoin, immigration detention centers, and local real estate) and Richard’s shared a number of business proposals with Epstein. They regularly arranged to meet around Epstein’s travel schedule.
In June 2017, Epstein and Richards discussed a forthcoming auction of local real estate. Soon thereafter, Epstein emailed Richards: “as you have asked me for hard money loan , please as= your supervisor if we can continue this converation.” Richards responded on 31 July 2017: “I spoke with my supervisor & was told that conversations on such a matter is ok, however, if I was to actually procure a hard money loan from you. It could or may be interpreted in a awkward way if I had to process you for official CBP travel business and the full terms of the transaction is not known or understood by certain individuals.”
Richards said that the request for a “hard-money loan” – a type of short-term loan typically used in real estate transactions – was not serious, but the result of him trying to “naively speak the jargon of a person that knows what they’re saying but not really knowing”. No actual loan was made, he said.
Richards said he never saw any hint of Epstein’s alleged crimes, which he described as “horrible” and “disgusting”.
“I just knew he was rich, and he had some issues with the law years ago,” he said. “To be associated with him is horrible, and I’m not that type of person. I can’t believe I actually was speaking to this horrible person, but you never know people’s life.”
On 30 August 2019, Routch stepped into his supervisor’s office in North Charleston, South Carolina, where he had worked since leaving the US Virgin Islands in 2016. “He respectfully requested to speak in confidence, closed the door, and appeared to be concerned, worried, and a bit shaken, about federal investigators looking into his past,” according to a CBP memo documenting the meeting.
It was just a few weeks since Epstein’s suicide in a New York City jail cell, and Routch had learned that a woman he had previously dated had alerted the FBI that Routch was “a known associate of Jeffery Epstein, had ongoing friendship with Mr. Epstein, and that while working for CBP Pre-Clearance in Saint Thomas for over 7 years, and assisted Mr Epstein for conducting human trafficking of underage females”, the memo states.
Asked how the woman would have known about this, Routch responded: “Everyone knew I was friends with Jeffery Epstein … I have been to his house, been on his boat, and flew in helicopter for whale watching.”
The memo was forwarded to the CBP Watch Commander, and then to an investigator with DHS’s inspector general’s office. The FBI opened a preliminary investigation on the matter on 10 October 2019.
The Guardian has not seen any evidence in the files to support the complainant’s allegation that Routch had direct knowledge or involvement in Epstein’s crimes.
Routch disputes the account of the opening of the investigation provided in the CBP memo. In emails to the Guardian, he claimed that there had never been any report by a woman to the FBI, and that instead his supervisor “fabricated a story to send to the FBI to glorify himself”.
“In the course of my employment I ran into Mr Epstein several times,” he said. “All my encounters were of a business nature … I never [witnessed] anything remotely related to trafficking.
“I have done nothing wrong,” he added.
Routch also told the Charleston Post and Courier this week he did not have a close relationship with Epstein.
In May 2020, federal prosecutors obtained subpoenas for credit checks on Routch.
A July 2020 email memorialized notes from an initial conversation between federal prosecutors and attorneys for Visoski, who was asked about Epstein’s contact with Routch. Visoski did not recall Routch, though he acknowledged having his contact information in his phone, but he named Heil, McNally and Samuel as CBP officers with whom Epstein had some kind of relationship. “Some inspectors would delay JE for a while, whereas McNally and Heil wouldn’t give him a hard time,” the notes state.
Federal prosecutors went on to subpoena credit reports for Heil, McNally and Samuel. There is no indication in the files that they ever investigated Richards or Martinez.
The FBI and federal prosecutors interviewed Visoski about Epstein’s interactions with CBP officers in November 2020. Visoski related Epstein’s practice of making “small talk” with CBP officers during pre-clearance and said he had given “one or two helicopter rides to CBP officers to EPSTEIN’s private island”, according to an FBI memo. Visoski also disclosed that Epstein had asked him to call a CBP officer “approximately 20 times” when he was arriving at STT after the CBP office closed, to ask whether it could remain open to process their plane. The officer “denied their request 80% of the time”, Visoski said.
The memo suggests that investigators were investigating CBP’s potential awareness of Epstein’s criminal activity.
“Sometimes EPSTEIN would be traveling with a female who had a foreign passport,” it states. “EPSTEIN would argue with CBP that this did not pose a CUSTOMS issue and that it was an immigration issue only … Some passengers on EPSTEIN’s plane were college students with a letter from their college stating their purpose for travel. When questioned by CBP, EPSTEIN would intervene and argue about the fact that the plane had not left United States territory. Sometimes a CBP officer would take the passenger into another room to be interviewed … VISOSKI was not aware of any special benefits or gifts given to any CBP officers. VISOSKI had no knowledge of any CBP officer assisting EPSTEIN in trafficking underage passengers.”
Routch was interviewed by the FBI and an agent from the DHS’s inspector general office on 7 April 2021. The memorandum of the interview provides insight into Epstein’s correspondence with individuals so far removed from his normal, elite circles.
Routch disputes much of what is contained in the memo, including the sequence of events that led to the investigation and the number of visits he made to Epstein’s island. He alleged that a CBP officer present during the interview “threaten[ed] me with physical violence” and that he was denied the right to have a union representative present during the interview.
Routch “thought it was a good idea to maintain contact with EPSTEIN because of his status, wealth and influence”, according to the memo. He “overly exaggerated” the relationship to others, showing people that he had Epstein’s contact in his phone, especially after his death. “It was an ego boost … because not everyone can say they know a billionaire,” according to the memo. He had not actually been whale watching on Epstein’s helicopter, though he may have lied about having done so to exaggerate the relationship, according to the memo.
According to the memo, Routch described ingratiating himself with Epstein through “mak[ing] sure he was being treated with fairness and respect by non-white US CBP personnel”, but said he never offered or received any special favors. Routch, who is white, told investigators that there was a “great deal of racial tension” in the Virgin Islands, and that “the ‘blacks’ disrespect the local white population”, prompting his concern for Epstein’s treatment. He said Epstein wanted to buy new computers for the CBP offices, as well as turkeys for CBP staff, but was told by a supervisor that they could not accept gifts.
Routch denied any knowledge or involvement with trafficking underage girls, but said he was aware of Epstein’s criminal conviction and that he assumed that “eastern European women who took commercial flights to the USVI” were heading for Epstein’s island, according to the memo. When he visited the island for lunch in 2013, he claimed to see “three or four ‘nice’, ‘beautiful’ women swimming and having fun” but “did not notice anything unusual nor did he notice anybody who appeared to be in trouble”.
“EPSTEIN always had older ladies with him, maybe in their 20s or 30s,” he said.
According to the memo, Routch visited Little St James a second time in 2014 or 2015 to inspect some trees Epstein had imported for spider mites.
By email, Routch insisted that only one visit occurred. “We had lunch and we discussed trees he was importing,” Routch wrote. Routch suggested that the FBI may have misconstrued a single visit as two; the memo clearly refers to two visits, a few years apart.
Routch “was aware of EPSTEIN’s conviction involving the abuse of minors but supported EPSTEIN because he was a good guy”, according to the memo. He said he had also “heard” that Epstein may have been framed by a secretary.
Ultimately, he told the FBI, he “stood by EPSTEIN as he would any friend, even though he was, in reality, more of an acquaintance”.

Judge declares 4 men once wrongfully accused in brutal 1991 murders innocent
This declaration of ‘actual innocence’ could prove crucial for the men and their families should they seek financial compensation for years spent incarcerated
- Bookmark
Four men wrongfully accused of the brutal 1991 Austin yogurt shop murders have finally been declared innocent by a Texas judge, formally clearing their names over three decades after the horrific killings that haunted the city.
"You are innocent," state District Judge Dayna Blazey affirmed during a poignant hearing in a packed Austin courtroom on Thursday. Her declaration brings a measure of closure to a dark chapter for the men and their families, and for a city deeply shaken by the crime's brutality and investigators' initial inability to solve it. Judge Blazey described her order as "an obligation to the rule of law and the obligation to the dignity of the individual."
The announcement follows cold case detectives revealing last year that they had connected the killings to a suspect who died in a 1999 standoff with police in Missouri.
Two of the four original suspects, Michael Scott and Forrest Welborn, were present in court with family members to hear prosecutors acknowledge their innocence. Robert Springsteen, who was initially convicted and spent several years on death row, did not attend. Maurice Pierce died in 2010 during a confrontation with police after a traffic stop.
"Over 25 years ago, the state prosecuted four innocent men ... (for) one of the worst crimes Austin has ever seen," Travis County First Assistant District Attorney Trudy Strassburger stated at the hearing's opening. "We could not have been more wrong."
This declaration of "actual innocence" could prove crucial for the men and their families should they seek financial compensation for years spent incarcerated or living under a cloud of suspicion.
"My son's name has finally been cleared after more than 25 years of being called the monster, the murderer and everything else," said Phil Scott, Michael Scott's father. "Son, be proud."
The killings shocked Austin and confounded investigators for years. Amy Ayers, 13; Eliza Thomas, 17; and sisters Jennifer and Sarah Harbison, ages 17 and 15, were bound, gagged and shot in the head at the "I Can’t Believe It’s Yogurt" store where two of them worked. The building was subsequently set on fire.
Investigators pursued thousands of leads and several false confessions before the four men, who were teenagers at the time of the girls' deaths, were arrested in late 1999. Springsteen and Scott were convicted largely based on confessions they insisted were coerced by police. Both convictions were overturned in the mid-2000s. Welborn was charged but never tried after two grand juries refused to indict him. Pierce spent three years in jail before charges were dismissed and he was released.
Prosecutors had intended to retry Springsteen and Scott, but a judge ordered the charges dismissed in 2009 when new DNA tests, unavailable in 1991, revealed another male suspect.
"Let us not forgot that Robert Springsteen could be dead right now, executed at the hands of the state of Texas," Springsteen’s attorney Amber Farrelly said at the start of an emotional hearing where several family members spoke of lives ruined by incarceration and years of harassment by investigators.
In a statement read in court, Welborn recounted losing friends, struggling to maintain employment, and experiencing homelessness. Michael Scott testified that his arrest, conviction, and prison sentence ultimately fractured his family. "I lost my family. I lost my youth. My daughter was 3 years old when I was arrested. We had just celebrated our first wedding anniversary. I lost the chance to build a family," Scott said. "Every day I have carried the weight of a crime I did not commit."
Maurice Pierce’s daughter, Marisa Pierce, directed her comments at former police investigators and prosecutors, whom she accused of harassing her father even after his release, tormenting him until the confrontation that led to his death. "Daddy, you have your name back," she declared. "The world knows what you were trying to say all along."
After Scott and Springsteen were released, the case effectively went cold until 2025, when an HBO documentary series attracted new public attention to the unsolved crime. Investigators then made a stunning announcement last September: new DNA science and reviews of old ballistics evidence pointed to Robert Eugene Brashers as the sole killer.
Since 2018, authorities had used advanced DNA evidence to link Brashers to the strangulation death of a South Carolina woman in 1990, the 1997 rape of a 14-year-old girl in Tennessee, and the shooting of a mother and daughter in Missouri in 1998. The crucial link to the Austin case emerged when a DNA sample taken from under Amy Ayers’ fingernail matched Brashers from the 1990 killing.
Austin investigators also discovered that Brashers had been arrested at a border checkpoint near El Paso two days after the yogurt shop killings. In his stolen car was a pistol matching the calibre used to kill one of the girls in Austin. Police noted similarities between the yogurt shop case and Brashers' other crimes: victims were tied up with their own clothing, sexually assaulted, and some crime scenes were set on fire.
Brashers died in 1999 when he shot himself during an hours-long standoff with police at a motel in Kennett, Missouri.

Stephen Colbert and CBS upended Jasmine Crockett’s Senate hopes in Texas. Here’s why influencer Democrats are furious
The congresswoman’s high-profile supporters are seething, writes John Bowden, as her opponent basks in the national limelight — and rakes in donations after Colbert takes their interview to YouTube

The race for a U.S. Senate seat in Texas took a sharp turn this week after CBS and Stephen Colbert gave one Democratic candidate an unintentional boost at precisely the right moment to catch the eye of voters.
Now, his opponent’s supporters are furious and threaten to turn an already acidic race into one reminiscent of the 2016 presidential primary between Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders — and one that could paint a bleak picture for 2028.
Rep. Jasmine Crockett and state Rep. James Talarico were running neck-and-neck for the Democratic nomination at the beginning of the week, with various polls showing the two primary candidates both in the lead at times.
That likely shifted on Monday evening, when late-night host Stephen Colbert dropped a bombshell. His network, Colbert said, was demanding that he not air an interview with Talarico in an effort to appease the Trump administration and the FCC. And Colbert, whose show is widely viewed as having been cancelled come May for the same reason, let both the FCC and Trump himself have it during his monologue.
“Let’s just call this what it is: Donald Trump’s administration wants to silence anyone who says anything bad about Trump on TV, because all Trump does is watch TV,” Colbert said.
The result was utterly predictable. Despite denials issued by CBS (which Colbert literally trashed, on-air), the segment with Talarico’s interview blasted through the walls of political circles and Democratic partisans into the mainstream, racking up millions of views in hours. It currently sits at 7.7m views, a figure which will likely be outdated soon. A separate clipped segment with Colbert explaining the network’s decision trailed closely behind in total viewership.
Talarico’s campaign capitalized on the snub. In two days the state representative’s team pulled in a staggering $2.5m in donations, an amount the campaign would typically raise in a concerted effort over several weeks.
Crockett and her supporters, meanwhile, are clearly unhappy. The congresswoman griped about how the CBS incident “just so happened to play out on the very first day of early voting” during a press conference on Wednesday, and said that her opponent had likely been given a “boost” by the fiasco.
“I think it’s probably better that [Talarico] didn’t get on and that they went straight to streaming,” Crockett added during an interview with Jen Psaki, Joe Biden’s former press secretary, on MSNOW. “Because we know that when we resist and when we know that it seems like they’re trying to change the rules and bend to the knee of or bend the knee to this president, that it backfires in historic fashion.”
“I think it probably gave my opponent the boost he was looking for,” she added.
On X, Instagram and TikTok Crockett’s supporters have responded with fury to news of Talarico’s sudden surge in fundraising and support.
“This seems like a setup to boost Talarico,” wrote one on the left-leaning app BlueSky.
Mike Nellis, a Democratic strategist, suggested the move was planned by Donald Trump’s allies to help Talarico: “They created more attention, and now they’re going to help Talarico win this primary. Just no restraint from these people.”
The controversy is adding another layer to a race that was already becoming toxic after a Crockett-supporting influencer accused Talarico of making a disparaging comment about Colin Allred, a former candidate in the race, who like Crockett is Black. Talarico strongly denied the accusation, but accusations of outright race-baiting and other ugly language has been traded online by individual supporters of the two candidates in response.
One Democratic-aligned political operative in the state lamented how “stupid” the race had become, and blamed the fixation of Democratic-aligned social media influencers for the tone and tenor of the conversation.
“There's eight people, most of whom don't live in Texas, who are fighting on the internet and that is driving [the conversation],” they told The Independent.
Others fear that it could be a sign of things to come, given the newfound importance the Democratic National Committee placed on reaching new media in 2024. That focus on new media has included both the long-form, casual interviewing space of the podcasting sphere as well as conversations with a new generation of political pundit inhabiting the social media space. It’s even caused some self-reflection from some of those content creators themselves.
“I have just been really gut-wrenched at what this primary has become, and it’s not even because of words that are consistently coming out of each candidate’s mouth,” the Texas-based Democratic influencer Olivia Julianna told the Texas Tribune. “We would all do a lot of good if every once in a while we realized social media is not real life.”
A Texas-based Democratic strategist who spoke to The Independent on Thursday argued that, despite their denials, influencers were adding fuel to nasty intra-party disputes because of the age-old financial incentives presented by ultra-partisan media.
“If you look at the incentives of these people, their incentives are to insert themselves into this race. And like, you know, there's a lot of people saying a lot of things on the internet, but like, largely what we're talking about is a fight between eight people, none of whom work for either campaign,” said Luke Warford, founder of the Agave Democratic Infrastructure Fund.
Warford, who said that the whole ordeal put Talarico a few points ahead of his opponent, explained that the party was witnessing the “downside” of embracing newer media, a necessity for remaining relevant for many campaigns in 2026 but also one that presents a new landscape with new rules for engagement.
“The theory was correct that we should work with influencers. I just think people didn't think through the downsides and the risks of that,” he said.
The two candidates will almost certainly face a runoff after voting concludes on March 3. That runoff will be in May, ensuring that the two candidates and their respective sides of the Democratic base have weeks to snipe at eachother in the media before a final vote occurs.
Luckily for Democrats, the Republican side is no friendlier. A messy battle between incumbent Sen. John Cornyn and two primary challengers has been playing out for months, with Cornyn trailing his closest challenger in the polls and routinely trading insults with the Republican who may unseat him, state Attorney General Ken Paxton. In Texas, both parties are now eyeing their respective primaries nervously as they try to determine how much damage the fallout could cause later in 2026 — or beyond.

Austrian climber guilty of manslaughter after leaving girlfriend on Alpine peak

Austria convicts climber over girlfriend’s death on mountain
February 19, 2026An amateur mountaineer in Austria has been found guilty of manslaughter over the death of his girlfriend.
She froze to death near the peak of the Grossglockner mountain, Austria's highest summit, after he left her alone to fetch help.
The court in the Austrian city of Innsbruck gave Thomas P. a five-month suspended sentence on Thursday and fined him €9,400 ($11,100) for gross negligence.
The case is unusual because while climbing accidents are common, prosecutions over them are rare.
Series of mistakes on mountain ended in girlfriend's death
The court heard how the couple had fallen behind in their schedule when climbing the Grossglockner in January 2025.
The woman had become exhausted and was unable to keep going, some 50 meters (54 yards) beneath the summit.
After midnight, Thomas P. left the 33-year-old woman alone to find help, and she froze to death in bad weather just below the 3,798-meter (12,460-foot) summit.
Prosecutors said the man made a series of serious mistakes.
The woman was exposed to strong winds, and he hadn't wrapped her in an emergency blanket or bivouac bag, which she had in her backpack.
When asked why he had failed to do that, he told the court the situation had been particularly stressful.
In a call to mountain police, Thomas P. also didn't make clear that the couple needed rescuing, the court said. He then failed to answer return calls or messages asking if help was needed, police said.
The 37-year-old defendant said his phone had been on airplane mode in order to save battery power.
Liability question: The risk of being a trip leader
During the trial, questions arose about the extent of legal liability in the high mountains and whether climbers generally explore at their own risk.
In this trial, the prosecution argued that the defendant was effectively acting as a mountain guide due to his greater level of experience.
That meant he had a special duty of care.
The presiding judge, Norbert Hofer, who is an experienced mountaineer, said Thomas P. should have realized his girlfriend wouldn't be able to complete the climb well before they ran into difficulty.
"I do not see you as a murderer. I do not see you as cold-hearted," Hofer told the defendant as he read his ruling, accepting that Thomas P. had indeed gone to fetch help.
He added, however, that the defendant was a better mountaineer than his girlfriend by "galaxies", and that she had placed herself in his care.
"What I want to say is that I am so terribly sorry," Thomas P. told the court.
Some 8,400 accidents occur on average each year in the Austrian mountains resulting in around 250 to 300 deaths, according to Austrian Alpine Safety Board.

Deer shooting to be facilitated in England to protect woodlands

It will be much easier to shoot deer in England under government plans that aim to curb the damage the animals are doing to the country’s woodlands.
Emma Reynolds, the environment secretary, plans to bring forward new legislation to give landowners and tenants legal rights to shoot deer to protect crops and property.
Because there are no natural predators in England, deer are able to breed quickly and without any population controls. Four non-native deer species – muntjac, Chinese water deer, fallow and sika – have been introduced into the wild and have thrived. Only two deer species present in England, the red and roe, are native.
Overpopulation of deer causes problems for woodland: they eat leaves, buds and sapling stalks, and strip bark from mature trees, which can affect the trees’ health and make them susceptible to disease. Some deer, particularly the sika, rake their antlers against trees, which can kill younger wood.
The government’s legally binding environment targets require it to regenerate woodland equivalent to a net increase of 43,000 hectares (106,255 acres), which will be difficult if the deer population continues to expand. Government figures show 33% of English woodlands are now in unfavourable condition due to the impact of deer, up from 24% in the early 2000s.
The government has mostly focused on protecting trees with guards and fences rather than tackling the deer population. Now, it is announcing a change of approach. Under the plans, all publicly owned or managed land will have deer management plans within 10 years.
National priority areas – where deer are extremely populous and are having a very detrimental impact on woodland – will be identified, with culls targeted there.
There will also be a change to the grant system that pays landowners to shoot deer. Under the new scheme, landowners can be paid to shoot deer when the animals move out of wooded areas, making it easier to target a problematic population, said Emma Dear, the principal officer for tree establishment at Natural England.
She told the Guardian: “This means we can have timely interventions when ecological damage is likely to be greatest. There is an issue because of the way deer move through the landscape and are not constrained to one patch. The grant system was only facilitated in the woodlands; the new strategy will address that.”
Dear added that the lack of natural predators was driving the rise in the deer population across England. Wolves, bears, lynx and other apex predators were hunted to extinction many years ago. Climate breakdown is also a factor.
“Deer are changing their behaviour because of warmer winters. They can overwinter in better conditions and the number of babies they have is higher when the winter is warmer,” Dear said.
Defra sources said there would be a particular focus on reducing the muntjac population as these were listed as an invasive species, and the agency will assess sika and Chinese water deer to see if these can be added to the invasive species list and urgently targeted. These are the three deer species deemed to be causing the most damage.
The nature minister, Mary Creagh, said: “Our trees and native wildlife are under huge strain from deer damage, including from non-native deer species. This government is helping landowners and farmers manage deer impacts more effectively so woodlands can flourish and crops are better protected. These new measures will also help restore nature, boost our homegrown timber industry and protect the millions of trees we are planting across the country.”
The culled deer may be eaten, with Defra looking at how to market and safely get the meat into the supply chain.
Dear said: “There is a section of the strategy that is looking at venison marketing and supporting that industry. Supporting the wild venison sector will hopefully reduce the cost of management.”

Italy against Russian and Belarusian athletes carrying flags at Paralympics
According to Ukrinform, this was claimed in a joint statement by Italian Foreign Minister Antonio Tajani and Sports Minister Andrea Abodi, ANSA reports.
"The Italian Government expresses its absolute opposition to the International Paralympic Committee's decision to allow six Russian and four Belarusian athletes to participate in the Milano Cortina 2026 Paralympics under their national emblems, including their anthem," the ministers said in a statement.
Tajani and Abodi stressed that “Russia's ongoing violation of the truce and of Olympic and Paralympic ideals, supported by Belarus,” is incompatible with the participation of athletes from these countries in the Games, except when they compete as neutral individual athletes.
As reported by Ukrinform, the International Paralympic Committee (IPC) has announced that six Russian and four Belarusian athletes will be allowed to compete at the 2026 Paralympic Games in Milano Cortina under their national flags.
Ukrainian Minister of Youth and Sports Matvii Bidnyi said on Thursday that the Ukrainian delegation will not attend the Paralympic Games in Milano due to the admission of Russian and Belarusian athletes to the competition.

Watch: Right-wing activists, lawmaker cross into Gaza to push resettlement

Dozens of right-wing activists crossed into the Gaza Strip by vehicle Thursday evening as part of a campaign to renew Jewish settlement in the territory. Among them was lawmaker Limor Son Har-Melech of the far-right Otzma Yehudit party.
IDF reserve forces identified the group after they crossed the border and were working to return them to Israeli territory. The crossing took place at at least two locations in northern Gaza and marked the second such incident this month.
The activists are affiliated with the Nachala settlement movement, which advocates reestablishing Jewish communities in Gaza. In a statement, the group said the entry was part of celebrations marking the Hebrew month of Adar, a festive period on the Jewish calendar leading up to Purim, which commemorates the biblical story of deliverance of the Jewish people as told in the Book of Esther.
“A festive entry today is the first sign ahead of a massive march into Gaza during the Passover holiday,” the group said.
Son Har-Melech said the activists were sending a message about Israel’s future in Gaza.
“In this place, from which the most despicable murderers set out to spread death and destruction, we declare today: Jewish boys and girls will play in the streets of Gaza, thriving cities will rise and life will flourish,” she said. Quoting a verse from the Book of Esther, she added, “The Jews shall rule over their enemies — this is not just a verse in the scroll, it is the reality we are building here on the ground. Gaza will be Jewish, because only this will ensure true victory and security for the people of Israel.”
Children were among those who crossed into Gaza, according to the group.
Nachala said the move was part of an “unbroken sequence of actions” aimed at restoring Jewish settlement in the territory. “While overseas they are launching [U.S. President Donald] Trump’s Board of Peace, here on the ground the message is clear and unequivocal: Gaza is our ancestral inheritance and there will be no foreign rule there,” the movement said.
Tzvi Elimelech Sharbaf, head of the Nachala movement, said the group’s entry into Gaza “with song and dance” was intended as a response to any plans for foreign governance in the territory.
“In the month of Adar, we are reminded that light dispels darkness,” he said. “The Israeli public demands Jewish settlement, which alone is victory, and this entry is the opening shot ahead of the massive march during the upcoming Passover holiday. The people of Israel are returning to Gaza, returning home.”

Epstein files: Former prince Andrew released by police, Trump calls his arrest 'a shame'

British police on Thursday released Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor, former prince and the brother of King Charles III, after having arrested him earlier on suspicion of misconduct in public office.
The nature of the investigation has not been revealed. But Mountbatten-Windsor's arrest came after renewed focus on his past friendship with Jeffrey Epstein, the now-dead notorious sex offender, after the U.S. Department of Justice released millions of documents about Epstein.
Thames Valley Police, who had arrested Mountbatten-Windsor without publicly identifying him, had said they were assessing reports that he had sent Epstein confidential trade reports in 2010, when he was Britain's special envoy for international trade.
Thames Valley Police, in a statement, said, "On Thursday ... we arrested a man in his sixties from Norfolk on suspicion of misconduct in public office."
"The arrested man has now been released under investigation," police said. "We can also confirm that our searches in Norfolk have now concluded. Our searches in Berkshire are still underway."
King Charles, in a statement earlier Thursday following the arrest of his brother, said, "I have learned with the deepest concern the news about Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor and suspicion of misconduct in public office."
"What now follows is the full, fair and proper process by which this issue is investigated in the appropriate manner and by the appropriate authorities," the king said. "Let me state clearly: the law must take its course."
President Donald Trump, speaking to reporters on Air Force One on Thursday, called Mountbatten-Windsor's arrest "a shame."
"I think it's very sad. I think it's so bad for the royal family. It's very, very sad. To me, it's a very sad thing," said Trump, who himself is a former friend of Epstein.
Charles stripped Mountbatten-Windsor of his title of prince in October and forced him out of his home near Windsor Castle because of his ties to Epstein, who killed himself in August 2019 after being arrested on federal child sex trafficking charges filed in New York.
Mountbatten-Windsor has denied any wrongdoing in connection with Epstein, including allegations that he sexually assaulted Virginia Giuffre, a known victim of Epstein, when she was 17 years old.
In February 2022, Mountbatten-Windsor reached a confidential settlement with Giuffre of her lawsuit in New York federal court related to those allegations, without admitting wrongdoing.
But he agreed at the time to what was called "a substantial donation to Ms. Giuffre's charity in support of victims' rights," and in a statement said he regretted his association with Epstein, and commended "the bravery of Ms. Giuffre and other survivors in standing up for themselves and others."
Giuffre died by suicide last April.
Maria Farmer, a victim of Epstein, in a statement Thursday after the arrest of Mountbatten-Windsor, said, "Today is just the beginning of accountability and justice brought forth by Virginia Roberts Giuffre — a young mother who adored her daughter so deeply, she fought the most powerful on earth to protect her. She did this for everyone's daughters."
"Let's now demand all the dominos of power and corruption begin to fall," Farmer said.

MAGA Republican endorses his Democratic wife for public office in Nebraska: ‘Susanne will be my one Democrat exception’
Pete Ricketts and Susanne Shore have been married for 28 years despite their opposing political views
- Bookmark
- CommentsGo to comments
Republican Senator Pete Ricketts, a Trump-aligned lawmaker, endorsed his Democratic wife, Susanne Shore, for a seat on the University of Nebraska Board of Regents, claiming she would be his only liberal vote for the year.
“I usually vote straight Republican, but Susanne will be my one Democrat exception in 2026!” Ricketts said in a statement, obtained by the Nebraska Examiner.
Shore is seeking a seat on the college’s board of regents, which provides policymaking guidance and oversight for public universities and colleges, to help leadership recover from a turbulent year and make higher education accessible for all students.
Ricketts, who served as governor of Nebraska from 2015 until 2023, said Shore has a “deep love” for the state and would be “an outstanding voice” for the university.
Ricketts and Shore, who have been married for 28 years, have opposing political views. They have donated to opposing political parties and endorsed opposing candidates in presidential elections – even while Ricketts was governor. But they have remained a team throughout the divisive political climate in the United States.
“There’s lots of discussion, but it’s always respectful, and we always listen as much as we speak,” Shore told the Nebraska Examiner, adding that Ricketts is “nothing but supportive” of her political ambitions.
Shore is entering a crowded field of at least four other Democrats seeking to take over Elizabeth O’Connor’s seat on the university’s board of regents.
O’Connor stepped down from her seat in January after being charged with a felony for allegedly driving while intoxicated and causing a crash that left one person seriously injured.
O’Connor’s departure arrived shortly before the university’s chancellor of three years, Rodney Bennett, stepped down from his role following a no-confidence vote from faculty. Bennett had been criticized for controversial budget cuts.
Shore said her experience serving as Nebraska’s first lady and working for the University of South Dakota’s Dean of Residential Life gives her insight into college operations.
“I’ll be able to walk in and have legitimacy with anybody that’s in the room with me, a level of trust,” Shore said.
The University of Nebraska’s Board of Regents primary will be held May 12.
While Shore pursues her own political career, Ricketts is also focused on his re-election.
Ricketts was appointed to serve as Nebraska’s senator in 2022 after former Senator Ben Sasse stepped down. Ricketts then ran in the state’s 2024 special election, defeating the Democratic nominee by roughly 25 percentage points.
Trump has endorsed Ricketts in the upcoming midterms.

Trump says 50 million barrels of Venezuelan oil 'floating very nicely' to Houston
'We took 50 million barrels of oil. It's right now floating very nicely and (in) extremely large ships to Houston,' says US president
WASHINGTON
US President Donald Trump said Thursday that 50 million barrels of Venezuelan oil are currently en route to Houston, Texas.
"You've heard about Venezuela, and we're helping them very much with their oil. They got a lot of oil...We took 50 million barrels of oil. It's right now floating very nicely and (in) extremely large ships to Houston," he said at an event in the state of Georgia.
Trump also hailed Venezuela's interim President Delcy Rodriguez.
"The president's doing an excellent job, getting along great," he added.
After months of heightened tensions, the US captured Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro on Jan. 3, which triggered a series of developments, including the swearing-in of Rodriguez, the passage of reforms to the country’s flagship oil law, and the release of some political prisoners.

Climber is convicted over girlfriend’s death near Austria’s highest peak
Sign up now: Get ST's newsletters delivered to your inbox
INNSBRUCK, Austria – An Austrian court late on Feb 19 found a 37-year-old amateur mountaineer guilty of manslaughter over his girlfriend’s death of cold near Austria’s highest summit after he left her to fetch help, local media reported.
The case is unusual because while climbing accidents are common, prosecutions over them are rare, even in situations like this one where various mistakes were made.
The court in the western city of Innsbruck handed the Austrian man a five-month suspended prison sentence and a €9,400 (S$14,000) fine for causing her death in January 2025 by gross negligence, an offence that carries a maximum prison sentence of three years.
The trial has raised questions about the extent of legal liability in the high mountains, an inherently dangerous environment that climbers generally explore at their own risk.
After a day’s climbing in which they fell far behind schedule, the woman was exhausted and unable to go on about 50m below the summit of the Grossglockner mountain on a freezing winter’s night, the court heard.
The defendant, identified as Thomas P., left his girlfriend Kerstin G. exposed to strong winds, without wrapping her in her emergency blanket or bivouac bag for reasons he could not fully explain, to fetch help in a shelter on the other side of the summit. The equipment stayed in her rucksack.
A short call to the mountain police did not trigger a search since the police said he did not make clear they needed rescuing, and he failed to answer calls back or WhatsApp messages asking if they needed help. The defendant said his phone had been in airplane mode to save battery.
“What I want to say is that I am so terribly sorry,” Thomas P., who pleaded not guilty, told the court. REUTERS

Epstein would 'name drop' Trump, Les Wexner says in deposition video

Jeffrey Epstein would "name drop" President Donald Trump as one of the many high-profile people he claimed to know, billionaire retail magnate Leslie Wexner said this week in a congressional deposition about the notorious sex offender.
The 88-year-old Wexner, who was one of Epstein's top clients and benefactors, said Epstein "held [Trump] out as a friend," according to a video of the deposition that House Democrats released Thursday.
But Wexner, the retired founder of Victoria's Secret ex-parent L Brands, said he did not believe Trump and Epstein were actually friends. And he denied seeing or hearing anything about Trump having a sexual relationship with someone introduced to him by Epstein or his convicted accomplice, Ghislaine Maxwell.
He also told lawmakers that both Trump and Epstein would sometimes be at the lingerie company's fashion shows — though he suggested it was a "coincidence" and that he can't recall "something ... that would put them together."
"I remember because Trump would always introduce himself to me, and I always thought it was kind of odd that he was at the fashion show because he had nothing to do with fashion," Wexner said.
The White House did not immediately respond to CNBC's request for comment.
The deposition occurred as the Department of Justice's recent release of millions of additional Epstein-related files raises new questions about the late sex criminal's ties to a growing list of prominent figures.
Video of the nearly five-hour deposition, conducted Wednesday in New Albany, Ohio, where Wexner lives, was shared on the YouTube account for the House Oversight Committee's Republican majority.
Democrats on the Oversight panel, who had traveled to Ohio for the deposition, said that no Republican committee members attended.
They also expressed skepticism about Wexner's insistence that he had virtually no social life with Epstein, and they vowed to continue investigating.
"I do not believe when Mr. Wexner says that he did not have a personal relationship or a friendly relationship" with Epstein, Rep. Robert Garcia, D-Calif., the panel's ranking member, told reporters Wednesday.
Asked if he had a relationship with Trump, Wexner laughed and said he did not. Despite their occasional exchanges at the fashion shows, "we didn't know each other," Wexner said. "I'd be shocked if he remembered me."
Trump has never discussed Epstein with Wexner, he said.
But when asked if Epstein ever discussed Trump with him, Wexner paused and then said, "I would describe it — he would name drop it."
"So he would say things like, 'I know [former President Bill] Clinton or I know the Pope or I know God... It was that kind of name dropping, but never, I can't remember [a] specific place, but Jeffrey dropped a lot of names."
Asked to clarify that Epstein specifically referenced Trump, Wexner seemed to backtrack. "No, I'm saying it could have and I don't remember," he said.
Wexner also said Epstein never shared any information with him about Trump's sexual activities.
The comments revealed from the deposition video align with the prepared statement Wexner gave the committee, in which he claimed he was "duped" and "conned" by Epstein but was uninvolved with, and ignorant of, any of his criminal activities.
Wexner in the deposition also denied ever meeting prominent Epstein accuser Virginia Giuffre in Epstein's presence. Giuffre has claimed that Wexner sexually abused her.
Wexner, in his prepared statement, said he has never been unfaithful to his wife in 33 years of marriage.

Vologda’s governor said his people were ‘dying out.’ In one year, he cut abortions by 82 percent, sending women fleeing to neighboring regions for a procedure that remains legal in Russia.

Vologda’s governor said his people were ‘dying out.’ In one year, he cut abortions by 82 percent, sending women fleeing to neighboring regions for a procedure that remains legal in Russia.
Abortion remains legal in Russia, but access to the procedure has become almost impossible for women in at least one region: Vologda. Governor Georgy Filimonov treats this fact as his administration’s crowning achievement — a feat he has managed through financial incentives, administrative pressure, and deliberate obstruction. The numbers tell the story: Abortions in the region fell 81.6 percent last year. The independent outlet Glasnaya Media documented the crackdown in a recent report. Meduza reviews Glasnaya’s findings.
You’re currently reading Meduza, the world’s largest independent Russian news outlet. Every day, we bring you essential coverage from Russia and beyond. Explore our reporting here and follow us wherever you get your news.
Shutting down access
Although abortion remains legal under Russian federal law — and medical facilities are required by the Health Ministry to provide it — women in Vologda now find themselves turned away from clinics, redirected across regional lines, and subjected to coercive counseling. When a Glasnaya correspondent called private clinics across the region’s capital city to schedule an abortion, every office refused. “Our clinic does not provide that service. Management’s orders,” a receptionist at one clinic told her, refusing to suggest alternatives.
The obstacles extend to public hospitals. In the spring of 2025, Anna, 39, a mother of four whose eldest son has a child of his own, sought an abortion after an unplanned pregnancy. Armed with the required test results, a psychologist’s note, and a referral from her gynecologist, Anna arrived at the Vologda city maternity hospital, only to be shown the door. A nurse “rudely” told her nothing would be done for her, and a second psychologist showed her “models of embryos,” telling her she would be “murdering a full-fledged child.” The psychologist also urged Anna to have the baby and put it up for adoption. The hospital cited “a verbal order from the regional health ministry banning abortions in the Vologda region, as well as moral and religious considerations.”
In the end, Anna traveled to the neighboring Yaroslavl region for the procedure.
Afterward, she filed a complaint with the prosecutor’s office, and the maternity hospital’s acting head was convicted of violating the facility’s licensing requirements and fined 15,000 rubles (about $200) — the minimum penalty allowed under civil statutes.
Filimonov’s population preoccupation
Georgy Filimonov, who took office in September 2024, has made demographic alarmism the centerpiece of his tenure. He has repeatedly declared that Vologda — which he calls “the most [ethnic] Russian region of Russia” — is “dying out,” citing a 3.4-percent population decline, well above the national average of 0.4 percent. He has framed restricting abortion as a frontline response to demographic collapse.
Vologda’s governor has been explicit about the financial machinery driving his campaign. As compensation for “lost abortion revenue,” the regional government paid private clinics 1 million rubles ($13,000) each to stop performing the procedure, earmarking the money for “equipment and furniture upgrades.” Doctors who talk a patient out of an abortion receive 5,000 rubles ($65); if that patient carries the pregnancy to term, the bonus rises to 25,000 rubles ($325). The results have been dramatic: Abortions in the region fell from 1,679 in 2024 to 309 in 2025 — a decline of 81.6 percent.
The legal framework for the de facto ban is a regional law that prohibits “inducing” a woman to have an abortion. The law does not ban the procedure itself, but its deliberately vague definition of “inducement” has created a climate of legal uncertainty that discourages physicians from so much as mentioning abortion as an option. “Frightened doctors simply stall for time,” State Duma deputy Alexey Kanaev, one of the region’s few vocal critics of the abortion crackdown, wrote in May 2025:
Unnecessary referrals to the regional center pile up. Equipment mysteriously “breaks down,” and the next available appointment is always “a week or two away.” Tricks and manipulations, in other words. Does any of this address the demographic crisis? No.
On social media, Kanaev has savaged Filimonov’s abortion policies, stressing that the procedure remains legal under federal law and guaranteed by Health Ministry regulations. “No region and no official has the right to violate federal legislation,” Kanaev wrote in February 2025.
Beyond abortion
Vologda’s assault on women’s reproductive rights extends to birth control. Pharmacies throughout the region are reportedly refusing to dispense emergency contraception such as Postinor — which requires no prescription under Russian law — particularly to younger women. Mifepristone-based medications used for medical abortions have vanished from shelves after authorities added them to a controlled-substances list.
Meanwhile, Filimonov has pursued what critics are calling a “birthrate import” strategy, offering payments of up to 300,000 rubles (almost $4,000) for children registered in the Vologda region, regardless of where the mother lives — a practice he describes as encouraging “obstetric tourism.” New billboards in the region’s capital urge men to “invest in the eternal” and to spend their evenings “loving their wives.” Local media report that residents are underwhelmed, mocking the signs as “idiotic” and asking what, exactly, “loving your wife” is supposed to mean.

Trump says Obama ‘made big mistake’ with alien revelation
- Donald Trump accused Barack Obama of improperly disclosing classified information by suggesting aliens are real, an allegation made without supporting evidence.
- Obama's initial comments on a podcast stated, “They're real, but I haven't seen them,” and denied any hidden facilities like Area 51.
- Obama later clarified on Instagram that his belief in extraterrestrial life is based on statistical probability in a vast universe, not classified information, and he saw no evidence of contact during his presidency.
- "He took it out of classified information ... He’s not supposed to be doing that," Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One while traveling to Georgia. "He made a big mistake."
- Pentagon reports from 2022 and 2024 have found no evidence of alien visits, crash landings, or extraterrestrial technology, attributing most sightings to misidentified ordinary objects.

Cuban families receive 'Made in Mexico' essentials as crisis worsens
Mexico is sending major food aid to Cuba as the island struggles with fuel shortages and widespread blackouts
- Bookmark
Guillermo Beltrán walked away with two heavy bags on Thursday, each containing an essential haul — rice, beans, amaranth and crackers — complemented by a bottle of oil, large cans of sardines and canned peaches. Every label carried the same simple phrase “Made in Mexico.”
Beltrán, a 70-year-old Cuban father of two, was one of several hundred recipients of Mexican humanitarian assistance, ordered by President Claudia Sheinbaum in support of the island nation as it faces blackouts and severe fuel shortages worsened by a U.S oil embargo.
“I feel very grateful,” said Beltrán. “The Mexican president should be praised to the skies for showing such concern and courage.”
Two Mexican Navy ships laden with humanitarian aid docked in Cuba last week, two weeks after U.S. President Donald Trump threatened to impose tariffs on countries that sell oil to the island, deepening an already severe economic and energy crisis in the Caribbean nation.
The ships brought about 800 tons of goods, and another 1,500 tons of powdered milk and beans are expected to be loaded in the coming days.
The Cuban government said the aid will support vulnerable families with underweight children or elderly members in Havana and the provinces of Mayabeque and Artemisa. Earlier this week, state television aired footage of the supplies arriving at bodegas — the state-run shops that distribute basic goods to citizens through a national ration book system.
The bags received by Beltrán were taken directly to his home by the manager of his neighborhood bodega in Havana.
“People are very grateful for these donations,” Roberto Román, the 28-year-old manager, told The Associated Press. He is responsible for 1,780 customers, distributed among 850 families.
The economic crisis gripping Cuba since 2020 has been compounded by intensified U.S. sanctions aimed at forcing a change in the island’s political model. These pressures led to critical shortages and severe blackouts that peaked in early 2026.
Cuba relied heavily on oil shipments from Venezuela that were halted when the U.S. attacked the South American country in early January and arrested its leader.
Because Cuba produces only 40% of its required fuel, it remains highly vulnerable to external blockades. While strong allies like Russia and China have condemned the U.S. measures, their support has remained largely symbolic thus far.

King Charles’ brother Andrew released by police
King Charles’ younger brother, Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor, was released from police custody on the evening of Feb 19 after being arrested on suspicion of misconduct in public office over allegations he sent confidential government documents to Jeffrey Epstein.
Mr Mountbatten-Windsor, who turned 66 on Feb 19, had been questioned all day by detectives from Thames Valley Police.
Earlier this month, the police force said it was looking into allegations that he had passed documents to the late convicted sex offender while working as a trade envoy.
The arrest of the senior royal, eighth in line to the throne, is unprecedented in modern times.
Trump appears to give Iran 10-15 days to make deal
President Donald Trump warned Iran on Feb 19 that it must make a deal over its nuclear programme or “really bad things” will happen, and appeared to set a deadline of no more than 10 to 15 days before the US might take action.
Amid a massive US military buildup in the Middle East that has fuelled fears of a wider war, Mr Trump said negotiations with Iran to end the tense standoff were going well but insisted Tehran has to reach a “meaningful” agreement.
“Otherwise bad things happen,” Mr Trump, who has repeatedly threatened to attack Iran, told the first meeting of his Board of Peace in Washington.
Trump hosts inaugural meeting of Board of Peace
US President Donald Trump told the first meeting of his Board of Peace on Feb 19 that US$7 billion (S$8.8 billion) has been contributed to a Gaza reconstruction fund that aims to rebuild the enclave once Hamas disarms, an objective that is far from becoming a reality.
The disarmament of Hamas militants and accompanying withdrawal of Israeli troops, the size of the reconstruction fund and the flow of humanitarian aid to the war-battered populace of Gaza are among the major questions likely to test the effectiveness of the board in the weeks and months ahead.
In a flurry of announcements at the end of a long, winding speech, Mr Trump said the United States will make a contribution of US$10 billion to the Board of Peace. He said contributing nations had raised US$7 billion as an initial down payment for Gaza reconstruction.
US state sues Apple over iCloud child sex abuse images
The US state of West Virginia on Feb 19 said it is suing Apple over child sex abuse material people tuck away in its iCloud online storage service.
The suit filed by Attorney-General John Bohen McCuskey in a state court accuses the iPhone maker of letting iCloud be used to store and distribute such content, often referred to as child pornography.
Apple has been under pressure from some child safety advocates due to a decision several years ago not to jeopardise user privacy and security by allowing scanning of data stored in iCloud.
US threatens to leave IEA if net zero focus remains
The United States stepped up pressure on the International Energy Agency on Feb 19 to drop net zero from its agenda, giving it a year to do so or risk Washington exiting the organisation.
Speaking on the last day of an IEA ministerial meeting in Paris, US Energy Secretary Chris Wright said the 52-year-old agency should return to its founding mission of ensuring energy security.
The Paris-based IEA was created to coordinate responses to major disruptions of supplies after the 1973 oil crisis, but it has broadened its focus to include renewable energy and net zero goals under executive director Fatih Birol.

FIFA president announces 'true partnership' with Board of Peace for Gaza
Gianni Infantino says soccer can help 'rebuild and build people, emotion, hope and trust'
HAMILTON, Canada
FIFA President Gianni Infantino announced a "true partnership" between the world soccer governing body and the Board of Peace on Thursday, outlining plans for major soccer infrastructure projects in the Gaza Strip aimed at rebuilding communities through sport.
Describing soccer as a unifying global force, Infantino at the inaugural Board of Peace meeting in Washington, DC said: "First point: football, or soccer as it's called here, is the world's universal language. It is spoken by 6 billion people, 6 billion fans who have the same feelings."
"It's about hope, it's about joy, it's about happiness. It's about coming together, and it's about uniting the world. We'll unite the world here this summer during the World Cup," he added.
Stressing that peace is essential to achieving that unity, Infantino announced "a true partnership between the Board of Peace and FIFA."
"And I'm very proud and very happy to announce this," he added, saying that after hearing presentations at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, "we need to help. We need to do something."
Noting that FIFA's contribution would focus not only on physical infrastructure in the Strip, he said: “We also have to rebuild and build people, emotion, hope and trust. And this is what football, my sport, is about."
Infantino also presented a promotional video at the meeting detailing the scope of the initiative.
"Through the partnership, a complete football ecosystem" will be created in Gaza, the video explained, saying that it will include the construction of football pitches, FIFA arenas, academies and a national stadium.
It announced that the plan includes 50 FIFA Arena mini-pitches at an estimated cost of $50,000 per unit, representing a $2.5 million investment. Five full-size pitches will be built in five different districts at around $1 million per pitch.
The initiative also envisions a FIFA Academy with an estimated investment of $15 million and a national stadium for 20,000 to 25,000 spectators valued at around $50 million.

ECB fines JPMorgan $14.3M over miscalculated assets

ISTANBUL
The European Central Bank has imposed two administrative penalties totaling €12.18 million ($14.34 million) on JPMorgan for reporting wrongly calculated risk-weighted assets.
The bank reported lower risk-weighted assets than required between 2019 and 2024, the ECB stated on Thursday.
This occurred because the bank misclassified corporate exposures for 15 consecutive quarters and applied a lower risk-weight for credit risk to them than banking rules prescribe.
JPMorgan also unduly excluded certain transactions for 21 consecutive quarters when calculating risk-weighted assets for its credit valuation adjustment risk.
The central bank classified the credit risk breach as "severe" and the credit valuation adjustment risk breach as "moderately severe" due to the bank committing both with serious negligence driven by evident deficiencies in its internal processes.
The bank reported wrongly calculated figures to the European Central Bank, which prevented the authority from having a comprehensive view of its risk profile.
Capital ratios are key indicators of a bank's capital strength and its ability to absorb losses, and as a result of underestimating its risk-weighted assets, JPMorgan reported higher capital ratios than it should have done.
The bank has the right to challenge the decision before the Court of Justice of the European Union.

Former Biden official says US must work with allies to counter China
Kurt Campbell warns Trump’s strategy risks weakening Washington leverage as policy machinery erodes and Beijing sharpens its approach
Working closely with like-minded countries remains the most effective strategy to counter an increasingly powerful China – in marked contrast to the policies of US President Donald Trump – said a former senior US official, while admitting that the Joe Biden administration made some key mistakes that undercut its own effectiveness.
Campbell, now chairman of the Asia Group consultancy, said Trump’s approach to China has inherent contradictions. At times he seems keen to craft an entirely new US-China relationship built on business deals that benefit “him and the United States”. At other times he seems to want a pause to build US reserves of critical minerals and bolster the US military.
“In many respects, this ambiguity is designed not just to keep China off balance, but frankly, to keep elements in American society guessing what President Trump’s ultimate outcomes and desires are,” he said at an event sponsored by Foreign Policy magazine.
Strategic ambiguity – the idea that Washington will not say whether it will defend Taiwan if the mainland launches an attack – has been a cornerstone of US policy.

Mexico and El Salvador make big cocaine seizures at sea as US continues lethal strikes
El Salvador and Mexico have reported major cocaine seizures at sea this week, as U.S. strikes on suspected drug boats leave 11 people dead
- Bookmark
The navies of El Salvador and Mexico announced drug seizures in the Pacific Ocean this week of more than 10 tonnes of cocaine, in contrast to deadly strikes by the U.S. government that just this week left 11 people dead on three boats suspected of carrying drugs in Latin American waters.
The latest announcement came Thursday, when Mexico said it had seized nearly four tonnes of suspected drugs and detained three people from a semisubmersible craft, 250 nautical miles (463 kilometers) south of the port of Manzanillo.
Mexican Security Secretary Omar García Harfuch said via X that the seizure from the sleek, low-riding boat with three visible motors brought the weekly total to nearly 10 tonnes, but he did not provide detail on the other seizures.
Mexican authorities said the seizure was made with intelligence shared U.S. Northern Command and the U.S. Joint Interagency Task Force South.
On Sunday, El Salvador’s navy announced the largest drug seizure in the country’s history of 6.6 tonnes of cocaine. The navy had intercepted a 180-foot boat registered to Tanzania, 380 miles (611 kilometers) southwest of the coast. Navy divers found 330 packages of cocaine hidden in the boat’s ballast tanks. Ten men were arrested from Colombia, Nicaragua, Panama and Ecuador.
On Thursday, Salvadoran authorities gave access to the seized ship FMS Eagle, which had just arrived in the port of La Union. More than 200 wrapped bundles were lined up on the deck.
The Trump administration has pressured Mexico to make more drug seizures over the past year. The trafficking of drugs like fentanyl was the president’s justification for tariffs on Mexican imports.
Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum has responded with a more aggressive stance toward drug cartels than her predecessor, that has included sending dozens of drug trafficking prisoners to the United States for prosecution.
Sheinbaum has also expressed her disagreement with strikes by the U.S. military in the Caribbean Sea and Pacific Ocean against boats suspected of carrying drugs.
At least 145 people have been killed in those strikes since the U.S. government began targeting those it calls “narcoterrorists” last September.
The U.S. strikes this week included two vessels carrying four people each in the eastern Pacific Ocean and another boat in the Caribbean carrying three people. The administration provided images of the boats being destroyed, but not evidence they were carrying drugs.

The US stock market saw a negative trend amid rising tensions between the US and Iran and a decline in alternative asset managers' shares.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell by 0.54%, or 267.5 points, to close at 49,395.16.
The Nasdaq dropped 0.31%, or 70.91 points, to 22,682.73, while the S&P 500 declined 0.28%, or 19.42 points, to 6,861.89.
The Volatility Index (VIX), also known as the "fear index," rose by 3.11% to 20.23 points.
On the geopolitical front, as news flow regarding increasing tensions between the US and Iran was monitored, US President Donald Trump said: “It’s proven to be, over the years, not easy to make a meaningful deal with Iran, and we have to make a meaningful deal.
"Otherwise bad things happen."
Investors remained cautious due to tensions between the US and Iran, while oil prices continued to rise.
Brent and West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil prices increased by more than 2% during the day.
Meanwhile, shares of other companies fell after alternative asset management firm Blue Owl Capital restricted withdrawals from one of its funds and decided to sell $1.4 billion worth of assets from three of its funds.
Blue Owl Capital's shares fell 5.9%, while shares of companies such as Blackstone and Apollo Global Management lost 5.4% and 5.2%, respectively.
In addition, as investors assessed the financial results of US retail giant Walmart, the company's revenue and profit for the three-month period exceeded expectations, but its profit forecast for the current fiscal year fell short of expectations; Walmart's shares lost 1.4% in value.
On the macroeconomic data front, the number of people filing for unemployment benefits for the first time in the US fell by 23,000 from the previous week to 206,000 in the week ending February 14, falling below market expectations.
The US trade deficit rose 32.6% from the previous month to $70.3 billion in the last month of last year, reaching its highest level since July.

West Virginia sues Apple over child sex abuse material stored and shared on iCloud
Unknown

West Virginia’s attorney general filed a lawsuit on Thursday accusing Apple of allowing its iCloud service to become a vehicle for distributing child sexual abuse material.
The state alleges that the company facilitated the spread of child sexual abuse material by declining to deploy tools that scan photos and videos and detect such material in iCloud users’ collections.
JB McCuskey, a Republican, accused Apple of prioritizing user privacy over child safety. His office called the case the first of its kind by a government agency over the distribution of child sexual abuse material on Apple’s data storage platform.
“These images are a permanent record of a child’s trauma, and that child is revictimized every time the material is shared or viewed,” McCuskey said in the statement. “This conduct is despicable, and Apple’s inaction is inexcusable.”
Apple responded with a blanket denial to the allegations: “At Apple, protecting the safety and privacy of our users, especially children, is central to what we do. We are innovating every day to combat ever-evolving threats and maintain the safest, most trusted platform for kids.” The company emphasized its controls that prevent children from uploading or receiving nude images, though West Virginia’s lawsuit aims at abusers’ use of Apple devices and services.
In 2020, an executive in charge of fraud detection at Apple texted a colleague: “We are the greatest platform for distributing child porn.” The exchange was made public during the trial between Apple and Fortnite maker Epic Games.
A group of victims of child sexual exploitation sued Apple in 2024, making similar allegations, for $1.2bn in damages. The suit is ongoing. The same year, the UK’s National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children (NSPCC) accused Apple of vastly undercounting how often child sexual abuse material appeared in its products. In a year, child predators used Apple’s iCloud, iMessage and FaceTime to store and exchange CSAM in a higher number of cases in England and Wales alone than the company reported across all other countries combined, according to police data obtained by the NSPCC. Apple did not comment on the finding at the time.
Apple routinely makes far fewer reports of CSAM to the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children (NCMEC) than Google or Meta, according to data published by NCMEC.
The company has considered scanning images saved in private iCloud accounts but abandoned the approach after concerns about user privacy and safety, including worries that it could be exploited by governments looking for other material for censorship or arrest.
McCuskey’s office filed the lawsuit in Mason county circuit court. The lawsuit seeks statutory and punitive damages and asks to have a judge force Apple to implement more effective measures to detect abusive material and implement safer product designs.
Alphabet’s Google, Microsoft and other platform providers check uploaded photos or emailed attachments against a database of identifiers of known child sex abuse material provided by the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children and other clearinghouses.
Until 2022, Apple took a different approach. It did not scan all files uploaded to its iCloud storage offerings, and the data was not end-to-end encrypted, meaning law enforcement officials could access it with a warrant.
Reuters in 2020 reported that Apple planned end-to-end encryption for iCloud, which would have put data into a form unusable by law enforcement officials. It abandoned the plan after the FBI complained it would harm investigations.
In August 2021, Apple announced NeuralHash, which it designed to balance the detection of child abuse material with privacy by scanning images on users’ devices before upload.
The system was criticized by security researchers who worried it could yield false reports of abuse material, and it sparked a backlash from privacy advocates who claimed it could be expanded to permit government surveillance.
A month later, Apple delayed the introduction of NeuralHash before canceling it in December 2022, the state said in its statement. That same month, Apple launched an option for end-to-end encryption for iCloud data.
The state said NeuralHash was inferior to other tools and could be easily evaded. It said Apple stores and synchronizes data through iCloud without proactive abuse material detection, allowing such images to circulate.
While Apple did not go through with the effort to scan images being uploaded to iCloud, it did implement a feature called Communication Safety that blurs nudity and other sensitive content being sent to or from a child’s device.
Federal law requires US-based technology companies to report abuse material to the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children. Apple in 2023 made 267 reports, compared with 1.47m by Google and 30.6m by Meta Platforms, the state said.
The state’s claims mirror allegations in a proposed class-action lawsuit filed against Apple in late 2024 in federal court in California by individuals depicted in such images.
Apple has moved to dismiss that lawsuit, saying the firm is shielded from liability under section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, a law that provides broad protections to internet companies from lawsuits over content generated by users.

- Lord Sugar dismissed Hamedi after holding her responsible for her team's poor branding decisions during a task to create and market a bottled water brand.
- As the sub-team leader for the branding element, Hamedi's team failed to impress, leading to her exit from the BBC business show.
- Hamedi expressed disappointment, stating she felt her time was "cut short" and that other team members, particularly team leader Conor Galvin, lacked accountability.
- She suggested Galvin should have been fired instead, believing he "threw her under the bus" and she was an "easy scapegoat".

Bangarra Dance Theatre wins international award for creating 'radical change'

Bangarra Dance Theatre wins Golden Lion at international dance festival Venice Danza 2026
Bangarra Dance Theatre, Australia's leading Indigenous dance company, has won the prestigious international award, the Golden Lion, at the Venice Biennale.
The prize for lifetime achievement in dance, first awarded in 1995, will be presented during the international festival of contemporary dance, Venice Danza, which kicks off in July.
Mirning choreographer Frances Rings, the artistic director of Bangarra, has described the win as a "validation of the important role of Bangarra in bringing First Nations stories to the stage and the responsibility that we carry".
"It's quite emotional because Bangarra doesn't do what it does to receive awards," she told ABC Arts.
"The reward for us is the validation from our communities and from our Elders, and when we see our audiences' perceptions change and shift and they become our allies and support First Nations people."
The company's win follows Back to Back Theatre, a disability-led theatre group from Geelong, taking home the Golden Lion at Venice's international theatre festival in 2024.
In the same year, Bigambul and Kamilaroi artist Archie Moore won the Golden Lion at the Venice Art Biennale.
The win at the Venice Biennale makes Bangarra the first company and first First Nations performers to receive the award since it was first presented.
Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander readers are advised that this article contains names of people who have died.
Award-winning British choreographer Wayne McGregor, the outgoing director of Venice Danza, described Bangarra in a statement as a company that has "caused a seismic shift in our understanding of dance and the cultural context in which it is performed".
"Their integrity, passion, commitment and power have often driven radical change, frequently overcoming great challenge and resistance," he said.
Previous recipients of the Golden Lion for dance include late American dancer Merce Cunningham, German choreographer Pina Bausch and American choreographer William Forsythe.
'We still have work to do'
Bangarra — whose name means "to make fire" in Wiradjuri language — was established in 1989 by the late Gumbaynggirr dancer and Vietnam veteran Rob Bryant, African American dancer Carole Y Johnson and South African dancer Cheryl Stone.
Johnson was also a co-founder of the National Aboriginal and Islander Skills Association (NAISDA) dance school.
In 1991, Stephen Page, a Nunukul/Ngugi man of the Quandamooka peoples and a Munaldjali man of the Yugambeh nation, became artistic director, running the company until 2022.
"We've been using our platform to share our stories and working with communities for over 37 years now," Rings said.
"But we still have a lot of work to do, because our stories are out of sight — they're in communities, in the memories of our Elders, to be unearthed still, and in the untold shadow of our nation's history.
"Our role as truth-tellers is to give a platform and voice to those stories and create a better understanding and awareness so that we get constructive change that benefits our people and communities."
Bangarra is best known for its performance of Bennelong in 2017 and Dark Emu in 2018, a dance adaptation of Bruce Pascoe's book. It has toured the world, including London, Paris, New York and Tokyo.
Its process for making work is culturally embedded, with choreographers and other creatives often visiting Indigenous communities multiple times to better understand their stories.
"Terrain's really a timeless work because Country's always going to be a priority for Indigenous people. It's always going to be the cornerstone of our existence," Rings told ABC Arts in 2022.
Taking Bangarra global
At Venice Danza in July, Bangarra is set to perform Terrain, choreographed by Rings in 2012, which examines the impact of colonisation on the natural environment, and the important role that Indigenous peoples and knowledges play in caring for Country.
Rings is proud to share Terrain with an international audience, working with Bangarra's company of dancers to bring it to life.
"It's a whole new generation of dancers that will be performing this so they inherit this role from the previous dancers," she said.
"It is a homage to Country and First Nations peoples' relationship to Country, what it means to wear Country as a second skin, and how to give insight into that relationship of Country to audiences and to our broader society.
"The messages in that work are still relevant today and more important than ever."
The company will premiere its next show Flora with Australian Ballet in Melbourne in March, before touring Sydney, with the show Sheltering also visiting Brisbane and Canberra from May.
In Flora, 35 dancers, alongside Kalkangu musician William Barton and Meriam Samsep designer Grace Lillian Lee, will bring to life the evolution of Australian plants and demonstrate the resilience of Indigenous peoples.
Sheltering brings together three Bangarra works. Two were born from the company's emerging artist festival Dance Clan: Grounded by Indjalandji-Dhidhanu and Alyewarre woman Glory Tuohy-Daniell; and the dance movie Brown Boys by Gamilaroi and Tongan man Daniel Mateo and Cass Mortimer. The final work on the bill is Sheoak by Rings, which premiered in 2015.

Is social media addictive?
Meta is accused of harming young users with its addictive features.
Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg has appeared in a Los Angeles court to answer questions about accusations of harm that his company causes to young users.
The landmark trial is looking into the addictive aspects of the use of social media.
It’s part of a big wave of growing anger against tech platforms, which are said to contribute to addictive behaviour.
As a response, some countries have already started restricting access to youngsters.
Others have gone as far as banning their use for children younger than 16.
But can a court case change things?
And what role should families play in controlling their kids’ excessive use of social media?

Gaza deaths in war’s first 15 months higher than reported, study says
Sign up now: Get ST's newsletters delivered to your inbox
JERUSALEM – More than 75,000 Palestinians were killed in the first 15 months of Israel’s military assault
The peer-reviewed study, published on Feb 18, found that women, children and the elderly comprised some 56.2 per cent of violent deaths in Gaza during that period, a composition that it said roughly aligned with reporting by Gaza’s Health Ministry.
The field work was conducted by the Palestinian Center for Policy and Survey Research, run by Palestinian pollster Khalil Shikaki, who has carried out public opinion polling in the West Bank and Gaza for decades. The lead author is Professor Michael Spagat, who teaches at Royal Holloway, University of London.
The study is the first independent population survey of mortality in the Gaza Strip, said its authors, whose research involved surveying 2,000 Palestinian households over seven days starting on Dec 30, 2024.
“The combined evidence suggests that, as at Jan 5, 2025, 3 to 4 per cent of the population of the Gaza Strip had been killed violently and there have been a substantial number of non-violent deaths caused indirectly by the conflict,” the authors wrote.
UN has long deemed ministry figures to be reliable
The Gaza death toll has been bitterly disputed since Israel’s assault began after the Hamas-led Oct 7, 2023, attack on southern Israel.
Israel has questioned those tallies, citing Hamas control of the ministry, though a senior military officer told Israeli media in January that its figures were broadly accurate – a view the army later said did not reflect official data.
Lancet researchers said their analysis contradicts claims of inflation and suggests the ministry numbers are, if anything, conservative under extreme conditions.
Mortality calculation based on face-to-face interviews
Researchers who published a statistical analysis in 2025 for The Lancet, its flagship journal, found the Health Ministry likely undercounted deaths by about 40 per cent during the first nine months of the war. The new research published on Feb 18 appears to suggest an undercount by a similar margin.
Field staff, mostly female and experienced in surveying, conducted face-to-face interviews with Palestinians from households across Gaza’s different districts, the authors wrote. The questionnaire, reviewed by Reuters, asks respondents to list individuals in their immediate household who were killed.
“We calculated mortality estimates as weighted sums. Each individual in the sample received a weight representing the number of people in the Gaza Strip they represent,” the authors wrote.
The authors wrote that the survey was the first on Gaza mortality that did not rely on administrative records from the Health Ministry. They said their results on violent deaths had a 95 per cent confidence interval, a value that indicates how accurately a pollster has captured a data point.
There were an estimated 16,300 non-violent deaths during the first 15 months of the war, caused by disease, pre-existing conditions, accidents or other causes not directly related to combat, the authors wrote. These are separate from the 75,200 violent deaths estimated during that period.
Hamas-led militants killed more than 1,200 people and took over 250 hostages during their 2023 attack on southern Israel, according to Israeli tallies. The hostages and the remains of those killed in captivity were released during ceasefires.
Hamas has confirmed the deaths of military leaders in fighting with Israel but has rarely disclosed fatalities among its fighters. REUTERS

Nearly one year after masked federal agents grabbed her off the street, Tufts University scholar Rumeysa Ozturk is officially a doctor.
Ozturk, who is studying media use among children and young people, has earned her PhD from the university’s Department of Child Study and Human Development.
“My studies, research and professional work focus on how positive media use among children and young people can nurture more kindness and compassion in the world,” she wrote Wednesday on LinkedIn.
“Despite the very brutal, illegal and unjustifiable experiences I faced over the last year, I remain hopeful that our world can become a gentler and more peaceful place,” she added.
Last month, an immigration court judge terminated deportation proceedings against Ozturk, whose arrest last March by masked agents near her home in Massachusetts is among the defining images of the Trump administration’s deportation efforts targeting international students who spoke out against Israel’s war in Gaza.
Homeland Security failed to prove that the Turkish scholar needed to be deported, and an immigration court judge terminated the case, effectively ending the government’s threat of removal while she continues to challenge the constitutionality of her arrest and weeks-long detention in Louisiana.
Last year, Trump administration officials publicly accused Ozturk of engaging in activities “in support of Hamas,” but internal documents from State Department officials admitted they did not possess any evidence.
Ozturk had co-authored an op-ed in a student newspaper that criticized university leaders for dismissing students’ concerns about the war. Administration officials — relying on a pro-Israel activist group that created an online directory of student activists — canceled her student visa and signed a warrant for her arrest in response.
She was held inside an ICE detention center in Louisiana, more than 1,000 miles away, for more than six weeks.
Last year, while testifying in an orange prison jumpsuit and taupe hijab, Ozturk said it was “impossible” to pursue her academic work while in ICE detention.
“The work I do is very meaningful,” she said.
She hoped her work can “contribute to the well-being and development of children all around the world,” she said.
Ozturk, whose faculty adviser testified to her intimate connections within her department and the broader Tufts community, also described how she organized support for academics who work with children in areas of global conflict, “from Gaza to Israel, from Russia to Ukraine, from Sudan to Yemen, from Cameroon to Afghanistan.”
“All of them are ours – [children] experiencing armed conflict around the world,” said Ozturk, who was clutching her heart.
Her adviser Sara K. Johnson described Ozturk as an “expert” whose “expertise is absolutely critical” in fields of study connected to social media use and impacts to child development.
“From our children kept in federal detention centers in inhumane conditions, to our children in Gaza facing a genocide, from our children of war everywhere from Ukraine to Sudan, to our BIPOC children facing racial injustices daily and our refugee children whose childhoods are stolen, the oppression is connected and global, and so our compassion must be equally universal,” Ozturk wrote Wednesday.
“In the middle of these hard times, I am holding a moment to celebrate this joy as a new beginning to work even harder, turning years of research, volunteering, and teaching into meaningful change for children, youth, and communities,” she wrote. “I hope this news brings some joy to all who need to hear it.”
She added: “As an important side note, I would like to be called Dr. Ozturk, not Miss Ozturk, from now on.”

Alysa Liu gives US its first women's figure skating Olympic gold in 24 years, bests Japanese rivals
Alysa Liu won Olympic gold for the U.S. in women’s figure skating, ending a 24-year drought
- Bookmark
Alysa Liu delivered the U.S. its first women’s figure skating Olympic gold medal in 24 years, performing a near-flawless free skate Thursday night in a glittering golden dress to upstage Japanese rivals Kaori Sakamoto and Ami Nakai at the Milan Cortina Games.
The 20-year-old from the San Francisco Bay Area, who had walked away from the sport after the Beijing Games four years ago only to launch a remarkable comeback, finished with a career-best 226.79 points. Nakai and Sakamoto, skating right behind her, each made a mistake on a combination sequence, and that made the difference in the medals.
Sakamoto had 224.90 points to earn a silver to go with her bronze from Beijing. Nakai finished third with 219.16 points.
The moment Nakai’s score was read after the final program of the night, teammate Amber Glenn jumped onto the kiss-and-cry stand and raised Liu’s hand in triumph. Liu sheepishly turned and applauded the 17-year-old Nakai, who raced over and hugged her.
It’s the first gold medal for an American woman since 2002, when Sarah Hughes stood atop the podium in Salt Lake City.
Glenn finished in fifth behind Mone Chiba of Japan, a stunning rebound from a disastrous short program Tuesday night. Her season-best free skate gave a score of 214.91 points, and just about landed her on the podium as well.
Glenn pumped her first and fought back tears when her score was read, then she took a seat in the new “leader’s chair.”
She wound up sitting there for quite a while.
Through an ice resurfacing. And through eight programs by other skaters, including American teammate Isabeau Levito, whose fall on her opening triple flip in an otherwise elegant performance kept her from taking over the top spot herself.
Adeliia Petrosian, the 18-year-old Russian competing as a neutral athlete at the Milan Cortina Games, tried the only quadruple jump during the women’s competition but fell on the quad toe loop. She was clean the rest of the way, but the points Petrosian lost on that fall ended up leaving her less than a half-point behind the leader.
It was Chiba — the ninth skater to follow Glenn — that finally took over first place.
That didn’t last long with Liu next on the ice.

What is Iftar during Ramadan and why does the time change every night?
- Iftar, the evening meal marking the daily fast's conclusion during Ramadan, holds profound significance for Muslims worldwide.
- As the primary meal for those observing the fast, it is consumed at sunset, known as Maghrib. Its precise timing shifts daily throughout the holy month, adapting to changing daylight hours, a phenomenon particularly evident in countries like the UK.
- Beyond its crucial role for health and nutrition, Iftar carries immense spiritual weight. It is believed to be a time when Allah (SWT) extends special mercy and love to those who have fasted, with particular blessings for individuals who provide food for others.
- A deeply rooted tradition, or Sunnah, encourages Muslims to break their fast with dates before their main meal.
- This practice emulates the Prophet (PBUH), who enjoyed and advocated dates, typically using fresh ones, then dried, or water if neither was available.

Trump accuses Obama of revealing classified information about aliens
During a podcast interview, the former president was asked if aliens were real
- Bookmark
- CommentsGo to comments
Donald Trump has accused former President Barack Obama of improperly disclosing classified information by suggesting aliens are real, an allegation made without supporting evidence.
"He took it out of classified information ... He’s not supposed to be doing that," Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One while traveling to Georgia. "He made a big mistake."
The comments followed an interview with podcast host Brian Tyler Cohen, released on Saturday, where Obama was asked about the existence of extraterrestrial life. He responded, "They're real, but I haven't seen them, and they're not being kept in ... Area 51. There's no underground facility unless there's this enormous conspiracy and they hid it from the president of the United States."
Area 51 is a classified Air Force facility in Nevada, which fringe theorists have long speculated holds alien bodies and crashed spacecraft. However, CIA archives released in 2013 identified it as a test site for top-secret spy planes.
Crucially, there was no indication in Obama's remarks that he relied on classified information for his assertion.
In a subsequent Instagram post on Sunday, Obama further clarified his position, stating, "I saw no evidence during my presidency that extraterrestrials have made contact with us. Really!" He explained his belief in aliens stemmed from the statistical probability of life in a vast universe, while deeming visits to Earth unlikely due to distance.
When questioned on Thursday about his own knowledge of alien existence, Trump stated, "I don’t know if they’re real or not."
The White House declined to add to Trump's comments, and Obama's office did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
In recent years, the Pentagon has intensified efforts to investigate reports of unidentified flying objects.
Senior military leaders confirmed in 2022 that they had found no evidence to suggest alien visits or crash landings on Earth. A 2024 Pentagon report further concluded that US government investigations since the end of World War Two have uncovered no evidence of extraterrestrial technology, attributing most sightings to misidentified ordinary objects and phenomena.

The US Department of Justice’s massive release of Epstein case files has turned some internet users into self-appointed digital sleuths. They’ve been combing through thousands of emails in search of hidden clues and have eventually fixated on one word: pizza. The term appears more than 900 times in the documents, prompting some Trump supporters to claim it vindicates Pizzagate. But the allegation that Democrats were running a Satanic child sex abuse ring out of a Washington D.C. pizzeria remains a conspiracy theory. In this episode of Truth or Fake, Maya-Anaïs Yataghène explains why.

Will Andrew and Epstein finally bring down the monarchy?
Unknown

Opinion
Will Andrew and Epstein finally bring down the monarchy?
In a moment of dramatic irony, Prince Hamlet’s uncle Claudius, who has murdered his brother to usurp the throne of Denmark, hypocritically boasts that a divine protective force or barrier keeps monarchs like him from harm. “There’s such a divinity that protects a king.” For too long Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor, King Charles’ disgraced younger brother, has been “hedged” by the British establishment from the consequences of his actions or possible misdeeds.
His arrest by police on his 66th birthday on suspicion of misconduct in public office removes one of the last of these protections. That is only right. One of the foundational principles of the rule of law is that government officials, politicians, and even princes, are not immune from legal consequences. There can be no exceptions to the legal maxim cited by British judges for centuries, “Be ye never so high, the law is above you.”
A charge or a court action does not automatically follow an arrest. Another foundational principle of the rule of law is the assumption of innocence unless proven guilty. But it does put Andrew on notice that he can no longer tell untruths about a relationship with Jeffrey Epstein that continued long after the financier was convicted and imprisoned for procuring a minor.
Release of the Epstein files in the US has shredded Andrew’s own airbrushed account of that friendship. It raises doubts about his credibility in a notorious BBC television interview where he denied having sex with Virginia Giuffre, a minor procured by Epstein and his accomplice Ghislaine Maxwell. The consequences of legal perjury for Andrew would be dire.
Andrew’s cup of misery is overflowing. Allegations related to the Epstein files are that he forwarded confidential reports to the financier while he was a trade envoy for the UK. Police have been searching both his former home in Windsor and his new address in internal exile on the Royal Estate in Norfolk. Former UK prime minister Gordon Brown has also demanded that police investigate him as an accessory or witness to Epstein’s use of London’s Stansted and Luton airports to traffic women and girls.
I recently wrote that the flaws of Epstein’s other celebrity British pal – or rather prize catch – Peter Mandelson, were well known before his appointment as ambassador to Washington ended in an all too predictable scandal. Labour’s governing establishment, however, was determined to look the other way. Andrew’s vices have been hiding in plain sight for many years, too, and have been similarly ignored.
In my time working at The Sunday Times newspaper, we revealed in 2007 that an unknown Kazakh oligarch had bought the then prince’s former home of Sunninghill Park for £3 million ($4 million) above the asking price and an estimated £7 million more than the property’s market value. Made an official trade envoy by prime minister Tony Blair to indulge his mother, the late Queen Elizabeth II, Andrew had become patron of the British-Kazakh Society jointly with the country’s dictator, Nursultan Nazarbayev. The sale has been subsequently linked to a Kazakh money-laundering scheme, but at the time Andrew refused to make any inquiries into the cause of his good fortune.
Not long after that story appeared, I was invited to a dinner by a go-between to meet the then prince. This was one invitation that was easy to decline. Courtiers at Buckingham Palace, prime ministers and Foreign Office officials forced to work alongside Andrew in his trade envoy role were not so fastidious. Deference to his mother, an icon of respectability, lay at the heart of it. Who at the time was policing the border between Andrew’s official duties and his financial affairs? Now it is alleged that his access to foreign leaders and financiers may have helped Epstein, too.
Some mothers are blind to the faults of their children. Andrew was the late Queen’s favourite. When Giuffre sued him in a New York court, accusing him of sexual assault, the Queen provided £7 million ($13.35 million) towards his £12 million out-of-court settlement, topped up with £3 million from her husband’s estate. Andrew strenuously denied all the charges at the time and still does.
UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer, his own tenure of office in jeopardy after a series of scandalous appointments including that of Mandelson, is vulnerable to the accusation that he tolerates a “boys’ club” at No. 10. He won’t be providing any protection. Mountbatten-Windsor’s brother the King declares that “the law must take its course”. Can the monarchy survive the scandal?
The cynics will reply that the damage caused by Andrew to the royal family is catastrophic, but not serious. After all, the monarchy has been surviving scandals for decades, even centuries.
The memory of Queen Victoria’s “wicked uncles”, a notably bad lot of Regency rakes and scoundrels, was soon erased by her virtuous marriage to Prince Albert, a pillar of Germanic rectitude and intellectual high seriousness. Edward VII’s fondness for actresses and horses never did the institution much harm, and his grandson Edward VIII’s abdication in 1936 to marry an American divorcee preserved bourgeois propriety and yet gifted the world a glamorous royal love story. The collapse of Charles’ fairytale marriage to Princess Diana – which kept the glossy gossip mags in business for years – only enhanced the marketability of an institution called “The Firm” by royal insiders.
In every royal legend, Hamlet included, there has to be a wicked uncle who offsets the virtues of the good prince or princess. Andrew’s vices and those of his ex-wife, Sarah Ferguson, provide a perfect foil to the goody-two-shoes couple of his nephew William and wife Catherine, the Prince and Princess of Wales – or at least to their well-polished public image.
The great Victorian authority on the British constitution, Walter Bagehot, warned that exposure of the workings of the monarchy would let “daylight in on magic”. He didn’t foresee that the public’s hunger for a sacrificial Epstein villain might become an essential part of the performance.
Still, the cynics may have underestimated how this scandal trumps them all. We may hear more about Andrew’s unwise choice of company – allegedly including a Chinese spy – and the extent of his involvement in Epstein’s network at home and abroad. Unless he clears his name, the late Queen’s intervention in settling Andrew’s court case will increasingly look to the public like the payment of hush money. And you don’t have to be a moralist to worry that it took allegations about profiteering, not the cries of alleged victims, that brought Andrew to the attention of police.

Far more Americans believe Trump is racist than not, poll finds
The president has defended himself against claims of bigotry by pointing to his friendship with prominent Black figures
- Bookmark
- CommentsGo to comments
Nearly twice as many Americans believe President Donald Trump is racist as believe he is not, according to a new survey, which comes after the president repeatedly rejected this allegation.
In the February poll from The Economist/YouGov, respondents were asked whether or not they would use the word racist to describe the 79-year-old Republican president.
Nearly half, 47 percent, said they would use this descriptor, while 24 percent said they would not — and 29 percent expressed no opinion.
Unsurprisingly, the results were sharply divided based on partisan affiliation, with 90 percent of Democrats, 48 percent of independents and just 5 percent of Republicans saying the term applied to the president.
The poll was conducted February 13-16 with 1,682 U.S. citizens, the vast majority of whom were registered voters. It had a margin of error of 3.1 percentage points.
On Tuesday, Trump used the death of Reverend Jesse Jackson, a longtime civil rights leader, to rebuff allegations of bigotry.
“Despite the fact that I am falsely and consistently called a Racist by the Scoundrels and Lunatics on the Radical Left, Democrats ALL, it was always my pleasure to help Jesse along the way,” Trump wrote on Truth Social.
The following day, the billionaire president again defended himself during a Black History Month event at the White House by citing his friendship with boxer Mike Tyson.
“Mike has been loyal to me,” he told a crowd of supporters at the executive mansion. “Whenever they come out, they say, ‘Trump’s a racist’ — You know, it’s like a statement: ‘Trump’s a racist’ — Mike Tyson goes, ‘He’s not a racist. He’s my friend.’”
His most recent remarks came about two weeks after a video portraying the Obamas as apes was posted to his Truth Social account, sparking bipartisan condemnation and calls of it being racist.
Senator Tim Scott, a Republican from South Carolina, called it “the most racist” thing he had seen from the White House. Senator Rodger Wicker, a Republican from Mississippi, called it “totally unacceptable” and called on Trump to apologize.
White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt initially dismissed criticism of the clip, calling out “fake outrage.” Hours later, though, the video was taken down and a White House official blamed a staffer for posting it “erroneously.”

Trump mixes diplomacy and flattery at first Board of Peace meeting
Sign up now: Get ST's newsletters delivered to your inbox
WASHINGTON – World leaders who accepted President Donald Trump's invitation to join his new Peace Board
While the US President has been chummy with world leaders in the past, he has typically leaned into a good-cop-bad-cop routine, alternating between praise and threats as his interests dictated. On Feb 19, those in attendance saw Mr Trump at his most convivial.
There was no hint of the criticised human rights records of some attendees. Only those who did not attend the board’s inaugural meeting in Washington received an ominous warning. “You can't play cute with me,” Mr Trump said.
A number of key US allies have declined to join the forum set up by Mr Trump in September 2025 for Gaza reconstruction, but which he hopes can become a global conflict-resolution body. Critics say it risks interfering with the work of the UN.
As leaders huddled for a group photo, the event’s soundtrack set the tone: James Brown’s 1966 song It's A Man’s Man’s Man’s World blared overhead.
Gaza is the board’s first priority, but the Middle East conflict was not discussed in detail by Mr Trump until 25 minutes into his welcome speech, as he focused first on complimenting the world leaders onstage, rating some of them on their good looks, wealth and strength.
Mr Trump recited the names of the world leaders in attendance, along with FIFA president Gianni Infantino, all of whom were seated on either side of him onstage, some with red MAGA hats placed on the table in front of them.
“President (Santiago) Pena of Paraguay is here,” Mr Trump said, pointing out the 47-year-old leader. “Young handsome guy. It's always nice to be young and handsome. Doesn’t mean we have to like you. I don’t like young, handsome men. Women I like. Men, I don't have any interest.”
Nonetheless, his interest in the male physique was apparent. At one point, he told the crowd to look at the “tough” face of Indonesian President Prabowo Subianto.
Mr Trump also told stories in which he portrayed himself as having coerced leaders into doing what he wanted. He told the crowd how he had used threats of tariffs to pressure some countries, such as India and Pakistan, into ending conflicts. India has firmly rejected this assertion.
‘Beautiful’ people
The President suggested that his new board could overtake the UN in prominence.
“The Board of Peace is going to almost be looking over the United Nations... they need help,” Mr Trump said, digressing to recount a 2025 visit when he and First Lady Melania Trump were stuck on an escalator at the UN headquarters in New York.
“I was lucky my movie-star First Lady was in front of me, because I put my hand on a certain part of her body,” Mr Trump said of the incident.
In total, the US leader used the term “beautiful” at least 14 times in his speech to praise his administration’s work and the event space, which was named after him.
He said it was Secretary of State Marco Rubio’s idea to “surprise” him by renaming the US Institute of Peace, where the event on Feb 19 was held, in his honour.
“I didn’t know the surprise,” Mr Trump said. “I thought maybe they were going to give me a lot of money or something, maybe cash.” REUTERS

Large Trump banner hung at justice department headquarters

A large banner featuring Donald Trump’s face was hung on the exterior of justice department headquarters on Thursday in a physical display of the president’s efforts to exert power over the law enforcement agency that once investigated him.
While Trump banners have been hung outside other agencies across Washington, the decision to place one on the storied justice department building amounted to a striking symbol of the erosion of the department’s tradition of independence from White House control.
The banner, hung between two columns on one corner of the building, says “Make America Safe Again” – a slogan used by the administration to tout its efforts to clamp down on illegal immigration and violent crime.
Pam Bondi, the attorney general, has postured herself as the president’s chief supporter and protector, eschewing the approach of predecessors who sought to maintain an arms-length distance from the White House to protect the impartiality of investigations and prosecutions.
Trump officials have rejected accusations that they have weaponized the justice department for political purposes, saying the Biden administration was the one that politicized law enforcement with two federal criminal cases against Trump that were abandoned after he won the 2024 election.
The department in a statement on Thursday said it was proud to “celebrate 250 years of our great country and our historic work to make America safe again at President Trump’s direction”.
The Trump administration has opened investigations into a number of the president’s perceived enemies, amplifying concerns that the agency is being used to exact revenge on his political foes.
Federal prosecutors brought charges against New York attorney general Letitia James and former FBI director James Comey that were later dismissed, and separately sought to indict several Democratic lawmakers in connection with a video in which they urged US military members to resist “illegal orders”.
The department is also investigating Fed chair Jerome Powell over congressional testimony and Democratic Minnesota officials over whether they obstructed federal immigration enforcement through public statements.

Alysa Liu wins gold for U.S. in women's figure skating at 2026 Winter Olympics
Alysa Liu won a gold medal in women's individual figure skating on Thursday, making her the first U.S. woman to take the Olympic podium in the event since 2006. Japan's Kaori Sakamoto took silver and Ami Nakai, also of Japan, took the bronze.
The last American woman to earn a medal in individual figure skating was Sasha Cohen, who took home silver in 2006. Sarah Hughes was the last American woman to take home a gold medal, in 2002 — four years before Liu was even born. Michelle Kwan also won a bronze medal at those Olympics. This is Liu's second gold medal.
"I just like, can't process this. There's no way," Liu could be heard telling her coaches as she walked down the hallway after winning.
Liu, 20, started the free skate in third place, behind Japan's Nakai and Sakamoto, following the short program on Tuesday. Isabeau Levito, 18, was in eighth place, while Amber Glenn, 26, was in 13th place after an error in her short program.
Glenn was the first U.S. skater to take the ice for her free skate. After failing to complete a triple loop on Tuesday, her score going into the free skate was 67.39. During Thursday's skate, she nailed a triple axel, though she had to catch herself with her hand after nearly falling during her final loop. She scored 147.52, for a total score of 214.91.
Photos captured Glenn embracing her coach after her skate. Glenn looked visibly thrilled, smiling and jumping for joy. Despite entering the free skate in 13th place, she was at the top of the leaderboard for much of the event, finally being unseated by Japanese skater Mone Chiba. Glenn ended the competition in fifth place, and Chiba took fourth place.
Liu praised Glenn's pop-scored comeback in a brief interview with an NBC Olympics correspondent.
"She did so good. I watched it on the bus on the way here, and aw, she killed it, and I'm really happy for her," Liu said.
Levito was the next American woman to skate. She took the ice with a score of 70.84 from her short program. She fell on the landing of her opening triple flip, losing nine points, but recovered to skate through the rest of her routine.
Levito looked disappointed after leaving the ice, even as Glenn cheered for her. She also appeared emotional as her score of 131.96 was read out. Levito racked up a total score of 202.80 and came in 12th overall.
Liu was the final U.S. competitor and the third-to-last skater to take the ice. She looked at ease during her warmup, waving to spectators as she rehearsed. She entered the rink with a score of 76.59 after her carefree short program. Liu looked casual and energetic during her free skate, sailing through a triple lutz and triple salchow. She had a broad smile on her face throughout the event, and the crowd roared every time she landed a jump.
Liu looked particularly at ease during her choreographic step sequences, and ended the routine triumphantly as her family rose for a standing ovation.
Liu's score was 150.20, for a total score of 226.79.
"That's what the f*** I'm talking about!" she shouted to the camera after finishing her skate. She bounced off the ice to hug her coaches and could be heard saying, "That was so great!" as they handed her her skate guards. Glenn and Liu were also seen hugging.
"I was so calm when I started," Liu said following the competition. "I have this breathing technique that I use throughout this program, and I was just making sure to lock in on that, be as smooth as I can and look out into the crowd during all my transitions."
"I did that, and I felt everyone's energy. I felt my energy," she said, adding that she felt she "put it all out there."
On whether she is glad to have returned to the sport in 2024, after having retired at 16 following the Beijing 2022 Winter Games, Liu said: "It was just right."
Sakamoto earned silver for her skate to a medley of Edith Piaf songs. She missed a triple jump, but otherwise skated cleanly, and embraced Liu after she came off the ice.
Nakai struggled with some of her jumps, but the high difficulty score of her routine meant she still took home the bronze medal. Liu and Nakai also hugged after Nakai's score was read out.
The United States also took gold in the team skating event earlier in the 2026 Milan Cortina Winter Games.

Chinese scientists put quantum chaos in ‘slow motion’
Researchers have controlled a temporary stable phase in the system, offering a possible avenue for preserving quantum information

In a landmark achievement, Chinese scientists have directly observed and manipulated prethermalisation – a critical transitional state in quantum systems – using the 78-qubit “Chuang-tzu 2.0” superconducting processor.
This allows researchers to “tune” the speed of quantum decoherence, providing a vital tool for managing complex quantum environments.
If a quantum system is disturbed, it naturally returns to a balanced state. The energy and information within it spreads out until they are evenly distributed. It would be similar to nudging a pendulum: it swings for a while but eventually slows down and stops.

This is a major challenge for quantum computing, which relies on keeping information perfectly intact. If a quantum system changes too quickly, its computational results become difficult to save and retrieve. However, predicting how long this process takes or what affects it is beyond the power of existing classical computers.
In a study published in Nature on January 28, researchers from the Institute of Physics at the Chinese Academy of Sciences reported the first observation of a counterintuitive intermediate stage during this evolution. This stage is transient, relatively stable and, crucially, controllable, offering a possible avenue for preserving quantum information.

Fifth candidate fired from The Apprentice as Big Zuu makes guest appearance
Roxanne Hamedi, a pharmacist from Aberdeen, was fired for her poor branding decisions

The latest series of The Apprentice has seen its fifth candidate fired after a task focused on creating and marketing a bottled water brand.
Aberdeen pharmacist Roxanne Hamedi was dismissed by Lord Sugar, who held her accountable for her team's poor branding decisions.
As sub-team leader for the branding element, Hamedi expressed her disappointment, saying she felt "like my time was cut short".
The episode required candidates to sell their new water brands live on social media and produce an accompanying television advert.
Rapper Big Zuu also made a cameo, assisting in judging the candidates' work. Lord Sugar ultimately attributed the team's branding failures to Hamedi, resulting in her exit from the BBC business show.
She was in the firing line alongside team leader Conor Galvin and pharmaceutical sales specialist Rajan Gill, who was brought into the boardroom after a disastrous pitch.
Hamedi said: “It didn’t feel good to be fired, just because I didn’t think that I deserved to be.
“There was a lot going on that day and I feel like other people lacked accountability.”
Hamedi said she took on the role of sub-team leader because she “wanted to get out of my comfort zone and take that risk”.
She added: “I don’t regret being a sub-team lead, but I just feel like my time was cut short in the process.”
She said Galvin should have been fired instead, adding: “I feel like he did throw me under the bus because I was just an easy scapegoat.”
Asked if she would have done anything differently, Hamedi said: “I guess I could have fought more in the boardroom, you know, called Rajan out on his lack of input, or reminded Lord Sugar that I’d taken creative risks and didn’t hide in the background.
“But I didn’t want it to come down to begging or being the loudest or most apologetic person in the room. I stayed true to myself and that takes integrity.”
Hamedi would have expanded her business, a beauty brand specialising in combatting hair loss, if she had won the programme.
The winner of the latest series of The Apprentice will be awarded £250,000 of investment into their company and the opportunity to go into business with Lord Sugar.
The Apprentice returns on BBC One next Thursday at 9pm.

Trump weighs limited strike on Iran to force nuclear deal, report says

U.S. President Donald Trump is weighing a limited initial military strike against Iran in an effort to compel Tehran to accept his demands for a new nuclear agreement, The Wall Street Journal reported late Thursday.
The report said the potential move is intended to increase pressure on Tehran to reach a deal without triggering a large-scale assault that could prompt a significant Iranian response.
Citing people familiar with the matter, the newspaper reported that if approved, the strike could take place within days and would target military or government sites. If Iran continues to reject Trump’s conditions for halting uranium enrichment, the United States could respond with broader attacks on regime facilities, potentially with the aim of toppling the government, according to the report.
One source told the Journal that Trump may escalate gradually, beginning with a limited operation before ordering more extensive strikes, until Iran dismantles its nuclear program or the regime collapses.
U.S. officials told the newspaper it remains unclear how seriously Trump is considering the option after weeks of discussions, even though senior aides have repeatedly presented it to him. In recent days, the discussions have increasingly focused on wider-ranging attacks, the report said.
American officials also said Trump has not yet decided whether to order any strike. Options under consideration range from a weeklong campaign designed to force regime change to a narrower wave of strikes targeting Iranian government and military facilities.
Some U.S. officials cautioned that such strikes could provoke retaliation from Iran, potentially drawing the United States into a broader war in the Middle East and endangering its regional allies.

More than 90 deaths this season: Are we seeing more avalanches?

More than 90 deaths this season: Are we seeing more avalanches?
It is not unusual for avalanches to be in the news in the northern hemisphere at this time of year, the height of the annual ski season.
But Tuesday's deadly incident in California, which took the lives of eight skiers and left one more unaccounted for, and the difficult situation in much of the Alps - where there have been more fatalities than usual this year - has put a spotlight on avalanches and how prepared winter sports enthusiasts should be for them.
The two situations would seem to be very different. California has been coming out of a so-called snow drought and experts do not consider the latest snowfall exceptional.
But droughts followed by intense snow can cause problems - the new snow is unable to bind to old snow underneath, which can either be very hard or non-existent, and therefore remains loose.
Europe, however, has seen two major storms in a week and a large amount of heavy snow combined with strong winds, leading to high avalanche warning levels across an unusually large part of the Alps. Three Britons were among dozens killed in incidents so far over the season.
One Alpine resort suggested that the current conditions could be the worst there this century.
Recent snows have also led to evacuations of several communities in Switzerland and northern Italy, as well as power outages and a train derailment at Goppenstein in the south-western Swiss canton of Valais.
But is there a connection between events in Europe and California?
Is climate change to blame?
Climate change might seem an obvious culprit for the unstable weather conditions that have brought them about.
"There is evidence that climate change will lead to sharper, more intense precipitation followed by long periods without," Simon Mason, senior scientist at SEI US, told the BBC.
This would seem to be the case in Europe, which has recently had several seasons with lower than average snowfall, and some dry periods in the early part of this season.
"However, since many factors control avalanche risk and precipitation is only one controlling influence, it is difficult to conclude how risks may evolve with future climate change," Mason said.
Climatologist Christoph Marthy told Swiss outlet SRF the current Alpine winter - with weather until recently dominated by high pressure and several long, dry periods - is exactly the opposite of a typical climate change winter.
Benjamin Zweifel, of the Swiss Federal Institute for Snow and Avalanche Research, told the BBC the storms were "only one piece of the puzzle".
"The main challenge this winter was a very weak snowpack [an accumulation of snow that compresses and melts seasonally] with very persistent weak layers, caused by long periods without new snow and low temperatures," he said.
While global warming affects weather patterns, the temperature itself could also have a direct impact on avalanches. According to the US Northern Rocky Mountain Science Center, wet snow avalanches - which are likely to become more frequent as temperatures rise - are dangerous, difficult to predict and relatively poorly understood compared with the dry snow equivalent.
"Wet snow avalanches are caused by weakening in the strength of the snowpack, often triggered by rain, abundant sunshine, or warm temperatures," the centre says in an article on wet snow avalanche research, adding their frequency was expected to increase with changing temperatures.
A 2021 research paper in the journal Frontiers in Physiology suggests wetter and warmer snow may also adversely affect a person's chances of surviving an avalanche, while thinner snow cover may increase the risk of blunt trauma injuries.
Broadly, there would seem to be four destabilising issues that are changing the dynamics of avalanches - switching between droughts and heavy precipitation, the precipitation itself, wetter snow and snow which is actually melting.
How are resorts mitigating the risk?
Blaise Agresti, a high-mountain guide at Chamonix, told France's Sud radio that there was another important factor in Europe's spike in avalanche deaths - the changing behaviour of skiers and higher levels of risk.
"People are increasingly practising off-piste skiing. Among skiers, 25% go off-piste," he said.
Way-marked pistes are generally protected by pre-emptive avalanche blasting, and their snow is flattened and compacted to further reduce the risk. If there is still a danger of avalanches, pistes can be closed off, as has happened during the recent warnings.
But while forecasting and blasting techniques have improved in recent years, it is not impossible for avalanches to hit pistes that have been declared safe. There is no such thing as zero risk, and it may be advisable to keep away from pistes beneath mountainsides covered with powdery-looking snow.
Sometimes resorts can detect a wider threat. The French resorts of Tignes and Val d'Isere even imposed a lockdown because of the avalanche threat, forcing residents and tourists to stay indoors.
In general, though, resorts will not prevent tourists from going off-piste so instead they offer advice. Another French resort, La Plagne, for instance, tells skiers to get information about conditions, make sure they have the necessary safety gear - avalanche transceiver, shovel and probe - know how to use them, and always go out with a professional guide and never alone.
The resort, which has one of the world's largest off-piste areas, holds weekly safety days in high season and has recently invested in a drone equipped with a thermal camera for use in avalanche detection and rescue operations.
Thomas Hager, a ski guide based in the Zell am See region in the Austrian Alps, told the BBC World Service's Outside Source programme that sometimes it was easy for snow sports enthusiasts to be complacent.
"Snow looks so calm. It's comparable to water," he said. "In an ocean you don't see undercurrents but local people know where the undercurrents are and where avalanches go off frequently. So please always talk with local people and listen to the avalanche forecast."
He also suggested it was vital to carry an air-bag, which is not required by law but could help keep avalanche victims close to the surface of the snow.
Though the recent spike in avalanche deaths in Europe is worrying, it is not exceptional - according to European Avalanche Warning Services, 95 have died so far this season, compared to 70 in the whole of 2024-24 and 87 in 2023-24. The 2020-21 season, when 131 died, and 2017-18, when the figure was 147, seem comparable.
Could it have been a lot worse?
But if you ask weather watchers about the situation, a different picture emerges. Meteo France's team in Bourg-Saint-Maurice near the Italian border, told the BBC the region went from below-average snowfall to "remarkable" above-average snowfall in under 10 days.
"Statistically speaking, we experience a situation like this once every eight years. This means a very significant avalanche risk," it said.
Meanwhile the Val d'Isere resort, in its Thursday weather bulletin, said a third wave of 30-50cm (12in-20in) of snow - after the two storms - would have to be taken very seriously and required "certain precautions".
"The situation has not been seen for a long time (perhaps since February 1999)," it added.
So have modern avalanche-warning systems and safety measures taken by resorts in recent years kept casualty figures down?
Benjamin Zweifel believes the situation could be a lot worse without these factors, and says he sees a "big effect", at least in Switzerland.
He notes, though, that France and Italy have both seen higher fatalities - 25 in each, compared to Switzerland's 13 - but says this could be linked to "even more challenging conditions" in the western and southern Alps.
The worst could be over, though. The weather is expected to improve from Friday, giving resorts the space to carry out more safety work and allowing the snowpack to settle.
However, sunny, south-facing slopes will lose some of their snow, potentially leading to greater risks for off-pisters.

MOSCOW, February 20. /TASS/. The Ukrainian army lost over 520,000 troops, and 6,700 tanks and combat vehicles along the engagement line in 2025, First Deputy Chief of the General Staff of the Russian Armed Forces and head of the Main Operational Directorate of the General Staff Sergey Rudskoy said.
"Their (the Ukrainian army - TASS) losses in 2025 amounted to roughly 6,700 tanks and combat armored vehicles, as well as over 12,000 weapons and mortars, and more than 520,000 servicemen in terms of personnel," he told the Krasnaya Zvezda newspaper.
"Since the beginning of the special military operation, the Ukrainian army has lost over 1,5 million troops in total," Rudskoy added.

Nawrocki signs law introducing new rules for assistance to Ukrainian refugees
Under the signed document, the key provisions of the special law will be incorporated into the general law on granting protection to foreigners, Ukrinform reports, citing Polish Press Agency (PAP).
"My signature on this document shows that consistency in action makes sense. My pressure on this matter, including a previous veto, forced the government to revise the draft and introduce changes expected by many Poles and proposed by me," Nawrocki said in a video address regarding the signing and vetoing of several laws.
He emphasized that Warsaw continues to stand with Kyiv "in its fight against imperial Russia," and that in the first months of the war Poland "passed the test of solidarity like no other country."
At the same time, he added that he had promised to end the "stage of unconditional privileges" and that he had fulfilled this commitment today.
Nawrocki stated that the law he signed ends the emergency assistance framework and introduces systemic rules.
"I am signing this law with the conviction that it protects our public finances, organizes the system, and restores a sense of basic fairness," he said.
The so-called special assistance law, in force since 2022, had simplified residence and employment rules, as well as access to social benefits and education for Ukrainian war refugees. The new law repeals the system created under that act. Instead, a unified system of temporary protection for all foreigners will be introduced. Under this framework, the most important instruments of the previous law will be transferred to the legislation governing the protection of foreigners.

US removing guardrails from proposed Saudi nuclear deal, document says
Sign up now: Get ST's newsletters delivered to your inbox
WASHINGTON – President Donald Trump has told Congress he is pursuing a civil nuclear pact with Saudi Arabia that does not include non-proliferation safeguards the US has long said would ensure the kingdom does not develop nuclear weapons, according to a copy of the document sent to Congress and reviewed by Reuters.
Mr Trump, a Republican, and former president Joe Biden, a Democrat, have worked with Saudi Arabia on paths to building the first civil nuclear power plants for the kingdom.
The development comes amid fears of a new global nuclear arms race following the expiration earlier in February of the last strategic arms limitation treaty
Arms control groups and many Democrats and some leading Republicans – including Secretary of State Marco Rubio when he served in the Senate – have insisted that any agreement come with guardrails, including that Saudi Arabia not have the ability to enrich uranium or to reprocess spent nuclear fuel, potential pathways to weapons, demands also made by successive US administrations.
They also insist that Saudi Arabia agree to the so-called Additional Protocol that grants the UN’s International Atomic Energy Agency broad and more intrusive oversight of a country’s nuclear activities, such as the power to carry out snap inspections at undeclared locations.
The Trump administration sent an initial report to leaders on some congressional committees in November, a copy of which was seen by Reuters, that it is required to send if it is not pursuing the Additional Protocol, the Arms Control Association (ACA), an advocacy group, said on Feb 19.
The report “raises concerns that the Trump administration has not carefully considered the proliferation risks posed by its proposed nuclear cooperation agreement with Saudi Arabia or the precedent this agreement may set”, Ms Kelsey Davenport, the head of non-proliferation policy for ACA, said in an article published on Feb 19.
Mr Trump’s report to Congress says that the draft US-Saudi pact on civil nuclear, known as a 123 Agreement, puts the US industry at the heart of Saudi Arabia’s civil nuclear development, ensuring nuclear-proliferation safeguards are in place.
The document, however, opens the way to Saudi Arabia also having an enrichment programme as it refers to “additional safeguards and verification measures to the most sensitive areas of potential nuclear cooperation” between the US and Saudi Arabia, including enrichment and reprocessing.
Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, the de facto ruler of Saudi Arabia, has said that the kingdom would seek to develop nuclear weapons if regional rival Iran did so.
“If they get one, we have to get one,” the crown prince told Fox News in 2023, saying a weapon would be necessary “for security reasons, and for balancing power in the Middle East, but we don’t want to see that”.
The White House and the State Department did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Saudi Arabia’s Embassy in Washington did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Congressional check
Ms Davenport said “It behooves Congress” to provide a check on the administration’s power to strike an agreement with the kingdom and “consider not just the implications for Saudi Arabia, but also the precedent that this deal will set, and vigorously examine the terms of the proposed 123 Agreement”.
The Trump administration could submit the 123 Agreement to Congress as soon as Feb 22, ACA said, as it has about 90 days after the report to Congress to send it. Unless both the Senate and the US House pass resolutions opposing the 123 Agreement within 90 days, it would go into effect and allow Saudi Arabia a civil nuclear programme. REUTERS

Trump claims Obama revealed classified information when he said aliens are real
Sign up now: Get ST's newsletters delivered to your inbox
ABOARD AIR FORCE ONE - United States President Donald Trump on Feb 19 accused former President Barack Obama of disclosing classified information when he recently said that aliens were real, but Mr Trump did not cite any evidence to support the allegation.
“He took it out of classified information... He’s not supposed to be doing that,” Mr Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One while travelling to Georgia. “He made a big mistake.”
During an interview with podcast host Brian Tyler Cohen released on Feb 14, Mr Obama was asked if aliens are real.
“They're real, but I haven't seen them, and they're not being kept in... Area 51. There's no underground facility unless there’s this enormous conspiracy and they hid it from the president of the United States,” Mr Obama said.
Area 51 is a classified Air Force facility in Nevada that fringe theorists have speculated holds alien bodies and a crashed spaceship. CIA archives released in 2013 said it was a test site for top-secret spy planes.
There was no indication in his remarks that the former president relied on classified information.
“I saw no evidence during my presidency that extraterrestrials have made contact with us. Really!” Mr Obama said in an Instagram post on Feb 15.
In the post, Mr Obama explained his belief that aliens exist by saying the statistical odds of life beyond Earth were high because the universe is so vast. He added that the chances of extraterrestrial life visiting Earth were low given the distance.
On Feb 19, Mr Trump said “I don’t know if they’re real or not” when asked whether he had seen evidence that aliens exist.
The White House said it had nothing to add to the president’s comments. Mr Obama’s office did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
The Pentagon in recent years undertook a push to investigate reports of unidentified flying objects, and senior military leaders said in 2022 they found no evidence to suggest that aliens have visited Earth or crash-landed here.
A 2024 Pentagon report said U.S. government investigations since the end of World War Two have found no evidence of extraterrestrial technology and most sightings were misidentified ordinary objects and phenomena. REUTERS

Life after the 'great resignation': Incentives are dimming for workers to change jobs
Unknown

06:50:32 KST

With the upheaval of the Covid pandemic came opportunity, as a shift in the labor market gave workers unprecedented opportunities for mobility and a chance to climb the pay scale.
The "great resignation," as it came to be known, saw record numbers of employees quit in favor of better opportunities, as companies couldn't hire workers fast enough to fill the vacancies that the pandemic helped create. A record 4.5 million left their jobs for greener pastures in March 2022.
But that is changing.
The level of "quits" as measured by the Bureau of Labor Statistics has contracted by nearly one-third since hitting its peak in early 2022, a period during which job openings have nearly halved.
One metric helps further tell the story: During the same period, the disparity between average annual pay increases for those staying in their jobs and for those leaving has all but collapsed, going from a peak of 8.4 percentage points in April 2022 to 1.9 percentage points in January. That's the lowest level since payrolls processing firm ADP began tracking the data in November 2020.
Call it the "big stay," or just another outgrowth of the low-hire, low-fire labor market, but it's a trend that has significance for workers.
A pendulum swing
"It's a very stable labor market. There's very little hiring, very little firing," said Nela Richardson, chief economist at ADP. "It's an outgrowth of the pandemic from where it was all hands on deck."
A lack of labor supply and a pernicious skills gap was the story when the economy was trying to recover from the massive drawdown it had seen during the early Covid days. Workers and employers were adjusting to the new world of hybrid work, and companies were hungry for new recruits.
As the "great resignation" peaked, there were more than two job openings per each worker the BLS classified as unemployed. That pendulum has swung back, however, and there are now more available workers than openings.
Layoffs, though, remain low. Last week saw just 206,000 initial jobless claims, with the longer-term average at 219,000, about in line with historical norms for a healthy labor market. Though hiring has slowed considerably, the unemployment rate is just 4.3%.
"If you were to parachute into this labor market in any time period of the United States, you'd be mostly happy with what you found," Richardson said. "The action is in the granular data."
For instance, pay trends are peculiar to industries.
In the high-turnover leisure and hospitality industry, pay gains are better for job stayers, with the disparity at 2.5% in stayers' favor, according to ADP. However, construction, which is struggling with labor supply during the U.S. crackdown on illegal immigration, has a 6.6 percentage point advantage for switchers.
The incentives are still strong for switchers, with annual pay growth averaging 6.4% in January, well above the 4.5% for stayers, according to ADP data. But the gap is narrowing and could close further due to current labor market moves.
A new reality
The trends come with a fresh flock of workers combing the want ads for jobs.
Searches were up 31% in January from December while job postings were little changed, according to Indeed Hiring Lab.
"The reality facing those seeking jobs in 2026 is that openings per unemployed person have declined, and hiring timelines are lengthening," Indeed experts Laura Ullrich and Sneha Puri wrote. "While some sectors continue to see elevated levels of postings, the macro environment remains in the low-hire, low-fire stagnation of 2025."
Even with the low unemployment rate, Richardson said she is concerned with the "lack of dynamism in the labor market" as most hires are in the health-care industry and turnover is receding.
"The fact that it is low-hire, low-fire is actually not a great state to be in. The churn is important to the productivity growth," she said. "You want to see the most talented go to the places where that talent is the most rewarded. And if we are in this really stable period, that means that talent is not being repositioned to its best use."

Trump’s Board of Peace pledges $7B for Gaza - a fraction of what it needs
- Donald Trump convened the inaugural meeting of his Board of Peace on Thursday, announcing significant pledges for Gaza's reconstruction.
- Nations including Kazakhstan, Azerbaijan, the United Arab Emirates, Morocco, Bahrain, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Uzbekistan, and Kuwait collectively pledged $7 billion toward a Gaza reconstruction fund.
- Additional contributions included $75million from FIFA for football−related projects and $2 billion from the United Nations for humanitarian assistance.
- The total amount pledged, however, falls substantially short of the estimated $70 billion required to rebuild Gaza.
- Gaza has been devastated by years of conflict, necessitating extensive reconstruction efforts.

Groceries, water, art supplies: Israeli women ready families for another confrontation with Iran

As the world waits to see whether the Trump administration will carry out strikes against the Islamic regime following failed nuclear negotiations and a month of domestic unrest, Israeli women told The Jerusalem Post on Thursday that they are preparing themselves and their loved ones for the possibility of another confrontation with Tehran.
The 12 Day War in June, which significantly reduced elements of Iran’s nuclear infrastructure through targeted strikes, left a deep imprint not only on military calculations but on civilian life in Israel. During the fighting, the Post spoke with people who had lost their homes, pet owners whose animals did not survive the attacks, and reported on the deaths of 32 people in Israel, including 31 civilians, four of whom were children.
Keren Shannon, 39, said she felt that, as soon as the war ended in June, the conflict was not truly over. Since then, she has kept 18 bottles of water under her table, stocked up on cans of tuna and dried Quaker oats, purchased rechargeable lights, and secured 40 days' worth of food for her cat.
Preparing for a potential emergency, Shannon also bought a radio and a first-aid kit and placed a war bag by her front door containing “my medicine, passports, portable hard drive, charger, and a power brick.”
Shannon lives in Ramat Gan, the same city that saw an Iranian missile kill 76-year-old Aharon Mizrahi and 74-year-old Eti Cohen Engel in two separate impacts.
“I have a dress by my front door that is easy to throw on if a siren goes off while I'm showering [and] I have slip-on shoes by the door,” she added.
More Israeli women share how they prepare
For Sarah Levy, a 40-year-old mother living in Bat Yam, the concern is primarily for her son. She told the Post she felt torn about whether to fly to Germany to spare her four-year-old the experience of another war, but has instead begun preparing ways to keep him occupied in Israel, purchasing “a ton” of arts supplies.
Levy said she suspected another round of fighting would follow the truce in June and that she “didn’t feel safe in Israel anymore” after seeing ballistic missiles damage safe rooms in homes across the country.
“But I continue to live, continue to push through. I noticed I start to suppress bad news and take life day by day. There is no other way to live here and not go crazy,” she explained. “You have to close your emotions a bit to survive. Some would say you become stronger here, more resilient. I think we become numb. To danger. To violence. To the suffering of others. We cannot take it any more; it has been a rough few years.”
Asked whether she feared the long-term impact of war on her son, Levy said she worried it could shape his worldview in ways she hopes to avoid, including growing fearful of Arabs and Arabic. The issue is deeply important to her, she said, as she has consciously raised her son to focus on peace, including sending him to a Muslim metapelet (caregiver).
“How much influence will I have on the person he becomes? Will I be able to shield him from becoming a racist or someone whose political attitudes are fueled by Jewish supremacy and racism? Or someone who hates out of fear? Those were the thoughts that occupied my head and my heart throughout the war,” she told the Post.
For Beca Bookman, another war would mean adjusting to new responsibilities. Last month, the Jerusalem resident adopted a puppy and began preparing her own grab bag with essentials for both herself and her new pet.
She assembled the emergency bag on the night of January 14. Without a mamad (safe room) in her building, Bookman said she understands that time is critical when heading to the building’s miklat (bomb shelter).
“Pretty much everyone has their bag that they bring down with them [ready],” she told the Post. “We recently got a dog, and it was a new experience trying to think about what he would need in such a situation. I packed him a large container of food, a dog bowl and water, his vaccination record, a couple of potty pads because he's young, wipes, and a bone with the hopes I remember to grab whatever toy he's playing with at the time a siren might go off.”
KeepOlim's 24/7 support hotline
Susan Cohen, the director of the 24/7 Tikva emotional support hotline run by the NGO KeepOlim, confirmed to the Post that they had received an increased number of calls over the past few days in which people voiced concerns about an impending war.
“Our call handlers are reporting an increasing number of calls from Olim experiencing heightened anxiety, fear, and emotional distress, particularly from individuals who were traumatized during the previous war and are now finding that unresolved trauma is being reactivated by renewed uncertainty and threat,” Cohen confirmed.
“Alongside this surge in crisis calls, requests for Tikva’s low-cost therapy services are also increasing, as more Olim recognise the importance of ongoing therapeutic support to help them cope emotionally during this period of instability,” Cohen continued.

Dead, 11-ton humpback whale washes up on California beach as officials warn locals to stay away: ‘It’s massive’
Officials say the whale’s carcass could shift unexpectedly in the surf

A dead, 11-ton humpback whale washed onto a popular beach in California this week, prompting officials to warn locals to stay away from its “massive” carcass.
A massive 29-foot whale carcass washed ashore on a bustling portion of Newport Beach, located about 45 miles south of Los Angeles, on Wednesday afternoon, a Pacific Marine Mammal Center spokesperson told The Independent Thursday.
The subadult whale weighs approximately 11 tons, or 23,000 pounds, the center said.
Dangerous ocean conditions and strong winds on Wednesday prevented crews from immediately removing the whale from the beach.
“The stormy ocean conditions and rising tide make the whale a public safety concern, as the large body could roll onto bystanders who are too close,” the Pacific Marine Mammal Center said in a statement.
In addition to being a safety concern, humpback whales are a protected species under the Marine Mammal Protection Act of 1972, which requires the public to stay at least 100 yards or 300 feet away at all times.
“The salvage boat can’t even do it because the weather is still extreme out in the outer water, and it’s too dangerous to tow,” Newport Beach Lifeguard Chief Brian O’Rourke told the Orange County Register.
Officials hope higher tides and an upcoming storm system could pull the whale back out to sea. But if that does not happen, crews may need to cut the animal into sections to haul it away. “We’re working on a plan to dispose of it,” O’Rourke told the outlet. “For it to just decay on the beach would cause a lot of different problems.”
Authorities also warned the public to stay at least 200 feet away from the massive carcass, noting the whale’s body could shift unexpectedly in the surf.
“Just please stay away from it right now until we can get the salvage disposal of the whale underway,” O’Rourke said. “It’s massive; there could be some danger to the public, it’s rolling away from the surfline.”
“It could cause damage, even crush them,” he warned. “That’s a possibility in a dangerous situation.”
The cause of the whale’s death is currently unknown.
Staff with the Pacific Marine Mammal Center will do a preliminary assessment followed by a necropsy, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration spokesman Michael Milstein told the Orange County Register.
Plans to remove the whale remain up in the air as officials monitor ocean conditions and the weather.

Hamas allegedly asked Mansour Abbas to ensure Netanyahu's re-election ahead of October 7 - report

Hamas had allegedly unsuccessfully attempted to influence Ra’am head Mansour Abbas to join a government led by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in 2021, Israeli journalist Amit Segal reported on Thursday.
According to Segal, a senior Hamas official had called Ra'am leader Mansour Abbas from Qatar, allegedly demanding he aid Netanyahu retain the premiership.
The official reportedly believed that "Netanyahu was looking for continued calm and quiet understandings, while a new government would be dragged into an operation in the Gaza Strip."
Former prime minister Naftali Bennett then backed Segal's claim on X/Twitter, emphasizing that "this is not a claim made by political rivals, it is not a theory, these are the facts that Amit Segal has just exposed."
"The same senior Hamas official explicitly asked Abbas not to join Bennett, because they were afraid of a government led by me and knew it would not allow them to arm themselves and slaughter us, as they did on October 7."
Bennett invited Smotrich to 2021 gov't before Arab party
On Thursday, Bennett said he would not boycott National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir (Otzma Yehudit) and Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich (Religious Zionist Party), according to leaked recordings released that day.
The comments sparked speculation that he would be willing to form a government with right-wing party leaders after the upcoming elections, scheduled to take place no later than October.
Regarding his term as prime minister that began in 2021, Bennett said he had invited Smotrich to join his government.
“If Smotrich had come, there would have been no need to rely on an Arab party,” he said. “But he preferred that I rely on an Arab party so that he could get angry about it, rather than come and be part of the solution. So, this boycott needs to be broken.”
Bennett became prime minister in June 2021 and entered a rotation government with opposition leader Yair Lapid (Yesh Atid). His government was the first in Israel’s history to include an Arab party.
It added the Ra’am Party to the coalition in a controversial move that is cited in the current round of elections.

WASHINGTON
US Secretary of State Marco Rubio sought to rally support for an ongoing ceasefire in the besieged Gaza Strip, telling member states of President Donald Trump's Board of Peace that "there is no plan B."
"We have to get this right. There is no plan B for Gaza. Plan B is going back to war. No one here wants that," Rubio said as leaders and senior officials assembled for the board's inaugural meeting.
"Plan A, the only path forward, is one that rebuilds Gaza in a way of enduring and sustainable peace, where everyone can live there, side by side with one another, and never worry again about returning to conflict, to war, to human suffering and to destruction," he added.
The Board of Peace was established within the framework of efforts toward a peaceful settlement in the Gaza Strip. It has since expanded to promote peacemaking around the world. Washington has said additional states have since joined the initiative.
A US-backed ceasefire agreement has been in place in Gaza since Oct. 10, halting Israel’s two-year onslaught that has killed more than 72,000 people, mostly women and children, and injured over 171,000 since October 2023.
Despite the ceasefire, Israeli forces have committed hundreds of violations through shelling and gunfire, killing 611 Palestinians and injuring 1,630, according to Gaza’s Health Ministry.

Britain’s typically pro-royal public welcomed the arrest of the former prince Andrew, whose friendship with convicted US sex offender Jeffrey Epstein has turned him into an outcast.
Some on Thursday appeared delighted that police were holding King Charles’ brother, arguing it sent the right message that the royal family was not above the law.
US President Donald Trump, meanwhile, called the arrest “very sad”.

“I think it’s a shame. I think it’s very sad. I think it’s so bad for the royal family. It’s very, very sad,” Trump told reporters on Air Force One.
The former prince, who became the first senior British royal in modern history to be arrested, is accused of sharing sensitive information with Epstein while serving as the UK’s trade envoy.

Teens arrested over shooting of former NRL star, alleged attacks on son

Teens arrested over shooting of former NRL star, alleged attacks on son
Updated ,first published
Four teenagers, including a 16-year-old boy, have been arrested over a spate of violent incidents allegedly targeting former NRL star Matt Utai’s son Iziah, whom police say is at the centre of an escalating gangland conflict between an emerging Sydney gang and the notorious Alameddine crime family.
Detectives from the newly formed Strike Force Halesowen on Thursday raided six properties in Riverwood, Guildford, Lilyfield, Villawood and Auburn, arresting two 19-year-old men, an 18-year-old man and a 16-year-old boy over the shooting of Utai and the firebombing and shooting of homes linked to his 24-year-old son.
Matt Utai, a member of the Canterbury Bulldogs’ premiership-winning side in 2004, was shot outside his Greenacre home in a “brazen ambush” on Tuesday morning.
Detectives on Thursday charged a 16-year-old boy with being an accessory after the fact to the attempted murder of Utai, who was shot in the chest and leg as he walked to his car parked outside the home he shares with his wife and children about 6am. Detectives are yet to speak with the 44-year-old, who remains in a coma, and has been moved to a different hospital from where he was initially treated.
The boy was also charged with supplying a pistol to a person not authorised to possess it and participating in a criminal group. Police will allege he helped Utai’s shooter conceal the pistol used in the attack. He was refused bail to appear in a children’s court on Friday.
Detectives also charged Khaldoun Khazma, 19, who they allege drove the gunman, who is yet to be arrested, from Utai’s house after the shooting. He was charged with being an accessory after the fact to Utai’s attempted murder and participating in a criminal group. Khazma did not apply for bail in Parramatta Local Court on Friday. He was remanded in custody to face the same court on February 24.
Police believe the teenagers were contracted to carry out the shootings and firebombing of Iziah Utai’s home and were working as part of a “criminal for hire group”.
Detectives believe Utai was targeted because of his son’s alleged involvement with the self-proclaimed Coconut Cartel, a “violent criminal organisation” that has been engaged in an increasingly violent feud over control of Sydney’s lucrative drug market.
Less than 24 hours after his father was shot, Iziah Utai’s Guildford West home was set alight, while a St Clair property linked to him was sprayed with bullets.
A video circulated throughout Sydney’s underworld and published by SCN Worldstar shows a person setting the front of the Guildford West property alight.
“F--- him and the Coconut Cartel … this is the start of the destruction,” a person says in the video.
In December, several shots were fired at the same home. Two women and a child were inside at the time but were uninjured. Last May, Iziah Utai’s Merrylands barbershop was firebombed twice in two days.
Detectives on Thursday also arrested Mohamad Hussein, 18, and Issa Rijab, 19, over the fire, charging both with damaging property and participating in a criminal group. Hussein was granted conditional police bail to appear in Bankstown Local Court on March 10.
Rijab was also charged with drug supply offences related to a kilogram of cocaine allegedly found at his Villawood home. He was refused police bail to appear in Bankstown Local Court on Friday.
On Friday, Rijab asked to be released on bail - his lawyer cited his young age, risk of institutionalisation and police co-operation as reasons he should be released. But he was refused bail and ordered to front Burwood Local Court on April 19.
No arrests have been made over the St Clair shooting. Video published by SCN Worldstar shows several shots being fired at the front of the Menzies Circuit home from a high-powered rifle.
Police are still hunting the two people believed to have been involved in the Matt Utai’s shooting, and a third person involved in the firebombing of Iziah Utai’s home, Detective Acting Superintendent Brad Abdy, the acting commander of NSW Police’s Raptor Squad, said.
Iziah Utai left Australia shortly after senior underworld figure Dawood Zakaria was killed in a botched assassination attempt on one of his associates in May, and is believed to be residing overseas. A warrant for Iziah Utai’s arrest in relation to Zakaria’s murder has been issued.
Police allegedly seized three vehicles, knuckle dusters, electronic devices and items of clothing during Thursday’s raids.
The Coconut Cartel has emerged as the main rival of the Alameddine crime family, which police have long alleged controls Sydney’s illicit drug market. The Coconut Cartel is believed to be comprised of young men, including many of Pacific Islander descent, who have defected from the Alameddine network as it has fractured over several years.
Utai’s shooting and the targeting of homes linked to his son marked the most significant escalation of the conflict and sparked the establishment of Strike Force Halesowen, a 100-strong police taskforce to quell the violent feud.
The conflict between the two groups has been escalating since the splintering of the Alameddine network after several senior members defected from the group to form their own rival crime syndicate.
The defections sparked a gangland war and a series of retaliatory shootings in which several people were injured or killed. Police have not publicly linked that conflict to the current feud between the Alameddine network and the Coconut Cartel.
“It’s extremely serious,” Abdy said.
“We’ve seen one man shot, we’ve seen a house firebombed, and we’ve seen the shooting of another house.”

Deal or war: Trump’s 10-day clock on Iran
Unknown
Unknown Publisher
2026-02-19
21:40:44 UTC
06:40:44 KST

After a day and a half in which a U.S. strike on Iran appeared imminent, and following the Islamic Republic’s decision to close its airspace ahead of what it described as “extensive missile launches,” Washington sought to cool war tensions and made clear — at least publicly — that the door to a deal had not closed.
“Maybe we’re going to make a deal. You’re going to be finding out over the next 10 days,” U.S. President Donald Trump said Thursday, at the height of the first gathering of the Board of Peace Council he established.
He said talks with Iran were “good,” but stressed that a “meaningful deal” must be reached. “It’s proven to be, over the years, not easy to make a meaningful deal with Iran. We have to make a meaningful deal, otherwise bad things happen,” he said.
In what appeared to be an ultimatum to Tehran, Trump added: “Now, we may have to take it a step further — or we may not. Maybe we’re going to make a deal.”
Trump also emphasized his efforts to promote peace worldwide, saying, “There's nothing more important than peace, and there's nothing less expensive than peace. You know, when you go to wars, it costs you 100 times what it costs to make peace.”
Shortly afterward, Trump was asked about a deadline for Iran and replied, “I would think that would be enough time — 10, 15 days, pretty much maximum.”
'A beautiful armada' vs. diplomacy
But the American president’s remarks were received with considerable skepticism across the Middle East. In fact, the contrast between his words and the actions the United States — under his leadership — has taken could hardly be sharper.
On one side were smiles and handshakes at the inaugural session of the Board of Peace in Washington, where Trump announced billions of dollars in funding for Gaza’s reconstruction, praised the prime minister of Qatar and declared: “There's nothing more important than peace.”
On the other side was the largest U.S. military buildup seen in the region in years — the “beautiful armada” Trump dispatched, including hundreds of fighter jets, more than 10 warships, submarines and aircraft carriers, already positioned for offensive and defensive operations in the Middle East and the Persian Gulf.
Remarks made just a day earlier by White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt reflected the same dual message, even as she qualified her comments. “There are many reasons and arguments that one could make for a strike against Iran,” she said, adding that “diplomacy is always [Trump's] first option.”
The planned visit next weekend by U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio to Israel for talks with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was also seen as a signal that strikes were not necessarily imminent. According to a State Department official, the purpose of the meeting is to update Netanyahu on U.S. negotiations with Iran, though that does not rule out military action beforehand.
In June of last year, during the 12-day war between Iran and Israel, the United States joined strikes on Iran in the midst of ongoing talks and while awaiting Iranian responses, much as it is now.
In effect, Trump’s strategy in recent days appears to be one of extremes. At one end, he is offering Tehran a path to avoid powerful strikes if it agrees to his conditions for a deal. At the other, he is signaling the possibility of war, with all tools and full force.
“He is investing a great deal of time in thinking this through,” officials said, even as warnings circulated that the “window of opportunity may be closing.”
In the Middle East, winds of war still blow
Meanwhile, Israel is not waiting for Iran’s response in the negotiations. Despite concerns about miscalculation — reportedly a factor in postponing a meeting of the Security Cabinet — officials are preparing for a scenario of direct confrontation that would include missile launches from Iran toward Israeli territory.
In recent restricted discussions led by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, the working assumption has been that Iran would fire missiles at Israel even if the IDF does not participate in any U.S. strike. As a result, emergency services and the Home Front Command have been instructed to prepare for war. Various security agencies have declared their highest level of defensive alert, and the defense establishment is clearly on edge.
Netanyahu said Thursday that “alongside all the tremendous achievements, it is important to remember that the Middle East is at a crossroads. The extremists refuse to give up and are reorganizing to challenge us. We are prepared and alert to defend ourselves against any challenge, and we are operating in close coordination with our ally, the United States.”
Regarding the U.S.-Iran talks, he added: “I clarified to my friend Trump the principles that, in Israel’s view, must guide the negotiations with Iran. We are prepared for any scenario. If the ayatollahs attack, they will experience a response they cannot even imagine.”
Even before cooling messages emerged from U.S. officials, Israeli assessments Wednesday were that a decisive moment was approaching, with timelines shrinking to a matter of days. Two Israeli officials told CNN that Israel had raised its level of alert and accelerated military preparations amid “growing indications” of a possible joint U.S.-Israeli strike on Iran in the coming days.
According to one military source cited, Israel has sped up both its operational and defensive planning. If approved by Trump, the anticipated campaign “would go beyond the 12-day war and include coordinated strikes by the United States and Israel,” one source said.
In Iran, meanwhile, officials appeared unmoved by efforts to dial down tensions. Despite the massive U.S. naval and air forces positioned in the region, Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei threatened to sink American aircraft carriers. At the same time, Iran has reinforced defenses around key regime facilities and is conducting military exercises.
According to assessments, Yemen’s Houthi rebels are expected to join the fighting immediately, launching missiles and drones toward Israel. There is also a credible scenario in which Hezbollah would not remain on the sidelines and, unlike during the 12-day war, would contribute to the confrontation this time.
The targets inside Iran
Between Washington’s cooling rhetoric and the winds of war blowing across the Middle East, President Trump appears to believe that the threat of military pressure could shift Iran’s defiant negotiating stance. If not, operational plans for large-scale strikes are likely already in place, with Israel and the United States closely coordinated. Drawing lessons from the 12-day war, senior officers from both countries reportedly spent weeks reviewing maps, aerial imagery and intelligence together.
The first and most urgent objective would likely be to cripple Iran’s air defense systems and establish air superiority — for Israeli forces and especially for U.S. aircraft. Another immediate target would be the ayatollah regime’s ballistic missile arsenal. Israel would prioritize destroying long-range missiles that threaten its territory, while the United States would focus on medium- and short-range missiles capable of targeting U.S. forces in the Gulf and regional allies. Washington would also almost certainly seek to dismantle Iran’s drone network, which could inflict damage on American assets.
Another key objective would be the naval forces of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, which pose a threat to U.S. ships. Neutralizing that fleet would be essential if Washington aims to eliminate Iran’s ability to disrupt or close the Strait of Hormuz.
Israel’s goal would be to focus on defending against Iran and its proxies while preparing for potential action against Hezbollah in Lebanon and the Houthis in Yemen. Israeli planning is aimed at removing the missile threat once and for all.
It remains an open question whether Israel or the United States would use a strike to inflict further damage on Iran’s nuclear facilities. Another possibility is that one or both would attempt to target Iran’s so-called “missile cities,” underground tunnel complexes used to store and launch ballistic missiles.
Missile defense is another critical factor. Israel and the United States are likely coordinating closely on air defense and efforts to intercept ballistic missiles Iran may launch toward regional targets and Israel. One of Israel’s requests to Washington has been to bolster air defense systems.
Unlike the 12-day war, this time additional countries may assist Israel in intercepting missiles. In contrast to last year’s conflict, which Israel initiated, a broader confrontation could create incentives for neighboring states and European countries to participate in missile defense efforts.

Megan Keller's spectacular overtime strike earned the USA the Olympic women's ice hockey gold medal with a 2-1 win over defending champions Canada on Thursday, February 19. It was the first time the Americans have won the women's title since the 2018 Pyeongchang Games.
Keller skillfully deked a Canadian defender and beat goaltender Ann-Renee Desbiens just over four minutes into overtime. Her goal sparked huge celebrations on the Team USA bench and among the thousands of US fans in the Santagiulia Arena in Milan. "I'm lost for words. This is an incredible feeling. I love these girls so much," Keller said. "This group deserves it. Just the effort and the faith that we kept through this four-year journey is something very special."
In a tight final, Canada struck first through Kristin O'Neill's backhander on a shorthanded play early in the second period, breaking the Americans' 351-minute shutout streak at these Games. Just as the Canadians appeared to be heading to victory, Hilary Knight pulled the USA level with a shot from center ice to send the final into overtime. Her dramatic strike with just over two minutes left in regulation gave Knight a record of 15 goals scored at the Olympics by a US woman.
Keller ensured the USA didn't need the 20-minute overtime in operation for the Olympic finals as she used exquisite skill to win the game before being mobbed by her teammates as US head coach John Wroblewski wept with joy. Earlier, Switzerland won the bronze medal by defeating Sweden 2-1.

WASHINGTON
The US is "grateful" to every member of President Donald Trump's Board of Peace for their participation, Vice President JD Vance said Thursday.
Vance said he believes the newly-created board is "fundamentally about making the peace stick, and it's an incredible thing that you guys have all done."
"To all of the leaders gathered here today who are investing in the future, who are investing in peace, we're grateful to you. We're grateful for your partnership," Vance said during the board's inaugural meeting in Washington, DC.
"In particular, I think, to the president of Azerbaijan and the prime minister of Armenia, who I just saw last week, thank you all for making it possible and for showing what real leadership can accomplish. When you set aside weapons and killing and destruction and invest in your people and invest in prosperity, it can create great things. So thank you both for what you did," he added.
The Board of Peace was established within the framework of efforts toward a peaceful settlement in the Gaza Strip. It has since expanded to promote peacemaking around the world. Washington has said additional states have since joined the initiative.
A US-backed ceasefire agreement has been in place in Gaza since Oct. 10, halting Israel’s two-year onslaught that has killed more than 72,000 people, mostly women and children, and injured over 171,000 since October 2023.
Despite the ceasefire, Israeli forces have committed hundreds of violations through shelling and gunfire, killing 611 Palestinians and injuring 1,630, according to Gaza’s Health Ministry.

Tensions flare between France, Italy leaders over killing of French far-right activist
Sign up now: Get ST's newsletters delivered to your inbox
PARIS - A war of words erupted between French President Emmanuel Macron and Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni on Feb 19 over the killing of a French far-right activist
Seven people, including an assistant to a member of parliament from the far-left France Unbowed (LFI), will face murder charges in the case, a prosecutor said on Feb 19. They were among 11 arrested
Ms Meloni, a conservative, said on social media on Feb 18 that the killing “by groups linked to left-wing extremism... is a wound for all of Europe.”
That triggered an angry response from Mr Macron on Feb 19, who told reporters during a visit to India: “I'm always struck by how people who are nationalists, who don’t want to be bothered in their own country, are always the first ones to comment on what's happening in other countries.”
Asked if his remarks referred to Ms Meloni, Mr Macron replied: “You got that right.”
Mr Macron, a pro-Europe centrist, and Ms Meloni, one of US President Donald Trump’s closest European allies, have sparred in the past over issues ranging from the conflict in Ukraine to trade and European policy.
The killing of Quentin Deranque, 23, during the Lyon clashes has caused uproar in France, damaging the LFI and allowing the far-right National Rally to depict itself as a victim of deadly extremist violence.
Lyon prosecutor Thierry Dran said Jacques-Elie Favrot, an assistant to LFI lawmaker Raphael Arnault, faces charges of complicity through instigation and was put in pre-trial detention.
Favrot and the other suspects deny the accusations, he added.
Mr Arnault said earlier this week that the aide had “stopped all parliamentary work”.
Favrot’s lawyer said his client has acknowledged committing violence and being present at the site, but said he was not “the author of the blows that caused the death of Mr Deranque.”
In response to Mr Macron’s criticism of Ms Meloni, the Italian Prime Minister’s office issued a statement expressing astonishment at the comments, saying Ms Meloni had “expressed her deep sorrow and dismay at the tragic killing of young Quentin Deranque.” REUTERS

Cherished teacher mourned following deadly crash with driver who was being pursued by ICE
Kindergarten and first grade students at a Georgia school are mourning their teacher days after she was killed by a driver who authorities say was fleeing federal immigration officers
- Bookmark
The kindergarten and first grade students in Linda Davis' classes sobbed and shed tears after being told their teacher, who greeted them most mornings with an infectious smile, wouldn't be coming back.
Davis, 52, was killed during her morning commute Monday, less than a half mile (0.8 kilometers) from the school where she taught students with special needs. Local and federal authorities say a Guatemalan man crashed his pickup truck into Davis’ car as he was fleeing a traffic stop by immigration officers.
“It was extremely difficult to tell 5 and 6 year olds that the teacher they loved and cherished will not be returning to see them,” said Alonna McMullen, principal of Herman W. Hesse K-8 School in Savannah's southside suburbs. “To see the looks on their faces, it broke my heart."
Teachers at Hesse were trying Thursday to create a normal routine for the students, but their grief remained fresh.
Many on their drives to and from school every day pass the crash site where a cross made from red roses and several bouquets of flowers have been left in the median. A paper sign on the ground reads: “Rest In Peace & Power, Dr. Davis.”
Students in Davis' two special education classes drew pictures of her to help deal with news of her death. And faculty crafted banners in her memory to display at the school's home basketball game Thursday.
‘A vacuum of compounded grief’
Davis began teaching at Hesse in September after the school year had begun. Her upbeat personality and her dedication to helping students with special needs thrive soon endeared her to fellow teachers and students alike.
“Even the most difficult students, she knew how to make them shine,” McMullen told reporters.
Davis had been teaching in the Savannah area since 2022. Outside of work, she was raising four children of her own and was guardian to a fifth, according to her sister, Felicia Jackson.
“The preventable, sudden, and violent loss of her presence and love has created a vacuum of compounded grief so vast it feels as though it fills the Mariana Trench,” Jackson said in a social media post.
Standing nearly 6 feet tall, Davis “filled her house with laughter and music,” Jackson said, recalling how her sister loved singing Disney songs and show tunes with her children “at the tops of their lungs.”
“That was Linda: fully alive, engaged, and loving,” Jackson wrote.
Local officials question whether ICE pursuit was necessary
Federal immigration officers have faced increased scrutiny for their aggressive tactics during the Trump administration’s nationwide crackdown on illegal immigration, especially since they shot and killed Renee Good and Alex Pretti in Minneapolis.
Savannah Mayor Van Johnson and Chester Ellis, chairman of the Chatham County Board of Commissioners, have questioned whether the pursuit that ended in Davis' death was necessary.
A spokesperson for U.S. Customs and Immigration Enforcement, Lindsay Williams, said the fleeing driver had no criminal history but was in the U.S. illegally.
Security camera video from outside the school Monday morning shows a red pickup truck speeding past the school, followed several seconds later by two law enforcement vehicles with flashing lights.
Authorities identified the driver of the truck as Oscar Vasquez Lopez, 38. He suffered minor injuries, according to police, and has been jailed on charges including vehicular homicide and driving without a valid license.
ICE officers pulled over Lopez to enforce an immigration judge’s 2024 deportation order, Williams said, and Lopez drove away as the officers approached his vehicle. ICE said in a news release that Lopez crashed into Davis' car after making a U-turn and running a stop light.
“He is presumed innocent, and the court process will determine the outcome,” said Don Plummer, a spokesman for the Georgia Public Defender Council, which has an attorney representing Lopez.

Skiers stranded by California avalanche used iPhone SOS feature to seek help

California’s deadliest avalanche killed at least eight people in a ski group near Lake Tahoe on Tuesday. The six survivors used the iPhone’s emergency SOS feature to help first responders find them as they waited under a tarp and discovered some of the bodies, according to the Nevada county sheriff. Apple’s feature, introduced in 2022, allows users to text law enforcement, even if there’s no cell service or wifi by connecting the phone to a satellite.
First responders reached the skiers’ location and learned of the six survivors based on conversations held through the feature, Sheriff Shannan Moon said at a press conference on Wednesday.
California office of emergency services law enforcement chief Don O’Keefe said his staff spoke with one of the stranded guides for more than four hours to relay information to the sheriff’s office, which was leading rescue efforts. O’Keefe’s agency said in an emailed statement that this communication occurred through a personal locator beacon that had the ability to text; these compact devices also tap into satellite signals to allow communication in an emergency.
Law enforcement reported that a ninth person from the group of 15 is still missing, though presumed dead. Three were instructors with Blackbird Mountain Guides, and six were clients.
The iPhone’s emergency SOS feature is free for two years after purchasing an iPhone 14 or any later model and activating it. If a call to emergency services doesn’t go through, the smartphone links with a satellite and allows users to text relevant agencies. Onscreen instructions can guide a user on how to connect. Apple notes that users will have a better chance of doing so if they are “outside with a clear view of the sky and horizon”. Once connected, the iPhone shares key information with emergency responders, including Medical ID and emergency contact if that information is added before losing service, as well as location, including elevation and remaining battery life.
This isn’t the first time Apple’s emergency SOS feature has helped users in crisis. The tech has reportedly been used to help law enforcement rescue a man who suffered a serious ankle injury in a California forest, stranded hikers in Oregon and Colorado and two people who were in a car crash in Canada.

Apartment building damaged during Russian offensive in spring 2022 restored in Bucha
According to Ukrinform, the head of the regional military administration, Mykola Kalashnyk, announced this on Telegram.
"The building, which suffered severe destruction due to shelling, has now been fully restored and put back into operation," Kalashnyk said.
1 / 5At the beginning of the full-scale invasion, parts of the walls and floors were destroyed, the attic and roof were damaged, interior premises and utility networks were ruined, and windows and doors were blown out. In effect, part of the building had to be rebuilt from scratch.
"Today, children's voices can once again be heard in the renovated apartments, residents are arranging their homes and making plans for the future. This is the best proof that the community is being revived," Kalashnyk said.
He noted that it is symbolic that just yesterday a veteran support center, "Veteran PRO," was opened in the same building – a hub to assist servicemen and servicewomen and their families.
"Where the enemy tried to sow fear and destruction, a place of strength, mutual support, and new opportunities is now being created. In total, 3,189 residential properties were damaged in the Bucha community – 2,728 private houses and 461 apartment buildings. As of today, 2,055 private homes and 331 apartment buildings have already been restored. Work continues daily," Kalashnyk said.
He stressed that the community's reconstruction is the result of joint efforts by the state, regional authorities, local self-government, and international partners. Funding has come from state, regional, and local budgets, as well as donor support. It is a shared responsibility and a shared achievement.
"Bucha is one of the communities that suffered the most during the occupation. The memory of the tragic months of 2022 will remain forever. At the same time, the community is confidently recovering. Together, we are restoring not only buildings – we are returning people to normal life," Kalashnyk added.

Oxfam to halt Gaza aid over Israeli NGO Rules, as ex-CEO alleges pressure to say 'genocide'
Unknown

06:30:52 KST

Israel's Diaspora Affairs Ministry announced this week that the British-based NGO Oxfam will cease operations in Gaza after its Israeli registration lapses, part of a broader move affecting 37 international aid groups that refused to comply with new government data-sharing requirements.
The announcement came as the ministry also highlighted a recent interview on Britain's Channel 4 in which Oxfam's former CEO, Halima Begum, alleged the organization had disproportionately focused on the Israel-Gaza war and faced internal pressure to label it a genocide before sufficient legal review – claims Oxfam strongly denies.
Oxfam, which is comprised of 21 affiliates operating all over the world, was included on a list released in late December of organizations whose Israeli registration was set to lapse, meaning that they would have to halt their work in Gaza, the West Bank and East Jerusalem.
The organizations listed, 37 in all, refused to comply with new registration requirements that went into effect on January 1, including providing the Israeli government with the personal information of their employees working in the Palestinian territories, many of whom are Palestinians themselves.
"INGOs cannot transfer sensitive personal data to a party to the conflict since this would breach humanitarian principles, duty of care and data protection obligations," a statement from Oxfam released in January read. "This is not a technical or administrative matter, but a deliberate policy choice with foreseeable consequences. If registrations are allowed to lapse, the Israeli government will obstruct humanitarian assistance at scale."
Bushra Khalidi, Oxfam's policy lead in the Palestinian territories, explains that in Gaza, the organization does a lot of work on water and wastewater infrastructure. They "work with the local municipalities to deliver water, to provide technical support," she told Haaretz. They also work with the private sector and groups like the Palestinian Farmers Union.
The deregistration will not significantly upend their operations, she said. "We've known about this coming for the last year, so from our perspective, we've been kind of preparing for the last 12 months for how we're going to handle this."
Oxfam's method of having local partners lead in executing projects will help them survive. "But a lot of our peers do direct implementation and rely on direct implementation, and their activities will certainly cease if they have not already," she said of organizations that execute the projects by themselves.
"When journalists ask me, 'What are the implications of your organization's closure in Gaza?' I say, 'Well, okay, I guess people will be swimming in more sewage.' The bar is so low right now. The implications are terrible already," she said.
The question, Khalidi said, should not be what will happen to organizations that are deregistered, but what could happen if they were to be allowed to work unhindered. "I'd love to imagine a world where actually we could operate in Gaza without our operations getting attacked by Israel, our convoys not getting bombed, our colleagues not getting killed, our items not rejected and just blocked at the crossing … What would that do to the population of Gaza?"
The Diaspora Ministry, in the same statement, pivoted to highlight another controversy regarding Oxfam. "On a separate but related note," it read, before discussing a recent interview given by the organization's former CEO, Dr. Halima Begum.
The interview was given by the organization's former CEO, Halima Begum, to the United Kingdom's Channel 4. Begum alleged that Oxfam paid disproportionate attention to the Israel-Gaza war and pushed to brand it a genocide before receiving evidence or proper legal counsel.
Begum told Channel 4 that "It's important to obviously work around the rule of law and maintain that the international rule of law must not be compromised, but we have to show consistency with other crises that are taking place in the world, and it always felt as though we were disproportionately working around the crisis in Gaza."
"But other examples include quite strong push back when we were not ready yet to use the word 'genocide'" in relation to Gaza, "because to use the word genocide, it has to be something that we arrive at with consultation and evidence and good legal advice. To try and use that term before we're ready as an organization feels quite risky to me."
The statement quoted Diaspora Affairs Minister Amichai Chikli as stating, "Dr. Begum herself, who is Muslim, has been a vocal critic of the State of Israel. Therefore, when she testifies about the level of antisemitism within the organization and levels these accusations herself, her remarks should resonate around the world all the more."
Oxfam denied Begum's accusations. In response to the interview, Oxfam said: "The claims made in the broadcast represent one individual's perspective and are strongly disputed by Oxfam Great Britain as unsubstantiated and inaccurate," it read. "We have a zero-tolerance approach to discrimination, harassment and abuse of power in all areas of our work – including racism, antisemitism, sexism and homophobia. These standards apply across the delivery of our programs worldwide."
It added that its institutional position on Israel and the Palestinian territories "has been clear and consistent for decades," and that the decision to use the word "genocide" was made "only after a thorough legal review and following widespread research and consideration of credible analysis by organizations and experts mandated to make such legal verdicts such as the International Court of Justice, the UN Commission of Inquiry and Amnesty International."

Opinion | It’s time for global governance to reflect the new realities
Despite international tensions, countries still seek cooperation based on shared interests. Institutions must embrace this trend
However, that order was designed for a world shaped by bipolar rivalry and later sustained by American predominance. Today’s global system looks very different: economically diffuse, environmentally constrained and politically fragmented but deeply interconnected by both trade and technology.
Meanwhile, rising populism in Western countries seeks to tear down multilateral structures perceived as holding back national prosperity.
Yet multilateral institutions remain anchored in yesterday’s distribution of power, while today’s challenges – climate change, digital fragmentation, supply-chain insecurity, debt distress and geopolitical rivalry – demand frameworks that reflect contemporary realities. Global governance has struggled to keep pace with these changes.
That old architecture was built for a world of steel, grain and territorial sovereignty. The system now finds itself confronting problems driven by data flows, artificial intelligence, cross-border platforms, atmospheric physics and globally integrated capital markets. Governance remains predominantly state-centric, while value creation and systemic risk increasingly transcend borders and sectors.

Elderly couple found dead at Dutch holiday park in suspected suicide
Municipality says couple had been in contact with authorities over residency rules at holiday park
ISTANBUL
The bodies of an elderly couple, believed to have died by suicide, were found at a holiday park in the southeastern Netherlands, local authorities said Thursday.
Emergency services responded to an alert at around 2.30 pm local time at the Posterbos holiday park in Posterholt, near the city of Roermond, where they found two bodies near a pond, one in the water and the other at the water’s edge, Dutch news broadcaster NOS reported.
Police later examined the couple’s home and quickly determined that “no foul play had taken place.”
Regional broadcaster L1 Nieuws also reported that the victims were a German couple, both over 80, who had lived at the park for decades.
Roerdalen Mayor Monique de Boer-Van Agtmaal said the pair had been undergoing a municipal “care process” because they were living permanently at the holiday park, which is not permitted under local regulations.
She noted there had been “positive contact” with them about a week and a half before the incident.
“They were in need of help and were open to the assistance we offered,” the mayor said, adding that it will likely never be clear whether there is any link between the suspected suicide and the municipality’s strict enforcement policy on permanent residence.
Authorities in Roerdalen have stepped up monitoring of holiday parks and warned residents that stays are limited to six months. Those exceeding the limit may face fines of up to €30,000 (approximately $35,000) and enforcement measures.
Officials said the investigation is ongoing, though emergency services are treating the case as a suicide.

Keller seizes gold for US women's ice hockey team in stunning overtime goal
Megan Keller on Thursday won gold for the US's Olympic women's ice hockey team with a strike just over four minutes into overtime to seal a 2-1 victory over defending champions Canada.
Megan Keller captured gold for the US's Olympic women's ice hockey team with a stunning overtime strike to seal a 2-1 victory over defending champions Canada on Thursday.
It was the first time the Americans have won the women's title since the 2018 Pyeongchang Games.
Keller skilfully deked a Canadian defender and beat goaltender Ann-Renee Desbiens just over four minutes into overtime.
Her goal sparked huge celebrations on the Team US bench and among the thousands of US fans in the Santagiulia Arena in Milan.
"I'm lost for words. This is an incredible feeling. I love these girls so much," Keller said. "This group deserves it. Just the effort and the faith that we kept through this four-year journey is something very special."
In a tight final, Canada struck first through Kristin O'Neill's backhander on a shorthanded play early in the second period, breaking the Americans' 351-minute shutout streak at these Games.

Just as the Canadians appeared to be heading to victory, Hilary Knight pulled the USA level with a shot from centre ice to send the final into overtime.
Her dramatic strike with just over two minutes left in regulation gave Knight a record of 15 goals scored at Olympics by a US woman.
Keller ensured the USA didn't need the 20-minute overtime in operation for Olympic finals as she used exquisite skill to win the game before being mobbed by her teammates as US head coach John Wroblewski wept with joy.
The Americans have now won three of the eight titles since women's ice hockey entered the Games in 1998, with Canada winning the other five.
Earlier, Switzerland won the bronze medal by defeating Sweden 2-1.

The Mets will have a Bobby Valentine Disguise Night and hand out 15,000 fake mustache-glasses
Bobby Valentine won't necessarily be behind the sunglasses and fake mustache at Citi Field this summer
- Bookmark
That won't necessarily be Bobby Valentine behind the sunglasses and fake mustache at Citi Field this summer.
Among several promotions the New York Mets announced Thursday is a Bobby Valentine Disguise Night on May 29, inspired by what the former manager donned to return to the dugout after being ejected from a game in 1999. The giveaway for the first 15,000 fans will be a glasses-mustaches getup similar to what was worn by Valentine.
“I love it!,” Valentine wrote in a text to The Associated Press about the planned giveaway.
While Valentine went 536-467 as the Mets manager from 1996-2002, and helped guide them to the 2000 World Series, he is perhaps best remembered for the dugout disguise. The now 75-year-old former manager has even played into that over the years.
When Valentine was introduced during a Mets' Old-Timers' Day in 2022, he came out donning a fake mustache, drawing a loud chuckle from the crowd at Citi Field.
During a television broadcast of a Mets game at the Los Angeles Angels in 2024, Valentine did an in-game interview in the Angels booth wearing a disguise.
It was on June 9, 1999, that the excitable Valentine was ejected from a game against the Toronto Blue Jays. He was tossed in the 12th inning, but returned to the dugout with the fake mustache fashioned from eye black and sunglasses for the rest of the 4 1/2-hour game that the Mets won in 14 innings.
Valentine was later suspended for two games and fined $5,000 for the stunt.

Trump warns Iran of ‘bad things’ if no deal made,  sets deadline of 10-15 days

Trump warns Iran of ‘bad things’ if no deal made, sets deadline of 10-15 days
US president urges Iranians to reach a ‘meaningful’ deal, stresses Tehran can’t have nuclear weapons; Israel said on alert for Iranian preemptive attack
WASHINGTON — US President Donald Trump warned Iran on Thursday that it must reach a deal over its nuclear program or “bad things” will happen, and appeared to set a 10-15 day deadline before the US might take action.
Amid a massive US military buildup in the Middle East that has fueled fears of a wider war, Trump said negotiations with Iran were going well but insisted Tehran has to reach a “meaningful” agreement.
Trump has repeatedly threatened military action against Iran, at first over a deadly crackdown on anti-regime protesters last month that killed thousands, then more recently over its nuclear program. But he has refrained from setting a hard deadline for taking action.
Recalling the US strikes on Iran’s nuclear facilities in June during his remarks at the inaugural meeting of the Board of Peace, his initiative to secure stability in Gaza, Trump said, “Now, we may have to take it a step further — or we may not. Maybe we’re going to make a deal.”
“You’re going to be finding out over the next, probably 10 days,” Trump said.
Trump reiterated that Iran “can’t have a nuclear weapon.”
“You can’t have peace in the Middle East if they have a nuclear weapon,” he said.
“Now is the time for Iran to join us on a path that will complete what we’re doing,” Trump said.
“If they join us, that’ll be great. If they don’t join us, that’ll be great too. But it’ll be a very different path,” he continued. “They cannot continue to threaten the stability of the entire region.”
“They must make a deal. If that doesn’t happen… bad things will happen,” he added.
Later, speaking to reporters aboard Air Force One, Trump was asked about his deadline.
“I would think that would be enough time — 10, 15 days, pretty much maximum.”
“We’re either going to get a deal, or it’s going to be unfortunate for them,” Trump said.
Iran, which vows to destroy Israel, has resisted making major concessions on its nuclear program, which it insists is for peaceful purposes. However, it has enriched uranium to levels that have no civilian use and prevented United Nations atomic agency monitors from accessing some of its facilities. The US and Israel accuse Tehran of trying to develop a nuclear bomb.
Trump’s comments came shortly after Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu issued his own warning to Iran, saying, “If the ayatollahs make a mistake and attack us, they will receive a response they cannot even imagine.”
Israel is preparing for a hypothetical scenario in which Iran may attack Israel first amid the ongoing tensions between Tehran and the United States, the Kan public broadcaster reported.
The report did not cite any sources nor provide any further information as to why such a scenario would play out.
Kan did, however, cite Israeli security sources as saying that if Iran follows through on its threat to attack Israel in response to an American assault, Israel will also launch strikes on Iran — something that Israeli leaders have repeatedly publicly said.
Since January, the IDF has been on high alert and has carried out various preparations after Trump threatened military action against Iran against the backdrop of the regime’s killing of protesters.
Preparations have largely focused on the military’s air defense array, attack plans, intelligence, and the Home Front Command, according to the IDF.
The level of preparedness in the military is similar to that ahead of June 2025’s 12-day war with Iran, Kan reported, also without citing any sources. Israel launched strikes on Iranian nuclear sites, saying Iran had taken steps towards nuclear weaponization. Iran responded with missile barrages at Israeli military sites and cities. The US hit Iran on the last day of the war, then brokered a ceasefire
Earlier on Thursday, Russia warned against an “unprecedented escalation of tension” around Iran and urged restraint amid the US military buildup in the region, which a senior American official said should be complete by mid-March.
Trump has sent aircraft carriers, warships, and jets to the region, raising the prospect of another attack on the Islamic Republic. Hebrew media outlets reported that a US Air Force plane, used to command special forces operations, landed at Ben Gurion Airport near Tel Aviv on Thursday.
Washington wants Iran to entirely give up uranium enrichment, a process used to create fuel for atomic power plants but that can also provide material for a warhead.
The US and its ally Israel also want Iran to give up long-range ballistic missiles, stop supporting proxy militias around the Middle East, and stop using force to quell internal protests.
Iran says it refuses to discuss issues beyond the atomic file, calling efforts to limit its missile arsenal a red line.
Satellite pictures have tracked both Iranian work to repair and fortify sites since last summer, showing work at both nuclear and missile sites, as well as preparations at US bases across the Middle East over the past month.
Iranian and US negotiators met on Tuesday, and Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi said they had agreed on “guiding principles.” White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said on Wednesday, however, that the two sides remained apart on some issues.
In a sign of growing concern over the increased tensions, Poland on Thursday became the latest European country to urge its citizens to leave Iran, with Prime Minister Donald Tusk saying Poles may only have hours to evacuate.
Germany, meanwhile, moved troops out of northern Iraq, reducing its footprint to the minimum necessary to keep its base there functional, citing regional tensions.

New York governor pulls robotaxi expansion proposal for cities outside Big Apple

06:24:22 KST

New York’s governor, Kathy Hochul, has pulled her proposal to allow commercial robotaxi services in smaller cities outside New York City, a spokesperson for the governor said on Thursday.
“Based on conversations with stakeholders, including in the legislature, it was clear that the support was not there to advance this proposal,” the spokesperson said.
The move comes as a setback to Alphabet’s Waymo, which received its first permit to begin testing its autonomous vehicles in New York City last year, albeit with a trained specialist behind the wheel. The permit is still in place, and Waymo’s plans for New York City are still likely to move ahead, as Hochul’s rescinded proposal governed areas outside the Big Apple.
The Alphabet subsidiary, which offers paid driverless rides to the public in cities in the San Francisco Bay Area, along with parts of Los Angeles, Phoenix, Austin, Atlanta and other cities, was hoping to grow its already sizable foothold in the robotaxi market and tap into a large pool of new users.
“While we are disappointed by the governor’s decision, we’re committed to bringing our service to New York and will work with the state legislature to advance this issue,” a Waymo spokesperson said. “We hear from thousands of New Yorkers who have experienced Waymo in other cities and want access to it at home.”
Self-driving operations already face a difficult path to commercialization, as the technology has been under heavy scrutiny over safety concerns after accidents, though Waymo’s safety record has not recorded major injuries like General Motors’ Cruise, which shut down after one of its cars dragged a woman through an intersection in San Francisco.
“Autonomous vehicles are already driving down accident rates and improving pedestrian safety in Arizona, California and Texas. It’s disappointing that Governor Hochul is withdrawing her proposal, because New Yorkers deserve the same proven protections,” Chamber of Progress’s CEO, Adam Kovacevich, said.

Anti-monarchist details what police detention could have been like for Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor
An anti-monarchist has given an insight into what Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor’s time in police detention could look like after he was detained on suspicion of misconduct in public office.
Mr Mountbatten-Windsor was detained at the Sandringham Estate in Norfolk on Thursday (19 February).
Speaking to The Independent, Graham Smith, CEO of Republic, said he hoped the former prince would be held in a cell when not being questioned, rather than “sitting in the constable’s office having tea”.
Mr Smith, who was detained by the Metropolitan Police on the morning of King Charles’s Coronation, described his own experience as “pretty grim”.“Not because I wish that experience on him,” he said, “but I would hope that he would be treated the same.”
Mr Mountbatten-Windsor has routinely denied any wrongdoing in relation to his connections to Epstein.

Ex-prince Andrew released after arrest over misconduct relating to Epstein

AYLSHAM, Norfolk – Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor, King Charles’ younger brother, was released from police custody on the evening of Feb 19 after being arrested on suspicion of misconduct in public office over allegations he sent confidential government documents to Jeffrey Epstein.
Mr Mountbatten-Windsor, who turned 66 on Feb 19, was questioned all day by detectives from Thames Valley Police.
Earlier in February, the police said they were looking into allegations
The arrest of the senior royal,
“I have learnt with the deepest concern the news about Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor and suspicion of misconduct in public office,” King Charles said in a statement.
A Reuters witness saw Mr Mountbatten-Windsor leaving a police station in Aylsham, eastern England, where he was met by a small group of photographers and television crew, just after 1900 GMT (3am on Feb 20 in Singapore).
A Reuters photograph taken after his release shows him seated inside a car, appearing visibly shaken.
Thames Valley Police said later on Feb 19 that “the arrested man” had been “released under investigation”.
‘Law must take its course’
Although Buckingham Palace was not informed in advance about the arrest, King Charles said the authorities had the family’s “full and wholehearted support and cooperation”.
“Let me state clearly: the law must take its course,” the monarch said in his statement.
“Meanwhile, my family and I will continue in our duty and service to you all.”
The King visited a fashion show in London
Mr Mountbatten-Windsor, the second son of the late Queen Elizabeth, has always denied any wrongdoing in relation to Epstein, and said he regrets their friendship.
His office did not respond to a request for comment and he has not spoken publicly since the release of more than three million pages of documents
Those files suggested Mr Mountbatten-Windsor had in 2010 forwarded to Epstein reports about Vietnam, Singapore and other places he had visited on official trips as the government’s Special Representative for Trade and Investment.
He was forced to step down from that role in 2011 after his close links to Epstein first emerged.
“Following a thorough assessment, we have now opened an investigation into this allegation of misconduct in public office,” Thames Valley’s Assistant Chief Constable Oliver Wright said in a statement.
“We understand the significant public interest in this case, and we will provide updates at the appropriate time.”
The arrest marks a new low for the former prince, who was forced to quit all official royal duties in 2019 over his ties with Epstein and was then stripped by his older brother of his titles and honours in October 2025

Earlier, six unmarked police cars and around eight plain-clothes officers were pictured at Wood Farm on the Sandringham estate in eastern England where Mr Mountbatten-Windsor now resides.
Thames Valley Police officers were also searching the mansion on the King’s Windsor estate where Mr Mountbatten-Windsor lived until he was forced out amid anger at the Epstein revelations.
While being arrested means that police have reasonable suspicion that a crime has been committed and that the royal is suspected of involvement in an offence, it does not imply guilt.
A conviction for misconduct in a public office carries a maximum sentence of life imprisonment, and cases must be dealt with in a Crown Court, which deals with the most serious criminal offences.
Police have previously said misconduct in public office, which is a “common law” offence and is not covered by written statute legislation, involved “particular complexities”.
Giuffre lawsuit
In 2022, the King’s brother settled a civil lawsuit
The current police investigation is not related to this or any other allegation of sexual impropriety.
“Today, our broken hearts have been lifted at the news that no one is above the law, not even royalty,” the family of Ms Giuffre, who died by suicide in 2025, said in a statement.
In response to Mr Mountbatten-Windsor’s earlier arrest, US President Donald Trump said it was a “shame”.
“I think it’s very sad. I think it’s so bad for the royal family,” Mr Trump told reporters. “It’s very, very sad to me... to see what’s going on with his (King Charles’) brother.”
Were Mr Mountbatten-Windsor to ultimately face criminal charges, he would join a very small group of senior British royals who have formally been accused of offences.
His elder sister, Princess Anne, was fined for speeding in 2001, and the following year became the first royal to be convicted of a criminal offence in 350 years when she appeared in court to plead guilty to failing to stop one of her dogs, named Dotty, from biting two children.
King Charles I was tried for treason in 1649 towards the end of the English Civil War, found guilty and beheaded.
The misconduct investigation is not the only accusation against Mr Mountbatten-Windsor into which police are looking.
Anti-monarchy campaign group Republic has reported him over allegations he was involved in the trafficking of a woman to Britain for sex in 2010. Thames Valley Police said they were assessing allegations that a woman had been taken to an address in Windsor, where the former prince lived until recently.
US lawmakers have also said he should testify before committees in the US over what he knew about Epstein.
Meanwhile, former British prime minister Gordon Brown has called for a police investigation into the extent of Epstein trafficking women without proper checks by the authorities through London’s Stansted Airport, saying this had been overlooked by previous inquiries into Mr Mountbatten-Windsor.
Essex Police said on Feb 18 they were looking into the issue.

The King and the PM are right – no one should be above the law
Editorial: The royal family has acted with conviction, but King Charles and Prince William will need to do more to pressure Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor to cooperate with the American Congressional investigation into Epstein
- Bookmark
Seismic” is a word that is easily overused, but it seems entirely appropriate in the case of the arrest of the former Prince Andrew and its consequences for the British monarchy.
Whatever Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor may have done – and the accusations are very serious – he is by now too peripheral a figure to bring down the dynasty. But equally, the monarchy cannot occupy its position based on divine right or class-based deference. It must earn its position by being useful.
The conduct of one individual ought not to affect the viability of the UK’s constitutional monarchy, but the family is linked to it, and public opinion can be capricious.
Even before this latest dramatic turn of events, serious questions were rightly being raised once again about the royal family’s finances, their tax affairs, and the size of “the Firm”, including the roles of the more marginal individual members. The Andrew affair, as we may well call it, is an unwelcome challenge to the system's propriety and transparency. The King and the Prince of Wales, in particular, will need to make changes in order to reassure the public that such behaviour will never be tolerated again. If that aspect is not taken care of, the institution will remain destabilised.
The blow to the prestige of the House of Windsor from the Epstein scandal is clearly grievous, as it has been for some years. The infamous BBC Newsnight interview in 2019 with the then Prince Andrew was a turning point for him and his family; his excuses, his unlikely claims, and his strange justification that he was, if anything, too honourable, only made matters worse. The saga is not over. All concerned must be conscious that there may be much worse to come, as the shocks from the millions of Epstein files continue to reverberate through the British body politic.
It is difficult to see any close precedent for these events in the modern age. British royalty is such an ancient fixture that it has seen pretty much everything: beheadings and other executions, forced and voluntary abdications, coups, murders, incarceration of inconvenient relatives, a king rendered deranged by some indeterminate disease, a few outrageous libertines, and routine eccentric behaviour.
The monarchy even had to be restored after an unhappy experiment with a republic in the 17th century. It seems to be an inevitable feature of British life, despite its tribulations.
The closest precedent to the events of the present day, in terms of the scale and depth of public concern, was the aftermath of the death of Diana, Princess of Wales, in 1997 – something that the then Prince of Wales, now the King, will remember very well. It was at that time that any notion of the Windsors as a model of family life to be looked up to was decisively shredded.
Also in 1997, Queen Elizabeth reflected that a hereditary monarchy could only exist in the modern era with the “support and consent of the people”. That should never be taken for granted. The monarchy has a constitutional role, and the family bolsters that through its charitable work and public appearances. That is a formula that should not be abused by way of entitlement or extravagance.
Some immediate issues have already been addressed. The former Prince Andrew is being treated like anyone else accused of a crime – nobody should be above the law, as the prime minister has said.
The King was given no special notice of his brother’s impending arrest, and has followed the correct constitutional line, promising to support the “full, fair and proper process”. He has removed all of his brother’s remaining titles and honours, and his royal status – though it took too long – to better quarantine the institution from collateral damage. He has, in short, put duty before family, and has proved ruthless in doing so.
Every occupant of the British throne faces fresh challenges, and each must rise to them as they judge best, and on the advice of their prime ministers and those closest to them. King Charles and Prince William will need to do more to pressure Mr Mountbatten-Windsor to cooperate with the US congressional investigation into Jeffrey Epstein, and to give a full account to the British police looking into the movement of individuals into the UK on Epstein’s private jet. A more convincing statement of apology to the victims must also be put forward.
Misconduct in public office is a serious offence, but there could be even more gruesome problems to deal with in the coming months. Nothing can be done about that, but the King can make clear his distress about what’s gone on, keep his brother far away from the royal family’s work, and implement the reforms the public desires as soon as possible. If these tasks are accomplished, then he might leave the institution in sounder condition than it was in when he inherited it, little more than three tumultuous years ago.

New Mexico’s promise of free child care comes with a fiscal escape hatch

New Mexico’s promise of free child care comes with a fiscal escape hatch
An ambitious program to provide free universal child care to working families in New Mexico is being enshrined into law
- Bookmark
An ambitious universal child care program aimed at fully footing the bill for working families across New Mexico is being enshrined into law, with state legislators making good on promises by Democratic Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham to make the state the first in the nation to offer such a program to families of all income levels.
As parents across the nation grapple with crippling daycare bills that threaten to keep them at home and out of the workforce, political leaders from New York to San Francisco have been angling to expand access to free and subsidized care. The political stakes are high as the potential for budget uncertainties and fraud looms large.
California has opted to eliminate copayments for some families, while Washington and Oregon cap what families pay. In Vermont, a payroll tax on employers funds child care subsidies.
In New Mexico, the plan relies heavily on the financial windfall from oil and gas production — including earnings from a recently minted $10 billion trust fund for early childhood education. It's a delicate balance for a progressive governor who initially set out to rein in the industry.
Lujan Grisham wraps up her tenure next year, and state lawmakers wary of unchecked spending opted during the legislative session that ended Thursday to take a cautious approach. They're leaving the door open to copayments if public finances deteriorate. That's a compromise Lujan Grisham had to make.
Putting up guardrails
As much as $700 million more will be funneled over the next five years to New Mexico's child care assistance program, state officials said. Copayments are unlikely and would require 90-days notice to families.
Decisions on possible cost-sharing will be tied to new annual reporting requirements. The early education agency has new authority to monitor how much child care providers pay employees, manage debt and structure their businesses.
State Sen. George Muñoz, cosponsor of the bill, said the Legislature seized an opportunity to put guardrails in place.
“We didn’t want to end up like Minnesota, where all of the sudden there was rampant fraud,” he said, referring to allegations by U.S. prosecutors that billions in federal funds were stolen from Minnesota-run programs for children with autism, addiction services and more.
Taking the weight off families
Families stand to benefit enormously, Muñoz said, explaining free care will put money back in their pockets.
Marianna Eanone of Las Cruces said her income combined with her husband's Army salary was just above the previous cutoff for child care assistance. They used to pay $1,000 a month to send their 3-year-old to a licensed home daycare provider, along with afterschool care for their kindergartener.
“It’s been a weight off to not have to worry about that,” said Eanone, who works for a program that connects families with child development services.
There's now wiggle room to afford things like occasional takeout from local restaurants, martial arts classes for her 6-year-old, bigger payments toward student loan debt and savings for the future, she said.
And those benefits resonate with voters.
“They are sending a really strong signal about the importance of child care to the well-being of the families in the state, the well being of the economy, of businesses,” said Karen Schulman, senior director of child care policy for the National Women’s Law Center.
Prioritizing vulnerable children
The New Mexico legislation allows the state to create a waitlist when demand for assistance outpaces available slots. It's an effort to prioritize access for children in vulnerable circumstances — ranging from extreme poverty to disabilities and those at risk of developmental delays.
It's also a response to concerns that the rapid expansion of child care subsidies to all income brackets may squeeze out slots for low-income families. Attendance from low-income families declined as assistance expanded to higher income brackets, according to a review by legislative analysts.
Elizabeth Groginsky, secretary of New Mexico’s early childhood education department, said lawmakers also left financial breathing room for recently adopted incentives to improve child care quality, raise base wages and expand operating hours through enhanced rates paid by the state.
Still, child care slots remain in short supply across wide swaths of New Mexico, even as the state extends assistance beyond working parents to grandparent guardians, foster parents and people experiencing homelessness.
Legislators have sent a separate bill to the governor to scale up more home-based daycare and child care centers in residential areas by overriding some local zoning and permitting requirements, including homeowner association restrictions on child care.

Amazon can be sued over suicides linked to chemical sold on its website, court rules

Amazon can be sued over suicides linked to chemical sold on its website, court rules
The justices rejected a lower court's ruling that the families could not pursue negligence claims
- Bookmark
Amazon must face lawsuits by families that lost relatives who died by suicide after consuming a chemical bought from outside vendors on the retailer's website, the Washington Supreme Court ruled.
On Thursday, all nine justices rejected a ruling by an intermediate-level appeals court that the families could not sue Amazon for negligence because suicide was a superseding cause of their relatives' deaths.
Justice G. Helen Whitener wrote that Amazon owed customers a duty of reasonable care, and must avoid exposing them to "harm from the foreseeable conduct of a third party."
She said a jury should decide whether suicide was a foreseeable result of the Seattle-based retailer's alleged failure to exercise that duty.
Amazon defends safety commitment
Twenty-eight families have filed lawsuits alleging that Amazon has known for years about the link between the chemical and suicide yet continued to allow unrestricted sales, alongside other products that could assist in suicides. They have labeled these products collectively as "suicide kits."
The families are seeking unspecified damages from Amazon under a Washington state product liability law for their relatives' deaths.
Thursday's decision covered appeals by four of the families, who said they lost relatives ages 17 to 27 who consumed the chemical in 2020 and 2021.
Amazon said it disagreed with the decision and is committed to the safety of all its customers. It expressed condolences to families affected by suicide.
Used as a food preservative
The case is one of many seeking to hold online sales platforms such as Amazon responsible for products sold by third-party vendors.
"Amazon is one of the world's biggest companies, and shouldn't be profiting from products they know people use to harm themselves," Carrie Goldberg, a lawyer for the families, said in an interview.
The chemical linked to the suicides is often used as a preservative in foods, such as meat and fish. It also can be used in research laboratories, and in the treatment of cyanide poisoning.
In its statement, Amazon said the chemical "is not intended for direct consumption, and unfortunately, like many products, it can be misused."
Amazon said it now prohibits sales of the chemical with purity levels above 10%.

New Mexico reopens investigation into alleged illegal activity at Epstein's former Zorro Ranch
New Mexico’s attorney general has reopened an investigation into allegations of illegal activity at Jeffrey Epstein’s former Zorro Ranch

New Mexico’s attorney general has reopened an investigation into allegations of illegal activity at Jeffrey Epstein’s former Zorro Ranch.
Attorney General Raúl Torrez’s office made the announcement Thursday, saying the decision was made after reviewing information recently released by the U.S. Department of Justice.
Although New Mexico’s initial case was closed in 2019 at the request of federal prosecutors in New York, state prosecutors say now that “revelations outlined in the previously sealed FBI files warrant further examination.”
The New Mexico Department of Justice said special agents and prosecutors at the agency will be seeking immediate access to the complete, unredacted federal case file and intend to work with other law enforcement partners as well as a new truth commission established by state lawmakers to look into activities at the ranch.
“As with any potential criminal matter, we will follow the facts wherever they lead, carefully evaluate jurisdictional considerations, and take appropriate investigative action, including the collection and preservation of any relevant evidence that remains available,” the New Mexico Department of Justice said in a statement.

We need to focus on a minute and 15 seconds from Roni Koban's Kan 11 program "Encounter," which aired earlier this month. The interviewee was Gadi Eisenkot, head of the new Yashar party, and 12 minutes and 32 seconds into the show, he was asked about certain personality traits that are perceived as problematic for someone aspiring to be a successful politician. The dialogue is fascinating because it encapsulates the political and ethical vertigo in which we have existed for years, and which has become a kind of axiom.

White House pressure leads universities to cut ties with nonprofit that helps racial minorities
The Trump administration says that 31 universities have agreed to cut ties with a nonprofit that helps racial minorities earn doctorate degrees
- Bookmark
The Trump administration said Thursday its campaign to end diversity programs in higher education has led dozens of universities to cut ties with an organization known as The PhD Project, which helps racial minorities earn doctorate degrees.
The PhD Project was a little-known nonprofit group until it caught the attention of conservative strategists last year and became the focus of an investigation by the U.S. Department of Education. The Republican administration says school diversity programs often exclude white and Asian American students.
The investigation, opened in March 2025, has resulted in 31 universities agreeing to end partnerships with the group, the department’s Office for Civil Rights said Thursday. Negotiations are continuing with 14 additional schools, it said.
The department said in its statement that The PhD Project “unlawfully limits eligibility based on the race of participants” and that institutions partnering with it violated Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which bars discrimination on the basis of race, color, or national origin in education programs and activities that receive federal money.
“This is the Trump effect in action: institutions of higher education are agreeing to cut ties with discriminatory organizations, recommitting themselves to abiding by federal law, and restoring equality of opportunity on campuses across the nation,” Education Secretary Linda McMahon said.
Many of the schools promptly cut ties with The PhD Project after the investigation was opened, in order to avoid entanglements with the administration. It had undertaken the inquiries after warning schools they could lose federal money over “race-based preferences.”
The PhD Project is one of many nonprofits that helps underrepresented groups gain access to higher education.
“The PhD Project was founded with the goal of providing more role models in the front of business classrooms and this remains our goal today,” the organization said in a statement Thursday. The website says it has “helped more than 1,500 members earn their doctoral degree.”
The group of 31 colleges listed by the department included major public research universities such as Arizona State, Ohio State and the University of Michigan, along with prestigious private schools like Yale, Duke and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
MIT, like many of the schools cited in the investigation, had paid The PhD Project “a nominal fee” to participate in the group's university fairs or conferences, allowing MIT to send representatives to answer questions about attending their school, spokesperson Kimberly Allen said.
MIT informed the government in April 2025 it had ended its participation in such conferences and was notified months later that the Office for Civil Rights had found it in violation of Title VI. The school signed a “resolution agreement” with the department about a week ago to resolve the matter “but explicitly did not admit any liability, wrongdoing or violation of any law or regulation,” Allen said.
The University of North Dakota said it, too, promptly ended its membership with The PhD Project two weeks after the investigation was announced last year.
“The University became a member of the PhD Project to have access to the PhD Project’s member directory and applicant database, to be able to recruit a larger pool of qualified applicants for faculty positions,” spokesperson David Dodds said in a statement.
The University of Utah said it had a table at annual conferences hosted by the nonprofit in the 2024-25 school year and two previous years. It cut ties with the project in October after settling with the department, university spokesperson Rebecca Walsh said.
Out of 170 PhD students admitted to Utah's business school over the past 14 years, just two were involved through the PhD Project, Walsh said.
The Education Department said that all of the 31 universities have also agreed to review partnerships with other organizations “to identify any that violate Title VI by restricting participation based on race.”
The administration has targeted a wide range of practices that it has labeled as diversity, equity and inclusion.

Team USA wins gold over Canada in women's hockey overtime thriller at Winter Games

Team USA wins gold over Canada in women's hockey overtime thriller at the Winter Olympics
Team USA defeated Canada in a stunning 2-1 overtime comeback win at the 2026 Milan Cortina Winter Games to take home their third Olympic gold medal in women's ice hockey.
After being down 1-0 headed into the third period, the U.S. tied things up late in the period and then Megan Keller scored the game-winner in overtime to avenge their loss in the final match from four years ago. This was the seventh gold medal match, and fifth in a row, between the two hockey powerhouses. It was also the third U.S.-Canada showdown to go to overtime.
Team USA captain Hilary Knight prolonged her final game at the Olympics by sending it to overtime tied 1-all.
Knight deflected Laila Edwards' shot past Ann-Renee Desbiens with 2:04 left in regulation and the U.S. skating 6 on 5 with goaltender Aerin Frankel pulled for an extra attacker. The goal was her 15th at the Olympics, the most in team history.
"This team's got so much resolve. Never quit. Always ready to fight and go to battle," Knight said. "It's just a testament to the preparation of our group and the love that we have in that room, and the way we found a way to get the job done at the end of the night."
The sides were playing 3-on-3 to finish a game where fans alternated chants of "USA! and "Ca-na-da!" Keller secured the win on a backhander 4:07 into overtime, breaking up the left wing and pushing past Claire Thompson, driving to the net and beating Ann-Renee Desbiens over her right pad to spark an emotional and teary-eyed celebration.
"I'm lost for words," Keller said. "This is an incredible feeling. I love these girls so much. This group deserves it. Just the effort and the faith that we kept through this four-year journey is something very special."
Frankel stopped 30 shots.
Canada had led since Kristin O'Neill scored short-handed less than a minute into the second period, ending the U.S. shutout streak at 352 minutes, 17 seconds. Desbiens and Frankel went save for save in a back-and-forth game that was far more competitive than the rivals' first meeting in the preliminary round, when the U.S. routed Canada 5-0.
The Americans romped through the tournament, outscoring opponents 33-2.
"We went through ups and downs," Canadian captain Marie-Philip Poulin said. "Just letting them know this does not define them. I'm proud of them. They showed up. Sadly lost in overtime but keep their head high because it's truly an honor to be on their side."
A Team USA that featured a mix of experience and talented and speedy youth delivered on the vision coach John Wroblewski instilled upon taking over four years ago, months after the U.S. lost the gold-medal game to Canada in Beijing.
"In my opinion, I think this is the best hockey team women's hockey has ever seen," Kelly Pannek said, noting how the Americans overcame adversity against their fiercest rival.
"I think that's a part of being a champion, right?" Pannek said. "We knew they were going to respond in the way that they do. And they gave us everything."
The U.S. and Canada have met in all but one Olympic final — the 2006 Turin Games won by Canada — since women's hockey made its debut at the 1998 Nagano Games. The loss gives Canada its third silver medal in the event.
Knight, 36, has already announced these will be her U.S.-record fifth and final Games, with a shot at adding a second gold medal to go with her three silvers. The game was played a day after Knight proposed to U.S. speedskater Brittany Bowe.
The defending Olympic champion Canadians had shown signs of age during a tournament in which they lost 5-0 to the Americans in the preliminary round, and eked into the final with a 2-1 win over Switzerland.
The loss to the Americans was the most lopsided and also the first time the Canadian women were shut out in Olympic play.
This was considered a last hurrah for their aging core led by Poulin, aka "Captain Clutch," who had missed two games — including the loss to the U.S. — with a right knee injury. She declined to discuss her Olympic future.
Meantime, many of her teammates were devastated by the result.
"It's hard to process right now," 37-year-old defender Jocelyne Larocque said. "We always had the belief that we could win. I love this group. I love this team. I'm proud of everyone."
Canada overcame questions about its age and recent sluggish performances by outshooting the U.S. 8-6 in the first period and then taking the lead with O'Neill converting Laura Stacey's pass on a 2-on-1 break. The Canadians kept pressing their attack and had several chances in overtime.
A minute before Keller's goal, Sarah Fillier moved up the right wing only to have her shot stopped by Frankel, with the puck landing in the crease.
"It's overtime. First goal wins. You've got to bury it when you have the chance," Filler said. "It's tough. You want to win a gold medal with that group. It's a special group, a lot of veterans."
The Americans extended their winning streak against Canada to eight. It began with two wins at the world championships in April, including the gold medal game. The U.S. then swept a four-game exhibition series by a combined margin of 26-7.
Earlier, Alina Muller scored 9:09 into overtime for her second bronze-medal clinching goal in Switzerland's 2-1 win over Sweden 2-1. Muller also scored Switzerland's decisive goal in a 4-3 win over Sweden in 2014.

Former UK prince Andrew released after arrest over Epstein-related misconduct

Former UK prince Andrew released after arrest over Epstein-related misconduct
His brother, King Charles, says authorities have the family’s ‘full and wholehearted support and cooperation’ amid allegations he sent sex trafficker classified government reports
AYLSHAM, England — King Charles’ younger brother Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor was released from police custody on Thursday evening after being arrested on suspicion of misconduct in public office over allegations he sent confidential government documents to Jeffrey Epstein.
Mountbatten-Windsor, who turned 66 on Thursday, had been questioned all day by detectives from Thames Valley Police. Earlier this month, the police force said it was looking into allegations that he had passed documents to the late convicted sex offender while working as a trade envoy.
The arrest of the senior royal, eighth in line to the throne, is unprecedented in modern times.
“I have learned with the deepest concern the news about Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor and suspicion of misconduct in public office,” King Charles said in a statement.
A Reuters witness saw Prince Andrew leaving a police station in Aylsham, eastern England, where he was met by a small group of photographers and television crews, just after 7 p.m. local time.
A Reuters photograph taken after his release shows him seated inside a car, appearing visibly shaken. Thames Valley Police said later on Thursday that “the arrested man” had been “released under investigation.”
Although Buckingham Palace was not informed in advance about the arrest, Charles said the authorities had the family’s “full and wholehearted support and cooperation.”
“Let me state clearly: the law must take its course,” the monarch said in his statement. “Meanwhile, my family and I will continue in our duty and service to you all.”
The king visited a fashion show in London on Thursday, making no further public comment.
Mountbatten-Windsor, the second son of the late Queen Elizabeth, has always denied any wrongdoing in relation to Epstein, and said he regrets their friendship.
His office did not respond to a request for comment and he has not spoken publicly since the release of more than 3 million pages of documents by the US government relating to Epstein, who was convicted of soliciting prostitution from a minor in 2008.
Those files suggested Mountbatten-Windsor had in 2010 forwarded to Epstein reports about Vietnam, Singapore and other places he had visited on official trips as the government’s Special Representative for Trade and Investment. He was forced to step down from that role in 2011 after his close links to Epstein first emerged.
“Following a thorough assessment, we have now opened an investigation into this allegation of misconduct in public office,” Thames Valley’s Assistant Chief Constable Oliver Wright said in a statement. “We understand the significant public interest in this case, and we will provide updates at the appropriate time.”
The arrest marks a new low for the former prince, who was forced to quit all official royal duties in 2019 over his ties with Epstein and was then stripped by his older brother of his titles and honors last October amid further revelations about their relationship.
While being arrested means that police have reasonable suspicion that a crime has been committed and that the royal is suspected of involvement in an offense, it does not imply guilt.
A conviction for misconduct in a public office carries a maximum sentence of life imprisonment, and cases must be dealt with in a Crown Court, which deal with the most serious criminal offenses.
In response to the arrest, US President Donald Trump said it was a “shame.”
“I think it’s very sad. I think it’s so bad for the royal family,” Trump told reporters. “It’s very, very sad to me… to see what’s going on with his [King Charles’s] brother.”
Were Mountbatten-Windsor to ultimately face criminal charges, he would join a very small group of senior British royals who have formally been accused of offenses.
His elder sister Princess Anne was fined for speeding in 2001, and the following year became the first royal to be convicted of a criminal offense in 350 years when she appeared in court to plead guilty to failing to stop one of her dogs, named Dotty, biting two children.
King Charles I was tried for treason in 1649 towards the end of the English Civil War, found guilty and beheaded.
The misconduct investigation is not the only accusation against Mountbatten-Windsor into which police are looking.
Anti-monarchy campaign group Republic has reported him over allegations he was involved in the trafficking of a woman to Britain for sex in 2010. Thames Valley Police said it was assessing allegations that a woman had been taken to an address in Windsor, where the former prince lived until recently.

Millions of Americans do not know they have this chronic condition
- A report from the American Heart Association reveals that nearly one in four adults in the U.S., approximately 9.6 million people, have undiagnosed diabetes.
- The report also indicates that 96 million Americans have prediabetes, with around 30 million adults (10.6 per cent of the adult population) having diagnosed diabetes.
- Diabetes is a significant health concern in the U.S., being a leading cause of death and a major risk factor for heart disease, responsible for over 95,000 deaths annually.
- The American Heart Association is urging increased awareness and professional care, as diabetes often develops slowly and silently without visible symptoms.
- New research has identified that red blood cells, particularly in low-oxygen environments like high altitudes, can absorb sugar from the bloodstream, potentially offering novel approaches to controlling blood sugar.

TEL AVIV, February 19. /TASS/. Israeli Defense Minister Israel Katz said Israeli troops will remain in the Gaza Strip forever.
"The IDF will remain in the Gaza security zone forever," he was quoted as saying by the Ynet news portal.
Addressing the officers' course graduation ceremony at Officer Training Base 1, he mentioned Israel’s strikes on Yemen and Iran, delivered last year.
"We will not allow threats of annihilation against Israel in the future either - and we will act against any threat, near and far," he said. "The policy today is one of initiative, decisiveness, removal of threats and defense of Israeli borders and communities from enemy territory."

Photos taken by the Russians themselves confirm the complete destruction of their BK-16 transport and landing craft in the temporarily occupied Crimea.
The photos were published by the Telegram channel “Dossier of the Spy.”
The combat operation to destroy the enemy boat was carried out by the “Kryla” unit of the Defence Intelligence of Ukraine, using a strike drone.
At the time of the strike, the BK-16 boat was moored near the pier in the area of the village of Novoozernoye. According to the Telegram channel, the strike took place on February 12.
Earlier, the burning of the boat was confirmed by a satellite image that the Defence Intelligence of Ukraine published in its video.
A few days earlier, information about the destruction of the Project 02510 BK-16 transport and landing boat appeared in a report by the General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine.
This is the second confirmed case of the destruction of a Russian boat of this type. The first such enemy boat was sunk in May 2022.
Currently, the Russian Black Sea Fleet has five boats of this type, and four more are operated by units of the Russian Guard.
The boat is designed to transport and land marine infantry or special forces units, provide security for water areas, escort ships, and participate in sabotage and reconnaissance operations. Read more about it in this blog.

What Moses would have asked about the Board of Peace - comment
Unknown
Unknown Publisher

21:11:37 UTC
06:11:37 KST

There is a question buried in this week's parasha, Terumah, that has haunted Jewish thought for centuries and feels, this week, startlingly contemporary.
God instructs Moses to tell the Israelites to bring gifts, each one according to what his heart moves him to give, and from those gifts to build a Mishkan, a sanctuary. The instruction that follows is precise in a way we might easily miss: "Let them make me a sanctuary, that I may dwell among them." Not in it. Among them. The Mishkan matters because of what its construction represents: a people choosing, freely and together, to build something that transcends any one of them.
Rabbi Jonathan Sacks spent much of his life thinking about what that distinction means for politics. He believed, deeply and consistently, that the great question of our age is whether we have the moral architecture to sustain what we build. Power is relatively easy to assemble. Covenant is harder. And without a covenant, without the willing participation of the people who will actually live inside whatever you construct, even the most generously funded structure eventually collapses.
This is why he watched Barack Obama so intently. Obama, Sacks felt, had understood something that most Western politicians had forgotten: that to lead is to tell a story of hope. That the covenant model, binding people together around shared obligation rather than competing interests, was the most sophisticated political technology ever devised. When Obama stood before two million people in Washington in January 2009 and spoke of promises handed from generation to generation, of eyes fixed on the horizon, of a gift of freedom carried forward to children's children, Sacks heard the cadences of Deuteronomy. He heard Moses.
He also heard something else. A warning, implicit in every covenant story: that the structure only holds if the people build it themselves. A sanctuary designed without the participation of those who will dwell in it is an imposition.
Which brings us to Washington this week, and to the Board of Peace.
The numbers are serious. Seventeen billion dollars pledged. Thirty-two thousand troops committed. Rafah named as the first test case. By the standards of international diplomacy, this is not nothing. The United Nations spent eighteen months producing working groups and envoys and institutional hand-wringing while Gaza burned. The BOP at least has a sequencing logic: disarmament first, reconstruction next, stabilization alongside it. It has donors and soldiers in the same room, connected by a single political condition.
What would Rabbi Sacks have said?
Sacks would have acknowledged all of this. He was clear-eyed about power, and clear-eyed about the United Nations. He knew that winning a war is easy and winning a peace is hard, and that peace requires structures, money, and sometimes the credible presence of force.
But he would have asked the question that the pledge numbers leave unanswered. Where is the covenant? Who sat in that room as someone who will actually live in whatever gets built? The Palestinian people, two million of them, were absent from the table. The Mishkan was built from the Israelites' own willing contributions, each person giving what their heart moved them to give. A sanctuary designed elsewhere and delivered as a finished product belongs to a different tradition entirely.
Sacks understood that legitimacy grows from within. From the sense that this is ours, that we built this, that we have a stake in its survival. A structure raised without that conviction requires permanent maintenance by outside forces, which is a different kind of project, and a far more costly one.
He would also have noticed the deeper irony. The covenant idea, the belief that a society coheres through shared moral obligation rather than concentrated power, is a Jewish idea that traveled through the Hebrew Bible into the political imagination of America and became the foundation of its democratic experiment. It is an idea that, as Sacks observed with a mixture of pride and sadness, is more alive in Washington than in Jerusalem.
And yet here is Washington, assembling a framework for Gaza's future, with all the resources and moral ambition the covenant tradition eventually made possible, and still searching for the covenant itself. For the thing that made it work.
Terumah teaches that the sanctuary lives in the giving. In the moment when people who have every reason to hold back choose instead to contribute, freely, to something they believe in. That is when God dwells among them. Among them, the text insists. The gold and the acacia wood and the linen curtains matter only because of the hands that offered them willingly.
The Board of Peace has measured the curtains carefully. The harder question, the one Moses would have asked, the one Sacks would have asked, is whether anyone has thought about the giving.

Leaked security footage debunks Tucker Carlson’s claim of being detained at Ben-Gurion Airport

Tucker Carlson was seen hugging and taking a photograph with a Ben-Gurion Airport employee, according to footage circulating on social media on Thursday, contradicting his claim to The Daily Mail that he was detained and hauled off by security.
In the video, he was seen smiling and hugging staff at the airport. He appeared to be unaccompanied, further contradicting his claims that he was travelling with security guards.
Sources confirmed to The Jerusalem Post that Carlson did not leave the airport during his visit and conducted the interview with US Ambassador to Israel Mike Huckabee there. He departed Israel around 3 p.m., concluding a trip that lasted only a few hours.
"Men who identified themselves as airport security took our passports, hauled our executive producer into a side room, and then demanded to know what we discussed with Ambassador Huckabee," Carlson stated in his Wednesday interview with The Daily Mail.
A spokesperson for the US Embassy in Israel told The Daily Mail that Carlson's claims were inaccurate and clarified that he only received the same passport-control questions that many visitors to Israel encounter.
Israel Airports Authority further confirmed that Carlson was "politely asked a few routine questions, in accordance with standard procedures applied to many travelers" in a late Wednesday X/Twitter post.
The questions were asked in a private, VIP lounge to protect his and his party's privacy, the authority said, adding that "no unusual incident occurred" and it rejects any such claims.
Bennett: 'Chickens***' Carlson landed in Israel, faked harassment
Former prime minister Naftali Bennett slammed Carlson following his brief visit to Israel, calling him "a chickens***" and saying that he has been "spouting lies about Israel."
In his remarks, shared late Wednesday on X/Twitter, Bennett accused Carlson of lying and of trying to portray a false image of his visit to Israel.
Bennett continued, arguing that Carlson "didn’t even step foot in the country" yet "made up a story that he’s being supposedly harassed by our security."
Finally, Bennett said, Carlson "whined" about his experience before flying off in his private jet.

WATCH: IDF foils terror plots in West Bank, destroys Hamas tunnels in Gaza

The IDF destroyed several Hamas tunnels east of the Yellow Line in the Beit Hanoun area of the Northern Gaza Strip, according to a Thursday statement.
This operation launched in January, the IDF said, and its broader goal was the destory terrorist infrastructure on the Israeli-controlled side of the Yellow Line.
One of the tunnels was approximately one kilometer long, the IDF said, and it contained several living quarters as well as explosive devices.
Also on Thursday, the IDF released helmet camera footage from recent operations in the West Bank, showing soldiers from the Duvdevan unit making arrests in two different villages near the city of Nablus.
One detainee was involved with the production of explosives in the area and the promotion of terrorist plots.
The other was previously associated with the Lions Den terrorist organization and possessed a gun and ammunition with which he was planning to attack IDF soldiers.
Late on Wednesday night, the IDF struck several Hezbollah targets in south Lebanon, which it claimed were terror infrastructure sites. These included weapons storage facilities and missile launchers, among other sites, according to the IDF.
These strikes were a response to Hezbollah's "repeated violation of the ceasefire understandings," the IDF said, adding that just the presence of such infrastructure sites constituted a violation of the understandings.

War-hammered Gaza needs basics like homes, roads and power. FIFA is offering a $50M soccer stadium

War-hammered Gaza needs basics like homes, roads and power. FIFA is offering a $50M soccer stadium
FIFA says it'll pay to build a new $50 million national soccer stadium in war-ravaged Gaza, where two years of fighting between Hamas and Israel have left housing, electricity and basic infrastructure severely damaged
- Bookmark
The Gaza Strip is in ruins with entire city neighborhoods reduced to rubble and serious questions about rebuilding basic water and sewage facilities, roads, electrical grids and the critical infrastructure needed to consistently produce enough food to prevent widespread starvation.
But a gleaming new national soccer stadium for an area devastated by two-plus years of war between Israel and Hamas? That's covered — or so promises the sport's international governing body.
The unusual pledge was part of a showy and often strange display of political theater at the inaugural meeting of President Donald Trump ’s Board of Peace in Washington on Thursday, where nine governments pledged $7 billion toward a Gaza relief package and five others said they'd deploy troops as part of an international stabilization force.
“We don’t have to just rebuild houses or schools or hospitals or roads,” said FIFA President Gianni Infantino. “We also have to rebuild and build people, emotion, hope and trust. And this is what football, my sport, is about.”
FIFA pledged $50 million for a new stadium holding between 20,000 and 25,000 spectators, and said it would build a $15 million FIFA academy. The organization also promised to spend an additional $2.5 million for 50 “arena mini pitches,” or soccer fields, and five full-sized fields costing $1 million each.
Gaza doesn't have a national soccer team. A unified Palestinian squad represents it and the West Bank and has been recognized by FIFA since 1998 — but has never qualified for the World Cup.
“Football, or soccer, as it is called here, is the world’s universal language,” Infantino said. “It’s about hope. It’s about joy. It’s about happiness. It’s about coming together. It’s about uniting the world.”
He showed a video that proclaimed, “A simple ball. A shared field. A reason to believe again,” while noting that FIFA and the Board of Peace were joining forces to “turn football into a bridge toward peace, dignity and hope.”
The video mentioned FIFA creating Gaza soccer leagues at youth, amateur and regional levels and promised a “complete football ecosystem designed to support communities and future generations.”
Infantino has become a regular presence at the White House ahead of this year's World Cup, jointly hosted by the U.S., Mexico and Canada. He also frequently pops up at Trump events while the president is traveling. He showed up in Davos, Switzerland, last month when the Board of Peace — part of a larger White House-brokered ceasefire to end the fighting in Gaza — was formally launched.
Trump repeatedly singled out Infantino during his own remarks on Thursday at the Board of Peace event while attempting to gloss over the fact that many top U.S. allies — including Britain and Canada — haven't joined.
“Virtually everyone is the head of a country,” Trump said of the board's members, while noting that Infantino is “head of soccer, so that’s not so bad."
“I like your job the best, I think,” Trump said.
Thursday’s attendees were given Make American Great Again-style red hats with “USA” in white letters and featuring “45-47” signifying Trump’s two presidential terms. Infantino briefly wore his, as did others assembled.
The president gave shout-outs to Infantino during several stories on divergent topics, including when Trump suggested that he'd personally been a more successful real estate developer than his special envoy, Steve Witkoff, and as he recounted how an escalator stopped while the president was on it during last fall's U.N. General Assembly meeting — an incident Trump suggested should trigger arrests, but didn't.
Trump even explained to Infantino that B-2 bombers carry “very big bombs.”
But the president's most effusive praise for Infantino was related to his organization having awarded Trump a new FIFA peace prize last year — after the president lobbied hard for a Nobel Peace Prize but was snubbed by the Norwegian committee that awards it.
“I think they saw that I got screwed by Norway,” Trump said.

Breaking Down the Ending of The Night Agent Season 3

Warning: Spoilers ahead for The Night Agent
At the end of The Night Agent’s second season, Peter Sutherland (Gabriel Basso) stops a catastrophic chemical attack at the United Nations by crossing an ethical boundary. To get the terrorists’ location, he cuts a deal with Jacob Monroe (Louis Herthum), a shadowy information broker, stealing classified documents that allow Monroe to manipulate a presidential election and help install Governor Richard Hagan into the Oval Office. The cost is permanent: Peter avoids prison only by agreeing to work with the FBI as a covert mole inside Monroe’s operation, a hero reckoning with the cost of his heroism.
“We liked the idea at the end of Season 2 that Jacob’s unaccounted for and he's still out there in the world,” says showrunner Shawn Ryan. “We thought there was a lot more to explore in terms of who he was.”
Indeed, throughout the third season of the hit Netflix show, Peter must find and confront Jacob again, only to learn there’s more to his story—and that he may be a symptom of something much larger. The intrigue detonates immediately with a commercial flight taken down by a missile strike, setting off a widening conspiracy. When a young Treasury agent uncovers a trail linking American companies to a crypto wallet used by the terrorist group claiming responsibility, Peter begins an investigation with a dogged financial reporter, Isabel (Genesis Rodriguez), navigates a suspicious White House-assigned handler, and races to uncover a dark-money network while staying one step ahead of a hired assassin.
It all comes to a head in the Season 3 finale, “Razzmatazz,” when Peter and Isabel expose Walcott Capital, the shadow bank quietly underwriting chaos, in a live interview with its owner. The reveal is damning: Walcott helped bankroll the terrorist organization. Even worse, it served as the financial back channel for the President and First Lady’s campaign, laundering Jacob’s illicit donation into a stack of clean cash built to win an election. The campaign finance transgression spurs on a senate conviction, then a disgraced White House exit, leading to another regime change in Washington.
Here, Ryan breaks down the ending of the show’s latest chapter, sharing the thinking behind a few key plotlines, and teasing a small detail about Season 4, which is currently being written.
How Walcott Capital became an unlikely villain
In order for the White House to cover up their involvement with Jacob and Walcott Capital, President Hagan enlists Adam (David Lyons), the partner he assigned to watch Peter, to eliminate everyone with knowledge of their criminal activity. That started with killing Jacob, but now it means betraying both Peter and Chelsea Arrington (Fola Evans-Akingbola), the First Lady’s ex-Secret Service detail, as they drive up to New York City.
Though the pair manage to give Adam the slip, Hagan quickly escalates things, dispatching two hired guns to the condo of Freya (Michaela Watkins), the icy head of Walcott Capital, where Isabel has been pressing her for a public interview after obtaining a damning list of her clients’ illegal transactions. Freya initially dismisses her questions as journalistic theater, but that calculation changes the moment she realizes she’s also landed on the President’s hit list. Her reputation means nothing if she doesn’t survive the night, forcing both Freya and Isabel to make separate, desperate escapes as the government goons tear through her condo.
According to Ryan, the idea to make a shadow bank one of the show’s villains initially came to him in 2016, when the Panama Papers were released, exposing a global network of offshore entities used by politicians, celebrities, and criminals to evade taxes. “We live in a world where money rules and sometimes, people choose money over ethics. Our theme here is that those people are just as bad as the people committing the crimes,” he says. “We wanted to shine a light that this is going on in the world, that there are institutions that aren't living up to their civic responsibilities.”
Peter’s purity keeps him and Freya alive
“Promise you’ll do the right thing, even if it’s hard,” Peter’s mother tells him at the beginning of Season 3.
It’s a line that might as well reverberate throughout the entire season, but especially after Peter races to New York to help Freya to safety. On their way to The Financial Register offices, Peter runs into one of Hagan’s assassins and nearly gets beaten to death inside the subway (Ryan notes that Basso wanted Peter to “get his ass kicked” by a bigger, tougher guy), at least until Freya helps Peter discharge a well-placed nail gun.
Outside the subway station, Peter still has one more foe to take down once Adam reappears with a gun pointed at him. This time, instead of pulling out another clever weapon, Peter walks straight towards his partner, insisting that Hagan has co-opted him for a dirty cause. “Are you willing to die for this?” Adam asks. As Peter continues to walk past him, Adam can only appreciate his partner’s integrity and must reconsider Hagan’s illicit actions.
“Adam was a soldier that believed in following orders and believed in doing the right thing. And he'd been led astray by his Commander in Chief,” Ryan says. “Peter doesn't triumph because he wins the fight. He wins because of character—and because, ultimately, Adam wants to be a better person than he's been at this moment.”
Isabel’s interview exposes presidential corruption
Once Freya makes it inside The Register, she agrees to go on record during a live video interview with Isabel in exchange for specific protections. The breaking news—and Isabel’s subsequent stories exposing more of Freya’s clients—eventually leads to the Hagans’s conviction and exit from the White House. After two seasons of Peter chasing around Rose Larkin, Isabel proves to be more than a distressed damsel, solidifying journalism’s crucial place in holding power accountable and aiding governmental investigations at large.
The decision to platform a high-profile journalist came from Ryan’s own love for journalism movies, but also his belief that the enterprise can still have significance in 2026. “It takes a combination of what Peter does and what Isabel does to kind of wrap things up satisfactorily,” he says. “To me, journalists are stand-ins for the audience who want questions answered. They want to know what's really going on in the world and they want to feel like people who are doing bad things are being exposed and people who are doing good things are being celebrated.”
How Jacob Monroe became a tragic figure
In some ways, the President’s downfall can be traced back to Jacob’s decades-long obsession with Raul Zapata, a Mexican businessman and the covert leader of the LFS terrorist organization. Throughout the third season, it’s revealed that Zapata murdered Jacob’s romantic partner, Sofia, after a business transaction went wrong—an act that spurs Jacob’s transformation into a ruthless foreign operator, using secrets and leverage against the American government for the ultimate revenge (which just happened to include working alongside various terrorist groups and making improper campaign contributions through illegal backchannels).
But Ryan argues that the sequence of events doesn’t take into account Jacob’s unwillingness to save Sofia when given the chance. “He didn't stand up for her in a crucial moment. He didn't sacrifice himself for her,” he says. “The secret sauce of that revenge is his guilt over not being the man that he would have liked to be. And it sort of ruins him and turns him to the dark side. It’s a sort of Darth Vader storyline.
“He was blackmailed and used,” Ryan adds. “And the lesson he learned from that is it's better to be on the other side of that, and that's how you get people to do what you want—and he took it to the logical extremes over the course of the next 30 years.”
What’s next for Peter, the Hagans, and Freya?
Despite losing his FBI handler Catherine, Peter is finally in a good place at the end of Season 3. He’s earned some well-deserved time off, finds his favorite ice-cream in Central Park, and might even have a familiar partner waiting for him when he returns to action.
The Hagans on the other hand? They’re only shown briefly departing the White House, giving a Nixon-esque wave goodbye before airlifting out of Washington in a helicopter. But that won’t be the end of their public life, as a news ribbon indicates they’ve already signed a media deal, the kind of realistic headline we’ve come to expect in today’s political climate. Ryan thought it was a fitting button that resembles the times we’re living in. “There's a feeling that people who have power and money and wealth and influence don't pay the price that they should for the crimes they commit—and because they don't, they're sort of more incentivized to commit those crimes,” he says. “It does feel like there's a lot less shame in the world today for this behavior, and that a lot of people are on the grift.”
Of course, Freya doesn’t get off so easily, either. After threatening to kill her hired assassin (Stephen Moyer) after he abruptly retires, he reappears with his revenge on his mind, poisoning her drink at a beachside resort without her noticing. It only underscores the importance of knowing exactly who you’re getting into business with—an idea that causes Ryan to perk up when I raise it: “You may have touched on something we're already planning for Season 4,” he says.

Ex-German president criticizes Merz over refusal to supply Taurus missiles to Ukraine
Gauck made the remarks on the talk show Maischberger, according to an Ukrinform correspondent.
"This is a mistake. We see the aggressor with all his military capabilities, yet we treat the victim of aggression as if it were the threat to peace. That is unacceptable!" Gauck said.
According to him, the refusal is driven by fear of escalation – precisely what Putin wants.
"Why are we doing this? Out of concern that something might happen. But Putin takes our fears into account. He thinks: every threat I make restrains your resolve. This game works in his favor. That's why we need a new, serious approach," Gauck said.
He drew a parallel with the Cold War era.
"Just as in the time of the great bloc confrontation: always ready for negotiations on the one hand, but on the other – as Willy Brandt and others did – never surrender your own strength. Instead, say: I am a serious player on the field. I'm not waiting for you to become good or tolerant. I respond to your armament with my own, and you will see: if you go too far, it will cost you dearly," he said.
Gauck stressed that weakness encourages those who disregard the law. "The weakness of the decent is an encouragement to the shameless. We must constantly remind ourselves of that. Peace will not be secured by those who pretend the victim does not need support!" he said.
He also warned against misunderstanding pacifism. "We have begun to wake up after the 'turning point' speech by the previous chancellor. After Merz's speech at the Munich conference, we have already gotten out of bed. Now we just need to start moving. That is why we are rearming. We are rearming because those who violate the law and attack another country have no moral restraints regarding the weapons they use. And if we treat the victim of aggression by denying it the weapons needed for defense, what kind of virtue is that?" Gauck said.
He stressed the importance of rearmament and military support for Ukraine, noting that Ukraine is also defending Europe.
"There are people who have woken up. And they ask: what does someone who disregards the law respond to? Someone who shoots people mercilessly? That is what Putin does. He does not want only Ukraine. He wants more. That is why Ukrainians are defending us. That is why, together with Macron and others who are truly ready, we must spend money on armaments. This must be done!" Gauck concluded.

Netanyahu warns Iran of response it ‘cannot even imagine’ if it attacks Israel

TEL AVIV, February 19. /TASS/. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has warned Iran of a potential response it "cannot even imagine" should it venture to attack Israel.
"We are prepared for any scenario. And if the Ayatollahs (the Iranian leadership - TASS) make the mistake of attacking us, they will experience a response they cannot even imagine," he said during the cadet graduation ceremony at the military academy.
According to Netanyahu, he articulated Israel’s position on the Iranian issue to US President Donald Trump during his visit to Washington last week. Israel insists that Tehran refuse from all of its stockpiles of enriched uranium and completely demolish the entire enrichment infrastructure. Apart from that, Israel demands that Iran curtail its missile program, limiting itself to missiles with a range of no more than 300 kilometers and stop providing assistance to its allies throughout the Middle East.
Earlier, CBS reported that the American administration is considering striking Iran on February 21. In January, the White House warned that it was ready to use force if Tehran fails to engage in talks aimed at reaching a "fair deal" under which Iran completely drops any plans to obtain nuclear weapons. The Iranian government has repeatedly said it had no plans of creating a nuclear bomb.
On February 17, the second round of negotiations between the US and Iran on the nuclear issue took place in Geneva, mediated by Oman. According to Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi, the parties reached mutual understanding on a number of issues, which could serve as a basis for a draft future agreement on the nuclear program. US Vice President JD Vance said that the talks went well on a number of aspects but Tehran is not yet ready to accept some of the fundamental positions outlined by the White House. Earlier, the United States and Israel insisted that Iran not only scrap its nuclear program, but also stop producing ballistic missiles and supporting pro-Iranian forces in the Middle East.

Epstein accuser’s brother hopes former Prince Andrew’s arrest signals ‘house of cards’ collapsing
Sign up now: Get ST's newsletters delivered to your inbox
WASHINGTON – The brother of one of Jeffrey Epstein’s most prominent accusers welcomed the arrest of Mr Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor
In an interview with Reuters, Mr Sky Roberts – whose sister Virginia Giuffre took her own life in April – and his wife urged the US Justice Department to take action against others suspected of playing a role in Epstein’s crimes.
“This is where the house of cards starts falling,” Mr Sky Roberts said in a joint interview with Mrs Amanda Roberts.
The release of millions of records on Epstein
The case has turned into a persistent political problem for President Donald Trump, who spent years fanning suspicions about Epstein and his associates before returning to office in 2025.
The files led to the arrest in Britain of King Charles’ brother, Mr Mountbatten-Windsor, on Feb 19 on suspicion of misconduct in public office, over allegations he sent confidential government documents to Epstein.
Mr Mountbatten-Windsor was later released from police custody.
Andrew settled earlier suit
In 2022, the king’s brother settled a civil lawsuit
The current police investigation is not related to this or any other allegation of sexual impropriety.
Mr Mountbatten-Windsor, the second son of the late Queen Elizabeth, has always denied any wrongdoing in relation to Epstein, and said he regrets their friendship.
Americans generally view the Epstein case as an example of wealthy and powerful people rarely being held accountable and believe the US government is still hiding information about Epstein’s clients, according to Reuters/Ipsos polling.
“We are trailing too far behind in justice, especially when we are sitting on the mountains of information that we have,” Mrs Amanda Roberts said. “The world is looking at us to do the right thing here.”
Epstein, in exchange for immunity, pleaded guilty in 2008 to a Florida state prostitution charge and served 13 months in jail. He was later arrested in July 2019 on charges of sex trafficking dozens of underage girls.
His August 2019 death in a Manhattan jail cell while awaiting trial was ruled a suicide.
Learning of the arrest of Mr Mountbatten-Windsor had brought “a mixed bag of emotions”, said Mrs Amanda Roberts.
“Initially we were... vindicated and screaming, at one point at 3am. And then it just hits you – that gut punch of the fact that she’s not here to see this, that we’re not able to call her and tell her how astronomically proud we are of her.” REUTERS

Prosecutors stand by former militant's conviction but blast judge's prior conduct as prosecutor
Georgia prosecutors defending the 2000 murder conviction of a onetime Black Panther leader known as H

Georgia prosecutors defending the 2000 murder conviction of a onetime Black Panther leader known as H. Rap Brown say new DNA evidence still points strongly to his guilt in the shooting of two sheriff’s deputies. However, they also accuse the case’s original lead prosecutor, now a Fulton County judge who has handled several high-profile political cases, of “grave and clear” misconduct.
The striking Wednesday filing by Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis’ office acknowledges serious wrongdoing by the former prosecutor and an FBI agent involved in the original investigation. But it argues that modern DNA testing, combined with ballistic evidence and trial testimony, leaves little doubt that Brown — by then known as Jamil Abdullah Al-Amin — was responsible for the attack that killed one deputy and wounded another outside of Al-Amin's Atlanta home.
The former prosecutor, Robert McBurney, is a superior court judge and has been involved in some of the most politically charged cases in the country. Prosecutors described his conduct in Al-Amin's trial as “the most egregious” issue in the case.
Despite standing by the conviction, Willis’ office said it does “not object to a hearing to evaluate the case in its entirety,” potentially keeping alive a public reexamination of a prosecution that has long divided civil rights advocates and law enforcement.
Al-Amin died in prison in November, but his family wants a hearing to clear his name, their attorney Mawuli Davis said, adding, “His legacy is still at the center of this.”
The lead prosecutor
McBurney oversaw the special grand jury Willis used in her investigation that eventually resulted in the indictment of Trump and others over allegations that they illegally tried to overturn the president's narrow 2020 election loss in Georgia. Notably, though, McBurney barred Willis from seeking charges against then-state Sen. Burt Jones because she had hosted a fundraiser for his Democratic opponent in the lieutenant governor’s race, which McBurney ruled created an “actual and untenable” conflict of interest.
McBurney also declared Georgia’s restrictive abortion law unconstitutional — a finding the state Supreme Court has vacated in a case that is ongoing.
“A trifecta of issues”
“This case had a trifecta of issues which undermined the process and the public’s confidence in justice,” the filing says.
During closing arguments at trial, McBurney displayed a chart titled “Questions for the defendant” and asked questions meant to focus the jury’s attention on the fact that Al-Amin didn’t testify. Al-Amin also had court permission to remain seated during the trial for religious reasons, including not standing when the jury entered. McBurney implored the jury, “Don’t stand for him.”
Federal courts have ruled that McBurney violated Al-Amin's constitutional rights, but that it's unlikely his actions substantially affected the verdict.
This week's filing says McBurney “crossed the line from aggressive advocacy into misconduct that undermined the core principles of justice,” accusing him of misrepresenting evidence and withholding critical information from the defense, among other things.
“These were not minor oversights; they reflected a troubling pattern of behavior that prioritized winning over truth, and conviction over justice,” the filing says.
McBurney did not immediately respond to an email Thursday seeking comment.
FBI Special Agent James Campbell approached Al-Amin while he was on the ground in handcuffs, kicked and spit on him, and said, “This is what we do to cop killers,” the filing says. A reprimand of Campbell “did not clear SA Campbell's stain on the investigation,” it says.
Lawyers for Al-Amin have also maintained that Campbell planted the guns used to shoot the deputies at the site where Al-Amin was arrested.
The Associated Press was unable to find contact information for Campbell to seek comment.
Campbell had been transferred to Atlanta after shooting an unarmed Muslim man in the back of the head, the filing says. That man's supporters accused Campbell of planting a gun found at the scene.
The judge did not allow the jury to hear about the prior shooting after the defense presented newspaper articles about it, wanting to use that shooting to demonstrate bias and motive to plant guns. If defense attorneys had presented recently interviewed witnesses rather than relying on articles, the judge likely would have allowed the jury to consider that information, the new filing argues.
New DNA evidence
Al-Amin's lawyers argued that nothing connected Al-Amin to the guns used to shoot the deputies. Willis' office used DNA testing that wasn't available at the time of the trial to test the guns and related items.
The tests excluded Al-Amin from the DNA found on both guns. But Al-Amin's DNA was identified on a leather belt wrapped around one of the guns, the filing says. That evidence is a strong indication of his guilt, especially when paired with prior ballistics evidence and testimony, the filing says.
The shooting
As a radical activist in the 1960s, Al-Amin once said violence was “as American as cherry pie” and that Black people would use violence, if needed, to fight oppression.
He converted to Islam during a prison stint and moved to Atlanta in the 1970s, becoming the leader of one of the nation’s largest black Muslim groups, the National Ummah.
On March 16, 2000, Fulton County sheriff’s deputies Ricky Kinchen and Aldranon English went to Atlanta’s West End neighborhood, where Al-Amin lived, was an imam and owned a grocery store, to serve a warrant for failure to appear in court on charges of driving a stolen car and impersonating a police officer during a traffic stop the previous year.
English testified at trial that Al-Amin fired a high-powered assault rifle when the deputies tried to arrest him. Then, prosecutors said, he used a handgun to fire three shots into Kinchen’s groin as the wounded officer lay in the street.
He was arrested four days later in White Hall, Alabama, a small town where he had helped develop a Muslim community.

Peru's new president under fire over past child marriage comments

Peru's eighth president in a decade has faced criticism within hours of taking office, with scrutiny over past remarks on child marriage and previous misconduct allegations.
Jose Maria Balcazar, 83, was named interim leader on Wednesday for just over five months after his predecessor, Jose Jeri, was impeached over graft allegations.
Jeri, 39, became the latest president to fall amid a cycle of institutional turmoil in which Congress has clashed with a weakened executive against a backdrop of chronic corruption and rising violence.
In the past decade, four presidents have been impeached, two have resigned to avoid the same fate and only one has completed a full term.
Four former leaders are currently behind bars.
A lawyer and former judge representing the leftist Peru Libre party, Balcazar was removed from the Supreme Court bench in 2011 for misconduct and expelled from a regional bar association in 2022 for ethical and criminal violations.
Non-governmental organisations have also criticised his past comments on women's rights.
Controversial record
During a 2023 congressional debate on ending child marriage, Balcazar said "early sexual relations aid a woman's psychological future."
Peru passed a reform that year banning marriage for anyone under 18, a change he had opposed.
The Flora Tristan Peruvian Women’s Center described his nomination as emblematic of a "profound ethical and democratic crisis" in the country.
Balcazar has said his remarks were distorted and taken out of context.
Fernando Rospigliosi, interim president of Congress, called Jeri’s removal "a very serious mistake," while former presidential candidate Keiko Fujimori said Balcazar's nomination marked "a very sad day for the country."

In freewheeling Board of Peace address, Trump reaffirms preference for strongmen, young women
Amid scripted remarks on Gaza and Iran, US president says he ‘endorses foreign leaders,’ warns Rubio not to outshine him and says even ‘horrible human beings’ love Steve Witkoff
WASHINGTON — US President Donald Trump repeatedly went off-script during his 47-minute address to the inaugural Board of Peace meeting in Washington on Thursday, making a number of eye-raising comments amid serious remarks about Gaza and Iran.
In a rambling speech, Trump denounced domestic opponents, highlighted stock market gains and endorsed the political fortunes of several leaders on stage, including populists Viktor Orban of Hungary and Javier Milei of Argentina.
“You know, I’ve had a very good record of endorsing candidates within the United States, but now I endorse foreign leaders,” he said, pointing to Orban, who was seated on stage. He also said that Milei, sitting nearby, had been “a little behind in the polls” until Trump endorsed him, and then “ended up winning in a landslide.”
Trump noted that many wouldn’t be happy with his endorsement of Orban, the leader frequently at odds with most of his European counterparts, who view him as leading a democratic backslide during his 16 years in power.
There was no hint of the criticized human-rights records of some attendees. It was only those who did not attend the inaugural meeting of the board in Washington who received an ominous warning: “You can’t play cute with me,” Trump said.
Trump also singled out some of the “tough” leaders on his Board of Peace, including the leaders of Albania and Azerbaijan, who recently ended decades of conflict.
“These are two tough cookies,” Trump said, pointing to Armenia’s Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan and Azerbaijani President Ilham Aliyev. “You think that was easy? It wasn’t easy. These are two tough people, good people, but tough people.”
He recounted getting the two leaders to soften in the Oval Office, “We made a deal, they hugged, they signed, and we had peace, two very important countries, and I’ll never forget it.”
Israel is slated to hold a national election this year, and Trump has publicly heaped praise on Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, including repeated demands that he be pardoned in his ongoing criminal trial. US Ambassador to Israel Mike Huckabee, however, averred in an interview last month that “I don’t think the president is going to get involved in the [Israeli] elections.”
Turning to address Paraguay’s President Santiago Peña on Thursday, Trump called him a “young, handsome guy.”
“It’s always nice to be young and handsome. It doesn’t mean we have to like you. I don’t like young, handsome men. Women — I like. Men, I don’t have any interest,” Trump said during his speech, as those present chuckled nervously.
“I don’t like young handsome men. Women I like.”

No women were among the nearly three dozen speakers on Thursday, other than the event’s emcee, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt.
Trump also told stories in which he portrayed himself as having coerced leaders into doing what he wanted. He told the crowd how he had used threats of tariffs to pressure some countries, such as India and Pakistan, into ending conflicts. India has firmly rejected this assertion.
The Board of Peace event had the feel of a Trump campaign rally, with music blaring from his eclectic playlist that included Elvis Presley and the Beach Boys. Participants received red Trump hats.
As leaders huddled for a group photo, the event’s soundtrack set the tone, as James Brown’s 1966 song, “It’s a Man’s Man’s Man’s World,” blared overhead.
Trump also appeared to use his speech to fuel the rivalry between the two members of his administration considered the front-runners to replace him as the GOP’s next presidential nominee: Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Vice President JD Vance.
Trump described Vance as “a fantastic man” and a “fantastic talent” before running through the highlights of the vice president’s education and marriage and noting that Vance “gets a little bit tough on occasion.”
The president then pivoted to Rubio, calling his leadership style “the opposite extreme… Marco does it with a velvet glove, but it’s a kill.”
Trump then praised Rubio’s performance at the Munich Security Conference this week, joking that if he did his job any better, he’d be fired for outshining him: “Don’t do any better than you did, please. Because if you do, you’re out of here.”
He also heaped praise on envoy Steve Witkoff, whom Trump has dispatched to conflicts around the world.
He said he brought Witkoff — a real estate developer with zero diplomatic experience — on board because “everybody loved him. All these developers, and they’re tough, you know, New York developers tend to be on the tough side.”
“And, you know, most of them hate each other. Like a lot of the people in this room hate each other, you know, sort of natural, I guess,” Trump added. “But we’re bringing love back into the room, like the old days. But everybody loves Steve. Every developer, the worst, most evil people, horrible human beings, actually. And they love Steve.”
The US president also spoke at length about the United Nations, amid fears from many world leaders and diplomats that the Board of Peace is an attempt to eclipse the UN Security Council. But Trump attempted to assuage those concerns, saying that the US will “work again with the United Nations and, bring it back to health.”
He added that his administration plans to “fix up even the building.”
“I like to see beautiful buildings. I like to see buildings fixed up physically, not look like they are in disrepair,” Trump said. “We don’t like that. So we’re going to do a job with the United Nations.”
Trump said he had a positive relationship with UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres, “other than in my last speech, they did turn off my teleprompter.”
That, he said, was after the escalator he was traveling on in the building stopped abruptly — which the UN said was triggered by an American videographer.
“Lucky my movie star first lady was in front of me, ’cause I put my hand on a certain part of her body, and I was able to stop my fall,” Trump said on Thursday. “So I said, that was strange. I’ve been in a lot of escalators. It’s never happened before. Usually, it stops very slowly. This was just, boom. But our first lady was right in the proper location for me.”
The US president also made some curious comments about a trip to China he made during his first term in 2017, where “President Xi, he treated me so well, he gave me a display.”
“I never saw so many soldiers, all the same height, exactly the same height, within a quarter of an inch… everybody was within about one eighth of an inch the same height,” Trump said. “I said, If they put their helmets down, you could have played pool on the top of their heads.”
And the US president couldn’t help but comment on one of his favorite topics — the fact that he has still not received his long-coveted Nobel Peace Prize.
Trump said he was excited to announce that Norway had agreed to host a Board of Peace event.
“I thought, when I saw this note… I thought they were going to say that they’re giving me the Nobel Prize,” he said. “Oh, this is less exciting.”
Trump said his first thought when seeing that Norway had an announcement was “finally. Finally, they got it right. But I don’t care. I don’t care about Nobel Prizes. I care about saving lives, just so you understand.”
In total, the president used the term “beautiful” at least 14 times in his speech to praise his administration’s work and the event space, which was named after him.
He said it was Secretary of State Marco Rubio’s idea to “surprise” him by renaming the US Institute of Peace, where Thursday’s event was held, in his honor.
“I didn’t know the surprise,” Trump said, “I thought maybe they were going to give me a lot of money or something, maybe cash.”

US trade deficit swells in December as imports surge
The second straight monthly deterioration in the United States’ trade deficit occurred as US firms boosted imports of computer chips and other tech goods.
The United States trade deficit has widened sharply in December amid a surge in imports, and the goods shortfall in 2025 was the highest on record despite US President Donald Trump’s tariffs on foreign-manufactured merchandise.
The second straight monthly deterioration in the trade deficit reported by the US Commerce Department on Thursday suggested that trade made little or no contribution to gross domestic product (GDP) in the fourth quarter.

Exports rose 6 percent last year, and imports rose nearly 5 percent.
The US deficit in the trade of goods widened 2 percent to a record $1.24 trillion last year as American companies boosted imports of computer chips and other tech goods from Taiwan to support massive investments in artificial intelligence.
Amid continuing tensions with Beijing, the deficit in the goods trade with China plunged nearly 32 percent to $202bn in 2025 on a sharp drop in both exports to and imports from the world’s second-biggest economy. But trade was diverted away from China. The goods gap with Taiwan doubled to $147bn and shot up 44 percent, to $178bn, with Vietnam.
Trump last year unleashed a barrage of tariffs against trading partners with the aim, among other things, of addressing trade imbalances and protecting US industries. But the punitive duties have not yielded a manufacturing renaissance, with factory employment declining by 83,000 jobs from January 2025 through January 2026.
“There just isn’t any evidence out there in the economic research literature to suggest that tariffs have materially impacted trade deficits historically when countries have implemented them,” said Chad Bown, senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics.
The trade gap ballooned by 32.6 percent to a five-month high of $70.3bn, the Commerce Department’s Bureau of Economic Analysis and the US Census Bureau said. Economists polled by Reuters forecast the trade deficit would contract to $55.5bn.
The report was delayed because of last year’s government shutdown.
Imports increased 3.6 percent to $357.6bn in December. Goods imports surged 3.8 percent to $280.2bn, boosted by a $7bn increase in industrial supplies and materials, mostly non-monetary gold, copper and crude oil. Capital goods imports increased by $5.6bn, lifted by computer accessories and telecommunications equipment. That rise is likely related to the construction of data centres to support artificial intelligence.
But consumer goods imports fell, pulled down by pharmaceutical preparations. There have been large swings in imports of pharmaceutical preparations because of tariffs.
“But strong imports should also imply strength in details like inventories or business investment,” said Veronica Clark, an economist at Citigroup. “Surging computer imports in particular should correspond with stronger business equipment investment and could remain strong due to AI-related demand.”
Exports fell 1.7 percent to $287.3bn in December. But capital goods exports increased, boosted by semiconductors. There were increases in exports of consumer goods, including pharmaceutical preparations.

Mamdani budget proposal leaves out community safety office, keeps NYPD at same level
Amid Jewish community security concerns, mayor allots $6.38 billion for police, a slight decrease, but does not mention Department of Community Safety meant to rein in hate crimes
Luke Tress is The Times of Israel's New York correspondent.
NEW YORK — New York City Mayor Zohran Mamdani’s preliminary budget for 2027, announced this week, leaves out funds for his signature community safety program, but keeps funding for police at the same level.
Community safety has been a central concern for Jews, who are targeted in hate crimes far more than other groups in the city.
During Mamdani’s campaign, Jewish community leaders repeatedly warned about safety concerns under a Mamdani administration due to his hostility toward Israel and past opposition to police.
The $127 billion budget for 2027 announced this week is preliminary and serves as a starting point for negotiations with the City Council, which must approve a final budget by the end of June. The city’s fiscal year begins in July.
The mayor’s office said the budget needed to close a $5.4 billion gap. Mamdani said he preferred to increase personal income taxes of high-earning New Yorkers and corporate taxes to close the gap, but if that was not possible, would raise property taxes by 9.5% and tap into the city’s reserve funds.
New York City Council Speaker Julie Menin and Comptroller Mark Levine, who are both Jewish, came out against the increase in property taxes. Menin and Levine, both centrist Democrats with deep ties to Jewish communities, hold two of the most powerful positions in city government, enabling them to serve as a counterweight to City Hall.
New York Governor Kathy Hochul also said she opposed the tax hike.
A 2023 survey by the UJA-Federation of New York found that 45% of Jewish households owned their homes in the city, while the citywide average was around 30%.
The biggest expenditures for city agencies in the proposed budget were 40% for education, 26% for social services, and 12% for uniformed agencies, led by the NYPD, at 7%.
The budget called to nix the planned hiring of 5,000 new police officers, keeping the force at around 35,000 officers.
Mamdani’s predecessor, Eric Adams, had announced the plan to hire 5,000 new officers late last year, near the end of his term.
The mayor’s Office of Criminal Justice would receive about $810 million dollars, an increase from $798 million in 2026, the budget said. The Office of Criminal Justice includes the city’s Office of Hate Crime Prevention, which was allotted $26 million. It was not clear how much the hate crimes office received last year because its budget was wrapped into funding for the Office of Criminal Justice.
The NYPD’s budget would remain nearly the same, from $6.4 billion in 2026 to $6.38 billion in 2027.
The preliminary budget did not refer to funds for Mamdani’s proposed Department of Community Safety, a central plank of his plan to combat antisemitism and other hate crimes in the city.
Mamdani’s initial plan for the department called for $1.1 billion in funding.
Mamdani said on Tuesday that the revised executive budget, which will be released in the coming months, will include investments in the department.

‘I don’t like young, handsome men’ Trump insists before he torches ‘attractive’ AOC in rambling Peace Board speech
Trump’s speech to his Board of Peace, a group of mostly autocratic leaders, included threats on Iran and yet more complaints about not being awarded the Nobel Peace Prize ... and bizarrely ended with the Village People’s YMCA
- Bookmark
- CommentsGo to comments
President Donald Trump couldn't stop himself from embarking on a nearly 40-minute ramble through a wide variety of disparate topics at the inaugural meeting of his Board of Peace, charged with overseeing implementation of his 20-point Gaza peace plan — including his dislike for attractive males and the appearance of one of his most prominent female foils in the U.S. Congress.
Trump was winding his way through his latest digression from prepared remarks, praising himself and the group of autocrats and Middle Eastern monarchs who have joined his panel when he found himself seemingly feeling the need to affirm his sexual preferences after commenting on Paraguayan President Santiago Peña’s appearance, calling him a “young, handsome guy.”
“It's always nice to be young and handsome — it doesn't mean we have to like you. I don't like young handsome men,” Trump said.
“Women, I like. Men, no, I don’t have any interest,” he added before laughing nervously.
Trump then continued with his rundown of the world leaders in attendance at the event before pivoting from offering praise for Vice President JD Vance’s academic record to insulting the intelligence of “attractive” New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez by claiming the Boston University graduate “didn’t do well ... in college.”
Trump hit out at the Bronx Democrat, a longtime target of his rhetorical barbs, for a disastrously awkward answer she’d given days earlier during an appearance at the Munich Security Conference after she was asked about America’s defense commitment to Taiwan.
Ocasio-Cortez’s halting, hesitant answer was widely mocked in conservative media spaces over the last week, and though Trump didn’t mention her name it was clear about whom he was speaking.
“There was one young, attractive woman, she was unable to answer questions, and she didn't do so well like JD did in college,” Trump said, contrasting her academic record with the vice president’s.
“She was unable to answer a simple question. And she could have said, ‘well, I'm studying it, and I'll report back to you next week.’ You know, you can get away with that. But ... actually, I think it could be a career ending answer, because for 25 years, anybody running against her, I think ... is going to use that, that little piece of stuff. It was not good. It was not good,” Trump added.
The president continued his meandering speech for another 30 minutes, during which he repeated his oft-used boast about having singlehandedly ended as many as eight world conflicts, most of which are still ongoing despite his claims to the contrary.
The “Board of Peace” meeting was held at the former headquarters of the United States Institute for Peace, which Trump and his erstwhile “Department of Government Efficiency” boss Elon Musk attempted to hollow out last year by firing most of the independent organization’s employees and forcing the transfer of the institute’s gleaming headquarters to the State Department — which promptly renamed it after the president.
Trump remarked that “nobody knew what to name” the building — which had long been called the U.S. Institute for Peace — until Secretary of State Marco Rubio ordered the renaming.
Although the president has long made a habit of slapping his name on everything from steaks to the Washington, D.C. arts center that is a memorial to assassinated president John F. Kennedy, he claimed Rubio had done so without his knowledge.
“Nobody believes it, and that's okay, but I appreciated it,” he said.
Trump’s remarks were the opening act of an hours-long session that saw most, of not all of the assembled leaders who’ve chosen to join the new international organization deliver short speeches of their own in which most of them offered over-the-top praise to the American president that was reminiscent of the sycophantic comments seen during one of his administration’s cabinet meetings.
Although he used the televised speech to saber-rattle at Iran’s leaders by threatening “bad things” if Tehran and Washington can’t reach a deal to curb Iran’s nuclear program within “the next, probably 10 days,” the leaders and top diplomats in attendance — plus FIFA president Gianni Infantino — each took pains to thank Trump and hail his commitment to the Gaza peace process, with the president announcing commitments of at least $7 billion from Kazakhstan, Azerbaijan, UAE, Morocco, Bahrain, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Uzbekistan and Kuwait — plus troops or police training assistance from Indonesia, Morocco, Kazakhstan, Kosovo, Albania, Egypt and Jordan.
Trump, who the organization’s charter lists as its chairman — a position he can hold for the rest of his life if he so desires — has in recent months tried to expand the new group’s supposed remit to something more in line with his outsized ambitions to position himself as a transformational American leader and an indispensable man of world history.
Rather than a purpose-built body to oversee the Gaza ceasefire and reconstruction as intended by the U.N., the charter signed by Trump the other “Board of Peace” members make no mention of the Gaza conflict or the fact that the board’s mandate is limited to Gaza and expires at the end of 2027.
Instead, it describes itself as “an international organization that seeks to promote stability, restore dependable and lawful governance, and secure enduring peace in areas affected or threatened by conflict” that is composed only of “States invited to participate by the Chairman” — that’s Trump — and willing to donate $1 billion for a permanent membership.
Trump will also serve as the first American representative to the board — a position that will pass to his successor as president — but he’ll remain the board’s chairman for life.
None of the United States’ major European allies have elected to join the organization, and the only EU member state that has done so thus far is Hungary, which is led by autocratic Trump ally Viktor Orban.

LONDON, February 19. /TASS/. The United Kingdom is not letting the United States to use its military bases to deliver strikes on Iran, The Times wrote citing sources.
According to the newspaper, Washington has been drafting detailed plans of a military operation against Iran, which include the use of the joint US-UK base on the Diego Garcia island in the Indian Ocean, and the Royal Air Force Station Fairford in Gloucestershire, the United Kingdom, which is the USAF's only European airfield for heavy bombers. According to The Times, London has not yet authorized the use of these facilities, fearing that the US strike on Iran would constitute "a breach of the international law."
The newspaper wrote that the UK government’s position has provoked the ire of US President Donald Trump, who publicly "attacked" the UK-Mauritius deal to hand over sovereignty over the Chagos Islands, hosting the Diego Garcia base, to Mauritius. The document was signed on May 22, 2025, but has not yet been ratified by the UK Parliament.
On Wednesday, Trump wrote on Truth Social that UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer was making "a big mistake" by handing over the archipelago to Mauritius, adding that the UK government should not take steps that may potentially lead to the loss of control over the Diego Garcia base.
Trump said it was possible that Washington will have to use the Diego Garcia base to thwart an alleged attack that Iran may possibly try to carry out.

Trump calls Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor’s arrest ‘so bad for the royal family’
‘I think it's very sad,’ Trump said of Andrew’s arrest
- Bookmark
US President Donald Trump has weighed in on the arrest of Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor, hours after the King’s brother was detained under suspicion of misconduct in public office.
“I think it's a shame. I think it's very sad. I think it's so bad for the royal family. It’s very, very sad. To me, it’s a very sad thing,” Mr. Trump said Thursday.
Andrew, who used to be known as “Prince” before having his royal titles stripped, was arrested after police launched an investigation into claims that he shared sensitive information while on official visits as the UK as the country’s trade envoy with Jeffrey Epstein.
The claims emerged as part of the Epstein file’s that were recently released by Trump’s Department of Justice.

'Failure is not an option' in Gaza reconstruction, says Trump envoy

ISTANBUL
Jared Kushner, a key figure in US peace efforts, said Thursday that failure in the Gaza Strip is "not an option" as he outlined an ambitious vision for rebuilding the war-torn territory at the inaugural Board of Peace meeting in Washington.
"We are here to help the people of Gaza, to lift them up and give them every opportunity to succeed," said US President Donald Trump's son-in-law, describing the effort as a partnership with Gazans and Israelis to create "an environment that can be peaceful, that could be functional."
Kushner struck an optimistic tone about international cooperation, saying Muslims, Jews, Palestinians, Israelis and people from across the world had come together around "a common goal, which is peace and togetherness."
"We cannot change the past," he said, "but what you're seeing today is that we can potentially change the future if we focus and do this in the right way."
He said participants of the Board of Peace are "a very self-selecting group of countries that really believe that the future can be different," noting those involved were doing it "for their children and for their grandchildren."
A promotional video produced by Kushner outlined reconstruction efforts on the ground, describing the establishment of safe zones offering shelter, food, health care and education for Palestinian families.
Infrastructure work coordinated with the US and the World Bank would employ hundreds of thousands in rebuilding and commercial activities, while transport, water and energy systems would be restored.
The video set a three-year target for the full reconstruction of Rafah, reduced unemployment and Gaza's connection to the world through a corridor linking Egypt, Israel, Jordan, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, extending to India and Europe.
Within a decade, Gaza will become a self-governing territory integrated into the region with thriving industry and housing, according to the video.

Epstein accuser’s brother hopes former Prince Andrew’s arrest signals ‘house of cards’ collapsing
Sign up now: Get ST's newsletters delivered to your inbox
WASHINGTON – The brother of one of Jeffrey Epstein’s most prominent accusers welcomed the arrest of Mr Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor
In an interview with Reuters, Mr Sky Roberts – whose sister Virginia Giuffre took her own life in April – and his wife urged the US Justice Department to take action against others suspected of playing a role in Epstein’s crimes.
“This is where the house of cards starts falling,” Mr Sky Roberts said in a joint interview with Mrs Amanda Roberts.
The release of millions of records on Epstein
The case has turned into a persistent political problem for President Donald Trump, who spent years fanning suspicions about Epstein and his associates before returning to office in 2025.
The files led to the arrest in Britain of King Charles’ brother, Mr Mountbatten-Windsor, on Feb 19 on suspicion of misconduct in public office, over allegations he sent confidential government documents to Epstein.
Mr Mountbatten-Windsor was later released from police custody.
Andrew settled earlier suit
In 2022, the king’s brother settled a civil lawsuit
The current police investigation is not related to this or any other allegation of sexual impropriety.
Mr Mountbatten-Windsor, the second son of the late Queen Elizabeth, has always denied any wrongdoing in relation to Epstein, and said he regrets their friendship.
Americans generally view the Epstein case as an example of wealthy and powerful people rarely being held accountable and believe the US government is still hiding information about Epstein’s clients, according to Reuters/Ipsos polling.
“We are trailing too far behind in justice, especially when we are sitting on the mountains of information that we have,” Mrs Amanda Roberts said. “The world is looking at us to do the right thing here.”
Epstein, in exchange for immunity, pleaded guilty in 2008 to a Florida state prostitution charge and served 13 months in jail. He was later arrested in July 2019 on charges of sex trafficking dozens of underage girls.
His August 2019 death in a Manhattan jail cell while awaiting trial was ruled a suicide.
Learning of the arrest of Mr Mountbatten-Windsor had brought “a mixed bag of emotions”, said Mrs Amanda Roberts.
“Initially we were... vindicated and screaming, at one point at 3am. And then it just hits you – that gut punch of the fact that she’s not here to see this, that we’re not able to call her and tell her how astronomically proud we are of her.” REUTERS

Trump warns Iran of ‘bad things’ if no deal made, appears to set deadline of 10-15 days
Sign up now: Get ST's newsletters delivered to your inbox
- President Trump warned Iran to make a nuclear deal within 10-15 days or face "really bad things," hinting at further US military action.
- Amid a massive US military buildup and war fears, Russia's warship joined Iranian naval drills, warning of "unprecedented escalation of tension."
- US-Iran nuclear talks are stalled; the US demands Iran cease uranium enrichment and missile development, which Iran refuses, heightening tensions.
AI generated
WASHINGTON - President Donald Trump warned Iran on Feb 19 that it must make a deal over its nuclear programme or “really bad things” will happen, and appeared to set a deadline of no more than 10 to 15 days before the US might take action.
Amid a massive US military buildup in the Middle East that has fuelled fears of a wider war, Mr Trump said negotiations with Iran to end the tense standoff were going well but insisted Tehran has to reach a “meaningful” agreement.
“Otherwise bad things happen,” Mr Trump, who has repeatedly threatened to attack Iran, told the first meeting of his Board of Peace in Washington.
Mr Trump spoke of the US airstrikes carried out in June, saying Iran’s nuclear potential had been “decimated,” adding “we may have to take it a step further or we may not.”
“You’ll be finding out over the next probably 10 days,” he said.
Asked later to elaborate, he told reporters aboard Air Force One: “I would think that would be enough time, 10, 15 days, pretty much maximum.”
But he declined to be specific, except to warn again of “really bad things” and insist that Iran would have to make a deal one way or another.
‘Good talks’: Trump
Mr Trump’s threats to bomb Iran, with the two sides far apart in talks on Tehran’s nuclear programme, have pushed up oil prices, and a Russian corvette warship on Feb 19 joined planned Iranian naval drills in the Gulf of Oman, a vital sea route for global energy.
Iranian and US negotiators met on Feb 17 and Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araqchi said they had agreed on “guiding principles.”
White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said on Feb 17, however, that the two sides remained apart on some issues.
Mr Trump said “good talks are being had,” and a senior US official said Iran would make a written proposal on how to address US concerns.
Mr Trump called on Tehran to join the US on the “path to peace.”
“They can’t have a nuclear weapon, it’s very simple,” he said.
“You can’t have peace in the Middle East if they have a nuclear weapon.”
Iran has resisted making major concessions on its nuclear programme, though insisting it is for peaceful purposes. The US and Israel in the past have accused Tehran of trying to develop a nuclear bomb.
Mr Trump’s latest sabre-rattling came as he talked himself up as a man of peace in a long, meandering speech while hosting world leaders at the inaugural meeting of his Board of Peace.
He proposed the body in September when he announced his plan to end Israel’s war against Hamas in Gaza. He later expanded the board’s remit to tackle conflicts worldwide, prompting many key Western allies to stay away.
Earlier on Feb 19, Russia warned against an “unprecedented escalation of tension” around Iran and urged restraint amid the US military buildup in the region, which a senior American official said should be complete by mid-March.
Threat of war
Mr Trump has sent aircraft carriers, warships and jets to the region, raising the prospect of another attack on the Islamic Republic.
The US and Israel bombed Iran’s nuclear facilities and some military sites last June. US Secretary of State Marco Rubio will meet Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to discuss Iran on Feb 28, the senior US official said.
Washington wants Iran to entirely give up uranium enrichment, a process used to create fuel for atomic power plants but that can also provide material for a warhead.
The US and ally Israel also want Iran to give up long-range ballistic missiles, stop supporting groups around the Middle East and stop using force to quell internal protests.
Iran says it refuses to discuss issues beyond the atomic file, calling efforts to limit its missile arsenal a red line.
Satellite pictures have tracked both Iranian work to repair and fortify sites since last summer, showing work at both nuclear and missile sites, as well as preparations at US bases across the Middle East over the past month.
Iran’s joint exercise with Russia came days into an extended series of Iranian naval drills in the Gulf of Oman, with Iranian state television showing special forces units deployed on helicopters and ships.
In a sign of growing concern over the increased tensions, Poland on Feb 19 became the latest European country to urge its citizens to leave Iran, with Prime Minister Donald Tusk saying Poles may only have hours to evacuate.
Mr Trump began threatening strikes on Iran again in January as Iranian authorities crushed widespread protests with deadly violence that left thousands dead across the country. REUTERS

Former British MP Jack Lopresti has joined the 12th Special Forces Brigade Azov of the 1st Corps of the Ukrainian National Guard.
He announced this on his Facebook page.
Lopresti lost his seat in parliament in the general election in July 2024, after which he decided to join the defense of Ukraine.
Jack Lopresti is a 56-year-old British politician from the Conservative Party who represented the Filton and Bradley Stoke constituency in the House of Commons from 2010 to 2024.
He served as deputy chairman of the Conservative Party and was an active member of the Defence Committee. For many years, he consistently advocated for increased military aid to Ukraine and the transfer of modern weapons.
In November 2024, Lopresti joined the International Legion. Despite his previous status as a high-ranking politician, he has military experience, having previously served in the British Army Reserve in an artillery regiment and participated in combat operations in Afghanistan.
In the British Army, he held the rank of corporal, which corresponds to a junior sergeant in the Ukrainian Army.

Ukrainian, Italian officials discuss strengthening Ukraine's defense industry
According to Ukrinform, Umerov shared details of the meeting via Facebook.
"We discussed defense, energy, and economic support for Ukraine, and synchronized our positions on the next steps in our cooperation," Umerov said.
Separate meetings were also held with the leadership of Italy's largest defense companies.
The talks focused on strengthening Ukraine's defense industry, particularly the development of air defense capabilities to protect Ukrainian cities, Umerov said.
He thanked Italy for its consistent support of Ukraine.
As Ukrinform earlier reported, during the full-scale war Ukraine's defense industry has demonstrated unprecedented growth: production capacity has increased 50-fold, reaching $50 billion. As a result, domestic manufacturers now supply more than half of Ukrainian forces' weapons needs.

On October 7 we got up just before 5:30 A.M. for a dawn alert. We were two tank crews of soldiers from the Golani Brigade at the "White House" outpost. We got dressed and entered the tank. Everything looked calm and, according to procedure, we went to sleep in the compartments, with one person staying awake to listen to the vehicle radio. We woke up suddenly from explosions of mortar shells and then calls of "Purple Rain" on the radio – warning of incoming rounds nearby. Immediately afterward, shouts of "There's been a penetration!" started.

Palestinian-American, 19, shot and killed in settler attack in West Bank — PA
Nasrallah Abu Siam and 4 others said injured when some 30 masked settlers raided barn to steal livestock in Mukhmas; military says it’s investigating; no arrests reported
A Palestinian man was shot dead and four others were wounded by armed settlers who stole dozens of livestock while accompanied by troops of the Israel Defense Forces in the central West Bank’s Mukhmas on Wednesday, the Palestinian Authority said overnight.
The person killed was identified as Mukhmas resident Nasrallah Abu Siam, 19. Abu Siam’s mother told The Associated Press that he also held American citizenship.
Footage from Abu Siam’s funeral in Mukhmas on Thursday showed people waving Palestinian flags and chanting religious and populist slogans as they carried his body, which was wrapped in a Palestinian flag and a keffiyeh.
The US Embassy in Israel did not respond to requests for comment Thursday. The IDF said it was investigating the incident.
Mukhmas residents cited by the Kan public broadcaster said Abu Siam was shot when some 30 masked settlers, some of them armed, raided Palestinian barns and stole 380 head of livestock, as Palestinian shepherds tried to fend off the settlers.
Security camera footage from Mukhmas, published by left-wing activist group Herd of Justice, showed a settler running into a barn and waving a stick to get the animals out.

Other footage from a hand-held camera, published by Kan, showed people identified as Palestinians hurling stones toward a raised position as rocks thrown from above fall around them.
One person in the clip can be seen falling to the ground and being dragged away by another.

Meanwhile, Arabic media published footage showing people identified as settlers hurling rocks from a raised position, as well as masked and armed settlers moving in between Palestinian homes and a shouting match between Palestinians and settlers, one of whom carried an assault rifle.
The Palestinian Red Crescent Society said three people shot by settlers were rushed to the Palestine Medical Complex, including Abu Siam, whose condition was described as serious. The Palestinian Authority’s Jerusalem Governorate later announced Abu Siam had succumbed to his wounds at the hospital.
The governorate said another two people were also hospitalized, at least one of whom was beaten by IDF forces, according to WAFA, the PA’s official news agency.

Haaretz cited one eyewitness as saying the settlers surrounded Abu Siam after he was shot, “hit him with clubs and stones, and almost killed him. They acted like animals — there was no humanity in them.”
Soldiers who arrived on the scene “watched them and did nothing except hurl tear gas at us. It was awful,” the person said, adding that the military ordered Palestinians to leave the barns.
In response to a query, the IDF said troops were dispatched to Mukhmas on Wednesday “following a report of rioting and violent confrontations that included stone-throwing,” and that later, “another force arrived at the scene and used riot dispersal means to restore order.”
The military said it later received reports of gunfire by “suspects” that resulted in several Palestinians being wounded.
There were no reports of any arrests.
“No gunfire by IDF troops during the incident is known,” the military said, adding that the incident is under further investigation. However, according to Kan, it was still unclear if the settler who fired the shot was part of one of the IDF’s so-called area defense forces, known by its Hebrew acronym Hagmar.
Dozens of soldiers from such units, which comprise local settlers in reserve duty, have been dismissed for violations, including attacks on Palestinians, the military said last month.
Abu Siam was the first person killed by Israeli settlers in the West Bank in 2026, and the 37th since the Hamas-led onslaught of October 7, 2023, according to the PA’s official news agency WAFA.
Settler attacks have spiked since the Hamas onslaught. The attacks, which occur on a near-daily basis, largely go unchecked. Prosecutions of Jewish extremists are rare, and convictions are even rarer. Critics have accused the government, described as the most hardline in Israel’s history, of shrugging off the attacks.
Data published by the IDF and Shin Bet security agency last month showed a 27 percent rise in settler attacks in 2025 compared to the previous year.
In addition to the overall rise in settler attacks, in 2025 there was also an increase in the number of severe incidents, including shootings, arson, and other violent crimes: 128 in the past year, compared with 83 in 2024 and 54 in 2023, according to the data.

Türkiye hopes US, Iran reach 'genuine negotiation' without need for war: Foreign minister
Hakan Fidan attends inaugural Board of Peace meeting, says parties to Iran talks 'giving unprecedentedly positive signals'
WASHINGTON
Türkiye hopes the US and Iran will reach a "genuine negotiation" without the need for a military operation or war, Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan said Thursday.
“Our wish is that there will be no need for a military operation or war, and that the parties genuinely reach a negotiation here," Fidan told Anadolu and TRT in the US capital, Washington, DC.
His remarks came right after attending the inaugural Board of Peace meeting, which was presided over by US President Donald Trump, bringing together representatives from more than 45 countries to discuss Gaza’s reconstruction and broader international stabilization efforts.
"As you know, this is an issue we follow closely. The process that started in Istanbul has led Americans and Iranians to begin speaking again. This is an extraordinarily important development," Fidan said.
Following diplomatic efforts launched in Istanbul, the two sides met twice — once in Oman's capital Muscat and once in Geneva, Switzerland — he noted.
Fidan added that he also met with one of the parties in Washington to assess the direction of the talks.
“Essentially, there are many reasons to be hopeful,” he said. “We hope they reach a result, especially on the nuclear file.”
He noted that his recent discussions involving Oman as a mediator, along with his direct contacts with American and Iranian officials, have been more constructive than in the past.
“My impression from the current talks — speaking with the Omani mediator, with the United States, and with Iran — is that the parties are giving unprecedentedly positive signals, particularly in advancing certain concrete issues,” he added.
At the same time, he cautioned that rising military activity by the US in the region is being "closely" monitored.
“We observe that military mobility has also increased,” Fidan said.
"Of course, we are closely monitoring whether this military activity is intended to put pressure on the ongoing negotiations or whether it is preparation for a pre-planned military operation."
Despite encouraging diplomatic signals, Fidan stressed that the process remains at a delicate stage.
“How this becomes practically implementable, when it will happen, how the parties perceive it, and how that perception guides their next steps — we are at a critical threshold right now,” he said. “It needs to be followed carefully.”
Trump said Thursday that it would soon become clear whether a deal with Iran is possible, warning that Washington may be forced to escalate if negotiations fall short.

Poland not seeking to possess nuclear weapons — defense minister

MOSCOW, February 19. /TASS/. Poland honors its international nuclear non-proliferation commitments and has no plans to obtain nuclear weapons, Defense Minister Wladyslaw Kosiniak-Kamysz said.
"Poland is bound by relevant obligations under international conventions. This topic (striving to possess nuclear weapons - TASS) is not subject for a broad discussion," he said in an interview with the PAP, AFP, and DPA agencies.
However, in his words, Poland’s science should develop the nuclear sector.
Apart from that, he noted that Warsaw should be ready to cooperate with its NATO allies on nuclear weapons deployment initiatives.
Polish President Karol Nawrocki said in an interview with the Polsat television channel on February 15 that Poland should aim to develop nuclear capabilities. However, Foreign Minister Radoslaw Sikorski said earlier that the Polish government is not discussing stationing nuclear weapons on the country's territory.
Poland’s former President (2015-2025) Andrzej Duda repeatedly advocated for deploying American nuclear weapons in Poland. In the spring of 2025, Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk stated that Poland would strive to gain access to the most modern types of weapons including nuclear weapons, supporting French President Emmanuel Macron’s idea to extend the French "nuclear umbrella" to other European countries.

US man found guilty of beating 4 to death in New York Chinatown, including HK migrant
The jury rejected an insanity defence by Randy Santos for the killings of Chuen Kok, 83, and three other homeless men in 2019
A man who fatally beat four sleeping men on the streets of New York’s Chinatown was convicted of first-degree murder on Thursday, with a jury rejecting his insanity defence in the 2019 rampage.
Randy Santos’ lawyers had conceded that he pummelled the defenceless victims – Chuen Kok, Anthony Manson, Florencio Moran and Nazario Vasquez Villegas – with a metal bar and meant to kill them.
But Santos’ lawyers contended that he was too mentally ill to be held criminally responsible. They said he was driven by schizophrenic delusions that made him believe he had to kill 40 people or would die himself.
Prosecutors countered that Santos took steps, such as sometimes looking out for potential witnesses, and subsequently made remarks that showed he knew the attacks were both illegal and immoral.
The Dominican-born Santos, 31, showed no reaction as he heard the verdict, through headphones, via a Spanish-language interpreter.
The killings spurred scrutiny of the city’s struggles to aid and protect a homeless population that had reached a record size. Santos was homeless, as were some of the victims. The slain men ranged in age from 39 to 83.

A palace in Marrakesh: How Schwab moved $27.7 million in payments for Epstein days before his arrest
Sign up now: Get ST's newsletters delivered to your inbox
LONDON/WASHINGTON/TORONTO, Feb 19 - Charles Schwab wired about $27.7 million on behalf of Jeffrey Epstein to a realtor in Morocco as the disgraced financier tried to purchase a palace in the 10 days before his 2019 arrest, including one transfer from an account which lacked sufficient funds, files released by the U.S. Department of Justice show.
Details of the transactions, reported by Reuters for the first time, show how the U.S. brokerage handled funds for Epstein over the course of several months at a time when he was under intense public scrutiny after reports in the Miami Herald in 2018.
Schwab flagged the payments in a suspicious activity report (SAR) to the U.S. Treasury Department's Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) on July 13, seven days after Epstein's arrest, the documents show.
An examination of more than a hundred documents shows Schwab opened three accounts for Epstein's companies in April 2019, including one for Southern Trust, a business that was attempting to buy the opulent Bin Ennakhil palace in Marrakesh, Morocco.
The Schwab corporate account listed Richard Kahn, Epstein's accountant, as authorised individual and Epstein as Southern Trust's president and sole beneficial owner.
Between June 26 and July 9, 2019, Southern Trust instructed Schwab to wire about $12.7 million in euros for the purchase but then reversed the order. Schwab then received another wire request, which was signed by Epstein, and sent $14.95 million to buy the same property, even though there were insufficient funds in the account pending the return of the original payment.
Schwab declined to comment on details of the accounts, saying federal regulation, privacy laws and its policies and procedures require it to maintain confidentiality.
"An associate of Epstein opened accounts in April 2019. Shortly after, our Risk team began investigating the accounts and within 60 days of starting the review, we notified the client of our decision to close and terminate the relationship. We also referred the matter to federal law enforcement," it said in an emailed response to Reuters.
Schwab declined to provide details on exactly when its risk team began investigating.
Under the U.S. Bank Secrecy Act, financial firms must file a suspicious activity report no later than 30 days after the initial detection of facts, in addition to filing reports of cash transactions that exceed $10,000 daily to assist in detecting and preventing money laundering.
FinCEN declined to comment. A lawyer for Kahn did not respond to Reuters' questions.
Marc Leon, the realtor in Marrakesh, told Reuters by email that Epstein first tried to buy Bin Ennakhil in 2011 and negotiations on the terms and price continued over the years.
With gold-draped walls, a hammam steam spa, 60 marble fountains and an outdoor pool and jacuzzi, Bin Ennakhil spreads across a total plot of 4.6 hectares, a property listing included in the DOJ's file cache said. It boasts multiple gardens with hundreds of olive trees and more than 2,000 palms, the listing said, in an area bigger than New York's Washington Square Park or around six standard soccer pitches.
Leon also defended his role in facilitating Epstein's bid for the property.
"Epstein had been convicted of sex crimes (in 2008) and had served his sentence. There was therefore nothing to prevent him from attempting to purchase property in Morocco. We had no way of knowing that he had continued his terrible crimes," he said.
Epstein died in jail in August 2019 while facing U.S. federal sex trafficking charges.
EPSTEIN INSTRUCTED FUNDS TO BE MOVED
Epstein turned to Schwab in 2019 as Deutsche Bank was winding down accounts held by the convicted sex offender, who had pleaded guilty in 2008 to soliciting prostitution from an underage girl and went to prison.
Schwab was among at least seven financial firms subpoenaed by the U.S. Virgin Islands in 2020 requesting documents in relation to the co-executors of Epstein's estate. The subpoena did not name Schwab as a defendant and contained no accusations of wrongdoing against the brokerage.
Emails and wire transfer requests contained in the DOJ documents, which may not be comprehensive, show that Epstein discussed purchasing the luxury property in Marrakesh with his associates in the spring of 2019.
Southern Trust, the company owned by Epstein, agreed to buy the property through Leon in March of that year.
After considering various financial arrangements, the files show, Epstein instructed associates to move funds to Leon.
Schwab then received an order from Southern Trust to wire 11.15 million euros, roughly equivalent to $12.7 million at the time, to Leon on June 26, 2019, Schwab said in the SAR, which was seen by Reuters.
The SAR was contained in the batch the DOJ had released publicly, but has since been withdrawn for reasons Reuters could not ascertain. The DOJ declined to comment on the file.
The funds were sent to a Julius Baer account in Switzerland held by Leon, who was based in Marrakesh at the time, the SAR shows.
A file on the DOJ website also shows the request.
The next day, Schwab received a call from a person whose identity is redacted from the SAR requesting the termination of the transfer. Asked why, they told Schwab that terms on the real-estate deal had not been "agreeable".
The person also said another payment would be made for a larger sum to a different account, the SAR shows.
Schwab was successful in reversing the order, which would be credited back on July 10, the SAR shows.
Two days before Epstein's arrest, in a July 4 wire transfer request signed by Epstein and his co-signatory, Southern Trust instructed Schwab to send Leon $14.95 million, the SAR shows.
Schwab said the funds were sent to an account of Leon's at Julius Baer, the SAR shows.
Yet Epstein's Southern Trust account did not have sufficient funds because Schwab had not yet returned money from the earlier transfer, the SAR says.
While Schwab could have had a reasonable expectation that the payment would be transferred back to Epstein's account, the bank would have been exposed to risk until the funds were returned.
Reuters could not establish when the $12.7 million ultimately landed back in Epstein's account but the funds were due to arrive on July 10, the SAR dated July 13 shows.
Asked by Reuters about its policy at that time for processing international wire transfers when accounts had insufficient funds, Schwab declined to comment.
Reuters was not able to establish whether Julius Baer accepted the transfers. A spokesperson for Julius Baer declined to comment.
Leon said: "The anti-money laundering checks in force were carried out by the banking institutions involved in the future transaction, which ultimately never took place."
It was not until July 9, three days after Epstein's arrest, that Schwab cancelled the second transfer at the request of an individual acting on Epstein's behalf whose name is redacted, the SAR shows.
An email included in the other DOJ documents shows Epstein's accountant Kahn asked to cancel the transfer on July 9.
Kahn has been ordered to testify before Congress next week to answer questions about whether he helped to facilitate Epstein's crimes through his management of the late sex offender's financial affairs, House Oversight Committee member Robert Garcia said in a media statement in January.
Reuters has no evidence that Kahn is guilty of wrongdoing.
In a follow-up exchange with Schwab after Epstein's arrest, an unidentified Epstein associate asked if future transfers for Southern Trust's account would still require two signatures as more money would be sent soon, the SAR shows.
Epstein had been charged with sex trafficking of minors and remained in jail, the DOJ said on July 8.
Schwab told FinCEN in the July 13 SAR it had "concerns with attempted wires for the purpose of real estate, in light of negative media surrounding Jeffrey Epstein" and worries about him being a possible flight risk ahead of a bail hearing.
"This investigation is the result of an internal referral," the document shows Schwab saying.
While Epstein's deal fell through, the palace of Bin Ennakhil - which means "amidst the palms" - in Marrakesh is no longer vacant.
"The property has since been sold to another buyer," Leon told Reuters. REUTERS

House Democrats call for Treasury probe into Trump family crypto venture

Dozens of House Democrats wrote to Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent on Thursday calling for an investigation into possible conflicts of interest and national security concerns related to World Liberty Financial, the Trump family's cryptocurrency venture.
The letter, led by Rep. Gregory Meeks, D-N.Y. and 40 other lawmakers, landed after Bessent testified at a contentious House Financial Services Committee hearing earlier this month. Meeks at the hearing called Bessent a "flunky" of President Donald Trump and raised questions about a $500 million stake that Sheikh Tahnoon bin Zayed Al Nahyan — a royal from the United Arab Emirates also known as the "spy sheikh" — bought in World Liberty Financial last year.
"The Trump family's $500 million deal connected to the Emirati royal family is not only a matter of national financial instability, but it also carries serious national security implications," Meeks said in a statement accompanying the letter. "Trust that the record will reflect whether Secretary Bessent chooses to answer to the American people, or his mob boss."
The request for a probe was made as World Liberty Financial is seeking a national bank charter, a distinction reviewed and issued by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, an independent arm of the Treasury Department that regulates banks.
World Liberty Financial held a day-long forum Wednesday at Mar-a-Lago where presidential sons Don Jr. and Eric Trump touted the family's stablecoin and called traditional banking a "Ponzi scheme."
Meeks at the hearing asked Bessent to commit to pause any pending applications from World Liberty Financial before the OCC and to complete an investigation into the "conflicts of interest and foreign influence."
"The OCC is an independent entity," Bessent said then, over the shouts of Meeks, without addressing the topic further.
President Donald Trump and his special envoy, Steve Witkoff, are co-founders emeritus of the company, which is run by members of the Trump and Witkoff families.
"This is no longer just a debate about crypto chartering theory. It is about foreign ownership, national security, regulatory integrity, and whether our bank-chartering process is resilient to political and geopolitical pressure," the lawmakers wrote Thursday.
In the letter, Democratic members asked for information on the safeguards in place to ensure that "foreign government officials, sovereign proxies, or politically connected investors cannot use the bank-chartering process to gain leverage over the U.S. financial system or access sensitive financial or technological infrastructure."
It also asks what role the White House, Office and Management and Budget and Treasury have in "reviewing, approving, or otherwise influencing national bank or trust chartering decisions made by the" OCC. It lawmakers requested a response from Treasury by Feb. 26.
A Treasury Department spokesperson did not immediately respond to an email seeking comment.
"The credibility of America's banking regulatory framework, and of the institutions charged with protecting it, depends on transparency, independence, and a demonstrated willingness to resist undue influence," the lawmakers wrote. "Our constituents need confidence that our banking system is governed by law, not proximity to power; by prudential judgment, not political convenience."

Norwegian ex-diplomat questioned over alleged links to Epstein

ISTANBUL
Former Norwegian diplomat Terje Rod-Larsen has been questioned by Norway’s economic crime authority, Okokrim, over alleged links to late convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein and provided a detailed statement addressing all matters under investigation, his lawyer confirmed on Thursday.
Attorney John Christian Elden told public broadcaster NRK that the indictment “does not refer to specific actions,” making it difficult to determine what his client is directly suspected of. He stressed that Rod-Larsen does not admit guilt.
“Despite this, Rod-Larsen has, based on his health situation, explained in detail his relationship with Jeffrey Epstein, including their interaction and financial relationship,” Elden said.
Okokrim confirmed that the hearing took place in Oslo. First State Prosecutor Marianne Bender, who is leading the investigation concerning Rod-Larsen and his wife, diplomat Mona Juul, said: “He has answered our questions, and we have the impression that he wants to cooperate with Okokrim.”
Rod-Larsen has also waived confidentiality for his former lawyers related to the purchase of an apartment in Frogner, allowing them to testify freely to investigators, authorities said.
Okokrim added that it is in contact with foreign governments as part of the probe and described the investigation as “extensive” and likely to take time.
On Jan. 30, the US Justice Department released more than 3 million pages of documents, 2,000 videos, and 180,000 images under the Epstein Files Transparency Act, which was signed into law last November.
Those materials include grand jury transcripts and investigative records, though many pages remain heavily redacted. Epstein survivors and victims’ relatives say the disclosure falls short of what the law requires and omits vital information.
Authorities found Epstein dead by suicide in a New York City jail in 2019 while he was awaiting trial on federal sex trafficking charges involving underage girls.

Trump extends Ukraine-related national emergency, certain US sanctions against Russia for another year
U.S. President Donald Trump on Feb. 19 approved a one-year extension of the national emergency and related sanctions first introduced following Russia’s 2014 occupation of Crimea.
The decree continues measures first introduced in 2014 and later expanded in 2018 and 2022, including asset freezes and restrictions targeting individuals linked to Russia’s occupation of Crimea.
The document states that Russia’s actions “continue to pose an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security and foreign policy of the United States,” justifying the extension of the national emergency first declared under Executive Order 13660.
Trump’s order maintains the national emergency framework established under Executive Order 13660, noting that the measures “must continue in effect beyond March 6, 2026.”
The restrictions have been updated multiple times in recent years, including during former President Joe Biden’s administration, as Washington responded to Russia’s full-scale invasion in Ukraine.
The extension comes amid renewed discussion in Washington and Moscow over the future of sanctions tied to negotiations on ending Russia’s war against Ukraine.
On Feb. 18, Kremlin economic negotiator Kirill Dmitriev claimed that lifting restrictions could unlock joint U.S.-Russia projects worth more than $14 trillion, arguing that sanctions have cost U.S. businesses more than $300 billion.
Moscow has reportedly floated large-scale economic cooperation proposals to Washington in exchange for sanctions relief, though U.S. officials have not confirmed the existence of any such agreement.

Guthrie investigators turn to Mexico, genealogy, pacemaker amid fears the trail is going cold
-
Click here to listen to this article - Share via
As the search for Nancy Guthrie stretches into its third week, there is growing concern that the trail to find the missing 84-year-old is rapidly growing cold.
Investigators have detained two people since Guthrie was abducted from her Tucson-area home in the early hours of Feb. 1. But both were released after questioning and no suspects have been publicly identified.
Authorities insist the case is still very much active, with the FBI receiving more than 20,000 tips. But the case is branching off into some new directions.
Look at Mexico
Law enforcement sources told The Times that investigators have been in touch with Mexican authorities in the case given Tucson’s proximity to the border, but there is no evidence that the abductors crossed with Guthrie.
The sources spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss the case candidly.
The Guthrie home near Tucson is only about an hour’s drive from the border. Sources stressed the request for help from Mexico was to exhaust all options but there is not any clear evidence suggesting either Guthrie or the kidnappers are there.
State of the investigation
DNA on a glove discovered two miles away from Guthrie’s home that matched those worn by a masked man seen on Nest camera footage didn’t return any matches in the national DNA database used by law enforcement, CODIS. Biological evidence that was found at Guthrie’s home is still being tested but did not produce a match in CODIS, Pima County Sheriff Chris Nanos told Fox News this week.
An anonymous donor this week gave $100,000 to 88-CRIME for information that would lead investigators to arrest the individual involved in Guthrie’s disappearance. This is in addition to the $100,000 reward for information being offered by the FBI.
Nanos has tried to dispel concerns that investigators are hitting nothing but dead ends, telling NBC News that “as long as we have the ability to chase a lead, it’s not cold.”
“We have thousands of leads we’re looking at,” he said. “We’re going to find Nancy, and we’re going to find who did this.”
Video footage could be key
So far, experts say investigators’ best bet to solving the case quickly would be if someone recognizes the suspect in Nest video footage, a masked man seen on Guthrie’s porch the morning she was abducted.
At 1:47 a.m. Feb. 1, the individual appears at the door of Guthrie’s home. The man is wearing a balaclava, gloves and a backpack. A gun is holstered by the man’s waist, positioned at the front of his body and easily visible.
At one point, the man, whom authorities describe as approximately 5 feet 9 to 5 feet 10 with an average build, notices the camera on the front porch and tries to cover the lens with his hand. The man scouts around the patio and yard area, apparently for something to obstruct the camera before settling on some greenery found in the yard.
In the video, the man is wearing a black, 25-liter Ozark Trail Hiker Pack backpack that can be purchased at Walmart, according to the FBI. Investigators have been working with Walmart leadership to see if they can identify who purchased the backpack.
Authorities are also canvassing gun shops, showing the video released by the FBI to see if anyone recognizes him, according to the sheriff’s department.
Investigators employ genetic genealogy
DNA found inside the Guthrie home could also prove fruitful in the case, experts say.
Although law enforcement did not get any hits in the federal database, they are also employing genetic genealogy in an effort to identify a suspect in the case.
“If they actually have the suspect’s DNA — Nancy’s kidnapper’s DNA — he will be identified through genetic genealogy,” said CeCe Moore, a genetic genealogist and co-founder of DNA Justice. “It’s just a matter of time.”
Authorities can compare DNA collected from Guthrie’s home with publicly accessible databases containing the genetic profiles of millions of people who have given them over for family history research and other reasons. From there, investigators can sometimes find distant relatives to help piece together a family tree that can point to a suspect.
The technology has helped solve some of the nation’s most high-profile cases in recent years. Investigators used genetic genealogy to identify Joseph James DeAngelo Jr. as the Golden State Killer who terrorized California in the 1970s and 80s. It was also used to secure the conviction of Bryan Kohberger, who was sentenced to life in prison for murdering four college students in Idaho in 2022.
There are limits to the technology, but law enforcement sources told The Times it’s probably the best way forward.
Law enforcement does not have easy access to the roughly 50 million genetic profiles contained in Ancestry.com, 23andMe and MyHeritage databases. The companies have barred authorities from accessing such information and said they would release it only if compelled by a court order or warrant.
Databases GEDmatch, FamilyTreeDNA and DNA Justice are open to law enforcement use but contain fewer than 2 million genetic profiles, Moore said.
With fewer genetic profiles to work with there is more legwork involved, but Moore said it will probably be key to identifying a suspect.
“It could happen in minutes, hours, days, weeks, but I don’t think it’ll stretch much longer than that because of all the resources available for this case,” she said.
Searching for her pacemaker
Law enforcement has also deployed “signal sniffer” technology in the search for Guthrie.
Parsons Corp confirmed this week that the Pima County Sheriff’s Department requested its help early this month deploying BlueFly units to search for Guthrie. BlueFly is a Bluetooth and Wi-Fi sensor that can be used on air and ground vehicles for search and rescue operations in challenging environments, providing authorities with a heat map to identify signals within a specific area, according to the company.
BlueFly can detect medical devices such as Guthrie’s pacemaker.

Türkiye ready to contribute to Gaza 'in every way possible': Foreign minister
Hakan Fidan attends inaugural Board of Peace meeting presided over by US President Trump in Washington, DC
WASHINGTON
Türkiye is ready to contribute to Gaza "in every way possible," Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan said Thursday.
"Our message is this: whether it's humanitarian aid, the administration of Gaza, infrastructure and superstructure services, or contributing to the (International) Stabilization Force, we are ready to provide all kinds of support in all these areas," Fidan told Anadolu and TRT in the US capital, Washington, DC.
His remarks came right after attending the inaugural Board of Peace meeting, which was presided over by US President Donald Trump, bringing together representatives from more than 45 countries to discuss Gaza’s reconstruction and broader international stabilization efforts.
Fidan said the meeting, held at the level of heads of state and government, carried symbolic importance as its first session but also produced tangible commitments.
The minister stressed that member states, especially those contributing financially and potentially militarily to the International Stabilization Force, declared their commitments.
"In that sense, it was important in delivering concrete outcomes,” he added.
He described the gathering as a key milestone as Trump's Gaza plan enters its second phase, which focuses on reconstruction and restoring local governance structures.
Fidan emphasized that rebuilding Gaza requires not only physical reconstruction but also restoring functional local administrative bodies.
"The crucial point here is that as Gaza rebuilds, local government bodies need a serious renewal and capacity building in the essential services they provide to the people," he said, noting that much of Gaza’s infrastructure has been destroyed.
He highlighted ongoing coordination with the National Committee for the Administration of Gaza (NCAG), a 15-member technocratic body chaired by Ali Shaath, a Palestinian technocrat with extensive expertise in infrastructure, planning and public administration.
Fidan said Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan recently discussed governance and reconstruction plans with Shaath.
Türkiye, he added, stands ready to assist in health, education and other capacity-building services inside Gaza beyond immediate humanitarian relief.
- Police training and possible military role
The minister said Türkiye has maintained uninterrupted humanitarian efforts since the beginning of the crisis, mobilizing state institutions and civil society organizations.
On Thursday, Fidan said a Turkish aid ship carrying supplies arrived at an Egyptian port en route to Gaza. Ankara is also seeking to send an initial 20,000 housing containers, he added.
In addition, Türkiye is continuing medical evacuations and operating field hospital services through its Health Ministry, he stressed.
As part of Gaza’s stabilization, Fidan said efforts are underway to establish a local police force capable of providing security and public services for more than two million residents.
"We have a commitment to provide training to the police force for this purpose. Our president also has the will to send troops to the stabilization force if the parties agree," Fidan added.
Türkiye, he said, will continue its efforts with “a strong sense of responsibility” to help secure lasting peace and stability in the region.

Trump’s Board of Peace gains international momentum after inaugural meeting - analysis

Images and videos from US President Donald Trump’s monumental first Board of Peace meeting showed that things are off to a good start.
The Board of Peace’s vision emerged between September, when Trump was urging countries to support a ceasefire, and January, when the second phase of the ceasefire in Gaza was announced.
The large meeting on Thursday showed that many countries are willing to participate and believe the administration is serious, as over 40 countries sent officials.
The Board of Peace meeting took place amid growing tensions with Iran, which has sidelined focus on Gaza. The Board of Peace is expected to focus on Gaza reconstruction and other issues. Trump was praised by attendees for his work toward peace in other regions, such as in South Asia between Pakistan and India.
The meeting is being praised throughout the Middle East. Arab News in Saudi Arabia noted that “Saudi Arabia and others pledge $7bn for Gaza relief.”
The report noted that “President Donald Trump announced Thursday at the inaugural Board of Peace meeting that nine members of the body have agreed to pledge $7 billion toward a Gaza relief package and that five countries have agreed to deploy troops to take part in an international stabilization force to the war-battered Palestinian territory.” Saudi Arabia will pledge $1 billion toward the endeavor.
Multiple countries have pledged billions of dollars
The report said that “Kazakhstan, the United Arab Emirates, Morocco, Bahrain, Qatar, Uzbekistan, and Kuwait are the other countries that are making pledges.” In addition, there appears to be progress on the International Stabilization Force for Gaza. “Indonesia, Morocco, Kazakhstan, Kosovo, and Albania have pledged to send troops for the Gaza stabilization force, while Egypt and Jordan have committed to train police for the efforts.”
Initial expectations are that troops will be deployed near Rafah and that a large base may be constructed. “Every dollar spent is an investment in stability and the hope of new and harmonious (region),” Trump said. “The Board of Peace is showing how a better future can be built right here in this room.”
Many European countries remain skeptical of the Board. According to the Arab News report, “More than 40 countries and the European Union confirmed they were sending officials to Thursday’s meeting. Germany, Italy, Norway, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom are among more than a dozen countries that have not joined the board but are taking part as observers.”
This comes in the context of the Munich Security Conference and the Davos meetings over the last month. US Secretary of State Marco Rubio spoke at the MSC, and he then went to Hungary. He spoke at the Board of Peace meeting.
Video from the Board of Peace meeting showed the Commander of the International Stabilization Force (ISF) in Gaza, Maj. Gen. Jasper Jeffers, speaking about which countries will participate. This is going to be a major test. Countries such as Albania, Indonesia, Kazakhstan, Kosovo, and Morocco are expected to take part. Egypt and Jordan may help train police. Separate reports say Italy previously said it could help support the police. It appears Indonesia will be the heavy hitter in the ISF.
Azerbaijan has said that as a founding member of the Board, it “supports the goals and objectives of the Board of Peace. In the future, Azerbaijan may consider participating in investment projects in Gaza through the Board of Peace.” Turkey’s Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan was at the meeting and said Ankara supports Gaza. Hungary’s leader also attended.
Turkish media covered the Board of Peace meeting and appears to take it seriously. It covered the countries that will contribute troops and the billions pledged to the Board. UAE’s Al-Ain media also covered the meeting, noting that the UAE will contribute to the $1.2 billion to the Board. Egypt has said it is committed to peace in Gaza and continues to reject the displacement of Palestinians in the enclave.
The coordinator of the Peace Council, Nikolay Mladenov, also announced on Thursday that the door to membership was opened to establish a police force in the Gaza Strip that would be independent of Hamas's influence, Al-Ain noted.
The head of the National Committee for the Administration of Gaza, Ali Shaath, also affirmed the work to restore security in Gaza “under one authority and one weapon,” and to build the foundations for a sustainable peace in the sector, a separate report said.
It is clear from the extensive coverage of the meeting that this is a momentous occasion and that many countries believe this is the way forward in Gaza. For Trump, the ability to bring together so many leaders and officials from so many countries showcases US influence.
It also shows how Trump’s foreign policy doctrine appeals to countries outside Europe. This has led to concern in Europe about the US commitment.
Many countries that attended find that they can work with the Trump administration. This is a major shift in terms of the US approach to the world order. Many reports from Davos and the Munich conference focused on how the world order of the last few decades is largely vanishing.
The Board of Peace meeting is another waypoint on this shift in US strategy under the Trump administration. The road ahead in Gaza is expected to be hard, and it will prove the first major test for this approach.

Moroccan court sentences 19 soccer fans to prison over hooliganism at chaotic Africa Cup final
A Moroccan court has sentenced 19 soccer fans to up to a year in prison on charges of hooliganism stemming from a chaotic Africa Cup of Nations final that saw supporters try to storm the field
- Bookmark
A Moroccan court on Thursday sentenced 19 soccer fans to up to a year in prison on charges of hooliganism stemming from a chaotic Africa Cup of Nations final between Morocco and Senegal that saw supporters try to storm the field.
After a hearing that lasted more than five hours, the presiding judge ruled that the fans — 18 Senegalese and a French national — were guilty of more than half a dozen charges, including damaging sporting facilities and committing violence during a sporting event.
Eleven people were sentenced to one year in prison and handed a $550 fine. Four were sentenced to six months and given a $218 fine. The remaining four were sentenced to three months and a $130 fine, lawyer Naima El Guellaf told The Associated Press.
One defendant fainted upon hearing the sentences. Others refused to rise from the defendants’ bench when ordered to enter the small door leading to the holding cells. Family members, visibly shaken, insisted their relatives were innocent.
Attorneys said they plan to appeal the decision that they view as severe.
The defendants were arrested last month when outraged supporters tried to storm the pitch to protest a late penalty awarded to host Morocco during the final, which Senegal eventually won 1-0. They were held in custody for more than a month awaiting judgment.
During Thursday’s hearing, attended by Senegalese and French diplomats as well as relatives of several defendants, attorneys argued that the court lacked sufficient grounds to convict their clients.
The public prosecutor sought the maximum penalties against the fans, arguing that they had disrupted the orderly conduct of the match. He added that the damage was estimated at more than $476,719.
Morocco has long grappled with episodes of soccer-related hooliganism and courts in the North African nation routinely handle cases tied to such incidents. However, this case was unusual as it involved only foreign nationals.
The sentences marked the latest development stemming from a final that prompted senior officials in both countries to urge peace and fraternity amid social media tensions and a surge in what Moroccan rights groups described as “hate speech.”
Last month, CAF, the African soccer body, issued $1 million in fines and bans against Senegal and Morocco over the tumultuous game. Morocco announced it plans to appeal the decision, seeing the sanctions as disproportionate to the incidents.
The game was marred by Senegalese players walking off the pitch protesting a penalty awarded to Morocco in stoppage time. Outraged Senegalese supporters threw chairs onto the field and battled with stewards before police arrived.
The match and its outcome prompted senior officials in both countries reinforce diplomatic and economic ties they described as “strong and historic,” seeking to prevent the game from straining bilateral relations.
The Senegalese prime minister visited Morocco and signed agreements aimed at boosting investments in sectors like agriculture and mining. The two African nations are important economic partners. Heavily indebted, Senegal is seeking investors and Morocco is pouring hundreds of millions of dollars in the West African nation’s economy.

British Police Examine Epstein’s Use of U.K. Airports and Other Lines of Inquiry

Several British police forces are examining the logs of Jeffrey Epstein’s private jet, nicknamed the “Lolita Express,” amid concerns the convicted sex offender may have trafficked women through U.K. airports.
Bedfordshire Police told TIME it “is reviewing materials published as part of the DOJ Disclosures Under the Epstein Files Transparency Act, in relation to private flights in and out of London Luton Airport.”
A spokesperson for Essex Police confirmed similar investigations were underway, telling TIME: “We are assessing the information that has emerged in relation to private flights into and out of [London] Stansted Airport.”
Emails released in the most recent drop of files show Epstein discussing traveling to and from Stansted in 2012.
In one email chain titled “Paris/London train,” which references Stansted, a sender, whose name has been redacted, tells Epstein: “If you come via private, I'll need photo copies emailed to me of passport and U.S. visa, I fwd [forward] to U.K. immigration... once Boeing is
ready to depart she is escorted to aircraft.”
Another email sent to Epstein references a flight to Luton Airport in 2018.
Highlighting the coordinated efforts among the authorities, the West Midlands Police force is also looking at the private flights in and out of Birmingham Airport, following the publication of the Epstein files, a spokesperson told TIME.
A spokesperson from Police Scotland confirmed that while it has “not received any report or complaint in relation” to Epstein’s jet using Edinburgh Airport, it would be “keen to speak to anyone with information.”
Former U.K. Prime Minister Gordon Brown has voiced deep concern over Epstein's frequent travel in and out of the U.K.
“How the flights were allowed to continue should have been fully investigated,” he wrote in an op-ed for the New Statesman last week. “The evidence suggests some in the U.K. were complicit in trafficking. This demands a full inquiry.”
He did not specify who may have been “complicit.”
Appearing in the Epstein files is not an indication of wrongdoing, nor is being listed on the flight logs.
Speaking before news of Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor’s arrest on suspicion of misconduct in public office on Thursday morning, Brown said he had been “told privately that the investigations related to the former Prince Andrew did not properly check vital evidence of flights.” He claimed “at least one” of Epstein's messages about private flights to the U.K. was linked to Andrew. “I have asked the police to look at this as part of the new inquiry,” he said.
TIME has contacted the relevant authorities for further information.
Separate to Andrew, Brown highlighted emails sent to and from Epstein concerning “the logistics of registering trafficked girls for English-as-a-foreign-language courses, as a route to obtaining U.S. visas.” He argued: “We need to know if and to what extent this was also happening in the U.K.”
Additionally, Surrey Police announced on Wednesday that, following a batch of Epstein files released in December, it had become aware of “a redacted report alleging non-recent human trafficking and sexual assaults on a minor in Virginia Water, Surrey, between 1994-1996.” The force is encouraging “anyone with information in relation to these allegations” to make contact.
Another police investigation is currently underway regarding Peter Mandelson, the former U.K. ambassador to the U.S., for alleged misconduct in public office offences.
In one resurfaced email, Mandelson appeared to tell Epstein he would lobby other government officials in an effort to reduce a tax on bankers’ bonuses. In another, he appeared to have forwarded an internal government report to Epstein which showed ways the U.K. might raise funds after the 2008 financial crisis. He has not been charged.

Westpac forecasts GDP growth of around 0.9pc in Q4 2025
Westpac has forecast that Australia's GDP growth would be around 0.9% in the fourth quarter of 2025.
The bank also suggests the soft Q3 2025 outcome of 0.4% was more noise than signal, implying that part of the Q4 strength is bounce-back.
"Overall, the signal is clear: leading indicators are outperforming and point to further gains in activity," said Pat Bustamante, senior economist at Westpac.
"Most high-frequency indicators strengthened further through Q4 2025.
"Leading indicators, including credit growth, capacity utilisation, and household spending, contributed to the lift in activity.
"These gains were partially offset by some soft partial labour market indicators."
ASX slips slightly with GYG and Megaport plummet over 10pc
The Australian share market finished the day edging down by just 4.8 points to 9,081 points.
Over the last five days, the index has gained 1.8% and is currently 0.4% lower than its 52-week high.
Overall, the market had 56 stocks gaining, seven unchanged and 137 stocks in the red.
When looking at the sectors, Utilities was at the top, up 0.6%, followed by Financials, up 0.2%, and then Energy, up 0.1%.
Technology finished at the bottom, down 1.7%, followed by Consumer Non-Cyclicals, down 1.4%, and then Materials, down 1.2%.
Among companies, the top mover was Telix Pharmaceuticals, up 14.2%, followed by QBE Insurance, up 7.1%.
It wasn't a good day for Guzman Y Gomez, down 13.9%, followed by Megaport, down 11.8%.
The Australian dollar is pretty flat, down 0.4% at 70.30 US cents.
Not a good time for metals
Precious metals prices have plunged as investors took profits following the rapid price surge in January, according to ANZ Research.
"Investors' confidence in Fed independence was partially restored after Kevin Warsh's nomination as the Fed chair," the bank said.
"Gold demand overall stayed strong, but offtake from jewellery contracted in 2025.
"Central bank purchases moderated but remained above the historical average.
"Silver's industrial demand is weakening due to elevated prices, while outflows from the US are easing spot market tightness."
ANZ adds that industrial metals are also retreating as demand softens and supply dislocation is set to normalise.
"Copper inventories are replenishing globally, and President Trump is considering relaxing tariffs on metal imports.
"Bulk commodities remain under pressure, with China's property sector still weak and steel production subdued by unfavourable margins."
Spot gold may test support at $US4,950
Spot gold may test support at $US4,950 per ounce. A break below could trigger a fall to $US4,909.
The metal failed a few times to break a strong resistance at $US5,016, the 61.8% retracement of the short downtrend from $US5,123 to $US4,843.
It is expected to retrace to $US4,960.
According to Reuters, spot gold looks undecided around a resistance at $US5,006.
Given its more sensitive hourly chart, which has been flashing bearish signals, the precious metal may retrace toward $US4,863.

🎥AI job loss fears loom despite unemployment remaining steady
Australia's unemployment rate remained at 4.1% in January, the same as in December, in seasonally adjusted terms.
The data reveals workers landed tens of thousands of full-time jobs, putting pressure on the Reserve Bank to deliver a follow-up interest rate hike.
It comes as the AI revolution threatens to change work as we know it.

Loading...Credit market 'unease' ratchets up as Blue Owl falters
The business team is watching developments around Wall Street private equity firm Blue Owl.
Its share price fell sharply overnight following a move to restrict investors redemptions.
Put simply, Blue Owl, worth billions of dollars, could not meet investor demands for cash.
The Montgomery Fund's Roger Mongtomery has this analysis:
"Blue Owl's move to permanently curb quarterly redemptions in OBDC II — shifting instead to opportunistic capital returns via asset sales and repayments — is the reason I have been telling investors loan book duration is one of the risks they have to understand."
Again, translating this, Montgomery is saying that rather than Blue Owl distributing investor returns as normal, it's been forced to sell assets to cover investors' demands for cash back.
"I've been watching the steady erosion in public market proxies for private credit firms, including ETFs holding these firms, since late last year.
"This latest episode with Blue Owl adds to the unease."
Again, Mr Montgomery is suggesting here that Blue Owl does not appear to be a catalyst for a liquidity crisis, but it adds to existing concerns about Wall Street's short-term cash problems in meeting investor needs.
"The assets are not held on the balance sheets of systemically important banks, so I still don't see the ingredients for a full-blown Lehman-style crisis in private credit but it's a tail-risk — as is geopolitics."
Telix Pharmaceuticals rockets after strong revenue growth
Telix Pharmaceuticals's shares have soared 14.2% after posting a 56% increase in full-year revenue to $US803.8 million.
CEO Christian Behrenbruch said the revenue reflected the company's "confidence in sustaining the momentum of our core cash-generative business".
"We are reinvesting earnings to prioritise the acceleration of our best-in-class therapeutic pipeline, which now includes three pivotal stage trials in prostate, kidney and brain cancer," Dr Behrenbruch said.
"We also intend to continue to expand the Precision Medicine growth opportunity through label expansion studies and new product launches.
"In 2026, we are focused on [the] delivery of these near-term priorities to further strengthen the foundations for long-term revenue and earnings growth."
ASX dragged down by tech and consumer staples sectors
Six sectors are lower, along with the ASX 200.
The technology and consumer staples sectors are the worst performers, down 2.8% and 1.5%, respectively.
Meanwhile, utilities is the best performing sector gaining 0.6% and 0.9% for the past five days.
Asian markets in red following fall in Wall Street
Stocks in Asia have fallen with Japan's Nikkei dropping 1% and Hong Kong's Hang Seng slipping 0.3% on its return from the Lunar New Year break, as of 1pm AEDT.
Major investment fund suffers liquidity squeeze
As we reported earlier, asset manager Blue Owl has been forced to halt investor redemptions.
For context, the firm is similar in size to Australia's largest investment bank, Macquarie Group.
The firm told investors in Blue Owl Capital Corp II, known as OBDC II, that it will no longer be able to redeem shares on a quarterly basis.
Instead, the fund will return capital through periodic distributions funded by loan repayments, asset sales or other transactions.
Henry Jennings is a senior market analyst with Marcus Today.
He's told the ABC that Blue Owl's liquidity squeeze has the potential to "blow up".
"Blue Owl Capital in the US, a large private equity fund manager, has frozen redemptions on one of its funds," he said.
"Private equity investment is not liquid.
"It is not valued every day, so given current sentiment in AI and software stocks and the debt associated with it, valuations are getting harder to justify.
"This has potential to blow up as valuations for specific assets infect sentiment elsewhere."
GYG shares plunge as US sales dwindle amid weak demand
Oh my guzzy, we're not having a good day! Is it just anticipation of earnings or have I missed something!?
- KA
Hi KA,
Thank you for your comment.
Guzman y Gomez (GYG) has indeed reported its first-half profit, which was better than expected.
However, sluggish US sales in a challenging consumer environment sent its shares plunging 16% to a record low this morning.
The company expects US losses to increase slightly in the year to June, compared with an $13.2 million loss in fiscal 2025.
"The company is executing well, but not as fast as the market is expecting," Citi analysts said.
"It's hard to see what's new in this result that would make investors chase the stock higher, especially given the valuation."
GYG's Australia segment was the biggest contributor to its sales during the half, reporting first-half network sales of $673.6 million, 17.5% higher than last year, and forecast full-year profit margins of up to 6.2%, compared to 5.7% last year.
The fast-food chain operator reported net profit after tax of $10.6 million for the six months to December 31, higher than the Visible Alpha consensus of $9.2 million and last year's $7.3 million.
Group network sales jumped 18% to $681.8 million, although that missed the Visible Alpha consensus of $687.3 million.
The company has declared an interim dividend of 7.4 cents per share.
I hope this helps clear "some air" for you.

Blue Owl halts redemptions
Shares in Wall Street asset manager Blue Owl have fallen 6%.
The firm told investors in Blue Owl Capital Corp II, known as OBDC II, that it will no longer be able to redeem shares on a quarterly basis.
Instead, the fund will return capital through periodic distributions funded by loan repayments, asset sales or other transactions.
The firm said it had sold about $1.4 billion in direct-lending investments across three funds to provide investors with promised liquidity.
The move highlights the risks confronting retail investors entering the fast-growing private credit market.
Though investors are generally allowed to redeem a portion of their capital each quarter, payouts can be curtailed if withdrawal requests exceed set limits.

Oil rallies as geopolitical risks in the Middle East intensify: analyst
WTI Crude Oil is trading higher, up 2.4%, to $US66.49, poised to close at its highest level in nearly seven months amid intensifying geopolitical risks in the Middle East, according to IG market analyst Tony Sycamore.
The advance builds on Wednesday's sharp 4% gain, fuelled by ongoing concerns over a possible US military strike on Iran after nuclear talks in Geneva stalled and US carrier strike groups were repositioned closer to the region, Mr Sycamore adds.
"The build-up in US military assets does have a dual purpose of offering the option of a strike on Iranian military targets while also building pressure on Iran to agree to terms around its nuclear program the US will find more acceptable," he said.
"As we noted yesterday, the current game of diplomatic 'cat and mouse' may extend over the next few weeks before a resolution is found either of a diplomatic or military nature.
"Technically, crude oil is trading towards the top of the $US55–$US66 trading range that has defined the past six months.
"A sustained break above the top of the range, say, would open the way for further gains towards $US70.
"While signs of de-escalation will likely see a retracement back towards $US61."

Austal's shares have surged after the company announced a $4 billion contract to build eight Landing Craft Heavy vessels for Australia's Department of Defence.
The vessels, all expected to be delivered to the Commonwealth in 2038, will be constructed in Henderson, Western Australia, according to Austal.
CEO Paddy Gregg said the contract generated a record order book for Austal, providing "a long-term demand signal" for its supply chain and "the incentive to invest in uplifting its capability".
"Constructing the Landing Craft Heavy vessels at Henderson will create and develop thousands of new, skilled jobs in Western Australia and provide further opportunities for the local defence industry supply chain," he said.
"It also provides earnings and employment stability for the next 12 years."
The company's shares are trading at $6.3 per share, giving it a market cap of $2.51 billion.

As the Middle East stands on the brink of escalation with Iran, it's natural for frightened folks in Israel to ruminate on the relationship between Donald Trump and Benjamin Netanyahu. The president and the prime minister are close enough that Netanyahu might just help tip the U.S. towards a new war – or not. What happens now matters a great deal for Israel: not only as a potential battlefield, but at the ballot box.

From demanding Israel's president grant the prime minister a pardon, to a potential escalation with Iran, how much harder can Trump campaign for Netanyahu to win Israel's elections, due later this year? But despite the trajectory, a kerfuffle or worse could change the script

US threatens to leave International Energy Agency if net zero focus remains
Sign up now: Get ST's newsletters delivered to your inbox
- The US pressured the International Energy Agency to drop its net zero agenda within a year, threatening US withdrawal. US Secretary Wright called net zero a "destructive illusion".
- The IEA ministerial meeting concluded without a final communique. While many ministers stressed climate action, the chair's summary downplayed net zero references.
- IEA Director Birol stated the agency would continue using "multiple scenarios," including those showing fossil fuel demand growth and net zero pathways, with future content undecided.

PARIS - The United States stepped up pressure on the International Energy Agency on Feb 19 to drop net zero from its agenda, giving it a year to do so or risk Washington exiting the organisation.
Speaking on the last day of an IEA ministerial meeting in Paris, US Energy Secretary Chris Wright said the 52-year-old agency should return to its founding mission of ensuring energy security.
The Paris-based IEA was created to coordinate responses to major disruptions of supplies after the 1973 oil crisis, but it has broadened its focus to include renewable energy and net zero goals under executive director Fatih Birol.
“The US will use all the pressure we have to get the IEA to eventually, in the next year or so, move away from this agenda,” Mr Wright said in a news conference, calling net zero a “destructive illusion”.
“But if the IEA is not able to bring itself back to focusing on the mission of energy honesty, energy access and energy security, then sadly we would become an ex-member of the IEA,” he added.
The net zero emissions target is crucial to meet the Paris climate agreement’s goal of limiting global warming to 1.5 deg C from pre-industrial levels.
But Mr Wright, a former fracking executive, said there was a “0.0 per cent chance” that net zero would be achieved.
Dutch Deputy Prime Minister Sophie Hermans, who chaired the two-day meeting, told AFP that the IEA has the task to provide governments “with all scenarios” – including net zero – so they can make informed decisions.
“I think we have to know what are the consequences of choices that you make or don’t make,” she said.
The gathering wrapped up without a final communique for the first time since 2017, releasing instead a “chair’s summary”.
The text says a “large majority” of ministers “stressed the importance of the energy transition to combat climate change and highlighted the global transition to net zero”.
But it only mentions “net zero” once and makes much fewer references to climate change and renewables than the communique that was issued afer the 2024 ministerial meeting.
US ‘undecided’ over IEA leadership
The IEA produces monthly reports on oil demand and supply as well as annual world energy outlooks that include data on the growth of solar and wind energy, among other analyses.
Mr Wright praised Mr Birol for reinserting in November 2025’s annual outlook a Current Policies Scenario in which oil and gas demand would grow in the next decades. That scenario had been dropped for the past five years.
But the report still included a scenario where the world reaches net zero emissions by mid-century.
In a closing press conference, Mr Birol said the IEA would “continue to have multiple scenarios” that look at investments, capital needs and resulting emissions from all of them.
But he also said he had yet to talk to colleagues about what would go into the next annual outlook which will be published later this year.
“We have not yet even thought about this, to be honest with you, this is a bit (of) a long term process,” Mr Birol said.
Mr Birol’s current four-year term ends in 2027, but Mr Wright demured when asked who he would like to head the IEA, which has over 30 member nations.
“We remain today undecided or neutral on who the leadership is. We care about the mission much more than the individual leaders,” the US energy chief said. AFP

Kessel Run Launches Program for ‘Next-Gen’ Air Operations Center
Unknown

05:28:17 KST

The Air Force’s Kessel Run software factory is launching an effort to create the “next generation” of the service’s Air Operations Centers, which command, control, and coordinate aircraft movements around the globe.
In the Feb. 18 program announcement, Kessel Run indicated it wants to incorporate artificial intelligence, machine learning, data fusion, and cloud-based software—the same technologies that are reshaping entire industries today.
The goal here is to enhance planners’ ability to synthesize and visualize the flight, intelligence, and threat data pouring into AOCs around the clock and to help leaders make better, faster decisions.
The goal is to release a request for information from industry later this month, starting a process that will end with a contract award targeted for June 2027, the announcement states.
The Air Force treats its 21 AOCs as weapon systems with the official designation AN/USQ-163 Falconer. The current AOC sustainment and modernization contract, a $374 million deal awarded to SAIC in 2022, runs out in summer 2027.
The AOC system consists of multiple software programs that acquire and present intelligence and sensor data to hundreds or even thousands of Airmen, who in turn use the system for command and control: identifying targets, creating Air Tasking Orders, assessing actions, and more.
The fielded version of the Falconer AOC system is Increment 10.1. A suite of upgrades, first referred to as 10.2 and now called Block 20, started years ago, with the Air Force first relying on contractors for the new software then moving much of the work in-house to software factories like Kessel Run.
At the heart of Block 20 is Kessel Run’s signature effort, the Kessel Run All Domain Operations Suite or KRADOS, according to the Pentagon’s Director of Operational Test & Evaluation. KRADOS is cloud-based and combines different software programs for things like planning refueling ops, fighter and bomber movements, and targeting options into one unified picture that looks like a website. It has already started rolling out to AOCs, and Air Force budget documents state that improvements and further integrations are in the works.
That’s supplemented by a program called AppTX, which transitions existing software applications to cloud computing.
According to Air Force budget documents, work on that front is progressing to a common baseline that provides commanders with a consolidated operational picture, a “single pane of glass” integrating multiple software programs onto one screen, negating the need to switch between multiple monitors.
The “Next-Generation” AOC program Kessel Run announced Feb. 18 doesn’t mention Block 20 by name but notes that with the current contract with SAIC running out, “as we look to the future, we are seeking to build upon these efforts and identify new and emerging technologies that can further enhance the AOC’s capabilities,” suggesting the program may be separate from Block 20.
The announcement lists four areas Kessel Run is particularly interested in:
- Artificial intelligence and machine learning “to accelerate decision-making”
- Data fusion and visualization from multiple sources
- Advanced cybersecurity measures
- Cloud-native architectures
Challenges contractors will have to reckon with include growing cyber threats and integrating legacy systems into new ones, the announcement also notes.
The timeline for the new program is relatively quick by Pentagon standards—though perhaps not as fast as many software developers are accustomed to:
- Request for Information released in February 2026
- Industry engagement and feedback in March 2026
- Draft Request for Proposal released in August 2026
- Final Request for Proposal released in November 2026
- Contract award in June 2027

The secret operation to arrest Andrew

The secret operation to arrest Andrew
The arrest of Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor has taken the world by surprise.
But behind closed doors, senior officers at Thames Valley Police will have been methodically planning the operation for days.
Having assessed the misconduct in public office complaint against the former duke and considered the available evidence, the police officer in charge of the investigation would have applied for a search warrant.
They would have needed to persuade a magistrate or district judge that it was necessary to raid Andrew’s former home in Windsor and his current one on the Sandringham Estate.
Once they had been given legal approval, they would have had to plan the raid and arrest, while ensuring the details were kept confidential.
The London Telegraph understands neither Buckingham Palace nor the King were given prior notice of the impending arrest.
About 20 officers from Thames Valley Police, supported by their colleagues from the Norfolk Constabulary, were involved in the raid.
They drove more than 200 kilometres from the police headquarters in Kidlington, Oxfordshire, to the village of Wolferton, on the Sandringham Estate in Norfolk.
The journey probably took about three hours, and the convoy of unmarked police cars arrived at Wood Farm shortly after 8am British time.
‘Confie op’
One former officer explained that the detectives selected for the “confie op” (confidential operation) are unlikely to have been given the details beforehand.
He explained: “The team would have simply been told to report to the station in the early hours. They may have even been told to hand over their mobile phones before being given the final briefing, setting out where they were going and what they were doing.”
Unlike the raid that was carried out on Lord Mandelson’s property after revelations about his relationship with Jeffrey Epstein, Mountbatten-Windsor was arrested at the scene and taken straight in for questioning.
The arresting officer would have read out the standard warning given to all suspects who are taken into custody: “You do not have to say anything. But it may harm your defence if you do not mention, when questioned, something which you later rely on in court.”
The former duke would then have been placed in the back of a police car and driven away for a formal interview.
Once at the police station, he would be checked in at the custody suite by a sergeant, who would confirm the grounds for arrest were lawful before authorising his detention.
Like any other person in custody, he would then have been searched for anything that could be used to harm himself or anyone else, and required to hand over his phone, any jewellery, watch, belt, or tie.
He would also probably have been subjected to a risk assessment to establish whether there were any medical conditions or alcohol or drug use to ensure he was afforded appropriate care in custody.
At this point, officers would have explained his rights, including the right to free and independent legal advice, the right to notify someone of his arrest and the codes of practice under which he was being detained.
Detainees are then usually fingerprinted before being led to a cell pending an interview.
A typical cell will be “austere”, according to former police officers, with a toilet possibly screened off inside, and a mattress raised about 30 centimetres off the floor.
At this point, he may have been offered a cup of tea or food if required.
Mountbatten-Windsor would have been allowed some time to talk to his lawyer before the police interview.
The interviews by the investigating officers may be staggered depending on what he says and any other tandem operations that the police team has carried out.
It is thought unlikely that Mountbatten-Windsor would have been handcuffed at any stage because there would be no history of violence or concerns that he could seek to escape.

CIA knew about plans to sabotage Nord Stream pipeline — report

US intelligence knew about Ukrainian plans to sabotage the Nord Stream pipelines far earlier than previously reported, according to reports in the German media.
In a news report on Thursday, Der Spiegel said CIA officers met with Ukrainian operatives in spring 2022 to discuss plans for destroying the pipelines that carried Russian natural gas to Germany along the Baltic Sea seabed.
Ukrainian sources told the magazine that American officials initially reacted positively to the idea and engaged in talks about technical aspects of the operation.
Later, however, the US intelligence reversed course and warned against proceeding.
A CIA spokesperson rejected the claims, telling Der Spiegel they were "completely and utterly false." The magazine stood by its report, citing credible information from multiple sources.
The sabotage of the Nord Stream pipelines in September 2022 caused extensive damage to the infrastructure connecting Russia and Germany beneath the Baltic Sea. The Ukrainian government has repeatedly denied involvement.
Some reports have claimed the operation was approved by then-army chief Valery Zaluzhny without informing President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.
Covert operations and sabotage
German authorities have identified a suspect from the sabotage team as Serhiy Kuznetsov. He was arrested in Italy and extradited to Germany in late November to stand trial.
According to German media reports, he is a former agent of Ukraine's intelligence service, the SBU, and belonged to a unit specialising in covert operations and sabotage.
Authorities revealed his identity after investigating the rental of a yacht named Andromeda, which served as the operational base for the mission.
Investigators determined the team traveled to Germany and rented the yacht using forged identity documents.
Kuznetsov is believed to have been part of a seven-member team that included divers, assistants, a captain, and a medic.
Authorities suspect he acted as a coordinator rather than one of the operatives who physically attached the explosives.

Tariffs paid by midsize US companies tripled last year, a JPMorganChase Institute study shows
WASHINGTON (AP) — Tariffs paid by midsize U.S. businesses tripled over the course of past year, new research tied to one of America’s leading banks showed on Thursday — more evidence that President Donald Trump ‘s push to charge higher taxes on imports is causing economic disruption.
The additional taxes have meant that companies that employ a combined 48 million people in the U.S. — the kinds of businesses that Trump had promised to revive — have had to find ways to absorb the new expense, by passing it along to customers in the form of higher prices, employing fewer workers or accepting lower profits.
“That’s a big change in their cost of doing business,” said Chi Mac, business research director of the JPMorganChase Institute, which published the analysis Thursday. “We also see some indications that they may be shifting away from transacting with China and maybe toward some other regions in Asia.”
The research does not say how the additional costs are flowing through the economy, but it indicates that tariffs are being paid by U.S. companies. The study is part of a growing body of economic analyses that counter the administration’s claims that foreigners pay the tariffs.
The JPMorganChase Institute report used payments data to look at businesses that might lack the pricing power of large multinational companies to offset tariffs, but may be small enough to quickly change supply chains to minimize exposure to the tax increases. The companies tended to have revenues between $10 million and $1 billion with fewer than 500 employees, a category known as “middle market.”
AP’s Lisa Dwyer reports on research showing Tariffs are hitting the bottom line.
The analysis suggests that the Trump administration’s goal of becoming less directly reliant on Chinese manufacturers has been occurring. Payments to China by these companies were 20% below their October 2024 levels, but it’s unclear whether that means China is simply routing its goods through other countries or if supply chains have moved.
The authors of the analysis emphasized in an interview that companies are still adjusting to the tariffs and said they plan to continue studying the issue.
White House spokesman Kush Desai called the analysis “pointless” and said it didn’t “change the fact that President Trump was right.” The study showed that U.S. companies are paying tariffs that the president had previously claimed would be paid by foreign entities.
Trump defended his tariffs during a trip to Georgia on Thursday while touring Coosa Steel, a company involved in steel processing and distribution. The president said he couldn’t believe the Supreme Court would soon decide on the legality of some of his tariffs, given his belief that the taxes were helping U.S. manufacturers.
“The tariffs are the greatest thing to happen to this country,” Trump said.
The president imposed a series of tariffs last year for the ostensible goal of reducing the U.S. trade imbalance with other countries, so that America was not longer importing more than it exports. But trade data published Thursday by the Census Bureau showed that the trade deficit climbed last year by $25.5 billion to $1.24 trillion. The president on Wednesday posted on social media that he expected there would be a trade surplus “during this year.”
The Trump administration has been adamant that the tariffs are a boon for the economy, businesses, and workers. Kevin Hassett, director of the White House National Economic Council, lashed out on Wednesday at research by the New York Federal Reserve showing that nearly 90% of the burden for Trump’s tariffs fell on U.S. companies and consumers.
“The paper is an embarrassment,” Hassett told CNBC. “It’s, I think, the worst paper I’ve ever seen in the history of the Federal Reserve system. The people associated with this paper should presumably be disciplined.”
Trump increased the average tariff rate to 13% from 2.6% last year, according to the New York Fed researchers. He declared that tariffs on some items such as steel, kitchen cabinets and bathroom vanities were in the national security interest of the country. He also declared an economic emergency to bypass Congress and impose a baseline tax on goods from much of the world in April 2025 at an event he called “Liberation Day.”
The high rates provoked a financial market panic, prompting Trump to walk back his rates and then engage in talks with multiple countries that led to a set of new trade frameworks. The Supreme Court is expected to rule soon on whether Trump surpassed his legal authority by declaring an economic emergency.
Trump was elected in 2024 on his promise to tame inflation, but his tariffs have contributed to voter frustration over affordability. While inflation has not spiked during Trump’s term thus far, hiring slowed sharply and a team of academic economists estimate that consumer prices were roughly 0.8 percentage points higher than they would otherwise be.

Judge declares 4 men wrongly accused of 1991 Austin yogurt shop murders innocent
Judge declares 4 men wrongly accused of 1991 Austin yogurt shop murders innocent
AUSTIN, Texas (AP) — For more than three decades, the four men and their families had insisted they were innocent of one of Austin’s most gruesome and notorious crimes: the 1991 rape and murder of four teenage girls at a yogurt shop that was set on fire.
No one listened. Not when Robert Springsteen was sent to death row. Not when Michael Scott was sentenced to life in prison. Or when Forrest Welborn and Maurice Pierce, though never convicted, struggled through life under dark clouds of suspicion that they were murderers.
Their pleas were finally heard Thursday. A judge formally declared the men innocent after an emotional court hearing where prosecutors apologized and admitted they were wrongly accused of a crime that haunted the city for decades. Investigators determined last year that the murders were committed by a previously unknown culprit who died in 1999.
Scott and Welborn sat in the crowded courtroom packed with family members to hear state District Judge Dayna Blazey formally tell them “you are innocent.” She called her order “an obligation to the rule of law and the obligation to the dignity of the individual.”
The hearing included lengthy statements from the men and their families about the struggles of incarceration, broken relationships, constant harassment by investigators and homelessness.
Springsteen did not attend. Through tears, Marisa Pierce addressed her father, who died in 2010 in a confrontation with police after a traffic stop.
“Daddy, you have your name back,” she said. “The world knows what you were trying to say all along.”
Killings shocked Austin and confounded investigators
Amy Ayers, 13; Eliza Thomas, 17; and sisters Jennifer and Sarah Harbison, ages 17 and 15, were bound, gagged and shot in the head at the “I Can’t Believe It’s Yogurt” store where two of them worked. The building was set on fire.
Investigators chased thousands of leads and several false confessions before the four men, who were teenagers when the girls were killed, were arrested in late 1999.
Springsteen and Scott were convicted based largely on confessions they insisted were coerced by police. Both convictions were overturned in the mid-2000s.
Welborn was charged but never tried after two grand juries refused to indict him. Pierce spent three years in jail before the charges were dismissed and he was released.
Prosecutors wanted to try Springsteen and Scott again, but a judge ordered the charges dismissed in 2009 when new DNA tests that were unavailable in 1991 and the previous trials revealed another male suspect.
“Let us not forgot that Robert Springsteen could be dead right now, executed at the hands of the state of Texas,” Springsteen attorney Amber Farrelly said.
In a statement his attorney read in court, Welborn said he lost friends, struggled to keep jobs and was at one time homeless. Scott testified that his arrest, conviction and prison sentence ultimately broke up his family.
“I lost my family. I lost my youth. My daughter was 3 years old when I was arrested. We had just celebrated our first wedding anniversary. I lost the chance to build a family,” Scott said. “Every day I have carried the weight of a crime I did not commit.”
The formal declaration of innocence could also be a key step for the men and their families if they seek financial compensation for years they spent incarcerated or struggled to live under a cloud of suspicion.
“My son’s name has finally been cleared after more than 25 years of being called the monster, the murderer and everything else,” said Phil Scott, Michael Scott’s father. “Son, be proud.”
Connection to a new suspect revealed
After Scott and Springsteen were released, the case effectively went cold until 2025, when an HBO documentary series attracted new public attention to the unsolved crime.
Then investigators made a stunning announcement last September: New DNA science and reviews of old ballistics evidence pointed to Robert Eugene Brashers as the sole killer.
Since 2018, authorities had used advanced DNA evidence to link Brashers to the strangulation death of a South Carolina woman in 1990, the 1997 rape of a 14-year-old girl in Tennessee and the shooting of a mother and daughter in Missouri in 1998.
The link to the Austin case came when a DNA sample taken from under Ayers’ fingernail came back as a match to Brashers from the 1990 killing.
Austin investigators also found that Brashers had been arrested at a border checkpoint near El Paso two days after the yogurt shop killings. In his stolen car was a pistol that matched the caliber used to kill one of the girls in Austin.
Police also noted similarities in the yogurt shop case to Brashers’ other crimes: The victims were tied up with their own clothing, sexually assaulted and some crime scenes were set on fire.
Brashers died in 1999 when he shot himself during an hourslong standoff with police at a motel in Kennett, Missouri.
“Over 25 years ago, the state prosecuted four innocent men ... (for) one of the worst crimes Austin has ever seen,” Travis County First Assistant District Attorney Trudy Strassburger said. “We could not have been more wrong.”

Stacked design panel approves Trump’s ‘beautiful’ White House ballroom

Stacked design panel approves Trump’s ‘beautiful’ White House ballroom
Washington: A design panel recently stacked with Donald Trump loyalists has approved the president’s White House ballroom, taking it a step closer to reality despite overwhelming opposition from the public submissions.
The Commission of Fine Arts voted 6-0, with one abstention, to approve the ballroom at a meeting on Thursday, Washington time, after reviewing updated plans and renders.
“This is a facility that is desperately needed for over 150 years, and it’s beautiful,” said chairman Rodney Mims Cook Jr, a former commissioner whom Trump returned to the agency last month.
Trump fired all six previous members of the CFA in October, then left the agency vacant until January, when he appointed seven new members - including his 26-year-old executive assistant Chamberlain Harris, who is not known to have any arts experience.
The panel approved the plans despite an avalanche of opposition from members of the public and concerned parties, including historic and conservation organisations.
Long-serving secretary Thomas Luebke said the commission received more than 2000 messages in just a week about the ballroom project. “The summary of it was overwhelmingly in opposition - over 99 per cent,” he said.
Those concerns largely involved the “illegal demolition” of the former White House East Wing in October, Luebke said, as well as the inappropriate scale of the new ballroom that would dwarf the White House.
People were also worried about the project ignoring historic preservation principles, the lack of transparency about who was funding the ballroom, and “a fundamental miscarriage of democratic principles”, he added.
Luebke also read out an unnamed letter of support, which said the White House’s current provisions for large ceremonies involving foreign heads of state were insufficient.
“We have a tent. Currently, people are omitted due to lack of space,” the person wrote. “The United States is on the world stage. Modernisation to have America be competitive in the eyes of world leaders is not a bad thing.”
Public condemnation did not stop the panel quickly proceeding to approve the designs following a presentation by architect Shalom Baranes and landscape architect Rick Parisi.
The 1000-person ballroom building is of similar height to the White House residence, although the footprint - 90,000 square feet - is considerably larger.
Harris, whose main job is formally the deputy director of Oval Office operations, said the building “isn’t that big by ballroom standards”, and the size was consistent with the residence.
“This is sort of like the greatest country in the world, it’s the greatest house in the world, and we want it to be the greatest ballroom in the world,” she said.
The CFA panel’s decision does not represent the end of the process. The ballroom must also clear the National Capital Planning Commission, which is due to meet in early March to vote on the project.
That commission has also been stacked with Trump loyalists. Its chairman is Will Scharf - formerly a Trump lawyer, now White House staff secretary, who is regularly pictured handing Trump executive orders.
Meanwhile, the National Trust for Historic Preservation filed a lawsuit in December to stop the ballroom. The judge in the case has so far refused to issue an injunction while the planning process is underway.
Cook Jr, the CFA chairman, said while he respected the National Trust, it had not stopped then president Harry Truman gutting the interior of the White House in the 1940s and 1950s. “Why the shouting now?” he said. “It seems unusual to me.”
Trump wants the ballroom to be finished before his term ends at the start of 2029. In a post on Truth Social, he thanked the panel for its decision. “Great accolades were paid to the building’s beauty and scale,” he said.
Even sceptics of the ballroom project have accepted the need for a bigger venue space for the president to host large, formal functions with visiting world leaders. Frequently - as was the case with a state dinner with then prime minister Scott Morrison in 2019 - guests are seated in outdoor tents on the White House grounds.
However, Trump’s ballroom has been tarred by accusations of improper process and lack of transparency. The cost - which is being covered by large corporate donations - has doubled to $US400 million, while the historic East Wing was bulldozed in October without any planning permits.
The White House has pointed out numerous presidents have modified or rebuilt the property. It says Trump’s ballroom is “a bold, necessary addition that echoes the storied history of improvements and additions from commanders-in-chief to keep the executive residence as a beacon of American excellence”.
Trump, a property developer before he entered politics, has also set in train a number of other Washington building projects, including the construction of a 250-foot triumphal arch nicknamed the “Arc de Trump”.

Tucker Carlson claims detained at airport in Israel, video tells different story

Conservative American commentator Tucker Carlson said Israeli security officials at Ben Gurion Airport detained him for questioning, but video circulating Thursday appeared to contradict that account.
In the footage, Carlson is seen signing a document, smiling, embracing what appears to be a security staff member, posing for a photo and leaving the area without visible distress.
Carlson claimed Wednesday that security personnel at Israel’s main international airport confiscated his passport and “hauled” him and his producer into a questioning room after he interviewed U.S. Ambassador to Israel Mike Huckabee.
“Men who identified themselves as airport security took our passports, hauled our executive producer into a side room and then demanded to know what we spoke to Ambassador Huckabee about,” Carlson told the Daily Mail. “It was bizarre. We’re now out of the country.” A photo posted on Carlson’s account on X showed him with his business partner, Neil Patel, in front of Israeli flags.
The U.S. State Department and the U.S. ambassador in Israel disputed Carlson’s account, saying he underwent routine questioning.
“It is inaccurate to say that Israel was prepared to allow Tucker to enter the country solely for the purpose of the interview,” the State Department said in response to an inquiry from ynet. “The only involvement of the U.S. Embassy with Israel regarding his visit was coordinating the landing of his private aircraft to facilitate a smooth visit. Tucker chose to enter the country for only a few hours and depart. Tucker received the same positive treatment afforded to any visitor to Israel.”
Israeli authorities also denied Carlson’s claims. The Israel Airports Authority said in a statement: “Contrary to the reports, Tucker Carlson and his entourage were not detained, delayed, or interrogated. Mr. Carlson and his party were politely asked a few routine questions, in accordance with standard procedures applied to many travelers. The conversation took place in a separate room within the VIP lounge solely to protect their privacy and to avoid conducting such a discussion in public. No unusual incident occurred, and the Israel Airports Authority firmly rejects any other claim.”
Carlson, one of Israel’s most vocal critics within the Republican Party, has at times made statements widely condemned as antisemitic. He traveled to Israel at Huckabee’s invitation after criticizing the ambassador on his YouTube program and accusing him of failing to ensure adequate protection for Christians in Israel.
“Instead of talking about me, why don't you come talk to me?” Huckabee wrote to Carlson on X. The podcast host responded that he would come to interview him. The interview ultimately took place at Ben Gurion Airport.

Shia LaBeouf accused of hate crime in Mardi Gras brawl
Actor was released from jail Tuesday and is due in court March 19

One of the alleged victims of Shia LaBeouf’s Mardi Gras meltdown has accused the actor of targeting him in a hate crime.
Jeffrey Damnit, who was born Jeffrey Klein, is asking prosecutors to upgrade charges against LaBeouf, 39, who currently faces two counts of simple battery after he was arrested for allegedly attacking two bartenders just after midnight Tuesday in New Orleans.
Hours before video was taken of the Transformers star fighting and being restrained on city streets, Damnit said he ran into the actor around 5 p.m. Monday, when LaBeouf allegedly knocked him over. He recalled to The Hollywood Reporter, “Then he turned around screaming, ‘Don’t you f***ing push me. I’ll kill you.’ I hadn’t touched him.”
Damnit said he tried to deescalate the situation, but LaBeouf allegedly then shoved a finger in his face and called him a homophobic slur.
In a Wednesday interview with The Guardian, Damnit said that he was wearing mascara, eye shadow and lipstick when LaBeouf allegedly attacked him while screaming, “You’re a f***ing f****t.” Damnit shared a video with the outlet that showed LaBeouf being examined by first responders at the scene before glancing over at Damnit and again calling him a slur.
“Keep on calling me f****t,” Damnit was heard saying on the video, The Guardian reported. The outlet noted that in initial police reports, officers said that the controversial former child star spoke about his Catholic faith and was heard saying, “These f****ts put me in jail.”
However, the allegation that he was spewing homophobic slurs at his alleged victims was left out of the official charging paperwork. NOPD refused to comment further on The Independent’s request, citing the ongoing investigation.
Damnit, an actor who visits New Orleans several times a year, told local Fox affiliate WVUE that he wants LaBeouf to be charged with a hate crime.
“I mean, it’s a hate crime, right? You’re beating people up because somewhere in your mind their sexuality goes against what you think should get to live,” Damnit said. He did not immediately return The Independent’s request for comment.
Louisiana law allows state prosecutors to file hate crime charges in cases where victims were targeted “because of actual or perceived race, age, gender, sexual orientation.”
LaBeouf was released from jail Tuesday and is due back in court March 19. The actor has not commented publicly on the charges against him, but has shared cryptic posts on his X account since his arrest, including a message simply saying, “Free me.”

Donald Trump speaks out on Andrew arrest: ‘It’s a very sad thing’
- US President Donald Trump has spoken out on the arrest of Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor.
- The disgraced royal was arrested Thursday on suspicion of misconduct in public office over his ties to paedophile financier Jeffrey Epstein but was released later that evening under further investigation.
- Speaking to reporters aboard Air Force One en route to an appearance in Georgia, Trump said: “I think it's a shame. I think it's very sad. I think it's so bad for the royal family. It’s very, very sad. To me, it’s a very sad thing.” He added that King Charles “who’s obviously coming to our country very soon”, is “a fantastic man, king”.
- On the Epstein files released by the Department of Justice, Trump said: “It's really interesting, because nobody used to speak about Epstein when he was alive, and now they speak, but I’m the one that can talk about it because I’ve been totally exonerated.
- He added, “I did nothing, in fact, the opposite. He was against me. He was fighting me in the election which I just found out throughout the last three million pages of documents.”

NASA's new boss is blasting Boeing and the space agency for Starliner's botched flight that left two astronauts stuck at the International Space Station

NASA’s new boss blasted Boeing and the space agency Thursday for Starliner’s botched flight that left two astronauts stuck for months at the International Space Station.
Administrator Jared Isaacman said poor leadership and decision-making at Boeing led to Starliner’s troubles. He also blamed NASA managers for failing to intervene and get Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams back more quickly.
The two test pilots, now retired from NASA, spent more than nine months at the station before catching a lift back with SpaceX last March.
Isaacman said Starliner’s problems must be better understood and fixed before any more astronauts strap in.
Isaacman upgraded the seriousness of Starliner's troubled astronaut debut, declaring it a “Type A mishap,” something that could endanger a crew. Both the Challenger and Columbia space shuttle disasters also involved cultural and leadership missteps. It is a mistake that Starliner was not designated a serious mishap right from the start, Isaacman said, citing internal pressure to keep Boeing on board and flights on track.
“This is just about doing the right thing,” he said. “This is about getting the record straight.”
Thruster failures and other problems almost prevented Wilmore and Williams from reaching the space station following liftoff in 2024. The thruster analyses continue by Boeing.
“We almost did have a really terrible day," said NASA Associate Administrator Amit Kshatriya, referring to a potential loss of life.
Boeing said the report by NASA will help the company move forward in ensuring crew safety, and stressed that the Starliner program would continue.
There is no timeline for when Boeing can launch Starliner on a supply run, essentially another test flight to prove its safety before astronaut flights. The grounding leaves SpaceX as the only U.S. taxi service for astronauts.
“Boeing has made substantial progress on corrective actions for technical challenges we encountered and driven significant cultural changes across the team,” Boeing said in a statement.
Even before the troubled astronaut flight, Boeing was struggling with Starliner issues. The first test flight in 2019, without anyone on board, ended up in the wrong orbit and forced a repeat mission, which had its own difficulties.
NASA hired Boeing and SpaceX in 2014, in the wake of the space shuttles’ retirement, to ferry astronauts to and from the orbiting lab. Their contracts are worth billions. SpaceX just delivered its 13th crew to the space station for NASA since 2020.
Kshatriya said the space agency must do better moving forward.
“We have to own our part of this,” he said. As for Wilmore and Williams, “We failed them."

National Parks ditches reservation system that has been used to help control crowd sizes
‘Our national parks belong to the American people, and our priority is keeping them open and accessible,’ a Trump administration official said
- Bookmark
- CommentsGo to comments
Visitors to popular national parks will no longer be required to make reservations, a system historically used to manage crowd sizes in America's protected natural areas.
The National Parks Service announced on Wednesday that three parks — Arches, Glacier and Yosemite — will ditch their reservation requirements starting this summer.
The agency, which is part of the Interior Department, said the decision reflects officials’ desire to expand public access during peak visitation season.
“Our national parks belong to the American people, and our priority is keeping them open and accessible,” Kevin Lilly, the acting assistant secretary for fish, wildlife and parks said in a statement. “We’re expanding access where conditions allow and using targeted tools only where necessary to protect visitor safety, maintain emergency access and preserve these extraordinary places for future generations.”
In order to prepare for this change, the parks’ seasonal workforce will be bolstered, officials said.
Several national parks started implementing reservation systems during the Covid-19 Pandemic in an attempt to reduce crowd sizes and to protect the spaces from overuse, according to The Wall Street Journal.
The policy elicited sharply divided responses from stakeholders: nearby business owners decried it for discouraging travel, while some outdoor enthusiasts supported it as a way to manage foot and vehicle traffic.
“In our view, [timed-entry reservations] have really made a meaningful difference in people’s visitor experiences. It creates safer conditions, protects resources and typically helps with traffic issues,” Cassidy Jones, a visitation program manager with the National Parks Conservation Association, told SFGATE.
The policy change will impact three of the country’s most popular outdoor tourist destinations, which draw millions of visitors each year.
Arches National Park in Utah won’t implement a “time entry reservation system,” NPS announced. Visitors instead will be encouraged to arrive early, explore less-traveled areas and to “be flexible.”
Additionally, Montana’s Glacier National Park won’t require “park-wide vehicle” reservations in 2026. The park, however, “will continue targeted congestion management in high-demand corridors,” NPS said.
Yellowstone National Park in California, which saw some 4 million visitors in 2024, will also phase out its reservation requirements this year, including during the busiest months of the year.
“The park will rely on real-time traffic management measures, including temporary traffic diversions when parking areas reach capacity and deployment of additional seasonal staff to manage high-use areas,” officials said.
NPS noted that Rocky Mountain National Park in Colorado will maintain its timed entry reservation system between May and October.
These adjustments are among multiple recent changes to the national parks system following President Donald Trump's inauguration last year.
In December, NPS revised its list of free entrance days, dropping Martin Luther King Jr. Day and Juneteenth — two federal holidays that were added under President Joe Biden’s administration.
In their place, June 14 — which is both Flag Day and Trump’s birthday — has been included.
And in January, Trump officials directed national parks to remove or update signage addressing climate change and Native American history. Staff at more than a dozen locations across Texas, Colorado, Montana and Utah received orders to change such displays.
The directive aligns with Trump's March 2025 executive order, titled "Restoring Truth and Sanity to American History,” which aimed to purge "partisan ideology" from federal sites.
Meanwhile, the number of staff at the nation’s parks has significantly decreased. According to the Journal, NPS has lost roughly 25 percent of its permanent staff since Trump returned to office.

Ukraine, Austria agree to step up joint efforts to return Ukrainian children from Russia
According to Ukrinform, Stefanchuk shared details of the meeting on Facebook.
"We spoke about the security situation and the consequences of Russian attacks. Russia is deliberately destroying energy infrastructure and using the cold as a tool of pressure, trying to make living conditions for Ukrainians unbearable. I received assurances of continued support from Austria and its parliament," Stefanchuk said.
He confirmed that "Ukraine is open to effective negotiations, but our 'red lines' remain unchanged – territorial integrity, sovereignty, independence, and the right to determine our own path."
Both sides also addressed the issue of abducted Ukrainian children and agreed to strengthen joint efforts in this area.
Stefanchuk and Rosenkranz discussed humanitarian projects as well, including the reconstruction of Ukrainian schools and kindergartens as a concrete expression of solidarity by the Austrian people with Ukraine.
"Austria remains a reliable partner of Ukraine, and we are sincerely grateful for all the support provided, which has already exceeded EUR 350 million," Stefanchuk said.

SAN FRANCISCO - The US state of West Virginia on Feb 19 said it is suing Apple over child sex abuse material people tuck away in its iCloud online storage service.
The suit filed by Attorney-General John Bohen McCuskey in a state court accuses the iPhone maker of letting iCloud be used to store and distribute such content, often referred to as child pornography.
Apple has been under pressure from some child safety advocates due to a decision several years ago not to jeopardise user privacy and security by allowing scanning of data stored in iCloud.
“Preserving the privacy of child predators is absolutely inexcusable,” Mr McCuskey said in a release.
Mr McCuskey argued that Apple has “shirked their responsibility to protect children under the guise of user privacy.”
In response to an AFP query, Apple countered that safety is a priority for the tech firm, which is constantly innovating to combat threats to users, especially children.
“All of our industry-leading parental controls and features are designed with the safety, security, and privacy of our users at their core,” an Apple spokesperson told AFP.
For example, a Communication Safety feature automatically intervenes on children’s devices when nudity is detected in Messages, shared Photos, AirDrop or live FaceTime video calls, the spokesperson added.
Apple opted not to allow scanning of photos stored in iCloud for child sex abuse, saying in a 2023 letter to an advocacy group that such a move brought the potential for unintended consequences.
“Scanning for one type of content, for instance, opens the door for bulk surveillance,” Apple said in the letter.
“How can users be assured that a tool for one type of surveillance has not been reconfigured to surveil for other content such as political activity or religious persecution?” AFP

Veteran dissident who refused exile released
Belarus has released jailed veteran opposition politician Mikola Statkevich, who refused to go into exile last year in a US-brokered prisoner release.
The 69-year-old was now at home and recovering from a stroke which had affected his speech, his wife Marina Adamovich said.
Statkevich spent more than five years behind bars after receiving a 14-year sentence for organising what the authorities called "mass riots" in 2020-21. He had run unsuccessfully against Alexander Lukashenko in a 2010 presidential poll.
More than 1,000 political prisoners remain in jail in Belarus, rights groups say.
"He is at home, recovering," Adamovich said on Thursday.
"I really hope that everything will be fine. The main problem at the moment is his speech. It's bad, it's difficult to have a conversation."
Meanwhile, exiled Belarusian leader Svetlana Tikhanovskaya said she was relieved that Statkevich "is free and able to hug his wife, who waited for him for so long".
"I want to thank everyone who keeps fighting to release all political prisoners in Belarus. We must continue until every last one is free," she added in a post on X.
Statkevich was one of 52 prisoners freed last year in Belarus, following an appeal from US President Donald Trump.
They were jailed in 2020-21, when Lukashenko brutally stamped out protests after claiming victory in presidential elections that were widely condemned as rigged.
Most agreed to be sent abroad into exile. Statkevich was the only one who refused to leave the country.
In exchange for the prisoner release, the US pledged to relieve some sanctions on Belarusian airline Belavia, allowing it to buy parts for its aircraft.
Belarus is a close ally of Russia, which launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.
Lukashenko has been in power in Belarus since 1994, quashing all opposition.

LoadingAlbanese comments on Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor's arrest
Prime Minister Anthony Albanese has described the arrest of Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor, the brother of King Charles, as an "extraordinary fall from grace".
The former prince was questioned on suspicion of misconduct in public office during his time as a British trade envoy.
Speaking to The Guardian, Albanese said he was limited in what he could say.
"These are very serious allegations, and because they will, no doubt, be the subject of court action, I’m limited in what I can say," the prime minister said.
"But people will be following the detail here. This appears to be about [classified] documents, and whether they were inappropriately forwarded on to someone who wasn’t eligible. But, of course, there’s the bigger issue as well when it comes to Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor. No doubt, we will wait and see where this all goes.
"To see this decline and fall is extraordinary."
Voters divided as Barnaby Joyce considers contesting New England for One Nation
Former deputy prime minister Barnaby Joyce has not ruled out recontesting his seat of New England as a One Nation candidate.
Following his defection from the National Party in December, the MP said he planned to run on One Nation's Senate ticket for NSW.
However, Joyce has now said there was a "caveat", and he could recontest in the lower house if it appeared One Nation could win multiple seats.
On the streets of Tamworth, John O'Meagher said he was surprised by Joyce's "caveat", but it was ultimately "his call".
Many in the region noted that Mr Joyce's reputation would work in his favour if he decided to recontest.

Fiji, Palau and Tuvalu set to show world leaders climate change impact ahead of COP31
Fiji, Palau and Tuvalu look set to host world leaders and climate change ministers in the lead-up to COP31 in a bid to encourage larger countries to accelerate cuts to emissions.
Both Fiji and Palau had offered to host the "pre-COP" meetings secured for the Pacific under a complicated deal struck last year that saw hosting rights for the main climate summit go to Türkiye while giving Climate Change Minister Chris Bowen a key position in global climate negotiations.
Australia and Pacific Islands nations have declared they want to use the opportunity to publicise the Pacific's existential battle with climate change.
But negotiations on who should host events in the lead-up to the summit have dragged on.
Palau President Surangel Whipps Jr told the ABC that Pacific leaders were close to landing a deal that would hand Palau, Fiji and Tuvalu a prominent role ahead of COP31.

Taylor distances himself from Hanson's remarks
Angus Taylor has distanced himself from Pauline Hanson's remarks on Muslim Australians, insisting the Coalition's focus was on "core values", not on race or religion.
The One Nation leader was condemned for suggesting there were no "good" Muslims. She later offered a partial apology for her remarks.
Taylor said he didn't agree with Hanson's comments. Asked if she should issue a full apology, the opposition leader said it was a matter for Hanson.
"I will always distance myself from people who think this is about anything other than protecting our way of life, focusing on our core values," Taylor said.
"If people want to come to our country, no matter their religion, and they don't believe what we believe in, then we should shut the door on them, it is as simple as that.
"I don't see that focusing on race and religion is the answer to that. I see us focusing on values and what we believe in as the priority here."
Taylor willing to work with government to broaden powers to refuse passports
Angus Taylor says the opposition would be willing to assist the government in broadening the power to refuse an Australian passport.
The Coalition is questioning why single-use travel documents were approved for a group of Australian women with links to the Islamic State to return from Syria.
"Temporary exclusion orders are there to deal with exactly this situation. There are powers to refuse passports, and the government has not answered the most basic questions about why those things are not being used, or to what extent they have sought to use them," he said.
"The legislation provides the powers to [refuse a passport] under the appropriate circumstances. The truth is if they need to be broadened, then we stand ready to work with the government to do that."
The group of 34 women and children had attempted to leave Al-Roj camp in north-eastern Syria on Monday, but were forced to turn back shortly afterwards.
A temporary exclusion order has been issued against one of the women on advice of security agencies.
Taylor called for the government to set out the advice it had received about the group.
Asked about the children, the opposition leader said it was "tragic" they were involved, but questions remained.
"There are real questions about radicalisation and what might have occurred with those children. We don't have the answers to any of those questions."
Taylor makes visit to Melbourne's Adass Israel synagogue
Opposition Leader Angus Taylor is in Melbourne today, where he's visiting the Adass Israel synagogue alongside Liberal frontbencher James Paterson.
Paterson says it is "not an accident" Taylor has chosen to visit the synagogue so early in his tenure as opposition leader.
"Protecting our way of life is a critical priority for the Liberal and National parties and the Coalition," he says.
"A critical feature of the Australian way of life is being able to worship freely without fear. And for the many Australian Jews, and especially the Adass Israel community, that has not been the case since that dark day."
The synagogue in Ripponlea was targeted in an arson attack on December 6, 2024.
Taylor says the attack should never have happened.
"But what I saw today was a Jewish community that is resilient, that is fighting back."
More reaction to arrest and questioning of Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor
Reactions have been rolling in from federal politicians about the news that Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor has been arrested and questioned by UK police on suspicion of misconduct in public office.
It is believed the arrest relates to allegations he passed sensitive government documents to the late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.
Social Services Minister Tanya Plibersek says she hopes the news brings some comfort to Epstein's victims.
"I hope some comfort to the victims to see that it seems no-one is above the law," she said.
"I hope that there are thorough investigations and, where warranted, prosecutions come from the release of these documents, and that victims get the justice they deserve."
New chief of top intelligence watchdog revealed
The federal government has appointed a new chief for Australia’s top intelligence watchdog.
The attorney-general, Michelle Rowland, has just announced New South Wales Crime Commissioner Michael Barnes will take up the role of inspector-general of Intelligence and Security from April this year.
He’s replacing Christopher Jessup, whose five-year term is coming to an end.
It’s an important role – the inspector-general oversees and reviews Australia’s national intelligence agencies to make sure they don’t break the law or overstep any boundaries while doing their work.
Barnes has had a long career in the law, and the attorney-general says he’ll bring “extensive” experience to the job and ensure intelligence agencies continue to face “robust” scrutiny.
Full list of 11 Australian women with ISIS links trying to leave Syria revealed
The ABC can reveal the names of the 11 women connected to former Islamic State fighters in Syria who attempted to journey home to Australia this week
The group of 34 Australians, including 23 children, has been living in camps in Syria since the fall of the so-called caliphate, and some of those children were actually born behind the razor wire.
Some of the women are believed to have accompanied their husbands to the war zone, but others came with family and married IS fighters once they arrived. Some say they got stuck in Syria by accident.
Many of them have previously spoken to the ABC.
They left the Al-Roj camp in north-eastern Syria on Monday in the hopes of returning to Australia, but were forced to turn back shortly afterwards.
An official at the Al Roj camp said that when the group left, staff started dismantling their tents, and when the group unexpectedly returned, some had to bunk in together.
On Wednesday, Home Affairs Minister Tony Burke revealed one of the women is now the subject of a Temporary Exclusion Order (TEO), potentially banning her from travelling to Australia for up to two years on national security grounds.
It is not clear who the woman subject to the TEO is.

Hanson is capitalising on fear, Melissa McIntosh says
Liberal frontbencher Melissa McIntosh says Pauline Hanson's comments about the Muslim community have had an impact on the people in her electorate on the western edge of Sydney.
The One Nation leader has this week made comments about Muslims that have been labelled "cruel" and "divisive" by people across the political spectrum.
McIntosh told Sky News she thinks Hanson is capitalising on people's fear relating to the news of Australian women with IS ties returning home from Syria.
"They need to separate what's going on when it comes to the so-called ISIS brides and when it comes to immigration, the impacts that immigration more broadly has on communities like ours in Western Sydney," she said.
"So, these are two fundamentally different things that are getting caught up together and and Pauline Hanson is taking opportunity of that."
Sympathy for children stuck in camps but blame on parents: Watt
Labor frontbencher Murray Watt also dialled into ABC's Radio National Breakfast.
He said he had sympathy for the children stuck in the "distressing" situation of the camps in northern Syria, but laid the blame on their parents.
"It's a distressing situation that they've been placed in as a result of very bad decisions by their parents. We, of course, from a government perspective, you know, focus more than anything on the safety of Australians, and that explains the basis of our decisions that we've made about this group," he said.
"I do have sympathy for those children, and our government has sympathy for those children. But the decision to put the children in these situations was made by their parents. That's something that we can't change."
Duniam unsure who wrote leaked immigration policy
The shadow home affairs minister also continued to distance himself from an immigration policy that was leaked to the media.
Under the plan, entry to Australia for people from terror-declared areas such as Gaza and Somalia would be barred.
The ABC reported earlier this week the draft policy proposal was produced within former opposition leader Sussan Ley's office and was not signed off on by the shadow cabinet.
Jonathon Duniam said he had no clue who wrote the policy.
He said the working group had an "excellent" proposal that was due to be released, but was delayed in the wake of the Bondi terror attack .
Duniam says he's now, along with his colleagues, working to redraft the policy.
Risk of 'anyone', even children, returning from former IS-controlled region a concern: Duniam
Shadow Home Affairs Minister Jonathon Duniam dialled into ABC's Radio National Breakfast, where he was also asked about the group of Australian women and children stuck in Syria.
The cohort of 34 had attempted to leave the al-Roj camp in north-eastern Syria on Monday in hopes of returning to Australia, but were forced to turn back.
Duniam was asked if the children should be subject to similar levels of concern and protection as demonstrated by former PM Scott Morrison when he repatriated eight orphaned children in 2019.
He said the situation was complex and there were risks associated with bringing anyone back from the region.
"So, we cannot ignore the risk associated with individuals, whether they be minors or indeed adults, when it comes to repatriating them here," he said.
"And indeed, when it comes to these minors, the temporary exclusion order regime does apply to individuals between the ages of 14 and 17, and some reports suggest that these aren't just infants, they are indeed inclusive of teenagers who would be more advanced in thinking and beliefs than perhaps a younger child."
Butler dismisses Coalition call to cancel passports for Australians with links to IS
The opposition has escalated its attack over the government's handling of the potential return of Australians linked to the Islamic State.
It has questioned why the cohort of 34 women and children was issued single-use passports and pointed to powers to refuse the documents.
But while Mark Butler agreed the power was there, the grounds for not approving a passport are "very specific".
"They're determined ultimately by our national security agencies," he says.
"I'm sure Angus Taylor knows that there are very strict constitutional limits on what any government, Labor or Liberal, is able to do in the area of citizenship and passports."
Liberal deputy Jane Hume said Australians deserved an explanation as to why one of the women was issued with a temporary order to delay their return, and others weren't.
Government reacts to Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor arrest
Health Minister Mark Butler has provided the government's first reaction to the arrest of Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor.
"As the king said, the law must follow its course. There's not much we can appropriately say about the potential for charges," he told Seven.
"But ... what a fall from grace. A man we knew for decades as Prince Andrew ... is just now a man in his 60s from Norfolk.
"I think all of our thoughts as human beings ... go to the girls and the women who were caught up in this hideous network of powerful men that Jeffrey Epstein pulled together.
"And we're starting to see some accountability for those awful years."
Deputy Liberal leader Jane Hume agreed, saying it was a reminder that "nobody is above the law".
"I think that this is an extremely disturbing fall from grace that we've seen from Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor. The misconduct in public office is a very serious allegation," she says.
"We should let the full course of the law take its place."
'I support the dual mandate': Wilson backpedals on RBA call
Shadow Treasurer Tim Wilson has walked back his call to overhaul the Reserve Bank of Australia's twin focus on taming inflation and full employment.
In an interview with the Sydney Morning Herald on Wednesday, Wilson called for a rethink of the RBA's twin goals, which are to keep inflation between 2-3 per cent and unemployment low.
Wilson told the newspaper the RBA is "confused about what its core purpose is to do, and it should be to focus on reducing inflation".
But in a statement to the ABC, the Goldstein MP appears to have had a change of heart.
"I support the dual mandate. I support a review so the RBA gets it right because they've consistently failed at understanding the nature of inflation, and I don't support Jim Chalmers continuing to pour debt petrol on the inflation fire," Wilson says.
The treasurer has labelled Mr Wilson's initial comments to the SMH "reckless" and urged the Coalition to "urgently reconsider abandoning the dual mandate for the Reserve Bank".
Yesterday, Liberal deputy Jane Hume told Afternoon Briefing she backs a dual mandate.
"I have seen no reason why the dual mandate doesn't work."

European Commission should defend EU interests, not Ukraine’s — top Hungarian diplomat

BUDAPEST, February 19. /TASS/. Hungary urges the European Commission to defend the interests of EU member countries, not those of Ukraine, which blocked Russian oil deliveries via the Druzhba pipeline, Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto said.
He welcomed the European Commission’s decision to discuss the issue during the Oil Coordination Group meeting due February 24 but suggested that the EU’s primary executive body should "act as the commission of Europe, and not of Ukraine."
In his opinion, the European Commission should demand that the Kiev government "complies with the EU association agreement which stipulates that Ukraine should not put energy security of any EU member country at risk."
On top of that, Szijjarto believes that the European Commission should "take seriously the EU’s rules on Russian oil imports," making Croatians understand that they cannot impede the delivery of Russian oil for Hungary and Slovakia by sea while the Druzhba pipeline remains offline.
According to Hungarian data, oil has not flowed through the Druzhba pipeline since January 27. Budapest believes that Kiev is attempting to provoke an energy crisis in Hungary ahead of parliamentary elections to create difficulties for the current government and support the political opposition. Hungarian authorities have assured that they will ensure stable oil supplies and the availability of fuel at gas stations. Hungary has oil reserves sufficient to supply refineries for more than three months.
On February 15, Hungary and Slovakia asked Croatia to allow the transit of Russian crude oil through the Adriatic Pipeline. It is expected that it will be delivered to the Croatian port of Omisalj by sea. Budapest believes this can be done in full compliance with EU regulations. The European Commission stated that its oil coordination group was to discuss the issue at its next meeting.

US officials tell DOJ now is the ‘time to act’ on Epstein files investigation in wake of Andrew’s arrest in the UK
‘If a Prince can be held accountable, so can a President,’ wrote one Democrat
- Bookmark
After the unprecedented arrest of Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor by U.K. authorities, some U.S. lawmakers have demanded greater accountability for individuals linked to Jeffrey Epstein on this side of the Atlantic.
Elected officials from both parties have urged the Trump administration to follow the European nation’s lead and take stronger steps toward securing justice for Epstein’s victims.
“The U.K. is not messing around,” Rep. Melanie Stansbury, a New Mexico Democrat, said. “It’s time to act.”
The former prince was arrested at his residence near Windsor Castle on Thursday. Authorities suspect him of misconduct in public office for allegedly leaking confidential documents to Epstein while serving as the U.K.’s trade envoy. The allegations were uncovered in the latest cache of the so-called Epstein files released by the Department of Justice. The documents appear to include numerous references to King Charles’ brother, whose association with Epstein has long been known. They also contain photos seeming to show the disgraced prince on all fours over a woman.
The 66-year-old Mountbatten-Windsor — the first senior royal in modern history to be arrested — will be held in a cell while he awaits an interview with police.
The arrest comes at a time when public intrigue surrounding the Epstein files — which has endured for years — shows no signs of waning. While campaigning, President Donald Trump vowed to make the government’s records on the convicted sex offender public. Although he resisted the idea after taking office, he later signed the Epstein Files Transparency Act, compelling the Department of Justice to release its documents on Epstein. Millions of files have since been published, some of which include references to high-profile individuals and sexual activity with minors. Despite this, the documents have not yet resulted in any prosecutions in the U.S.
‘It’s time to act’
The stunning news of Mountbatten-Windsor’s detention, which came on his 66th birthday, sent shockwaves across the Atlantic, prompting swift reactions from a number of U.S. officials.
Democrats largely led the charge in seeking further action from the Trump administration, which has thus far chosen not to pursue any prosecutions — and President Donald Trump has dismissed the entire Epstein matter as a “hoax.”
“I’m glad to see someone is finally being held accountable,” Maryland Rep. Johnny Olszewski told CNN Thursday morning. “This is far too vast a network for there not to be more accountability.”
He lamented the passivity of the U.S. government, saying: “We can’t even release all the files.”
Attorney General Pam Bondi said in her congressional testimony last week that “all” the files had been made public. However, a recent report by Channel 4 News out of the U.K. claimed that, based on internal emails, only 2 percent of the documents have been released.
New Mexico Rep. Melanie Stansbury also applauded the decisive action by U.K. authorities, writing in a post on X: “If a Prince can be held accountable, so can a President.”
“It’s time to act,” she added.
“If you raped or abused children, you should be prosecuted and held fully accountable,” Arizona Rep. Yassamin Ansari wrote in a social media post about the former prince’s detention.
The DOJ’s files include references to and correspondence from numerous high-profile individuals across all sectors of society, including President Donald Trump, former President Bill Clinton, former Treasury Secretary Larry Summers, Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates and film director Woody Allen. Merely being named in the files is not in and of itself evidence of wrongdoing. None of the people named in the file have been charged in U.S. courts.
Some Democrats, meanwhile, accused the Trump administration of deliberately shielding criminals from legal repercussions — while noting that multiple other nations have take action.
“In France, the Paris prosecutor's office just opened two investigations based on new leads from the released files,” Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said in a statement. “And in Britain, former prince Andrew has been arrested over ties to Epstein. When will there be justice in America?”
Republicans echo calls for accountability
A few Republicans have weighed in following Mountbatten-Windsor’s arrest, with some of the strongest statements coming from South Carolina Rep. Nancy Mace — one of four GOP members who voted to pass the Epstein Files Transparency Act.
“If you’re watching a former prince get arrested today, remember: four Republicans refused to flinch, refused to fold, and forced the Epstein files into the light,” Mace, who is running for South Carolina governor, wrote in a post on X, which she pinned to the top of her feed. “Courage has consequences. So does corruption.”
Kentucky Rep. Thomas Massie, who helped spearhead the passage of the Epstein Files Transparency Act, urged the Trump administration to take a page from the U.K.’s playbook.
“Prince Andrew was just arrested. This was the metric I established for success of the Epstein Files Transparency Act,” he wrote on X. “Now we need JUSTICE in the United States. It’s time for [Bondi] and [FBI Director Kash Patel] to act!”
Trump has not commented publicly on the arrest of Mountbatten-Windsor, who was once photographed with him at Mar-a-Lago. In November, the 79-year-old president lamented the disgraced prince being stripped of his royal titles, calling it “a terrible thing.”
A White House spokesperson did not immediately respond to a request for comment from The Independent.
New developments on Epstein files
While there have not yet been any arrests or prosecutions in the United States, several new developments related to Epstein have emerged in recent days.
On Saturday, the DOJ sent a six-page letter to Congress, which included the names of politicians, businesspeople and celebrities who were mentioned at least once in the files. Among the names listed were Trump, Mountbatten-Windsor and Gates.
This week, billionaire Les Wexner also testified before the House Oversight Committee, claiming he was "duped” by Epstein, his former financial adviser, who he described as a “world-class con man.” Wexner turned over the management of his massive fortune to the convicted sex offender in 1991.
New Mexico lawmakers also approved a comprehensive investigation into Zorro Ranch, a sprawling property once owned by Epstein. The estate is referenced numerous times in the DOJ’s files, which include unconfirmed reports about criminal activity there.
Still, despite limited efforts by lawmakers, the public remains skeptical that justice will be served. According to a new Reuters survey, 69 percent of Americans believe “powerful people in the U.S. are rarely held accountable for their actions.”

Meet Antonia Romeo, Keir Starmer’s super-ambitious pick to reboot the British state

LONDON — “Her office was like something out of Black Mirror,” recalls a young official of her first trip to see the woman now leading Britain’s civil service.
Wherever she looked in Antonia Romeo’s old sanctum at the Department for International Trade, Romeo’s face smiled back. “It was covered in pictures of her with famous people,” the footballer David Beckham among them, the official recalled. “I couldn’t concentrate on the meeting, because I was just looking at the wall thinking, ‘is that Imelda Staunton?’”
If this kind of self-promotion sits awkwardly with Britain’s highly-strung reputation, it clashes violently with the stuffy etiquette of its civil service — where leaders are so notorious for self-restraint and false modesty that they were satirized in a TV drama called “Yes Minister.”

Trump's Board of Peace opens with $10 billion pledge and troops for Gaza
France

05:04:11 KST

US President Donald Trump on Thursday, February 19 promised $10 billion and Muslim-majority nations offered funding and troops for Gaza as he inaugurated his Board of Peace, a new institution whose ultimate mission has drawn questions.
Trump brought together allies from around the world – many authoritarians, with few Western democrats who traditionally ally with the United States – to hail his peacemaking just as he sends US military might near Iran and threatens war.
Presiding with a gavel over the meeting in the gleaming Washington building of the former US Institute of Peace, which has been gutted and renamed after the 79-year-old Republican, Trump hailed the "powerful people" who joined his board.
"We will help Gaza. We will straighten it out. We'll make it successful," Trump said, holding up a document with pledges before the disco beats of his adopted theme-song "YMCA" came on the speakers. "We will make it peaceful, and we will do things like that in other spots. Spots will come up, things will happen," Trump said.
Trump, who has sharply curtailed foreign aid, said the US would contribute $10 billion to the board. Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates each promised at least $1 billion. White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said more than $6.5 billion was pledged, presumably excluding Trump's offer.
"Together we can achieve the dream of bringing lasting harmony to a region tortured by centuries of war, suffering," said the realtor-turned-president, who has spoken improbably of building tourist resorts in Gaza.
Trump did not explain exactly where the money would go and whether Congress had approved the contribution he announced for the institution, which has drawn criticism for its opaque nature.
Trump will wield veto power over the Board of Peace and can remain its head even after leaving office, while countries that want to stay on permanently, rather than enjoy a two-year stint, will need to pay $1 billion.
Troop pledges
The Board of Peace came together after the Trump administration, teaming up with Qatar and Egypt, negotiated a ceasefire in October to halt two years of devastating war in Gaza. The plan's second phase calls for the disarmament of Hamas, whose unprecedented October 7, 2023 attack on Israel triggered the massive offensive.
In a first for an Arab country, Morocco announced it was ready to send police as well as officers to the nascent International Stabilization Force. The force's American commander, Major General Jasper Jeffers, said that Albania, Indonesia, Kazakhstan and Kosovo were also sending troops and announced that an Indonesian officer would serve as his deputy.
Indonesia, the world's largest Muslim-majority country, earlier said it was ready to send 8,000 troops – nearly half of the 20,000 sought. Trump hailed Indonesian President Prabowo Subianto, who attended, calling the former military officer accused of human rights abuses in East Timor a "tough cookie."
Nickolay Mladenov, a veteran Bulgarian diplomat named high representative for Gaza by the US, also announced the beginning of recruitment for a post-Hamas police force in Gaza and said 2,000 people had applied in the first hours.
Despite the truce, Gaza's health ministry, which operates under Hamas authorities, says Israeli forces have killed at least 601 people since it took effect. Foreign Minister Gideon Saar, representing Israel at the meeting, demanded disarmament of Hamas and "a fundamental deradicalization process" in Gaza.
Mixed attendance
In a rambling speech, Trump denounced domestic opponents, highlighted stock market gains and endorsed the political fortunes of several leaders on stage, including populists Viktor Orban of Hungary and Javier Milei of Argentina. He also issued a new warning to Iran, warning of potential US strikes in 10 days if the clerical state does not agree to major concessions starting with its nuclear program.
Few Western nations joined the board. Britain and Germany sent their ambassadors to Washington as observers, while Canada and France shunned the meeting entirely. French Foreign Minister Jean-Noël Barrot criticized the European Commission for attending as an observer, saying it did not have a mandate to do so.
Prime Minister Edi Rama of Albania, a steadfast US ally, dismissed European concerns that Trump was trying to "replace the UN," to which he drastically cut US support. "But if it helps shake that agonizing giant and, Inshallah, wake it up, then God bless the Board of Peace," Rama said.

‘She always spoke highly of her kid’: Friend of Rhode Island ice rink shooter speaks out on mass shooting

‘She always spoke highly of her kid’: Friend of Rhode Island ice rink shooter speaks out on mass shooting
Robert Dorgan, 56, opened fire at the Dennis M. Lynch Arena in Pawtucket during a hockey game
- Bookmark
A woman who knew the Rhode Island ice rink shooter as a calm, loving parent says she is still struggling to come to terms with the deadly violence that unfolded during a hockey game earlier this week.
“To see the events of this tragedy was just shocking because she had such a calm demeanor,” a friend of Robert Dorgan, named only as Kimberly by local outlet WCVB, said. Kimberly only knew Dorgan as “Roberta.”
Dorgan, 56, who also went by Roberta Esposito and Roberta Dorgan, walked into the Dennis M. Lynch Arena in Pawtucket during a youth hockey game on Monday and opened fire, killing his ex-wife and their son and wounding three others before dying of a self-inflicted gunshot wound.
While investigators have not released a motive, Kimberly told WCVB that nothing in her interactions with Dorgan suggested a capacity for violence.
“I cannot in any situation understand how she can go and take the life of her child, especially because she spoke so highly of them," Kimberly said. "It breaks my heart, I'm disgusted, I'm mad, I'm disappointed.”
Kimberly first came into contact with Dorgan at a biker meetup after they moved to Florida following a divorce and gender-affirming surgery.
“She always put her children on a pedestal,” she told the broadcaster. After spending three years in Florida, Dorgan moved to Maine in 2023 to be closer to family but was frustrated about limited contact with the children, Kimberly added.
“We had a conversation not long after she moved up there, and it was repeated, where she said, you know, ‘I moved all the way up here, and I don’t see my kids as much as I want,’” Kimberly recalled.
“Well, kids, a lot of teenagers don’t want to be around their parents anyway… if I’m being honest, it’s sometimes probably hard when you have the dad, that’s now a mom, and sometimes her wardrobe was sometimes more flamboyant than her personality.”
Authorities say the shooter targeted family members, killing ex-wife Rhonda Dorgan and adult son Aidan Dorgan, and wounding Rhonda’s parents, Linda and Gerald Dorgan, along with a family friend, Thomas Geruso.
Pawtucket Police Chief Tina Goncalves said there was “no indication” of impending violence and noted Dorgan had attended hockey games before without incident.
Court filings show gender identity was initially cited as a factor in the couple’s 2020 divorce, though the final filing listed “irreconcilable differences.” The documents also show the pair shared the same last name even before marriage, a detail authorities have not further explained.
Under the name Roberta Dorgano, Dorgan posted frequently on social media about marital troubles and transgender identity. In 2018, Dorgan wrote that Rhonda “hates the person who stole her husband.” A year later, Dorgan posted: “Transwoman, 6 kids : wife – not thrilled,” and encouraged others not to let being transgender stop them from creating a family.
A day before the shooting, Dorgan responded on X to posts by actor Kevin Sorbo and conspiracy theorist Alex Jones, writing that constant criticism of transgender people is “why we Go BERSERK.”
Goncalves credited several “good Samaritans” with intervening during the attack. At least three bystanders tackled Dorgan in the stands as the crowd fled. Dorgan was still able to reach for a second firearm and fatally shoot himself, police said.
A vigil was held Tuesday night at Slatersville Congregational Church in North Smithfield.
“It’s absolutely mind-boggling that this could happen to people we know and love and support through everything,” said Amy Goulet, whose son plays hockey in the community.
Dorgan worked at General Dynamics Bath Iron Works, a Navy shipbuilding facility in Bath, Maine. Co-workers said Dorgan often used the name Roberta at work.
A colleague, Destiny Mackenzie, said Dorgan frequently talked about family and a hockey-playing son. Mackenzie also said Dorgan had a bad temper and sometimes got into screaming matches with co-workers.
The Associated Press reported that, according to military records, Dorgan briefly served in the Marine Corps in 1988 and was separated less than three months later at the lowest rank.

Files reveal Epstein was offered chance to buy US Pentagon, FBI buildings
New files show Epstein, who had close ties to Israel, was offered sensitive US government real estate deals.
Emails released in the United States Department of Justice files show that the late convicted paedophile Jeffrey Epstein was offered the chance to buy into a sprawling building tied to the Department of Defense in 2016, according to United Kingdom broadcaster ITV News.
The 84,710-square-metre (101,312-suqare-yard) complex, located roughly 1.6km (1 mile) from the Pentagon in Arlington, Virginia, was described in an investor deck as a “mission-critical” site and “the only property in Arlington, Virginia other than the Pentagon itself with the ability to meet the space and infrastructure needs of the DOD”.

The proposed purchase price was about $116m. The structure of the deal would have made Epstein a co-owner and, effectively, a landlord to the US government.
There is no evidence that the transaction went ahead. But the prospect of a convicted sex offender acquiring a stake in property serving the Pentagon raises serious security questions.
Among millions of emails published last month, an FBI informant wrote in a memo that Epstein was a “Mossad Agent” working for Israel.
“Epstein was close to the former Prime Minister of Israel, Ehud Barak, and trained as a spy under him,” the memo adds.
Epstein maintained a decade-long relationship with Ehud Barak, a former Israeli prime minister and one-time senior military intelligence figure. Barak visited Epstein’s New York townhouse more than 30 times between 2013 and 2017.
The ties between Epstein and Israel have come into sharp focus following the release of the documents. Beyond his interactions with members of the global elite, including Barak, the files document Epstein’s financial support for Israeli groups, including Friends of the Israeli army and the settler organisation the Jewish National Fund, as well as his connections to the Mossad, Israel’s overseas intelligence agency.
The Pentagon-linked proposal formed part of three documents – an email, an investor presentation and a deal summary – contained within the newly released files.
David Stern, a businessman who referred to himself as Epstein’s “soldier”, forwarded the offer. Stern also served as a close aide to Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor, who was arrested on Thursday on “suspicion of misconduct in public office” following revelations in the Epstein files.
In the same year Stern relayed the Pentagon-area proposal, he became director of the St George’s House Trust at Windsor Castle and attended an event at St James’s Palace, where he sat beside the late Queen Elizabeth II.
Stern also sent Epstein a separate proposal in 2015 to invest in two FBI field offices in Richmond and Baltimore, and courthouses, which were called “sexy assets”. That deal required an initial $25m, followed by a further $80m, with ownership routed through a Cayman Islands offshore entity.
Real estate investor Jonathan D Fascitelli originated both property proposals.

Indonesia pledges 8,000 troops for Gaza force

ALBAWABA- Indonesian President Prabowo Subianto on Thursday pledged up to 8,000 troops, and potentially more, to support an International Stabilization Force (ISF) in Gaza, speaking at the inaugural meeting of the newly formed Board of Peace in Washington.
Addressing leaders gathered at the White House, Prabowo voiced strong confidence in the U.S.-led initiative, expressing optimism that lasting peace in Palestine could be achieved despite expected challenges.
“Even with obstacles and difficulties, we are very optimistic that under the leadership of President Donald Trump, this vision of real peace can be realized,” he said, adding that Indonesia stands ready to play an active role in securing stability in Gaza.
Prabowo said recent ceasefire gains were tangible and reaffirmed Jakarta’s commitment to contribute “a significant number of troops, up to 8,000 or more if necessary”, to help ensure the agreement holds and reconstruction efforts proceed safely.
Separately, Pakistani Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif called for coordinated international efforts to secure Palestinian self-determination through the establishment of an independent and sovereign state in line with United Nations resolutions.
Sharif stressed that preserving the ceasefire was critical to saving lives and enabling reconstruction, adding that Palestinians must retain full authority over their land and future.
Trump presided over the launch of the Board of Peace, a multilateral body tasked with overseeing Gaza’s reconstruction and promoting broader regional stability. The initiative, endorsed last month in Davos under UN Security Council Resolution 2803, brings together representatives from more than 40 countries to advance a 20-point ceasefire and recovery framework.
The plan focuses on humanitarian assistance, rebuilding infrastructure and deploying the ISF to maintain security during a transitional period before responsibilities shift to restructured Palestinian authorities. Trump announced more than $5 billion in reconstruction pledges and outlined plans aimed at economic revitalization, including major infrastructure and coastal development projects, while reiterating that further progress would depend on Hamas’ disarmament.
The Board of Peace builds on the October 2025 Gaza truce brokered by the United States, Qatar, and Egypt, which ended nearly two years of fighting. While the initiative reflects broad international backing for reconstruction, some allies like France and the UK have voiced concerns over governance arrangements and the extent of U.S. leadership within the framework, particularly amid continued tensions in the West Bank and ongoing disputes surrounding Iran’s nuclear program.

First photos: Former UK royal Andrew seen leaving police station after arrest

Former British royal Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor, once known as Prince Andrew, was released Thursday to his home under investigation after being arrested on suspicion of misconduct in public office.
Mountbatten-Windsor, 66, was taken into custody at Wood Farm on the Sandringham estate in Norfolk in the morning — coinciding with his birthday — and held by Thames Valley Police for roughly 10 to 11 hours before being released without charge, officials and eyewitnesses said. Searches were carried out at both his Norfolk residence and his former home in Windsor Great Park as part of the probe.
Police said the arrest was made on suspicion of misconduct in public office, a serious offense that can carry heavy penalties, and is linked to an ongoing investigation sparked by newly released documents connected to disgraced financier and convicted pedophile Jeffrey Epstein. Some of those files suggest Mountbatten-Windsor may have shared confidential government materials with Epstein during his decade as Britain’s special trade envoy.
Mountbatten-Windsor has previously denied any wrongdoing related to his past association with Epstein, a convicted sex offender who died in U.S. custody in 2019. His links to Epstein have long shadowed the once-senior royal, leading to his withdrawal from public duties and the stripping of his royal titles and honours in recent years.
The arrest marks a rare moment in modern British history and is believed to be the first time in centuries that a senior royal has been detained on suspicion of a crime.
Hours after the arrest, Mountbatten-Windsor was photographed leaving the Aylsham police station in Norfolk, seated in the back of a vehicle bound for home. It was not immediately clear whether he was released on bail or under investigation.
The police investigation followed public and political pressure after the release of millions of pages from U.S. Justice Department files related to the Epstein case, which have prompted renewed scrutiny of Mountbatten-Windsor’s conduct, particularly during official trips as a trade envoy.
King Charles III issued a statement underscoring that “the law must take its course” and pledged full cooperation with authorities, while other senior royals expressed concern over the continuing revelations tied to the scandal.
Mountbatten-Windsor’s legal jeopardy remains unresolved as police continue their inquiry. UK law requires that charges be filed within a set period after an arrest, but authorities have not yet announced whether he will face formal prosecution.

Tunisia jails lawmaker for eight months for mocking president
Sign up now: Get ST's newsletters delivered to your inbox
TUNIS, Feb 19 - A Tunisian court on Thursday sentenced lawmaker Ahmed Saidani to eight months in prison over social media posts mocking President Kais Saied, a ruling that opponents say signals an intensifying crackdown on critics.
Once a supporter of Saied’s policies against political opponents, Saidani has become a vocal critic, accusing the president of seeking to monopolise all decision-making while leaving others to bear the blame for problems.
The member of parliament was jailed on charges of insulting others through communication networks, a judicial official said.
Saidani was arrested this month after he mocked the president in a Facebook post, describing him as the "supreme commander of sewage and rainwater drainage".
"This is a violation of the law and an attack on institutions. How can parliament hold the executive authority to account if it carries out an unlawful arrest over critical views", Bilel Mechri, a colleague of Saidani, told Reuters.
Saidani was elected as a lawmaker at the end of 2022 in a parliamentary election with very low voter turnout, following Saied's dissolution of the previous parliament and dismissal of the government in 2021.
Saied has since ruled by decree, moves the opposition has described as a coup.
Most opposition leaders, some journalists and critics of Saied have been imprisoned since he seized control of most powers.
Human rights groups say Saied has cemented his one‑man rule and turned Tunisia into an "open‑air prison" in an effort to suppress his opponents.
Saied says he is enforcing the law and seeking to "cleanse" the country. REUTERS

Danny Dyer claims the BBC ‘hasn’t asked’ him to go on Celebrity Traitors
The ‘Rivals’ star has described rumours of his ‘Celebrity Traitors’ stint as ‘absolute b*****s’
- Bookmark
- CommentsGo to comments
Celebrity Traitors fans who are hoping to see Danny Dyer in the turret this year may be disappointed – the ex EastEnders star has admitted that the BBC is yet to be in touch.
The actor is one of the names rumoured to be taking part in the hit show’s second series, which will air on BBC One later this year. It was previously reported in January that Dyer, 48, was on Celebrity Traitors’ bosses wish lists for the 2026 cast, alongside the likes of Hugh Bonneville, Richard E. Grant and Alison Hammond.
However, the Rivals star hit out at rumours of him joining the show while on The Jonathan Ross Show, calling them “absolute b******s”. When asked whether he would be heading to the Scottish castle, Dyer told Ross in an episode airing on Saturday (21 February): “I don’t why they’re saying it.
“If they ask me I’ll do it, but no one’s asked me. I would f***ing declare it. I’m not on it, you’ll see when it comes on.”
It was reported by The Sun in January that BAFTA-winning actor was being eyed up by Celebrity Traitors producers, having turned down the show last year before becoming a fan. “As soon as his tune changed, it was all systems go,” a source told the publication.
Dyer broke out into acting with his hard man roles in 1999’s Human Traffic and 2004’s The Football Factory, while also working with playwright Harold Pinter by starring in four of his productions. After a nine-year stint in EastEnders as Queen Vic landlord Mick Carter, Dyer won a BAFTA for his performance in comedy Mr. Bigstuff and won rave reviews for his role of Freddie Jones in Rivals.
Teasing the new series of Rivals on The Jonathan Ross Show alongside his Love Island star daughter Dani, Dyer admitted that there are more racy scenes to come for his character.
“I don’t think you’ll be able to watch much of it,” he told Dani, who replied: “There was a scene on the last series. The love-making, I don’t watch. The last one there wasn’t that much.”
“I got away with it last time,” he said. “I don’t get away with it this time.”
The father-daughter duo appear on Saturday’s episode of Ross’ chat show to promote their new Sky One series, in which they open up their own caravan park. Dyer revealed on Tuesday (17 January) that he initially rejected the idea for The Dyers’ Caravan Park, but was inspired by memories of his own “working-class holidays” as a child.
“They were very simple days that I really do miss. So I thought, with the might of Sky behind me, let’s see if we can make caravans interesting again to some people, with my firstborn child, of course.”
The Jonathan Ross Show airs Saturday at 9:25pm on ITV1 and ITVX.

Dani Dyer reveals she’d ‘love’ another chance at Strictly Come Dancing after quitting due to injury
The ‘Love Island’ star was replaced by Amber Davies on the BBC show last year

Dani Dyer has revealed she’d “love” to have another shot at Strictly Come Dancing, after being forced to quit the most recent series due to injury.
The former Love Islander was paired with professional dancer Nikita Kuzmin but the duo never actually got to compete together, as Dyer fractured her ankle before the first live show.
Addressing the fact that her Strictly journey was cut short, Dyer has now said: “I’d love to do it again.”
“If they rang me, I’d answer the phone,” she added, during an interview on The Jonathan Ross Show that airs on Saturday (21 February). “I was devastated. It was hell for me when I hurt my foot, I was so sad.”
Dyer is appearing on the ITV talk show alongside her dad, Danny, to promote their new programme, The Dyers' Caravan Park, which sees the pair try to restore a caravan park to its former glory.
There is a precedent for injured Strictly stars getting a second chance. Jamie Laing was also forced to pull out of the competition before delivering a full performance back in 2019, after suffering an injury while filming the launch show. He gave it another go in 2020 – and made it to the final.
Announcing her Strictly exit last September, Dyer told fans: “The doctors have said I am not allowed to dance so l’ve had to pull out of the show. To say I’m heartbroken is the biggest understatement.”
She was replaced by fellow Love Island alumna Amber Davies, who had less than 48 hours to prepare before the first live show.
Davies wasted no time in impressing the judges and cementing herself as a serious contender – but the 29-year-old struggled to win over some viewers, with many claiming her West End career gave her an unfair advantage.
The criticism intensified in the run-up to the final and Davies’ professional partner said she was receiving “hate every single day”.
Making an impassioned speech during the live semi-final, Kuzmin said Davies nevertheless “came every single day into the training room with a big smile, ignoring everybody”.
“You were always so kind, you’re so caring,” he added, becoming tearful. “You care more about me when I’m supposed to care about you. You care about me every single day. You are such a lovely, positive person.”
Addressing Strictly fans at home, Kuzmin pleaded: “Please, please be kind because it costs nothing and you don’t deserve none of that.”
The pair were the highest-scoring couple in the following Saturday’s live final, receiving a near-perfect 118 out of a possible 120 after performing their three dances – but Davies missed out on the Glitterball, which was won by ex-England player Karen Carney.
The Jonathan Ross Show airs on Saturday at 9.25pm on ITV1 and ITVX.

Grey’s Anatomy star Patrick Dempsey opens up why he left hit medical drama
The 60-year-old played Dr Derek Shepherd, known to fans as McDreamy, in the show

Actor Patrick Dempsey has revealed why he left his role in medical drama Grey’s Anatomy.
Dempsey left the show in 2015 and has now opened up on why it was “time to walk away”.
The 60-year-old, a beloved original cast member from Grey’s Anatomy’s 2005 inception, played Dr Derek Shepherd, affectionately dubbed "McDreamy" by fans before leaving during season 11.
Grey’s Anatomy was a US medical drama chronicling the lives of surgical interns and their supervisors at Seattle’s Grey Sloan Memorial Hospital.
Speaking about his shock exit, the star told ITV’s The Jonathan Ross Show: “It was time to walk away.
“I had the opportunity to do a full season in the WEC, which is the (FIA) World Endurance Championship. That was my love.”
Dempsey left the show after almost a decade and went on to participate in the WEC, an international sportscar racing competition, achieving first place in a six-hour-long endurance race held in Japan.
He added: “For me, it’s (Grey’s Anatomy) been a blessing. It’s given me a wonderful platform.
“I think the best thing that has come out of it is that a lot of young people have gone into the medical profession because of it – I think that’s a great thing.”
Dempsey said that despite the popularity of Emmy-winning show, he has tried to keep it away from his children, who he described as “very direct” with their opinions.
He said: “I didn’t really expose them to the show (Grey’s Anatomy). I kept them as far away as possible.”
He went on to say that the popularity of the hit medical drama helped him with his charity work, which has seen him open a cancer treatment centre in his hometown in Lewiston, Maine.
According to its website, The Dempsey Centre provides free holistic treatment to cancer patients including nutritional care, counselling, fitness classes and integrative therapies.
Dempsey said: “It was inspired by my own mother’s cancer journey – she had ovarian cancer over 12 recurrences. We don’t treat the disease, we treat the person holistically and the visibility of the show (Grey’s Anatomy) helped me do that.”
He added: “You come out of surgery and your treatment, you may be cured but you’re not healed and that’s where we come in.”
Dempsey also spoke about being named the “sexiest man alive” by People magazine in 2023, and called it “quite a shock” at his age.
The actor is known for playing heartthrobs on-screen, and has starred in a string of romantic comedies as the love interest such as Enchanted (2007), Made Of Honor (2008) and more recently, Bridget Jones’ Baby (2016).
Dempsey currently stars in new US crime drama Memory Of A Killer, where he leads a double life as a family man and a hit-man.

Israeli companies grew more when listed in Tel Aviv than on NASDAQ, study reveals

Israeli companies listed on the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange (TASE) outperform their NASDAQ listings, with the “local version” of these shares seeing higher growth in trading volume and total market value than their “US version,” according to a Wednesday report by TASE.
The report points out that one of the main reasons behind this performance difference is centered around the “home factor,” with investors opting to invest in the company's local markets rather than overseas, even if it means choosing the TASE over NASDAQ, Yuval Tsuk, an economist working at TASE’s research unit, explained.
This is evident in the numbers: TASE stocks saw a 68% increase in trading volume, while the same shares on the NASDAQ averaged a 55% increase, according to TASE data.
This can also apply to local investors, who prefer investing in the local market over a foreign one, mainly because of conversion costs and more convenient trading hours.
In 2025, dual-listed companies accounted for 22% of the TASE's total market cap, totaling $114 billion. Among the highest-valued were Teva, Elbit Systems, and Tower, which had a combined market cap of $76 billion.
This margin became even higher in February, when Palo Alto Networks ($115 billion) announced it would list on the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange (TASE) as part of its acquisition of the Israeli cybersecurity platform CyberArk.
The report also noted that ten dual-listed companies achieved share yields exceeding the TA-125 index's 51% yield, indicating they outperformed the Israeli market as a whole.
The leading companies from this list were Lineage Cell Therapeutics with an annual yield of 175.8%, Enlight Energy with an annual yield of 129.6%, and Kenon Holding with an annual yield of 101.2%.
TASE’s new trading week brings Wall Street capital to Israel
A factor that didn’t affect the 2025 metrics but could apply to the first month of 2026 is the trading-day shift the TASE implemented since January.
The market shifted from a Sunday-to-Thursday schedule, aligned with the traditional Israeli workweek, to a Monday-to-Friday schedule, which aligns with most international markets.
With this, TASE managed to attract international investors, especially on Fridays, with that day seeing a doubling of foreign investor involvement compared with Sunday’s metrics in 2025.
”Furthermore, higher trading activity was recorded on Fridays across the entire Israeli equity market relative to the average Sunday trading volumes in 2025,” Tsuk explained in the analysis.

As the US eyes Iran showdown, how far should it go?

As the final pieces of the US military buildup all fall into place in the Middle East, it appears increasingly clear that, from a purely military standpoint, Iran is not a rival capable of genuinely challenging the US. That said, Tehran should not be underestimated. As demonstrated in limited confrontations in the past, particularly in the missile front, Iran possesses significant asymmetric capabilities: a substantial ballistic arsenal and a broad network of regional proxies.
Yet even before addressing the tactical questions of how an attack would be carried out, it is essential to define its objectives realistically. What strategic shift could military action against the Islamic Republic of Iran achieve? To answer that, it is necessary to examine the main courses of action reportedly under consideration by President Donald Trump and his administration.
A campaign to change the regime
According to reports, the US military has prepared for "weeks" of sustained operations against Iran, suggesting that the administration may be seriously weighing a move aimed at deep political change. Such a goal is inherently difficult to achieve, certainly by military force alone. Senior US officials have publicly distanced themselves from it. Vice President JD Vance, for example, has said that such a mission is "up to the Iranian people" if they choose to pursue it.
There are significant obstacles. Iran does not have a unified and capable opposition ready to step in and fill a vacuum. At the very least, none has emerged publicly, and any early signs may have been suppressed in recent protests, including political arrests targeting reformist figures within the regime's own support base. Moreover, achieving regime change would almost certainly require ground forces and a prolonged effort, a scenario with little appetite among the American public and political establishment, still mindful of the bloody decades in Iraq and Afghanistan.
Destabilizing the regime from within
The current tensions began amid a wave of protests against the Iranian regime. One possible rationale for military action, therefore, would be to intensify internal pressure in a way that weakens the leadership and brings its opponents closer to a tipping point.
This option also faces serious challenges. The Iranian leadership, particularly the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, has no escape plan comparable to the one that stood before former Syrian President Bashar Assad or other dictators. That means it is likely to respond to any internal unrest with maximum force, as seen recently in the killing of thousands of protesters in January.
Even if such pressure were to succeed, the most probable outcome would not necessarily be a transition to democracy but rather internal chaos that could push Iran toward civil war, with severe regional and global repercussions. If Washington were to pursue this path, it would need a coherent plan to move quickly from chaos to stability in order to safeguard its own interests and those of its allies in the region.
Striking nuclear facilities
Administration officials have repeatedly stressed that the overriding objective is to prevent the ayatollah regime from obtaining nuclear weapons. One possibility, therefore, is that any attack, similar to the one carried out in June, would focus on nuclear infrastructure and sites, to the extent that they remain intact or have been restored since the 12-day war.
Here, too, a fundamental problem emerges. Airstrikes cannot erase scientific knowledge or human capital, and no one can guarantee that all stockpiles of enriched uranium accumulated by Iran over the years can be located and destroyed. As seen after the June war and in satellite imagery circulating since, if Tehran survives such an assault, it may move to rebuild the project with greater determination and fewer self-imposed restraints born of its reluctance to trigger open military confrontation.
Destroying Iran's missile project
Iran's missile force is the central pillar of its retaliatory and defensive capabilities. The Islamic Republic has invested its best resources on this front, viewing it as the backbone of deterrence against conventionally superior militaries. A broad campaign could severely damage missile stockpiles and production infrastructure, removing, at least temporarily, this significant threat.
But even after heavy losses, Tehran would likely prioritize the rapid restoration of these capabilities. The result could be only a temporary setback rather than permanent elimination. The difficulty of dismantling a ballistic project has also been demonstrated in Israeli and US operations against the Houthis, whose capabilities are deeply rooted in Iranian support.
Forcing negotiations on favorable terms
Trump's preferred option may not be war but a deal. The president has expressed this repeatedly, and the direct talks held in recent weeks between Washington and Tehran suggest that this channel remains open. The logic is that sufficient military pressure would compel Tehran to accept more favorable terms than those it previously rejected.
Past confrontations indicate that Iran's leadership may choose to absorb a blow rather than capitulate, which it views as an existential danger in light of internal pressure. The regime could calculate that time is on its side and that as a conflict drags on, political pressure on Washington to wind it down will intensify, as occurred in the campaign against the Iran-backed Houthis that Trump launched and ended within months without tangible gains.
Eliminating Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei
Ali Khamenei is indeed the central figure in Iran's ruling system. To some extent, his steadfast refusal to accept certain conditions in negotiations with the US can be seen as a key catalyst behind the erosion of stability within the ayatollah regime.
Yet so-called decapitation strikes often produce unpredictable results. Iran's political system is institutional, not solely personal. There is no guarantee that removing Khamenei would moderate Iranian policy; it could just as easily radicalize it. Such a move could trigger a fierce response from Iran and its regional proxies, given the senior ayatollah's religious stature, and draw the US into a far broader confrontation than originally intended.
America's military superiority in a direct clash is not in doubt. But military superiority does not automatically translate into strategic advantage, and that is precisely the dilemma. For the first time in decades, the US faces the prospect of direct war with a state actor rather than a proxy conflict. That demands leaders who define in advance what they are seeking to achieve.
Of all the options outlined above, none is simple, and each carries consequences that Washington may not be fully prepared to manage. Before embarking on any course of action, decision-makers must answer one fundamental question: What does success look like, and at what price?

Israeli settler kills Palestinian-American teen in West Bank, local health ministry says

A 19-year-old Palestinian-American citizen shot by an Israeli settler in the West Bank has died from his wounds, the Palestinian Health Ministry said late on Wednesday.
A US embassy official condemned the violence, telling Reuters on Thursday: "The US Department of State has no higher priority than the safety and security of US citizens overseas."
Nasrallah Mohammed Jamal Abu Siam was shot on Wednesday in the village of Mukhmas near Ramallah in the occupied West Bank.
A relative of Abu Siam, who did not wish to give his name out of fear of reprisals from Israeli security forces, said that settlers had raided the village to steal sheep.
The relative said that when villagers, including Abu Siam, had tried to prevent the theft, the settlers had begun firing at them, wounding Abu Siam and others.
The attacks injured five people, three of whom suffered bullet wounds, including Abu Siam, the Palestinian Authority's official news agency WAFA said. The agency did not give details on the other injuries.
The Israeli military did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment on the incident.
Settler violence in the West Bank
Violence by Israeli settlers against Palestinians in the West Bank has increased sharply since the beginning of the war in Gaza in October 2023, with nearly 700 people displaced due to settler attacks in 2026, according to UN data.
Nine Palestinians have been killed in the West Bank in 2026, according to UN data, while 240 were killed in 2025. Two Israelis were killed in the West Bank during 2025, according to the data.
Israeli indictments of settler violence are rare. At the end of 2025, Israeli monitoring group Yesh Din said of the hundreds of cases of settler violence it had documented since October 7, 2023, only 2% resulted in indictments.
Several US citizens, including the activist Ayşenur Ezgi Eygi, have been killed by Israeli forces or settlers over the past two years in the West Bank.

Democrats pick Virginia Gov. Spanberger to give State of the Union rebuttal

Virginia Gov. Abigail Spanberger will deliver the Democratic rebuttal to President Donald Trump's State of the Union address next Tuesday, a primetime slot for the newly elected state executive to lay out the Democratic Party's vision ahead of the pivotal 2026 midterm elections.
Spanberger defeated Republican Winsome Earl-Sears by 15 points in last year's elections, flipping the state from Republican to Democratic control. She was previously a member of the House of Representatives from Virginia.
The rebuttal to the State of the Union is a high-stakes opportunity for the party outside of the White House to lay out its vision for the country after the president gives his speech. The stakes are even higher for Democrats this year, who are looking to rip away Trump's complete control of Washington in the midterm elections.
"Virginians and Americans across the country are contending with rising costs, chaos in their communities, and a real fear of what each day might bring," Spanberger said in a statement announcing her speech. "Next week, I look forward to laying out what these Americans expect and deserve — leaders who are working hard to deliver for them."
House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., said in a statement that Spanberger "stands in stark contrast to Donald Trump, who will lie, deflect and blame everyone but himself for his failed presidency on Tuesday evening."
And Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said she will "lay out a clear path forward: lower everyday costs, protect healthcare, and defend the freedoms that define who we are as a nation."
Sen. Elissa Slotkin, D-Mich., gave the rebuttal to Trump's joint session of Congress last year. The last time a governor gave the rebuttal was in 2022 when Republican Iowa Gov. Kim Reynolds spoke following President Joe Biden's State of the Union address.

Dwayne Johnson’s energy drink company could owe you money after $3 million settlement
Customers have until February 20 to file a claim

Thanks to a class action settlement, customers will technically be able to say “The Rock owes me money.”
ZOA Energy, the energy drink brand co-owned by Dwayne Johnson, agreed to a $3 million settlement in a class-action lawsuit that accused the company of deceptive marketing.
Now, American customers may be eligible for cash payouts of up to $150 if they bought a ZOA Energy drink labeled “0 preservatives” for personal use between March 1, 2021, and November 21, 2025, according to the settlement.
The lawsuit against ZOA Energy — which was initially filed in the Northern District of California in October 2023 — claimed that the drinks contained chemical preservatives, specifically citric and ascorbic acids, despite advertising that the products are preservative-free.
Johnson’s brand refused to admit any wrongdoing, but agreed to settle, according to the federal complaint which states: “ZOA denies these allegations and maintains that its labeling and marketing are truthful, accurate, and compliant with applicable law.”
Cash payments are available to customers depending on the number of energy drinks they bought within the window, and whether they have proof of purchase.
People who submit approved claims with receipts can get a payment of up to $150 per household, but those without receipts will be capped at a $10 payment per household.
However, customers must submit a valid claim form by February 20, either electronically or by mail, to receive the free money. Customers must redeem the payments within 180 days or risk losing them.
The final approval hearing for the class action settlement is set for March 26.
“The proposed relief offered to Class Members will be provided only if the Court gives final approval to the Settlement and, if there are any appeals, after the appeals are resolved in favor of the Settlement,” the complaint said.
Johnson launched ZOA Energy in 2021 with his ex-wife Dany Garcia, celebrity personal trainer Dave Rienzi and investor John Shulman. The energy drink is marketed as a “better-for-you” pick-me-up, emphasizing clean energy from plant-based caffeine, electrolytes and zero sugar.
Alcohol giant Molson Coors bought a majority ownership stake of the energy drink brand in 2024, but ZOA Energy still uses Johnson to promote its products in advertisements and on social media platforms.
In another massive payout, Amazon customers can get a refund up to $51 by filing a claim under its $2.5 billion settlement with the Federal Trade Commission by July 23, 2026.

We're ending our live coverage of the arrest and release of Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor, formerly Prince Andrew. Thanks for following along with us.
Here's a summary of the main news regarding Andrew's arrest:
- Mountbatten-Windsor was arrested on suspicion of misconduct in public office for confidential government documents he is alleged to have provided while a British trade envoy to convicted child sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.
- The allegations originate from documents released by the US Department of Justice as part of the so-called Epstein Files
- Mountbatten-Windsor was held in police custody for about 11 hours and released "under investigation," police said.

Likely scenario would be seeing Andrew 'in a criminal court,' royal biographer tells DW
Royal biographer Christopher Wilson spoke to DW about the arrest of ex-Prince Andrew and surmised that authorities would have gathered "a huge body of evidence" beforehand.
"The police, and particularly politicians behind them, would not allow an intrusion of this kind and an arrest to take place unless they're pretty certain that they've got a watertight case against Andrew," Wilson said.
The historian said a likely scenario would be seeing Andrew "in a criminal court."
"I don't think he'll escape. I think he will stay and face the music," Wilson said.
"It will be a sensation. No member of the royal family has been arrested for 600 years, and the last person to do that was King Charles the First, who had his head chopped off once they had actually finished with him in court," Wilson explained.
"I can't see that happening to former Prince Andrew but he certainly faces a bleak future in this year coming," Wilson said.
Trump says former prince's arrest 'very sad'
US President Donald Trump has commented after the arrest of former Prince Andrew's arrest in connection with Jeffrey Epstein scandal.
"I think it's a shame. I think it's very sad. I think it's so bad for the royal family. It's very, very sad," Trump told reporters on Air Force One.
Trump also praised King Charles, saying he "would be coming to our country very soon."
The US president made the comments as he travelled to Georgia for an event.
Andrew leaves police station
The former UK prince, Andrew, has left a police station around 11 hours after being arrested earlier in the day.
Police said he had "been released under investigation."
"We can also confirm that our searches in Norfolk have now concluded," Thames Valley Police said, in reference to the royal Sandringham estate.

Recap — in case you're just joining us
It's been a busy day in the UK with the arrest of King Charles III's younger brother, Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor, amid an investigation into possible misconduct in public office.
The former Duke of York, who turned 66 on Thursday, was taken into custody by police in unmarked cars at his Norfolk residence before noon.
King Charles III later said that "the law must take its course," and repeated a pledge from Buckingham Palace to cooperate with Thames Valley Police if requested.
Andrew had long been plagued by scandal surrounding his association with deceased US financier and sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, but the latest release of files had renewed scrutiny of the man stripped of his royal titles late last year.
Police have not commented in detail on the ongoing investigation but it is thought to be connected to the emails published en masse by the US Deparment of Justice on January 30. Several of these were from or to an addressee labeled either "A" or "the Duke."
Since that publication, an anti-monarchy group in the UK known as Republic said it had filed a formal complaint pertaining to emails which seemed to show Andrew had forwarded information on foreign trips he had made as a UK trade envoy in 2010.
British politicians have not exactly rushed to comment, perhaps in part after police issued an appeal to consider contempt of court risks, but Prime Minister Keir Starmer had said shortly before the news broke that "nobody is above the law."
UK PM Starmer: 'Nobody is above the law'
A few hours before the news of the police investigation broke on Thursday, Prime Minsiter Keir Starmer was asked about Mountbatten-Windsor on the BBC Breakfast television show.
"One of the core principles in our system is that everybody is equal under the law, and nobody is above the law," Starmer, formerly a director of public prosecutions, said. "And it is important that that is applied across the board."

Senior royal arrest unprecedented in modern UK history, but many past parallels exist
An arrest of a senior royal family member has not taken place in the UK for well over a century, making Thursday's developments more or less unique in a modern British law enforcement context.
Nevertheless, the arrest, detention or legal punishment of senior relatives of the kings and queens of England is by no means unprecedented if you look further back into history.
Indeed, these cases tended to involve much higher and more violent stakes than Thursday's. A very abridged selection follows:
- In 1330, King Edward III successfully launched a coup at the age of 17 to seize power from his mother's husband, Roger Mortimer, who had been the de facto ruler since Edward was formally crowned three years earlier. He imprisoned Mortimer and his mother Isabella of France.
- During the 15th century civil war known as the Wars of the Roses, the last Plantaganet king, Richard III is thought to have put his nephews in the Tower of London, from which they never emerged, albeit without ever formally arresting them.
- After the Tudors came to power and deposed Richard, their second king, Henry VIII, would famously imprison and ultimately execute two of his six wives — Anne Boleyn and Katherine Howard.
- Henry's penchant for divorce led to more than a century of intermittent royal and civil conflict surrounding Britain's switch from Catholicism to a form of Protestantism:
- This included the imprisonment of the woman who would become Queen Elizabeth I under her sister Mary I; Elizabeth I jailing and then executing her cousin Mary Queen of Scots; Charles I being publicly beheaded, leading to the only period without an English king or queen in around a millennium; and England's last Catholic king, James II, being deposed in 1688.
Accuser Giuffre's relatives say Andrew 'was never a prince'
The family of deceased Epstein and Andrew accuser Virginia Giuffre issued a statement to CBS News in the US in light of Thursday's developments.
"At last, today, our broken hearts have been lifted at the news that no one is above the law, not even royalty," Giuffre's siblings said in a statement.
"He was never a prince. For survivors everywhere, Virginia did this for you," they wrote.
Giuffre died by suicide last April. Her book was published posthumously later that year, alleging three sexual enconters with Andrew.
Andrew reached an out-of-court settlement with Giuffre in March 2022.
Based on the very limited preliminary information, Andrew's reported arrest on Thursday appears related to suspicion of "misconduct in public office" rather sexual misconduct allegations, which he has denied.

Popular young prince who later fell from grace, partly at hands of Emily Maitlis
Queen Elizabeth II's second son, Andrew, the spare rather than the heir to use the phrase popularized by the Netflix series "The Crown," was rather a popular royal in his younger life.
Gregarious and outgoing, in contrast to his elder brother Charles who faced far greater public pressure and scrutiny, he served for 22 years with the Royal Navy, including combat operations as a helicopter pilot in the Falklands War in 1982.
Fellow "spare" Prince Harry would follow a similar path in Afghanistan a generation later.
Andrew's marriage to Sarah Ferguson, formerly the Duchess of York, became a subject of considerable press attention, as did their 1992 separation and 1996 divorce, not long after Charles' contentious divorce from Princess Diana.
But Andrew's lifestyle and associations with questionable characters including but not limited to Jeffrey Epstein, American financier and convicted sex offender, put him under increasing pressure as time went on.
In 2011, his ties to Epstein, convicted on sex offenses three years earlier, led to his resignation from a role as a trade envoy for the UK.
In 2019, amid even more intense public scrutiny, the prince gave a disastrous interview to the then-BBC journalist Emily Maitlis for the "Newsnight" program. Designed to explain away his connections to Epstein and allegations of sexual misconduct from the late Virginia Giuffre, it backfired.
The claims that prompted scrutiny and skepticism included Andrew saying that he could not possibly have been guilty of an alleged case of misconduct in 2001 because he was at a Pizza Express restaurant in Woking with his children at the time, and him saying that as a result of his military service in the Falklands, he was no longer able to sweat.
He announced he would step back from public engagements as a royal soon after.
Buckingham Palace said last week it would cooperate with police if asked
On Monday, February 9, Buckingham Palace made the unprecedented announcement that it was ready to cooperate in the event of a police inquiry into Mountbatten-Windsor's alleged links to Epstein.
"While the specific claims in question are for Mr. Mountbatten-Windsor to address, if we are approached by Thames Valley Police, we stand ready to support them as you would expect," a statement from the palace said.
UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer said on February 1 that he also thought Andrew should testify in the US. This was a change in stance from earlier comments, where Starmer had only said it was a matter for the former prince.
Congress has been trying to secure testimony from Mountbatten-Windsor for some time. In November, six Democratic members of the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform released a letter addressed to Andrew requesting that he appear.
"Well-documented allegations against you, along with your long-standing friendship with Mr. Epstein, indicate that you may possess knowledge of his activities relevant to our investigation," they wrote.
King Charles: 'The law must take its course'
King Charles III has issued a statement in light of the reports of his younger brother's arrest.
"I have learned with the deepest concern the news about Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor and suspicion of misconduct in public office," Charles said.
"What now follows is the full, fair and proper process by which this issue is investigated in the appropriate manner and by the appropriate authorities."
Charles said that authorities would "have our full and wholehearted support and cooperation" in their investigations, repeating a message first published earlier in the month by Buckingham Palace.
"Let me state clealy: the law must take its course," he said. "As this process continues, it would not be right for me to comment further on this matter. Meanwhile, my family and I will continue in our duty and service to you all."
Andrew stripped of titles, but technically still eighth in line to throne
Charles III's decision, with support of parliament, to strip his younger brother of his prince title and dukedom late last year means he is now known as Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor.
Mountbatten is the original surname of his late father Prince Philip, and the House of Windsor is the UK's current royal house.
Nevertheless, Andrew does remain the line of succession to the British throne, as does Prince Harry, the Duke of Sussex, who retains his titles but stepped down from his position as a senior royal in 2020.
However, the chances of Andrew, once second in line after his elder brother, becoming king are now extremely small. He is eighth in line, after Harry's youngest child Lilibet.
Andrew has always denied any wrongdoing connected to Epstein
The former prince, the late Queen Elizabeth II's second son, has faced various allegations tied to Jeffrey Epstein for several years now.
He had always denied any wrongdoing in this context and said that he regrets their friendship, after several stays on Epstein's island.
Last November, the British royal family said it had begun the "formal" process of stripping the 66-year-old, whose birthday falls on February 19, of his titles and residence.
Among other things, this came amid the launch of a posthumous memoir written by Virginia Giuffre, who described three alleged sexual encounters with the then-prince in her book. She took her own life last April.
The more recent release of Epstein communications included many emails from a man who went by the email ID of either "A" or "The Duke."
The anti-monarchy group Republic reported the former Duke of York to police regarding files they said suggested that he had forwarded reports about official visits to Vietnam, Singapore and other places in 2010.
In the UK, misconduct in public office is what's known as a "common law offense," that is a crime that's been established by a combination of legal precedent and custom, not by a formal act of parliament. Police had previously said that this makes the current investigation particularly complex.
What did Thames Valley Police say about the arrest?
Thames Valley Police issued a press statement soon after reports in the Daily Telegraph, on the BBC and elsewhere of police outside Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor's residence in Norfolk.
"As part of the investigation, we have today [February 19] arrested a man in his sixties from Norfolk on suspicion of misconduct in public office and are carrying out searches at addresses in Berkshire and Norfolk," police wrote.
The man remained in custody, they said.
"We will not be naming the arrested man, as per national guidance. Please also remember that this case is now active so care should be taken with any publication to avoid being in contempt of court."
Police also quoted Assistant Chief Constable Oliver Wright in the written statement.
"Following a thorough assessment, we have now opened an investigation into this allegation of misconduct in public office," Wright said. "It is important that we protect the integrity and objectivity of our investigation as we work with our partners to investigate this alleged offense."
Police said they appreciated the "considerable public interest" in the case and promised further information in due course.

But Andrew's lifestyle and associations with questionable characters including but not limited to Jeffrey Epstein, American financier and convicted sex offender, put him under increasing pressure as time went on.
In 2011, his ties to Epstein, convicted on sex offenses three years earlier, led to his resignation from a role as a trade envoy for the UK.
In 2019, amid even more intense public scrutiny, the prince gave a disastrous interview to the then-BBC journalist Emily Maitlis for the "Newsnight" program. Designed to explain away his connections to Epstein and allegations of sexual misconduct from the late Virginia Giuffre, it backfired.
The claims that prompted scrutiny and skepticism included Andrew saying that he could not possibly have been guilty of an alleged case of misconduct in 2001 because he was at a Pizza Express restaurant in Woking with his children at the time, and him saying that as a result of his military service in the Falklands, he was no longer able to sweat.
He announced he would step back from public engagements as a royal soon after.
Buckingham Palace said last week it would cooperate with police if asked
On Monday, February 9, Buckingham Palace made the unprecedented announcement that it was ready to cooperate in the event of a police inquiry into Mountbatten-Windsor's alleged links to Epstein.
"While the specific claims in question are for Mr. Mountbatten-Windsor to address, if we are approached by Thames Valley Police, we stand ready to support them as you would expect," a statement from the palace said.
UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer said on February 1 that he also thought Andrew should testify in the US. This was a change in stance from earlier comments, where Starmer had only said it was a matter for the former prince.
Congress has been trying to secure testimony from Mountbatten-Windsor for some time. In November, six Democratic members of the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform released a letter addressed to Andrew requesting that he appear.
"Well-documented allegations against you, along with your long-standing friendship with Mr. Epstein, indicate that you may possess knowledge of his activities relevant to our investigation," they wrote.
King Charles: 'The law must take its course'
King Charles III has issued a statement in light of the reports of his younger brother's arrest.
"I have learned with the deepest concern the news about Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor and suspicion of misconduct in public office," Charles said.
"What now follows is the full, fair and proper process by which this issue is investigated in the appropriate manner and by the appropriate authorities."
Charles said that authorities would "have our full and wholehearted support and cooperation" in their investigations, repeating a message first published earlier in the month by Buckingham Palace.
"Let me state clealy: the law must take its course," he said. "As this process continues, it would not be right for me to comment further on this matter. Meanwhile, my family and I will continue in our duty and service to you all."
Andrew stripped of titles, but technically still eighth in line to throne
Charles III's decision, with support of parliament, to strip his younger brother of his prince title and dukedom late last year means he is now known as Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor.
Mountbatten is the original surname of his late father Prince Philip, and the House of Windsor is the UK's current royal house.
Nevertheless, Andrew does remain the line of succession to the British throne, as does Prince Harry, the Duke of Sussex, who retains his titles but stepped down from his position as a senior royal in 2020.
However, the chances of Andrew, once second in line after his elder brother, becoming king are now extremely small. He is eighth in line, after Harry's youngest child Lilibet.
Andrew has always denied any wrongdoing connected to Epstein
The former prince, the late Queen Elizabeth II's second son, has faced various allegations tied to Jeffrey Epstein for several years now.
He had always denied any wrongdoing in this context and said that he regrets their friendship, after several stays on Epstein's island.
Last November, the British royal family said it had begun the "formal" process of stripping the 66-year-old, whose birthday falls on February 19, of his titles and residence.
Among other things, this came amid the launch of a posthumous memoir written by Virginia Giuffre, who described three alleged sexual encounters with the then-prince in her book. She took her own life last April.
The more recent release of Epstein communications included many emails from a man who went by the email ID of either "A" or "The Duke."
The anti-monarchy group Republic reported the former Duke of York to police regarding files they said suggested that he had forwarded reports about official visits to Vietnam, Singapore and other places in 2010.
In the UK, misconduct in public office is what's known as a "common law offense," that is a crime that's been established by a combination of legal precedent and custom, not by a formal act of parliament. Police had previously said that this makes the current investigation particularly complex.
What did Thames Valley Police say about the arrest?
Thames Valley Police issued a press statement soon after reports in the Daily Telegraph, on the BBC and elsewhere of police outside Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor's residence in Norfolk.
"As part of the investigation, we have today [February 19] arrested a man in his sixties from Norfolk on suspicion of misconduct in public office and are carrying out searches at addresses in Berkshire and Norfolk," police wrote.
The man remained in custody, they said.
"We will not be naming the arrested man, as per national guidance. Please also remember that this case is now active so care should be taken with any publication to avoid being in contempt of court."
Police also quoted Assistant Chief Constable Oliver Wright in the written statement.
"Following a thorough assessment, we have now opened an investigation into this allegation of misconduct in public office," Wright said. "It is important that we protect the integrity and objectivity of our investigation as we work with our partners to investigate this alleged offense."
Police said they appreciated the "considerable public interest" in the case and promised further information in due course.

Starmer said unwilling to grant US permission to use UK military bases for Iran strike

Starmer said unwilling to grant US permission to use UK military bases for Iran strike
British PM reportedly worried about violations of international law, likely prompting Trump’s public about-face on UK plan to hand over sovereignty of key Diego Garcia base
The UK is reportedly refusing to grant permission to the US to use British military bases for a potential strike on Iran.
According to a Thursday report in The Times, US President Donald Trump’s public withdrawal of support for UK plans to give up sovereignty over the Chagos Islands in the Indian Ocean — which includes the key Diego Garcia airfield — stems from the British refusal.
The British newspaper reported that US plans for a potential Iran strike included the use of Diego Garcia and the RAF Fairford base in England, both of which can only be used in any aerial campaign if the UK government agrees.
British Prime Minister Keir Starmer is said to be concerned that the Iran strike might violate international law.
On Wednesday night, Trump wrote on Truth Social that Diego Garcia might be needed were Iran not to agree to a deal, “in order to eradicate a potential attack by a highly unstable and dangerous regime — an attack that would potentially be made on the United Kingdom, as well as other friendly countries.”
“Prime Minister Starmer should not lose control, for any reason, of Diego Garcia,” Trump stressed in the post, lambasting the British leader for considering letting go of the islands.
Britain had kept control of the Chagos Islands after Mauritius gained independence in the 1960s from British colonization. Britain evicted thousands of people, who have since mounted legal challenges for compensation. Trump said the claims by people from the Chagos Islands were “fictitious in nature.”
Under a 2025 agreement, Britain will transfer sovereignty of the Chagos Islands to Mauritius while retaining control of the strategically important Diego Garcia base under a 99-year lease.
“DO NOT GIVE AWAY DIEGO GARCIA!” Trump wrote. “I have been telling Prime Minister Keir Starmer, of the United Kingdom, that Leases are no good when it comes to Countries, and that he is making a big mistake by entering a 100 Year Lease with whoever it is that is ‘claiming’ Right, Title, and Interest to Diego Garcia.”
“This land should not be taken away from the U.K. and, if it is allowed to be, it will be a blight on our Great Ally,” he wrote, adding: “We will always be ready, willing, and able to fight for the U.K., but they have to remain strong in the face of Wokeism, and other problems put before them.”
Responding to Trump’s remarks, a British foreign office spokesperson said the deal was “crucial to the security of the UK and our key allies.”
“The agreement we have reached is the only way to guarantee the long-term future of this vital military base,” the statement added.
Trump’s comments mark the latest in an Anglo-American diplomatic rollercoaster over the deal.
Britain has said it had no choice but to make a deal after international court decisions threatened its ability to maintain the base under previous arrangements.
Washington last year gave its blessing to the agreement, but in January, Trump described it as an act of “great stupidity.” Earlier this month, he then said he understood the deal was the best Starmer could make, but added he would retain the right to “militarily secure” the base if needed.
On Tuesday, before Trump’s post, the US State Department had issued a statement which stated its backing for the deal.
“The United States supports the decision of the United Kingdom to proceed with its agreement with Mauritius concerning the Chagos archipelago,” the statement said, announcing talks between the US and Mauritius next week.

Winter Olympics recap: Alysa Liu wins figure skating gold, US tops Canada in women’s hockey final
Winter Olympics recap: Alysa Liu wins figure skating gold, US tops Canada in women’s hockey final
MILAN (AP) — On a night of American comebacks at the Milan Cortina Games, Alysa Liu delivered the U.S. its first women’s figure skating Olympic gold medal in 24 years.
The 20-year-old Liu performed a near-flawless free skate Thursday to upstage Japanese rivals Kaori Sakamoto and Ami Nakai. She finished with a career-best 226.79 points. Nakai and Sakamoto each made a mistake on a combination sequence.
Liu had walked away from the sport after the 2022 Beijing Games only to launch a remarkable comeback.
It was the first individual gold medal for an American woman figure skater since 2002, when Sarah Hughes won in Salt Lake City, and it was the second gold for Liu at these Games. She helped the Americans win team gold.
Sakamoto scored 224.90 points to earn a silver. Nakai finished third with 219.16 points.
Liu was third after the short program two nights earlier, though within range of gold.
US beats Canada in OT for women’s hockey gold
The U.S. women’s hockey team delivered an Olympic comeback for the ages by beating Canada 2-1 in overtime to win the gold medal.
With her team trailing 1-0, American captain Hilary Knight forced overtime by tipping in Laila Edwards’ shot with 2:04 remaining in regulation.
Megan Keller then scored 4:07 into overtime to hand the U.S. its third Olympic gold medal in women’s hockey.
It was the seventh time the two powerhouses faced off for Olympic gold since women’s hockey debuted at the 1998 Nagano Games. In the 2022 Beijing final, Canada beat the Americans in the final.
With the sides playing 3-on-3 in overtime, Keller broke up the left wing and pushed past Claire Thompson. Driving to the net, Keller got off a backhander that beat Ann-Renee Desbiens.
Kristin O’Neill scored a short-handed goal for Canada in the second period.
Earlier Thursday, Alina Muller scored the bronze medal-winning goal in overtime in Switzerland’s 2-1 victory over Sweden. It came 12 years after Muller scored the clinching goal to deliver the Swiss their first Olympic medal in women’s hockey — a bronze at the 2014 Sochi Games.
Jordan Stolz stunned in 1,500 meters
U.S. speedskater Jordan Stolz’s late push wasn’t enough.
The American star settled for silver in the 1,500 meters, missing a chance to secure a third gold medal at the Milan Cortina Games.
China’s Ning Zhongyan won Thursday’s race in an Olympic-record time of 1 minute, 41.98 seconds. The 21-year-old Stolz, who won gold medals in the 500 and 1,000 at these Games, crossed 0.77 seconds later.
As Stolz glided by, hands on his knees, Ning raised his country’s flag aloft with both hands and started a victory lap.
Stolz, a Wisconsin native, will participate in the mass start on Saturday.
Dutch skater Kjeld Nuis, who won the 1,500 at the past two Olympics, took bronze.
Eileen Gu advances to halfpipe final despite fall
Defending Olympic champion Eileen Gu shook off a fall during her opening run to advance to Saturday’s final in freeski halfpipe. The 22-year-old Gu was born in the United States and competes for China.
She clipped the lip of the halfpipe on the third trick of her first run, knocking her left ski off and sending her skittering to the bottom of the course.
That set up a pressure-packed second attempt that run earned 86.50 points, good enough to place fifth among the 12 skiers who advanced to the final.
US and Canada reach women’s curling semifinals
The United States and Canada advanced to the women’s curling semifinals.
The Americans, skipped by Tabitha Peterson, beat Switzerland 7-6 in a match that went to an extra end. The teams will square off again in Friday’s semifinals.
Peterson threw the decisive rock and her teammates swept it into position, just a hair closer to the button than the Swiss’ nearest stone.
Canada beat South Korea 10-7 and will play Sweden on Friday.

Kosovo's Catholics and Muslims mark Ash Wednesday and Ramadan in one week
Kosovo’s religious diversity came to light this week as the Balkan nation’s Christian and Muslim communities both embarked on a traditional period of fasting and spiritual reflection
- Bookmark
Kosovo 's religious diversity came to light this week as the Balkan nation's Christian and Muslim communities both embarked on a traditional period of fasting and spiritual reflection.
This year marks a rare occasion when the start of the Muslim holy month of Ramadan and the Catholics' Ash Wednesday coincided, encouraging tolerance and understanding between different religions.
Kosovo, a young nation of 2 million people, is more than 90% Muslim and is still reeling from a war in 1998-99 it waged for independence from predominantly Orthodox Christian Serbia. Kosovo's ethnic Albanian authorities have pledged to promote religious and ethnic tolerance following the conflict that killed 13,000 people.
On Wednesday evening, Catholics in Kosovo's capital Pristina gathered at the city's Mother Teresa Cathedral where worshippers had their forehead marked with ashes in a symbol of repentance for sins and humility.
To Catholics, the day marks the start of the 40-day Lent period of penance, solemn reflection and fasting before Easter. The Islamic holy month of Ramadan, similarly marking a period of increased worship before the holiday of Eid al-Fitr, started in Kosovo on Thursday.
“It is a special opportunity that this year we have Lent and Ramadan together," said Dode Palukaj, a Catholic. “What unites us is fasting, shared prayer, solidarity and love.”
Ash Wednesday and the start of Ramadan coincide approximately every 30 years or so. Ramadan is the ninth month of the Islamic lunar calendar; the start of the month traditionally depends on the sighting of the crescent moon and may vary among countries.
Don Agim Qerkini, the Catholic priest in Pristina, praised religious tolerance in Kosovo over centuries, noting that divisions that still plague Kosovo have been stemming from national rather than religious differences.
“Faith is what enriched us for many centuries,“ he said. "It is a reality we are proud of, precisely because our history, as we all know, has faced many different hardships,"
Serbia still refuses to recognize Kosovo's 2008 declaration of independence and the dispute between the two has been a source of continuous tension in the volatile Balkans.
Varis Hashimi, a Muslim from the southern historically multi-ethnic town of Prizren, has made it his mission to keep alive a tradition dating back to the centuries of Ottoman rule in Kosovo.
For the entire month of Ramadan, Hashimi walks every day to a medieval fortress above Prizren to light fireworks and thus signal the end of the daily fast. In the Ramadan tradition, families then get together for the evening meal.
Locals say this was done with a cannon in the past. Nowadays, Hashimi rushed uphill at sunset on Thursday to light his first fireworks this year into the sky.
“The idea is to revive an old tradition," he said.
Down the hill, Prizren's mosques echoed with Iftar, sounding the end of the daily fast as the town's restaurants opened their doors for hungry visitors.

Thanks for reading the national news blog. This is where we’ll end today’s coverage.
To conclude, here’s a look back at the day’s major stories:
- Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor – formerly Prince Andrew – was arrested last night over suspicion of misconduct while in public office. He was held in police custody for 11 hours, years after the revelations of his ties to sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, and the publication of the notorious photograph showing him with his hand on the waist of Virginia Roberts Giuffre, who accused him of sexual assault. He is yet to be charged.
- Australian politicians reacted to the historic arrest, with Prime Minister Anthony Albanese describing it as an “extraordinary fall from grace”, and Opposition Leader Angus Taylor saying, “He needs to stand before law enforcement and the courts in the UK, and that’s absolutely appropriate.”
- The Australian Federal Police say they have “received reports of a crime” related to One Nation leader Pauline Hanson’s anti-Muslim comments earlier this week.
- Senior Labor minister Tanya Plibersek delivered some of the strongest criticism yet of the women who took their children to the Middle East during the rise of Islamic State, accusing them of “child abuse”.
- And, in further world news, US President Donald Trump says he will likely decide whether to launch strikes against Iran in the next 10 days, as he continues the biggest American military build-up in the Middle East since the invasion of Iraq in 2003.
- Epstein’s estate and its two co-executors have agreed to pay as much as $US35 million ($50 million) to resolve outstanding legal claims of his victims who haven’t already reached settlements.
Thanks again for joining us. This is Cassandra Morgan, signing off.

BRUSSELS ― The EU is planning to spend as much as €16 million over the next four years to fly its top officials by private jet, according to a tender document.
This is an increase of €3 million from the previous four-year period and is 50 percent higher than the period before that, which ended in 2021.
"In a time where ordinary people can't afford traveling during their summer holidays, this sends a very weird signal," said Green MEP Rasmus Andresen. It's "embarrassing," and "doesn't fit" the EU's climate goals.

Kenyan families demand return of loved ones recruited into Russian army
Official intelligence report revealed that more than 1,000 citizens had been lured to fight for Russia in Ukraine.
Families of Kenyans allegedly tricked into fighting for Russia in Ukraine are demanding their return as an official intelligence report revealed that more than 1,000 citizens had been lured onto the front line.
Dozens of families protested in Nairobi on Thursday to demand the government take action, one day after the country’s National Intelligence Service unveiled a report on the scam, which allegedly involved a network of rogue state officials colluding with trafficking syndicates to dupe locals.

Winnie Rose Wambui said she hoped to get information about her brother, Samuel Maina, who went to Russia believing he had a job as a security guard at a mall. She last heard from him in October when he sent a “distress voice note” from a forest, she told news agency AFP.
Parliament Majority Leader Kimani Ichung’wah presented the intelligence report to the Parliament of Kenya on Wednesday, saying that more than 1,000 Kenyans had been recruited “to fight in the Russia-Ukraine war”, with 89 currently on the front line, 39 hospitalised and 28 missing in action.
The families plan to present petitions to several government offices, including the Foreign Ministry, and to the Russian embassy, according to their coordinator Peter Kamau, whose brother, Gerald Gitau, is missing.
“The Ministry of Foreign Affairs is not helping us,” said Wambui at Thursday’s protests, which called for the return of 35 recruits. “They told us if we have questions, we have go to the Kenyan embassy in Moscow.”
The Russian embassy in Kenya posted a statement on X, saying the government had “never engaged in illegal recruitment of Kenyan citizens in the Armed Forces”, dubbing the allegations a “dangerous and misleading propaganda campaign”.
However, the statement added: “the Russian Federation does not preclude citizens of foreign countries from voluntarily enlisting in the armed forces”.
Lured with job promises
Reports of African men being lured into Russia with promises of jobs as bodyguards and ending up on Ukraine’s front line have become more frequent in recent months.
The number of Kenyan recruits is far higher than the figure of “around 200” given by authorities in December.
The intelligence report said recruitment agencies colluded with rogue Kenyan airport staff, immigration and other state officials, and with staff at the Russian embassy in Nairobi and at the Kenyan embassy in Moscow to facilitate travel.
Those enlisted initially left Kenya on tourist visas and travelled to Russia via Turkiye or the United Arab Emirates. The recruits started travelling via Uganda, South Africa and the Democratic Republic of Congo after Kenya tightened surveillance at Nairobi airport.
While some were ex-soldiers leaving to become mercenaries, many were said to have been tricked by recruitment agencies targeting former soldiers, police officers and the unemployed with promises of monthly earnings of some 350,000 shillings ($2,715), along with bonuses of up to 1.2 million shillings ($9,309).
Kenya’s Foreign Ministry said last week that 27 Kenyans had been rescued after being stranded in Russia.
Kenya’s Foreign Minister Musalia Mudavadi has said he plans to visit Russia next month for talks on the issue.

Zelensky on peace talks: Further steps will be determined at Friday meeting
He announced this in his nightly video address, Ukrinform reports.
"Today all members of our negotiating group will already be in Ukraine, and for tomorrow I have scheduled a special meeting with them regarding our next steps and decisions. There will be a report here in Kyiv on those aspects of the negotiations that should not be discussed over the phone. We will also define the further framework of talks with our partners – the American side, the Europeans – and with the Russian side," he said.
According to Zelensky, it is important that Europeans were present at the recent negotiations in Switzerland, as Europe's positions must also be taken into account.
Zelensky thanked members of the Ukrainian delegation for strictly adhering to their directives during the talks.
Following negotiations in Geneva, Zelensky stated that there had been progress on military issues, namely monitoring a ceasefire, while on political matters – territories, the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant, and other sensitive issues – the positions of the parties remain different.

Macron tells Meloni to stay out of France's affairs after activist remark

A French prosecutor on Thursday requested homicide charges against seven individuals accused in the fatal beating of a far-right activist, a case that has sparked political outrage beyond France’s borders.
The tensions escalated to the point that President Emmanuel Macron urged Italy's Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni to keep out of French domestic matters.
Quentin Deranque, 23, died from head injuries after being attacked by at least six people on the sidelines of a far-right protest in Lyon on Feb. 12. Most of the 11 suspects who had been detained are from far-left movements.
Prosecutor Thierry Dran told a press conference he had requested "intentional homicide" charges against seven men and recommended they remain in custody to avoid any "disturbance to public order."
The killing has fuelled political tensions ahead of municipal elections in March and France's 2027 presidential race, in which the far-right National Rally (RN) party is seen as having its best chance yet at winning the top job.
On Wednesday, Italy's far-right leader Meloni said the killing of Deranque was "a wound for all of Europe."
Macron said there was no place in France "for movements that adopt and legitimise violence" and called on all political parties to "clean up" their act.
"Nothing can justify violent action – neither on one side nor the other, and not even in a head-to-head confrontation that is deadly for the republic."
Macron also suggested that everyone must "stay in their own lane," after Meloni lamented "a climate of ideological hatred."
"I'm always struck by the fact that people who are nationalists – who don't want anyone bothering them at home – are always the first to comment on what's happening elsewhere," Macron said, while on a visit to New Delhi.
Italy's foreign minister hit back, saying the killing of the French activist "is a serious matter that concerns us all."
Antonio Tajani said on the social media platform X there had been similar incidents in Italy's history, and that condemning such violence aims "to ensure that we do not return to a terrible past."
He said "there have been many Quentins in Italy, some during the darkest periods of the Republic."
Macron is "closely monitoring" events, a member of his team said on Thursday. "We must avoid any spiral of violence."
Eleven people – eight men and three women – were taken into custody over the killing.
Lyon prosecutor Dran said that of the seven men who could be charged with homicide, two have refused to speak while in custody.
Others have acknowledged being at the scene and "some admit to having struck blows," but he added, they all dispute having had any homicidal intent.
Four suspects have been released, but more are being sought, Dran said.
Among those originally detained are two parliamentary assistants to Raphael Arnault, a member of parliament from the hard-left France Unbowed (LFI) party, as well as a former intern.
A lawyer for Deranque's parents said they called "for calm and restraint."
"The family condemns any call for violence. Any form of political violence," Fabien Rajon told broadcaster RTL.
In snap parliamentary polls in 2024, Macron's supporters and the left, including the hard-left, joined forces in an effort to bar the far-right from power.
But following Deranque's killing some high-profile politicians sought to distance themselves from the hard-left, ruling out any possible futue alliance.
Justice Minister Gerald Darmanin called on Arnault to "draw the consequences" if the judiciary "finds serious and consistent evidence concerning him or the aides he hired."
LFI party coordinator Manuel Bompard said that Arnault would "certainly not" be suspended or excluded from the LFI group in the National Assembly lower house.
An anti-immigration collective called Nemesis has blamed the killing of the activist on an anti-fascist youth group called La Jeune Garde (Young Guard) co-founded by Arnault before he was elected to parliament.

DHS Pushes for Detention of Refugees While Cases Are Reviewed

Cyber CEO released to house arrest after shooting 15-year-old

The Central District Court in Lod on Thursday rejected a police appeal and ordered the release to house arrest of the CEO of a cyber company suspected of shooting a 15-year-old boy near Yavne. The suspect had been held in custody for 10 days.
Judge Abbas Assi ruled that the executive would remain under house arrest until Feb. 24. “The wall of silence is deafening,” police said in response to the decision.
The shooting occurred last week in Moshav Ben Zakai in central Israel. According to an initial investigation, residents suspected the teenager and his friends of attempting to break into a building. A confrontation developed, during which the cyber company CEO — who serves in a local civilian emergency response squad — was stabbed and sustained very light injuries.
Police allege that in response, he drew his weapon and shot the teenager. The boy’s friends drove him toward a gas station at the southern exit of Yavne. The teen himself called police and reported that he had been shot in the abdomen.
The CEO is suspected of discharging a weapon in a built-up area and obstructing an investigation.
His attorneys, Gilad Baum and Hedva Baum, said their client is “a salt-of-the-earth Israeli” whom police are portraying as a criminal. They described him as a commander in the local emergency squad with no criminal record, a police volunteer, a firearms instructor and a holder of high-level security clearance.
“He responded to a WhatsApp alert from the moshav about three masked individuals entering,” his lawyers said. “From his perspective, he arrived at what he believed was a terrorist incident. During the event he was stabbed in the thigh. He is in severe emotional distress.”
They added that even after days of investigation, police have not fully clarified what happened. “He left his home as a member of the emergency squad believing there was a terrorist infiltration. He was stabbed in the leg, and the single shot may have been accidental discharge — possibly self-defense.”
During the hearing, Gilad Baum said: “A salt-of-the-earth Israeli goes out as part of an emergency squad established by police to defend the moshav. From his perspective this was a terrorist incident. Let us not forget we are after Oct. 7. He finds himself entangled, and police are acting as if they caught a criminal.”
Judge Assi, after reviewing investigative materials from the Shfela District police unit, appeared to question the sequence of events. According to statements made in court, investigators are still uncertain who stabbed the emergency squad member — an injury that allegedly led to the shooting.
A police representative argued there was concern the suspect could obstruct the investigation if released. He said that despite multiple opportunities, the emergency squad member did not report the incident to the police emergency hotline.
“Everything points to a wall of silence between him and others in the moshav,” the police representative said. “He did not activate the emergency squad. Everything happened in the dark. There is a public interest in getting to the truth.”
A resident of the moshav defended the suspect, saying, “They are treating him like the worst of criminals. We are ashamed of what was done to him. Suddenly masked men who arrive in a moshav at midnight become teenagers who came to spray graffiti. It hurts us. He is an amazing person. On his own initiative he would guard outside the synagogue to give us a sense of security. Let it be known that anyone who holds a weapon as part of an emergency squad could get into trouble and be left alone.”
The court imposed a gag order on the CEO’s identity, citing his security-related occupation.

Taylor walks a tightrope on immigration policy as Hanson surges

Can Angus Taylor get beyond slogans to craft a sound immigration policy?
This week, we pressed the rewind button on the Pauline tape, back to Hanson maxing out with inflammatory statements about Muslims, attracting a blaze of publicity and widespread outrage.
Or, given One Nation's surging polls, have we pushed the fast-forward button to when Hanson's party joins the big league? The March 21 South Australian election, followed by the Farrer by-election for Sussan Ley's seat, will provide clues.
Hanson told Sky on Monday, "I've got no time for the radical Islam. Their religion concerns me because of what it says in the Koran. They hate Westerners, and that's what it's all about. You say, 'Oh well, there's good Muslims out there.' I'm sorry, how can you tell me there are good Muslims?"
She subsequently only partially qualified her blanket condemnation of Muslims.
Her extreme comments left Barnaby Joyce, her new recruit, uncomfortable. They also brought notable pushback from prominent Nationals senator Matt Canavan.
The Liberals and Nationals will be going head-to-head against One Nation in Farrer. They will need to take it on robustly.
Hanson is exploiting rifts in Australia's social cohesion while tearing further a fabric in its poorest shape in recent memory. As the Muslim community this week entered Ramadan, with threats made to the Lakemba Mosque, Hanson's outbursts will make the security agencies even more nervous.
The Middle East conflict took a big toll on our cohesion. The Jewish community suffered attacks amid soaring antisemitism, culminating in the horrific Bondi massacre. Incidents against Muslims increased. Demonstrations divided the public. Many Australians are on edge. Tensions have escalated, and tolerance has plummeted.
We see this in the blow-up over the so-called ISIS brides and their children, who want to come to Australia.
The debate isn't new.
It stretches back to the prime ministership of Scott Morrison and the repatriation of a handful of children. Morrison condemned the parents for a "despicable" act in putting them in harm's way, but said "the children can't be held responsible for that".
The Coalition, eyeing voters lost to One Nation, is demanding the brides and their families never get here. When asked about the children, Liberals acknowledge their situation but say it is their parents' fault.
For his part, Anthony Albanese has now toughened his rhetoric, declaring: "My mother would have said if you make your bed, you lie in it."
"Shut the door!" Angus Taylor says, offering to support fresh legislation if necessary. The keep-them-out chorus will play well with many people, especially in the present climate. The women joined terrorists fighting against Australia's interests and values.
Moreover, there are increasing questions about how honest the government has been in what it said and did in reacting to lobbying to get them home. It still has much to answer.
But on the substantive issue, these are Australian citizens and as such are entitled to come to Australia. (Though there are legal provisions for exclusion orders on security advice, and the government has taken that route with one person. There are also some other legal loopholes in relation to granting passports.)
Australia claims the right to demand that countries should take back their citizens when we deport them under our laws. Legislation was passed last year to potentially penalise those who refuse to do so.
Loading...In the same way, Australia should recognise its obligations to accept its own citizens, however much it mightn't want to do so. This goes beyond legality — it is also a moral responsibility.
But, the critics shout, they pose a risk. To a degree, perhaps, including because some of the older children may have been radicalised. But whatever risk there might be is one that could be managed.
The cohort is fewer than three dozen. Women who have broken Australia's law by their actions should be charged when they return; the others, including minors, where necessary, should be monitored by police and ASIO. It's not ideal, but if you admit the moral argument, it's the price we pay.
LoadingIt's against the backdrop of today's hyped-up community feeling that Angus Taylor will craft an immigration policy that he will presumably release ahead of the Farrer by-election.
Devising the policy will be harder than his slick slogan condemning the government's policy — "numbers too high, standards too low" — as he is pulled between good policy and populist politics.
The policy has two dimensions: the size and composition of the intake and the issue of ensuring people accept and fit with Australian "values".
The government already has migration numbers coming down. Net overseas migration was 306,000 in 2024-25, down from 429,000 a year earlier. The budget projected 260,000 in 2025-26. The opposition wants it lower.
But it is tricky when it comes to the details. Cutting the permanent skilled migration intake would be bad for business and the economy — although the points system seems totally out of whack when people get points for characteristics that have nothing to do with their likely economic and social contribution to Australia.
Reducing those on temporary visas is also difficult. The care economy and many businesses rely heavily on these workers. Are there too many students? Perhaps — but universities need their fees: in 2024 they provided more than a quarter of their revenue.
Education is also a huge export industry. What about backpackers? But how would many farmers cope without them? There are multiple stakeholders Taylor's policy will have to consider in slicing numbers.
The "values" side of the policy will be even harder. A draft policy prepared in the Ley office proposed designating regions where terrorist organisations have sustained control, banning people coming from them for a period. Home Affairs and Immigration spokesman Jonno Duniam says this is not part of the policy now being worked on.
Whatever the scope of toughening scrutiny of migrant entry, permanent residency, and citizenship, ensuring people have the right values remains an elusive quest. One of the Bondi shooters came from India and had been here for decades; his son, who faced court this week, was born an Australian. There are no guarantees, and sometimes it's a matter of vigilance.
The values people arrive with are important, but they need constant reinforcement across all parts of society, including through the education and political systems.
As part of this, a lot more political attention should be paid to our multiculturalism which is at risk of a serious unravelling. Multiculturalism requires social licence, and among some Australians, that licence is diminishing before our eyes.

What’s next for Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor’s ex-wife, Sarah Ferguson?

While the spotlight has been on Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor, his arrest has prompted questions about what is next for his ex-wife, Sarah Ferguson.
Ferguson, known by the tabloids as Fergie, married the then prince Andrew in 1986 and was divorced from him 10 years later after an alleged affair with an American financial adviser. It was one of multiple scandals in the 1990s and 2000s involving the former duchess, who was widely considered an embarrassment to the royal family.
Ferguson has stood by Mountbatten-Windsor through waves of allegations produced by his links to Jeffrey Epstein, though she was yet to comment on his arrest on Thursday.
She has previously described him as “amazing” and said they were “the happiest divorced couple in the world”, later rejecting the claims against him and calling his alleged victim Virginia Giuffre a liar.
While Ferguson’s ties to Mountbatten-Windsor have kept her adjacent to the Epstein scandal, it is her own closeness to the convicted sex offender that is threatening to make her persona non grata in the public sphere as more details come to light.
News of the former prince’s arrest came only days after it was revealed that six of Ferguson’s businesses are set to be struck off the register of Companies House, after becoming dormant. It is not clear what each of them did, but one appeared to be a public relations business, while another appeared to be in the retail sector.
Ferguson, whose money problems have been well documented over the years, and who has struggled to be financially independent, exchanged many emails with Epstein, even after he was convicted in 2008 for soliciting prostitution from a minor.
A string of revelations have uncovered Ferguson’s financial ties – even an alleged dependence – on Epstein. The allegations have also opened up questions about the funding of the lifestyles of her daughters, Beatrice and Eugenie, now in their 30s, who were pictured going on lavish holidays during their 20s while working relatively low-paid jobs.
Ferguson has been involved in several scandals that appeared to be attempts to cash in on her royal connections, including two tell-all memoirs, in 1996 and 2011, and in 2010 when she was exposed in a News of the World sting operation attempting to sell access to her former husband in return for £500,000. She told Mazher Mahmood, who was undercover as the “Fake Sheikh”, that she would “open any door you want”, promising him he would get his investment back tenfold.
Later apologising for the scandal, Ferguson said it was “true my finances are under stress”.
The Epstein files, the tranche of documents gathered by US authorities in the investigation into the disgraced financier, have shown some of the extent to which she financially depended on the friendship with him, including evidence he wired Ferguson $150,000 (£104,000) in 2001, which she said was for share options she had earned as an “ambassador” for Weight Watchers, which had gone public earlier that year.
She initially claimed to have cut ties with Epstein as soon as she became aware of the allegations against him in 2006. However, emails contained in the US department of justice files showed she maintained her closeness with him.
“Cannot wait to see you,” she wrote in one email in 2009. Another email between Epstein and his assistant showed he paid $14,080 to fly Ferguson and her two daughters, then 19 and 20, to the US for lunch.
Days later she wrote to him: “Thank you Jeffrey for being the brother I have always wished for.”
The following year, in another email, she wrote: “You are a legend.” Later in the same email, she added: “I am at your service. Just marry me.”
Nine months later, Ferguson publicly apologised for her association with him, saying in an interview with the Evening Standard newspaper: “I abhor paedophilia and any sexual abuse of children and know this was a gigantic error of judgment on my behalf.”
But in private, the former duchess emailed Epstein to “humbly apologise” for denouncing him publicly, calling him “a supreme friend to me and my family”.
Later, when the conversation became public, she told the media she had sent that email to him to “assuage Epstein and his threats”.
When the US government released the first tranche of Epstein files in September last year, a number of charities associated with the then duchess cut ties with her, including the Teenage Cancer Trust and the children’s hospice Julia’s House, both of which she was patron.
The Natasha Allergy Research Foundation issued a statement saying the charity was “disturbed” to read her comments, and also dropped her as a patron.
Nothing uncovered in the files has indicated any criminal activity by Ferguson, who appeared to stop using the duchess title when her ex-husband was stripped of his title, though it may be one scandal too many.

MINSK, February 19. /TASS/. The United States did not issue entry visas to members of the Belarusian delegation to the Board of Peace meeting, despite the fact that Minsk complied with all necessary procedures, the Belarusian foreign ministry said.
According to the ministry, the Belarusian side in due time informed the meeting’s organizers that in accordance with President Alexander Lukashenko’s decision, the country will be represented by Foreign Minister Maxim Ryzhenkov. All necessary formal notifications were sent to the US protocol services as per established procedures. The documents for visas were submitted well in advance. "But despite the fact that we fulfilled all required procedures, our delegation was not issued visas," the ministry said.
"In this situation, we have a logical question: what kind of peace and what kind of consistency are they talking about when the organizers failed to carry out even basic formalities for our participation? And it was US president [Donald Trump] that sent an invitation to take part in the Board of Peace meeting to the Belarusian head of state. Enough said," the ministry added.

Trump outlines global commitments to rebuild Gaza during Board of Peace debut
The gathering in Washington comes as Trump seeks to cultivate a reputation as a peacemaker, even as the US escalates threats against Iran and bolsters its military presence in the region

- CommentsGo to comments
U.S. President Donald Trump convened the inaugural meeting of his Board of Peace on Thursday, announcing that nations had pledged $7 billion towards a Gaza reconstruction fund.
The ambitious initiative aims to rebuild the war-torn enclave, but hinges on the disarmament of Hamas, an objective currently far from realisation. The gathering in Washington comes as Trump seeks to cultivate a reputation as a peacemaker, even as the United States escalates threats against Iran and bolsters its military presence in the region.
The substantial sum for Gaza’s recovery was reportedly contributed by countries including Kazakhstan, Azerbaijan, the United Arab Emirates, Morocco, Bahrain, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Uzbekistan, and Kuwait. Trump also declared that the United States would contribute $10 billion to the Board of Peace, though he did not specify the source of these funds or whether congressional approval would be sought. Further pledges included: $75 million from FIFA for football-related projects in Gaza and $2 billion from the United Nations for humanitarian assistance. These figures, however, fall significantly short of the estimated $70 billion required to rebuild Gaza, which has been devastated by two years of conflict.
The Board’s membership is predominantly comprised of Middle Eastern nations, alongside leaders from outside the region who may be seeking to curry favour with Trump.
Notably, some key Western allies, concerned about the initiative's scope, are absent. While Israel is a member, Palestinian representatives are not included. Trump’s suggestion that the Board’s remit could extend beyond Gaza to address other global "hotspots" has sparked anxiety that it might undermine the United Nations' established role in international diplomacy.
Despite this, Trump asserted, "We're going to strengthen the United Nations," even as the US faces arrears in its payments to the global body. Norway, initially cited by Trump as a host for a Board event, later clarified it was not joining the initiative.
A significant component of the plan involves the deployment of an International Stabilisation Force to Gaza. Trump stated that several nations are preparing to send thousands of troops, with Indonesian President Prabowo Subianto announcing a contribution of up to 8,000 personnel.
This force, led by a US general with an Indonesian deputy, is intended to begin operations in Israeli-controlled areas, starting with Rafah, to train a new police force. The ultimate goal, according to Trump, is to prepare 12,000 police officers and deploy 20,000 troops.
The disarmament of Hamas remains a critical and contentious issue. Trump expressed hope that force would not be necessary, claiming Hamas had promised to disarm and "looks like they're going to be doing that, but we'll have to find out." However, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu issued a stark warning, stating, "Very soon, Hamas will face a dilemma - to disarm peacefully or disarmed forcefully."
In Gaza, Hamas spokesperson Hazem Qassem indicated that any international force must "monitor the ceasefire and prevent the (Israeli) occupation from continuing its aggression," adding that disarmament could be discussed without a direct commitment. Hamas, which has resumed administration of the enclave, claims it is ready to hand over to a US-backed committee of Palestinian technocrats, but alleges Israel has blocked their entry into Gaza.
The Board of Peace meeting unfolded against a backdrop of heightened tensions with Iran. Even as Trump presented himself as a proponent of peace, he maintained a hawkish stance towards Tehran, stating he expected to know within 10 days whether a "meaningful deal" to end the standoff was possible. The event itself reportedly bore the hallmarks of a Trump campaign rally, complete with blaring music from his eclectic playlist and attendees receiving red Trump hats.
U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio underscored the gravity of the situation, stating, "We have to get this right. There is no plan B for Gaza. Plan B is going back to war. No one here wants that." The path forward for the Board of Peace, particularly regarding Hamas disarmament and the broader geopolitical landscape, presents considerable challenges.

Five Key Takeaways From Trump’s First Gaza Board of Peace Meeting
Unknown
Unknown Publisher
2026-02-19
19:32:32 UTC
04:32:32 KST

President Donald Trump convened the inaugural meeting of his newly formed Board of Peace at the United States Institute of Peace headquarters on Thursday, unveiling funding pledges and outlining plans for Gaza’s reconstruction.
Trump first announced the initiative at the World Economic Forum in Davos last month, presenting it as part of Phase Two of his U.N.-endorsed 20-point peace plan for Gaza. He invited dozens of countries to join the board.
But several close U.S. allies have hesitated to participate or refused to do so, amid concerns that the structure could sideline the United Nations. Reports that permanent membership would be granted to countries that contribute $1 billion in cash within the first year have also raised questions about whether authoritarian governments could gain influence within the body.
The meeting brought together Trump, who serves as chairman of the board, Vice President J.D. Vance, Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner, Special Envoy Steve Witkoff, and representatives from participating countries. FIFA President Gianni Infantino was the only attendee not serving in a political role.
Trump opened by praising board members and criticizing allies who have not joined the initiative, accusing them of “playing cute.”
Here are five key takeaways from the meeting.
Trump vowed $10 billion U.S. commitment
Trump announced that the United States would contribute $10 billion to the Board of Peace.
“The Board of Peace is showing how a better future can be built, starting right here in this room,” he said. “I want to let you know that the United States is going to make a contribution of $10 billion to the Board of Peace.”
He did not clarify whether his Administration has formally requested congressional approval for the funds, which would be required.
“We've had great support for that number,” Trump added. “That number is a very small number. When you look at that compared to the cost of war, that's two weeks of fighting, it's a very small number.”
Five nations pledged boots on the ground
General Jasper Jeffers, appointed commander of the planned International Stabilization Force (ISF) for Gaza, said Indonesia, Morocco, Kazakhstan, Kosovo, and Albania have committed troops to the force. Egypt and Jordan, he said, have agreed to train police.
“For the last few months, we've had a team on the ground of U.S. military experts preparing the infrastructure for the ISF,” Jeffers said. “This team is already operating from a combined joint operation center that's going to be the headquarters for the entire ISF.”
He said the force will operate across five sectors, beginning in Rafah. The “midterm objective is to continue to expand sector by sector, all moving to our long term, 12,000 police and 20,000 ISF soldiers,” he said.
Jeffers also confirmed that Indonesia will serve as deputy commander of the ISF.
Nine nations pledged $7 billion in relief
Trump announced that nine countries had pledged a combined $7 billion toward Gaza relief.
“I'm pleased to announce that Kazakhstan, Azerbaijan, UAE, Morocco, Bahrain, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Uzbekistan, and Kuwait have all contributed more than $7 billion toward the relief package,” he said.
The pledges come amid a fragile cease-fire in Gaza following the initial phases of Trump’s 20-point peace plan. According to Gaza’s health ministry, 603 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli strikes since the cease-fire deal brokered by Trump and mediated by Turkey, Qatar, and Egypt came into effect on Oct. 10, 2025.
Trump also said the U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Assistance has agreed to raise an additional $2 billion “for the support of Gaza.” Japan will host fundraising events for the Board of Peace, Trump said, with expected participation from South Korea, the Philippines, Singapore, China, and Russia.
Additionally, “FIFA will be helping to raise a total of $75 million for projects in Gaza,” Trump said.
Board of Peace will be ‘looking over’ U.N., Trump says
Trump suggested the Board of Peace would effectively oversee the United Nations.
“The United Nations is going to be much stronger, and the Board of Peace is going to almost be looking over the United Nations and making sure it runs properly,” he said.
While saying he was “working very closely” with the U.N., Trump added that the organization has not lived up to its “tremendous potential.”
The remarks come as U.N. Secretary-General António Guterres has warned the body faces “imminent financial collapse” unless member states reform funding rules or pay outstanding dues. The U.S. currently owes $2.196 billion to the U.N.’s regular operating budget, including $767 million for this year.
“We're going to strengthen the United Nations. We're going to make sure its facilities are good. They need help, and they need help money wise. We're going to help them money wise,” Trump said, without specifying an amount.
Iran remains a central tension point
Throughout the meeting, Trump repeatedly described Iran as a “threat” to “the stability of the entire region.”
“Now is the time for Iran to join us on a path that will complete what we're doing, and if they join us, that will be great. If they don't join us, that will be great too, but it will be a very different path,” he said. “They cannot continue to threaten the stability of the entire region, and they must make a deal. If that doesn't happen, maybe I can understand, but bad things will happen.”
The warning comes amid mounting speculation about possible U.S. military action against Iran. The U.S. has expanded its military presence in the region. Trump confirmed that the U.S. has ordered 22 additional B-2 stealth bombers, the same aircraft previously used to strike three Iranian nuclear sites.
“We do have some work to do with Iran. They can't have a nuclear weapon. It's very simple,” Trump said. “They can't have peace in the Middle East if they have a nuclear weapon. And they can't have a nuclear weapon. And they've been told that very strongly.”
Trump added that whether a deal is reached, or whether the U.S. will need to “take it a step further,” should become clear “probably over the next 10 days.”
Meanwhile, Rep. Ro Khanna of California said he and Rep. Thomas Massie of Kentucky will seek a vote next week to limit the President’s ability to use force against Iran without congressional approval.“Trump officials say there's a 90% chance of strikes on Iran. He can’t without Congress,” Khanna wrote on social media. A similar effort failed last June, nearly a week after the President ordered strikes against Iranian nuclear facilities without consulting Congress.

Katherine Eddington was driving in North Las Vegas last week when she thought she saw a big black bird carrying a banana fly across the intersection.
But after a closer look, she realized it was a toucan — a tropical bird native to rainforests in Central and South America known for their large, colorful bills.
“They’re beautiful birds, so being able to see something like that so close to home was fascinating,” said Eddington, who recognized the bird from social media and contacted animal rescue.
That toucan is named Sam, and he has been living in the area since November, when a resident posted online that he'd escaped from his cage. After surviving the Las Vegas desert for months, Sam has captivated community birding groups, with people posting occasional sightings around town.
A local rescue group has been trying to catch him for months — and the clock is ticking.
“I’m really worried about him,” said Skye Marsh, president and co-founder of SouthWest Exotic Avian Rescue. The Las Vegas-based group has spent hours searching for him, only to find the bird 50 feet (about 15 meters) up in a palm tree, limiting rescue options. They have not been in touch with the owner, she said.
Las Vegas is not a good environment for a toucan to be in the wild with its too-hot summers and cold winters, said Donald Price, a professor and biologist at the University of Nevada in Las Vegas who studies how winged animal species adapt to different environments.
Marsh, who has two toucans of her own, said Sam is starting to show signs of struggle. His eyes are sunken in, and the skin around his beak is starting to get discolored, she said.
Sam likely lived off figs and pomegranates from trees in the Los Prados neighborhood, located about 15 miles (24 kilometers) from the Las Vegas Strip, when he first escaped in November, Marsh said. Those fruits have since disappeared, and Sam has moved on to citrus, which are harmful to toucans, she said. Their livers cannot process the calcium, and the iron can be deadly.
“This bird is not in good shape,” Marsh said.
Bird experts and enthusiasts alike are surprised the toucan has survived so long in Las Vegas. Exotic birds that escape often have difficulty finding food and avoiding predators, and the changing weather in Las Vegas has also likely taken a toll on the toucan.
Birds can thermal regulate, but only for so long. It takes a lot of energy, so the toucan would need more food, Price said.
“If it’s still alive, it could be in trouble, I can imagine. So hopefully they catch it," he said.
The toucan has been spotted in one specific location, a sign he’s running out of energy, she said. The rescue group set up a cage with food in it and urged neighbors to stop feeding it. The toucan has scoped out the cage but gets spooked when people are around, Marsh said.
The rescue group will rush him to the vet as soon as he's caught, Marsh said. He’ll need fluids, and his system will need to be flushed to remove the iron he’s eaten.
Marsh urged neighbors to not get close to the toucan or try to trap Sam themselves.
“The more people that are out there, the worse it’s going to be because he doesn’t like people,” she said. “So just let us do our thing, and we’ll get him.”

Will this helmet prevent concussions in footballers?

Study to test whether a new helmet will significantly reduce risk of concussion in football players
It's getting toward the pointy end of pre-season for the Brighton Bombers senior women's football squad.
Before training, their strength and conditioning coach, Kelley, takes them through a meticulous warm-up: high knees, grapevine and sprints.
"It's just to prevent injury, mainly," says Lily, 20, who is sweating after the run-throughs.
"One wrong movement can cause a torn muscle or something like that."
It makes sense. An injury can derail any athlete's preparation.
So can a concussion, and repeated concussions can have significant long-term consequences. So what do these players do to protect their heads?
"Nothing, if I'm honest. I've never worn a helmet or anything like that," Bonnie, 19, admits.
"My parents have told me to before because I've had a few head knocks. But look, I just think it's part of the game sometimes, so I don't really do much to prevent it," she says.
A potential solution
"We want to achieve for concussion what seatbelts achieved for road safety."
That's the bold claim made by industrial designer Graeme Attey at the beginning of a promotional video for Australian sportswear company GameGear. In his hands is his latest invention, a helmet specifically designed to reduce an athlete's chance of getting concussion.
"It was actually back in 2012; it was a game of Friday night footy," says Attey, reflecting on the origin of his design.
"Two guys just went head to head and down cold, both of them, and I thought, 'That's it. This is ridiculous,' because I could just see that they don't need to suffer these sorts of injuries.
"If you design a helmet that's specifically made correctly for football, they shouldn't be suffering such severe concussions."
The AFL and NRL's treatment of concussions has shifted dramatically in the past decade. In 2021, the AFL introduced a mandatory minimum 12-day return-to-play period after a player receives a concussion. This was extended in 2024 to a 21-day minimum for community football.
Little focus has been paid to prevention, however.
"It's probably been our biggest frustration all along," Attey says.
"Initially, there was this issue of all the focus and money and everything … going into what do you do after someone's concussed? And we were waving our hands saying, 'But stop the concussions first before you treat them.'"
The result of Attey's frustration is a helmet made-up of a lattice of connecting spheres that, according to independent testing undertaken at the NSW Crash Lab, can reduce the force transmitted to a player's head during impact by more than 90 per cent.
"The reason I wanted to use spheres is because they have a progressive resistance to impact," Attey says.
A concussion is a mild traumatic brain injury that occurs when force is transferred to the brain from a hit to the head or body.
Attey's helmet is designed to reduce the amount of force that is transferred to the brain.
"What causes a concussion is head acceleration. So what you want to do is slow the acceleration of the head because that's what is causing the concussion," he says.
"If you take a circle and then you compress it, when an impact first strikes through the cross-sections of the ball, there's not much resistance initially because it's only sort of the peak of the ball, and then as it squashes down and down, it becomes more and more resistant to the force."
Loading...What does the science say?
Across a range of sports, including Aussie Rules, soccer, rugby union, and a combination of those sports, the science appears settled: helmets are not associated with a reduced risk of concussion.
Attey says there's a reason for this.
"It all started back in 1993 with World Rugby in the UK deciding that they would allow headgear to be worn in rugby games, but it was to protect the ears in a scrum," he says.
These guidelines are still in place, and state that the only injuries that headgear should protect against are cuts and abrasions.
"So it actually stipulates it can't work," Attey says.
He says many helmets on the market have been made to adhere to these specifications, so it's no surprise the science says they do nothing for concussions.
"You hear over and over again in the press, people in the medical field saying helmets have been proven not to work. There's no point in wearing helmets, and yes, it's true, but they were testing helmets that we already knew didn't work," he says.
"So, there should never be a conclusion that because that occurred, therefore, no helmet is ever going to work, because it's just crazy.
"You know, no-one will get anywhere with that sort of attitude."
World-first concussion trial approved
While the GameGear helmets have had promising results in a laboratory setting, the next step is to test them in the field.
Over the next couple of years, scientists from Monash University, with support from non-profit organisation Connectivity Traumatic Brain Injury Australia, will study 600 players aged 16 and over who will wear the helmets during elite and community football and rugby games across the country.
The study will look at real-world exposure data, biomarkers and clinical assessments to help determine whether these helmets significantly reduce a player's risk of getting a concussion.
Adelaide University senior lecturer in exercise science Hunter Bennett is curious to see the results.
"This is actually a really interesting topic of research," Dr Bennett says.
"What we tend to see in laboratory settings is that those helmets really do a good job of preventing or reducing the amount of force that's transferred to the skull, and often to a pretty meaningful degree, or what you would think would be a meaningful degree.
"But then when it comes to research out in the field, we tend to see those helmets maybe not having as large an effect on reducing concussion as what we would expect."
Dr Bennett says hits during a game can be unpredictable, and every individual will have a different threshold for concussion.
"Maybe your force threshold is different to my force threshold. Maybe that force threshold reduces if you experience multiple head knocks in a game," he says.
"So maybe there's sort of an accumulated effect where we receive 10 head knocks in a game, and even though not a single one of them is really large, maybe accumulated, those 10 could result in a concussion occurring.
"There's so many things that occur throughout a duration of a game that just maybe the helmet does prevent some of those contributing factors to concussion, but it just can't impact all of them."
Attey says these variables are why the field trials are vital in determining whether his helmets will be an effective strategy in reducing concussion risk.
"Some guys will get a 100g [g-force] hit and be OK. Another guy will get a 60g hit and go down cold.
"We know the impacts will be reduced hugely out there on the field for any sort of head hit, but we just need to know how much overall, at the end of the day … that [will] reduce concussion."
Should helmets be mandated?
If, at the conclusion of Monash University's study, it is shown that these helmets unequivocally reduce a player's chance of getting a concussion, Attey says they should be a compulsory part of contact sport.
"It should be mandated everywhere if it's proven to reduce concussion because otherwise you can't say you're looking after the health and safety of the players."
Dr Bennett agrees, but with some caveats.
"I think you would have to sort of question if these helmets have a really, really robust effect on concussion," he said.
"You would almost make the sort of assumption that it's almost the duty of care to mandate it.
"But then I'm sure there's also going to be issues around funding, like these helmets aren't cheap.
"Do players take on that cost? Do parents? What if parents can't afford it? Then maybe it becomes an equity issue where only those players who can afford to buy these helmets can participate in the sport, and that's going to have a negative effect from a general health perspective."
No helmet is ever going to completely rule out a player's chance of getting concussion, and we are certainly a long way off any helmet being mandated.
But for some of the players at Brighton, it might be the only way they would wear one.
"I would also look into it because I've had a few knocks as well and a few concussions, but I don't think I would wear it straight away," Sava, 17, says.
"I feel like I'd have to get maybe one more and then be like, maybe?"
"I got concussed in 2021, so then after that, my parents made me wear a helmet for the rest of that season, but I took it off as soon as I could," says Milla, with notable disdain in her voice.
"It was quite embarrassing, I think, to be wearing a helmet as a girl because no-one else was wearing a helmet, and it's just, yeah, wasn't very flattering.
"I feel like if everyone was doing it, I would probably be able to get on board. I wouldn't feel so isolated."

Tom Fletcher: 'Anyone who says the UN is dead should spend some time with my colleagues in Sudan or DRC'

Tom Fletcher is the United Nations under-secretary-general for humanitarian affairs (OCHA). During a visit to Paris, the British diplomat, appointed to the role in 2024, responded to the first meeting of Donald Trump's Board of Peace, held Thursday, February 19, in Washington.
The official mission of the Board of Peace, created by the US president, is to rebuild Gaza. But the board seems, at least in Trump's mind, to have a broader mandate. Is it intended to compete with the UN?
I was in Davos [at the World Economic Forum held from January 19 to 23] a couple of weeks ago when they were convening it, and I talked a lot to the White House about the Board of Peace. In every conversation, they started by reassuring me that this is not an alternative to the UN, it's not a threat to the UN. The UN is 193 countries, it has its charter, it's on a completely different scale. I don't have a problem with different groups of countries coming together to work on peace.
France has refused to participate. Is that a mistake?
I think that's a matter for them, it's a choice for them and I respect the decision. I was with the foreign minister [Jean-Noël Barrot]: He's very focused on international law and international humanitarian law and very strong in his defense of the UN. That is welcome and we need it right now, because the UN is under sustained attack from so many different directions. As a result, we face a crisis of funding but also a crisis of confidence. Even in the Security Council, we have several countries there that have invaded other countries or are talking openly about invading other countries, and are challenging many of the norms on which the UN has been built. So that's a real challenge for us.

Virginia Gov. Abigail Spanberger will deliver the Democratic response to President Donald Trump’s State of the Union address next week.
She was tapped for the rebuttal just months after resoundingly winning an office previously held by a Republican.
The Democratic response will immediately follow Trump’s address to Congress next Tuesday, offering the party’s most high-profile opportunity to deliver a countermessage.
Spanberger, who served three terms in Congress, became Virginia’s first female governor earlier this year.
A former CIA case officer and member of Congress, Spanberger’s November victory made her the state’s 75th governor.
It was a historic first as only men had held the post since Virginia became a commonwealth in 1776, with no woman serving as a colonial governor prior.
She defeated Republican Winsome Earle-Sears, succeeding Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkin.
Spanberger won the race by a double-digit margin, campaigning on affordability and lowering costs for families.

Gaza administration committee opens applications to form new police force
Committee says planned force will be built on accountability, transparency and rule of law as it calls on qualified Palestinians to apply
By Hosni Nedim
ISTANBUL (AA) – The National Committee for the Administration of Gaza (NCAG) announced Thursday that it has opened applications to establish a new Palestinian police force in the Gaza Strip.
In a statement published on its website, the committee invited “qualified and committed individuals” to submit applications to serve the community and strengthen public security.
It said it aims to recruit Palestinian men and women with “high professional competence and a commitment to maintaining order and stability, supporting the rule of law and protecting society with discipline and national responsibility.”
The committee described joining the force as “a national duty and an active contribution to rebuilding trust and security within Gaza’s society.”
It said the recruitment process targets individuals who demonstrate “professionalism, integrity and a sense of public responsibility, to be at the forefront of protecting families, safeguarding human dignity and helping shape a more secure future for coming generations.”
The planned police force will be built on “solid foundations of accountability, transparency and respect for the law,” the committee said.
Members of the force will operate under “clear codes of conduct and continuous oversight and accountability,” the statement added.
The NCAG is a nonpolitical body formed under a Gaza plan proposed by US President Donald Trump. It is tasked with managing daily civil service affairs in the enclave.
It comprises 11 Palestinian figures and is led by Ali Shaath. The committee began operating from the Egyptian capital, Cairo, in mid-January but has yet to start work inside Gaza, where about 2.4 million Palestinians face severe humanitarian conditions.
It has yet to begin operating from inside Gaza, despite Hamas saying it had completed logistical and administrative procedures to hand over civil governance duties.
Entry of committee members into Gaza requires field and security coordination through crossings controlled by Israel. No official explanation has been issued by the committee regarding the delay, and Israel has not commented on the matter.

Iranians grieve defiantly for thousands killed in last month’s crackdown

Iranians grieve defiantly for thousands killed in last month’s crackdown
Iranians grieve defiantly for thousands killed in last month’s crackdown
CAIRO (AP) — Standing on her balcony in the Iranian capital, Tehran, the teacher shouted out into the darkness, “Death to the dictator!” and “Death to the murderer, Khamenei!” on a recent night, joining the slogans coming from windows and rooftops around her relatively affluent neighborhood.
A few voices in the darkness responded with slogans in support of Iran’s 47-year-old Islamic Republic.
“Shut up! Choke on it!” her neighbors shouted back, drowning out the pro-government voices, the teacher recounted to The Associated Press, speaking on condition of anonymity for her safety.
Iranians across the country are still reeling with shock, grief and fear after massive nationwide protests were crushed by the deadliest crackdown ever seen under the rule of the 86-year-old Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei. Thousands were killed and tens of thousands are believed to have been arrested.
But a vein of defiance persists. A seething anger at Iran’s rulers is evident in videos shared on social media and in conversations with protesters. At the same time, three protesters reached by the AP also expressed futility over what can be done after hundreds of thousands braved taking to the streets only to be met with overwhelming violence. The protesters all spoke on condition of anonymity, fearing retribution or arrest.
Adding to the uncertainty is the United States’ threat to strike Iran. The U.S. has positioned warships and fighter jets nearby even as it holds negotiations with Iran over its nuclear program.
The defiance appears in the shouting of slogans from windows and rooftops at night, a ritual displayed in past waves of protests.
It is also evident at memorial gatherings for those killed 40 days earlier. Such commemorations -- known as the “chehelom,” Persian for “the 40th” – are traditionally held by families for anyone who has died. But in times of unrest, chehelom can have a political dimension.
Commemorations turn to protests
This week marks 40 days since Jan. 8 and 9, the deadliest days of the crackdown, and multiple videos circulating online show 40-day ceremonies in towns and cities around Iran. Some appear to have drawn hundreds of people, who often break into anti-government chants.
Often they are festive, with friends and loved ones of the slain protester singing and throwing flowers – a rejection of the solemn atmosphere encouraged by the state at official ceremonies. Most avoid calling the dead “shaheed,” or “martyr,” a term with Islamic religious connotations. Instead, they use the term, “javid nam,” a Persian phrase meaning, “Long live the name.”
Videos posted this week and verified by the AP showed a crowd of hundreds at the main cemetery in the small western Iranian town of Abdanan, chanting, “Death to Khamenei” and pumping their fists at the chehelom of Alireza Seydi, a 16-year-old boy killed on Jan. 8. The videos show security forces firing from an armored vehicle, raising clouds of what appeared to be tear gas, sending men and women running.
During the 1979 Islamic Revolution that toppled the shah and brought the Islamic Republic to power, 40-day memorials for slain protesters often turned into rallies that security forces tried to crush, causing new deaths – which then would be marked 40 days later with new protests.
Postings on social media have reported security forces trying to restrict people from attending some chehelom ceremonies.
“For every person killed, a thousand more stand behind him,” a crowd of several hundred chanted Tuesday while gathered in the eastern city of Mashhad for the chehelom of Hamid Mahdavi, according to a video verified by the AP. When a few police officers harassed some people commemorating Mahdavi, a fireman shot to death in January protests, the crowd shouted, “Shameless! Shameless!”
The government held its own chehelom for those killed, whom the Revolutionary Guard in a statement depicted as victims of violence caused by foreign-backed armed “terrorist” groups that exploited “legitimate public demands.” It said the 40-day commemoration was “a chance to renew commitment to national unity.”
‘Mass depression’ and anger
“More than sad, people are angry. Everyone is so angry. Everyone is waiting for some kind of explosion,” said a resident of Karaj, a city just outside of Tehran.
He joined street marches on Jan. 8 and Jan. 9 and said five of his relatives and family friends were killed when security forces opened fire on protesters.
The Human Rights Activists News Agency has so far counted more than 7,000 dead and believes the death toll is far higher. Iran’s government offered its only death toll on Jan. 21, saying 3,117 people were killed; it has depicted many of the protesters as “terrorists.”
“I don’t know anyone around me who doesn’t know someone who was killed, or someone who was arrested or wounded,” the 26-year-old teacher in Tehran said. Two of her acquaintances were killed and the husband of one of her co-workers arrested, she said.
Iranians are also struggling with a rapidly worsening economy, as the value of their currency plummets.
Every day, prices rise, said the Karaj resident. “We are getting near an economic collapse,” he said. “Buying fruit has become a luxury.”
A resident of north Tehran who works in tourism and joined last month’s protests said that with the Persian New Year approaching in March, the bazaar would usually be full of shoppers, but not now.
“It’s a combination of grieving, lack of money and inflation,” he said, describing people in the capital as being in a state of “mass depression.”
The mood has dampened Iran’s normally vibrant cultural sphere. One prominent actor posted that she would no longer accept new roles “in this land that smells of blood.”
Alireza Ostad Haji, who referees a popular television strongman competition, offered condolences to “all mourning families” in an Instagram post and resigned from two national athletic committees. He broke down in tears as he spoke of a former bodybuilding champion, Masoud Zatparvar, who was killed. “He was not a terrorist, he was a protester,” he said.
‘They see no alternative’
There is also a fear that street protests can’t bring change in the face of the state’s overwhelming use of violence.
The Karaj resident and the Tehran protester who works in tourism both expressed support for the son of the ousted shah, Reza Pahlavi, who from exile has put himself forward as a leader of the fragmented Iranian opposition. Pahlavi has encouraged protests and called for the U.S. to strike Iran.
The depth of support for Pahlavi around Iran is impossible to gauge. But during January’s wave of protests, chants in support of him were common, a notable change from the past, when the shah’s son drew scant attention within the country or was seen as out of touch.
Some are even taking what was a previously unimaginable step for many -- expressing hopes for an American attack.
“Every night, every hour, I wish I could hear (U.S.) strikes,” the protester who works in tourism said. “We cannot fight anymore with our fists against machine guns.” He said many of his friends who took to the streets alongside him in January say they won’t do so again because of the state’s violence.
The teacher said that, while she joined past protests, she didn’t in January because she didn’t like the expressions of Pahlavi support.
But she said some of her friends who also oppose the shah’s son joined the January protests and even repeated the slogan, “Long live the shah!”
“People have become very tired, and they see no alternative,” she said.
She worried a U.S. attack will bring war, civil strife and even more bloodshed.
“I am afraid there will be more massacres,” she said.

This is stated in the president's official notice published in the Federal Register, which is set to take effect on March 6, Ukrinform reports.
"In accordance with section 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)), I am continuing for 1 year the national emergency declared in Executive Order 13660," the document reads.
The notice specifies that the national emergency related to the situation in Ukraine remains in effect. It covers sanctions introduced in March and December 2014, as well as in September 2018 and February 2022, under executive orders issued by previous U.S. presidents.
U.S. executive orders declaring a national emergency and imposing sanctions on foreign states remain in force for one year. They must then be renewed by a separate order from the president to remain in effect for another year.

Iranians grieve defiantly for thousands killed in regime’s January crackdown on protests

“More than sad, people are angry. Everyone is so angry. Everyone is waiting for some kind of explosion,” said a resident of Karaj, a city just outside of Tehran.
He joined street marches on January 8 and January 9 and said five of his relatives and family friends were killed when security forces opened fire on protesters.
The Human Rights Activists News Agency has so far counted more than 7,000 dead and believes the death toll is far higher. Iran’s government offered its only death toll on January 21, saying 3,117 people were killed; it has depicted many of the protesters as “terrorists.”
“I don’t know anyone around me who doesn’t know someone who was killed, or someone who was arrested or wounded,” the 26-year-old teacher in Tehran said. Two of her acquaintances were killed and the husband of one of her co-workers arrested, she said.
Iranians are also struggling with a rapidly worsening economy, as the value of their currency plummets.
Every day, prices rise, said the Karaj resident. “We are getting near an economic collapse,” he said. “Buying fruit has become a luxury.”
A resident of north Tehran who works in tourism and joined last month’s protests said that with the Persian New Year approaching in March, the bazaar would usually be full of shoppers, but not now.
“It’s a combination of grieving, lack of money and inflation,” he said, describing people in the capital as being in a state of “mass depression.”
The mood has dampened Iran’s normally vibrant cultural sphere. One prominent actor posted that she would no longer accept new roles “in this land that smells of blood.”
Alireza Ostad Haji, who referees a popular television strongman competition, offered condolences to “all mourning families” in an Instagram post and resigned from two national athletic committees. He broke down in tears as he spoke of a former bodybuilding champion, Masoud Zatparvar, who was killed. “He was not a terrorist, he was a protester,” he said.
“They see no alternative”
There is also a fear that street protests can’t bring change in the face of the state’s overwhelming use of violence.
The Karaj resident and the Tehran protester who works in tourism both expressed support for the son of the ousted shah, Reza Pahlavi, who, from exile, has put himself forward as a leader of the fragmented Iranian opposition. Pahlavi has encouraged protests and called for the US to strike Iran.
The depth of support for Pahlavi around Iran is impossible to gauge. But during January’s wave of protests, chants in support of him were common, a notable change from the past, when the shah’s son drew scant attention within the country or was seen as out of touch.
Some are even taking what was a previously unimaginable step for many — expressing hopes for an American attack.
“Every night, every hour, I wish I could hear (US) strikes,” the protester who works in tourism said. “We cannot fight anymore with our fists against machine guns.” He said many of his friends who took to the streets alongside him in January say they won’t do so again because of the state’s violence.
The teacher said that, while she joined past protests, she didn’t in January because she didn’t like the expressions of Pahlavi support.
But she said some of her friends who also oppose the shah’s son joined the January protests and even repeated the slogan, “Long live the shah!”
“People have become very tired, and they see no alternative,” she said.
She worried a US attack will bring war, civil strife, and even more bloodshed.
“I am afraid there will be more massacres,” she said.

Scientists develop universal vaccine to protect against allergies, cold and flu
The vaccine could replace multiple jabs every year for winter respiratory infections and may even work against new pandemic bugs

- CommentsGo to comments
A universal vaccine that can protect against cold, flu, Covid and allergies is a significant step closer, scientists believe.
Stanford Medicine researchers in the US have tested a vaccine formula on mice that protects against a range of respiratory viruses, bacteria which causes sepsis and even house dust mites.
The vaccine is delivered through a nasal spray and provides broad protection in the lungs for several months.
If this vaccine was developed for humans it could replace multiple jabs every year for winter respiratory infections and may even work against new pandemic bugs.
“I think what we have is a universal vaccine against diverse respiratory threats,” Dr Bali Pulendran, director of the Institute for Immunity, Transplantation and Infection at Stanford Medicine and lead author said.
“Imagine getting a nasal spray in the fall months that protects you from all respiratory viruses including Covid-19, influenza, respiratory syncytial virus and the common cold, as well as bacterial pneumonia and early spring allergens,” Dr Pulendran said. “That would transform medical practice.”
For the study published in the journal Science, mice were given a drop of the vaccine, known as GLA-3M-052-LS+OVA, in their noses which offered protection for several months.
Researchers demonstrated that helpful T cells in the lungs, which are working against pathogens, could send signals to the body’s innate immune cells to keep them active.
Instead of trying to mimic part of a pathogen, the vaccine mimics the signals that immune cells use to communicate with each other during an infection.
Dr Pulendran thinks two doses of the nasal spray would be enough to provide protection in people and estimates that, depending on funding, the vaccine might be available within five to seven years.
Although Professor Ian Jones, a virologist at Reading University, believes the new vaccine design will be used in the future, he warns a universal vaccine is a way off.
“We are some way from a true one-jab-and-forget-it vaccine as the safety considerations are considerable given how diverse the human population is. A one size fits all may not work, and the current seasonal jabs, for flu or Covid or RSV, will remain the norm for some time yet,” he told the Independent.
Professor Jonathan Ball, virologist at Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine (LSTM) also believes scientists are “big steps” away from a truly universal vaccine.
He said: “We have to ensure that keeping the body on 'high alert' doesn't lead to friendly fire, where a hyper-ready immune system accidentally triggers unwelcome side-effects.”
Professor of vaccinology at University of Oxford, Daniela Ferreira, found the research “exciting”.
“Over our lifetime, we’re constantly exposed to viruses and bacteria that infect the airways. As a result, most of us carry ‘memory’ immune cells, including some that live in the lining of the nose and lungs. This research shows it may be possible to use that existing immune memory as a foundation for broadly protection - even of unrelated pathogens,” she explained.

State comptroller: Public given only ‘partial picture’ of Oct. 7 responsibility
Responding to High Court order freezing his probe, Matanyahu Englman pans ‘improper conduct’ of officials, in apparent hint at Netanyahu’s circulation of document on investigation
Jeremy Sharon is The Times of Israel’s legal affairs and settlements reporter
State Comptroller Matanyahu Englman said Thursday that office holders, including political and military officials, have “exposed to the public” only partial details about his review of the failures surrounding the Hamas-led invasion and atrocities in southern Israel on October 7, 2023.
He appeared to be referring, at least in part, to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s recent release of a 55-page document of his answers given to Englman for his probe, which included selectively chosen excerpts from years of security cabinet meetings regarding the situation in Gaza before October 7.
Englman made his comments in his response to High Court of Justice petitions asking the court to order him to end his review and not publish the conclusions and reports on the key issues of the October 7 failings.
The comptroller has not released findings from his investigation, which the court ordered him to freeze in December. Netanyahu released his document earlier this month, pinning the failure to prevent the onslaught on political rivals and security chiefs while presenting himself in a positive light and deflecting his responsibility for the attack.
“This conduct is improper since in this state of affairs, in which the audit procedures were terminated before the reports were completed and published to the public, the public was exposed to a partial picture, as provided by the aforementioned officials, instead of receiving complete and final review reports, which include the findings of the state comptroller,” said Englman.
The State Comptroller’s Office said that its response to the petitions “disproves one by one” the claims made against Englman’s probe, “and details the damage done to the public interest that has already taken place due to the court order, and the damage which is likely to happen if the court rules in favor of the petitions.”
Netanyahu’s office responded by saying the premier aimed to show the truth to the public with his document.
“The prime minister published the protocols in accordance with his authority in order to reveal the truth to the public after the High Court of Justice halted the comptroller’s investigation,” the Prime Minister’s Office said in a statement. “The only way to reveal the entire truth is through an equal and independent investigative committee, which will represent the entire public, and all materials will be presented to it.”
Yoav Gallant, defense minister on October 7, said after Netanyahu released his 55-page document that “the prime minister is a liar” who had stitched together a false narrative of the events leading up to the Hamas invasion and massacre.
The comptroller’s probe was controversial from the get-go, facing claims that it is severely flawed, would taint evidence and the investigative process, and that only a state commission of inquiry could properly investigate the disaster. It also drew scrutiny because Englman was appointed under a government led by Netanyahu.
The Military Advocate General’s Corps’ Military Defense unit and Movement for Quality government petitioned the High Court in September, alleging that there were “substantive flaws” in Englman’s information-gathering processes, and argued more broadly that the ombudsman has no remit to conduct an inquiry into the October 7 attack, since the role of the office is to examine the processes of the agencies under review but not to examine policy and strategy.
Opinion polls have regularly shown a clear majority of Israelis support a state commission of inquiry, Israel’s highest investigative authority, which Netanyahu opposes because it is appointed by the judiciary, which he argues would be biased as his government is pushing to curb the courts’ powers.
During the October 7 attack, terrorists who burst into the country from the Gaza Strip killed 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducted 251, also mostly civilians, who were taken as hostages to Gaza. The attack triggered a war, which eventually ended with a US-brokered ceasefire in October 2025. All of the hostages, dozens of them dead, have been returned to Israel.

Justice can be slow… and then suddenly, it’s swift. Two months to the day after the US justice department first started releasing the Epstein Files the arrest of King Charles’ brother: Andrew had already been stripped of his titles over allegations of relations with sex trafficked minors. Now he’s accused of leaking state secrets to the disgraced financier from the time when his late mother had pushed for his appointment as trade envoy.
What consequences for Andrew, for the British monarchy and for institutions already rattled by Peter Mandelson’s appointment as the current prime minister’s ambassador to the United States even though he too stands accused of leaking insider information to Epstein during the financial crisis? Will the arrests restore faith or fuel cynicism?
Moreover, will the arrest of Andrew force Donald Trump’s Justice Department to come clean over what’s still unreleased… and to pursue wrongdoers in an impartial manner? Whether it’s sex trafficking, trading state secrets, or tax evasion, who is above the law and who is not?

A thousand Kenyans 'recruited' for Russia's war — new report
February 19, 2026Kenya's National Intelligence (NIS) said that 1,000 Kenyans have been recruited to fight for Russia in Ukraine after allegedly being duped by the promise of employment.
The NIS findings were presented to lawmakers by parliamentary leader Kimani Ichung'wah on Wednesday.
Kenyans duped into fighting by job offers
Ichung'wah accused Russian embassy officials of colluding with recruitment agencies and human trafficking syndicates to recruit Kenyans to fight in Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine, under the guise of being given employment.
He said the Russian embassy officials issued them tourist visas.
"So far over 1,000 Kenyans have been recruited and departed to fight in the Russia-Ukraine war," Ichung'wah said.
Ichung'wah said that according to the NIS report, 89 Kenyans were on the front line, 39 were hospitalized, 28 were missing in action and at least one was confirmed dead.
According to the report, recruiters targeted former soldiers and police officers, as well as unemployed people, with promises that they would earn around 350,000 shillings (€ 2,300, $2,715) per month and get bonuses of up to 1.2 million shillings ($9,309).
In November, Kenya said that over 200 of its citizens were fighting for Russia, now with the NIS findings, the number is five times more than previously thought.
Moscow refutes allegations
Moscow's embassy in Nairobi denied the allegations in a statement on Thursday saying that no visas were issued to anyone intending to travel to Russia to fight in Ukraine.
The Russian embassy did however say that "the legislation of the Russian Federation does not preclude citizens of foreign countries from voluntarily enlisting in the armed forces.”
Ukraine has previously said that hundreds of citizens from 36 African countries were fighting alongside Russian forces on its territory, with some recruited through deception.
South Africans who fought for Russia return home
On Wednesday, South Africa's Foreign Ministry announced that four South African men who had been lured into fighting for the Russian forces in Ukraine had returned home.
This follows talks held by South African President Cyril Ramaphosa with his Russian counterpart, Vladimir Putin, on the return of South Africans caught up in the war in Ukraine.
In November, Pretoria said it had received "distress calls" from 17 men who had been tricked into joining mercenary groups and were trapped in the epicenter of the fighting in Ukraine's Donbas region.
South African law prohibits its citizens from fighting for a foreign army without government authorization.

US sanctions 3 RSF commanders for atrocities in Sudan
Treasury Department cites ethnic killings, torture, sexual violence during 18-month siege of El Fasher
ISTANBUL
The US Treasury Department sanctioned three commanders Thursday from Sudan's Rapid Support Forces (RSF) for their roles in a brutal campaign during the paramilitary group's siege and capture of El Fasher.
"These individuals were involved in the RSF's 18-month siege of and eventual capture of El-Fasher, in which the RSF perpetrated a horrific campaign of ethnic killings, torture, starvation, and sexual violence," said the Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control.
The RSF and its allied militias have committed "widespread atrocities, including war crimes, crimes against humanity, and genocide" since Sudan's civil war broke out in April 2023, it added.
Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent urged the RSF to commit to an immediate humanitarian ceasefire. "We will not tolerate this ongoing campaign of terror and senseless killing in Sudan," he said, warning that without a swift end to the conflict, Sudan risks "further destabilizing the region, creating conditions for terrorist groups to grow."
The US action follows similar designations by the UK in December and the EU in January.
Sudan has been locked in a bloody conflict between the army and the RSF since April 2023, killing tens of thousands, displacing 13 million people, and creating one of the world’s worst humanitarian crises, according to UN reports.
Actions by the RSF during their late-October takeover of El Fasher show “hallmarks of genocide” and indicate an ongoing risk of further atrocities, UN investigators said in a report Thursday.

Hungarian foreign minister threatens countermeasures unless Ukraine reopens Druzhba oil pipeline
Hungary's Foreign Minister Péter Szijjártó has once again accused Ukraine of causing his country problems relating to supplies of Russian oil.
Source: Szijjártó on Facebook, as reported by European Pravda
Details: Szijjártó claimed that Ukraine is "politically blackmailing" Hungary and Slovakia.
Quote from Szijjártó: "There are no technical, engineering-related or physical reasons for not resuming oil supplies via the Druzhba pipeline. The reason is purely political. The Ukrainians want us to go into elections with a petrol price of HUF 1,000 (around US$3.10), thereby helping the Tisza party, but we are not stupid!"
Details: The foreign minister asserted that his country "will defend itself", insisting that oil and fuel supplies to Hungary and Slovakia will be ensured.
"If the Ukrainians continue to stand in our way, we are ready to take further joint countermeasures," he added.
Szijjártó also posted a photo of himself with his Slovak counterpart, Juraj Blanar.
Background:
- Hungary is threatening to stop exporting electricity and gas to Ukraine unless Kyiv reopens the Druzhba oil pipeline.
- The statement came after Hungary announced the suspension of diesel supplies to Ukraine.
- The transportation of Russian crude oil via the Druzhba pipeline through Ukraine has been suspended since the end of last month due to large-scale Russian attacks on Ukraine's energy infrastructure.
- Slovakia and Hungary have accused Ukraine of refusing to repair the damaged sections of the pipeline.
- The Slovak government has also announced that it is halting supplies of diesel fuel to Ukraine.

Cats could hold the key to understanding breast cancer
Scientists discovered the genetic changes that drive cancer formation in cats are similar to those seen in humans
- Bookmark
- CommentsGo to comments
Household cats could help us understand how breast cancer develops in humans.
That’s according to the first study of multiple cancer types in cats that has identified genetic changes that could help treat the condition in humans and animals.
Almost a quarter of all UK households own at least one cat. Cancer is one of the leading causes of illness and death in cats, however very little is known about how this develops.
Scientists at the Wellcome Sanger Institute, the Ontario Veterinary College in Canada, the University of Bern, analysed tumours from almost 500 pet cats from five countries.
They discovered the genetic changes that drive cancer formation in cats are similar to those seen in humans.
Bailey Francis, co-first author at the Wellcome Sanger Institute, said: “By comparing cancer genomics across different species, we gain a greater understanding of what causes cancer. One of our major findings was that the genetic changes in cat cancer are similar to some that are seen in humans and dogs.
“This could help experts in the veterinary field as well as those studying cancer in humans, showing that when knowledge and data flows between different disciplines, we can all benefit.”
Cats are exposed to some of the same environmental cancer risks as their owners, which means that some causes of cancer could, at least in part, be shared.
By sequencing DNA from tissue samples that had already been collected by the vet for diagnostic purposes, the study published in the journal Science, found certain genetic changes commonly found in cat cancers mirror those seen in human cancers. For example, they found similarities between feline mammary cancers and human breast cancers.
Researchers looked for around 1,000 human cancer-associated genes in both tumours and healthy tissue samples. This included 13 different types of cat cancer and allowed them to compare the genetic changes to those seen in human and dog cancers.
One cancer studied was mammary carcinomas - a common and aggressive type of cancer in cats. Researchers identified seven driver genes that led to the development of cancer when mutated.
The most common driver gene of this type of cancer was FBXW7, which is also found in 50 per cent of the cat tumours. In humans, changes in the FBXW7 gene in breast cancer tumours are associated with a worse prognosis - which is similar to what is seen in cats.
Certain chemotherapy drugs were found to be more effective in the cat mammary tumours with changes in the FBXW7 gene. Although further research is needed, these findings may mean it is possible to develop a therapy for both cats with mammary carcinoma and human breast cancer patients.
The second most common driver gene was PIK3CA, seen in 47 per cent of cat mammary carcinoma tumours. This is also a genetic change found in human breast cancer. But similarities in these driver genes were also seen across blood, bone, lung, skin, gastro-intestinal, and central nervous system tumours.
Researchers say these findings could also lead to new therapies for cancers across the two species.
Professor Geoffrey Wood, co-senior author at the Ontario Veterinary College, Canada, said: “Despite domestic cats being common pets, there was very little known about the genetics of cancer in these animals, until now.
“Our household pets share the same spaces as us, meaning that they are also exposed to the same environmental factors that we are. This can help us understand more about why cancer develops in cats and humans, how the world around us influences cancer risk, and possibly find new ways to prevent and treat it.”

Azerbaijan does not plan to join $7B Gaza initiative announced at Board of Peace meeting
Trump says 8 nations collectively pledged more than $7B
ISTANBUL
Azerbaijan does not plan to participate in the $7 billion in donations announced Thursday during the first Board of Peace meeting in Washington, according to presidential adviser Hikmet Hajiyev.
Hajiyev wrote on US social media platform X that Azerbaijan, as a founding member state, supports the goals and objectives of the board and may consider participating in investment projects in the Gaza Strip in the future.
“However, I would like to clarify one point. Azerbaijan doesn’t envisage to participate in the USD 7 billion financial initiative related to Gaza that was announced during the meeting of the Board of Peace in Washington,” he wrote.
US President Donald Trump announced billions of dollars in contributions for relief in Gaza at the inaugural meeting of the Board of Peace. He said Kazakhstan, Azerbaijan, the United Arab Emirates, Morocco, Bahrain, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Uzbekistan and Kuwait collectively pledged more than $7 billion.
The board was established within the framework of efforts toward a peaceful settlement in Gaza. It seeks to promote peacemaking around the world. Washington has said additional states have since joined the initiative.
A US-backed ceasefire agreement has been in place in Gaza since Oct. 10, halting Israel’s two-year onslaught that has killed more than 72,000 people, mostly women and children, and injured over 171,000 since October 2023.
Despite the ceasefire, Israeli forces have committed hundreds of violations through shelling and gunfire, killing 611 Palestinians and injuring 1,630, according to Gaza’s Health Ministry.

Israeli settler killed Palestinian-American teen in the West Bank, local health ministry says

RAMALLAH/JERUSALEM, Feb 19 - A 19-year-old Palestinian-American citizen shot by an Israeli settler in the West Bank has died from his wounds,
the Palestinian Health Ministry said late on Wednesday.
A U.S. embassy official condemned the violence, telling Reuters on Thursday: "The U.S. Department of State has no higher priority than the safety and security of U.S. citizen overseas."
Nasrallah Mohammed Jamal Abu Siam was shot on Wednesday in the village of Mukhmas near Ramallah in the occupied West Bank.
A relative of Abu Siam, who did not wish to give his name out of fear of reprisals from Israeli security forces, said that settlers had raided the village to steal sheep.
The relative said that when villagers, including Abu Siam, had tried to prevent the theft, the settlers had begun firing at them, wounding Abu Siam and others.
The attacks injured five people, three of whom suffered bullet wounds including Abu Siam, the Palestinian Authority's official news agency WAFA said. The agency did not give details on the other injuries.
The Israeli military did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment on the incident.
Violence by Israeli settlers against Palestinians in the West Bank has increased sharply since the beginning of the war in Gaza in October 2023, with nearly 700 displaced due to settler attacks in 2026 according to UN data.
Nine Palestinians have been killed in the West Bank in 2026 according to UN data, while 240 were killed in 2025. Two Israelis were killed in the West Bank during 2025, according to the data.
Israeli indictments of settler violence are rare. At the end of 2025, Israeli monitoring group Yesh Din said of the hundreds of cases of settler violence it had documented since October 7, 2023, only 2% resulted in indictments.
Several U.S. citizens, including the activist Ayşenur Ezgi Eygi, have been killed by Israeli forces or settlers over the past two years in the West Bank. REUTERS

Belarus, issued rare invitation to Board of Peace, says it received no visas
Sign up now: Get ST's newsletters delivered to your inbox
Feb 19 - Belarus, a close ally of Russia rarely invited to international gatherings, said on Thursday it had intended to attend the inaugural meeting of U.S. President Donald Trump's Board of Peace in Washington but failed to receive the necessary visas.
Belarus has long been subject to Western sanctions over its human rights record and punitive measures were intensified after President Alexander Lukashenko allowed his country's territory to be used for Moscow's 2022 invasion of Ukraine.
Trump has made diplomatic overtures to Belarus, dropping some sanctions in exchange for the release of detainees deemed political prisoners by Western countries.
Belarusian Foreign Minister Maxim Ryzhenkov had been due to attend, his ministry said, and the U.S. side duly informed.
"However, despite carrying out all the required procedures from our side, visas were not issued to our delegation," the ministry said in a statement.
"In this situation, a valid question arises -- what kind of peace and what kind of sequence of steps are we talking about if the organisers cannot even complete basic formalities for us to take part?"
The ministry said Trump's invitation to attend the Board of Peace meeting had originally been sent to Lukashenko.
Lukashenko, in power since 1994, agreed last month to join the Board of Peace -- an invitation extended by the U.S. as part of its normalisation process involving prisoner releases.
Trump has called Lukashenko a "highly respected" leader - a description at odds with those by exiled Belarus opposition leaders, who denounce him as a dictator.
Representatives of 47 nations attended the meeting of the Board, proposed by Trump in September when he announced his plan to end Israel's war in Gaza. He later made clear the board's remit would expand to tackle other conflicts worldwide. REUTERS

US builds website that will allow Europeans to view blocked content
Unknown

The US has built a portal that will allow Europeans to view blocked content including alleged hate speech and terrorism, according to Reuters.
The portal, “freedom.gov”, will allow worldwide users to circumvent government controls on their content. The site features a graphic of a ghostly horse galloping above the Earth, and the motto: “Information is power. Reclaim your human right to free expression. Get ready.”
Though reports suggest the portal was developed by the state department, the domain appears to be administered by the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), which is a branch of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS). The DHS also administers Immigration Customs and Enforcement (ICE).
It comes after the Trump administration largely gutted a state department programme called Internet Freedom, which funded grassroots groups worldwide that built technologies to circumvent censorship. Over the past decade, this programme gave more than $500m to digital rights experts – from Myanmar to Iran to Cuba to Venezuela – who built tools used by local populations to access the global internet.
Those tools allowed pictures and videos to filter out of Iran during the recent internet shutdown; they are heavily used by journalists and activists worldwide.
Freedom.gov appears to be an effort to redirect and politicise the Internet Freedom programme, according to sources.
A former US official said: “It feels mostly performative. It reads more like a combative policy declaration. USG [US government] disagreements with the EU on free speech are nothing new as a matter of policy. But a portal of this kind takes it a step further, declaring publicly that the USG is concerned with freedom of expression even among our allies in Europe.”
Internet Freedom funded tools that are open-source and privacy-preserving – technologies whose code can be audited and that do not expose their users to surveillance. These tools were not designed by US businesses, but by technologists around the world attuned to local censorship regimes.
While freedom.gov is ostensibly also an “internet freedom” project, it does not propose to preserve privacy – instead, it appears to funnel users into an opaque, central system controlled by a US government agency.
“What you’re now talking about is concentrating traffic through a US federal agency organised and kept closed – as opposed to multiple internet freedom, open-source, privacy-preserving projects,” said Andrew Ford Lyons, an independent consultant on digital security and media resilience, who worked on previous US internet freedom projects.
The “censorships” that the site purports to counter are not internet shutdowns or broad restrictions on content such as those in place in China and Iran, but European restrictions on hate speech and illegal content such as those in the Digital Services Act, or the UK’s Online Safety Act.
“When I worked with journalists in Myanmar or civil society in Afghanistan, I was helping get the right tools to the right people to do whatever they want. This is very specifically to help, like, an angry man in Schöndorf see neo-Nazi tweets from a guy in Arkansas,” said Ford Lyons.
“If the Trump administration is alleging that they’re gonna be bypassing content bans, what they’re gonna be helping users access in Europe is essentially hate speech, pornography, and child sexual abuse material,” said Nina Jankowicz, a former US official and disinformation expert.
Jankowicz added it was odd that the site appeared administered by CISA, whose remit before Trump included election infrastructure and foreign disinformation in the US. “The site is in and of itself a propaganda tool,” she said.
CISA “is the group that used to make sure secretaries of state were equipped with the tools that they needed to fight foreign disinformation. Now what we’re alleging is that our allies in Europe somehow pose a greater threat to Americans than the national security threats posed by Russia, China.”
The Trump administration and US tech companies are in an escalating tussle with the EU over the bloc’s efforts to regulate big tech companies. The European Commission has launched an investigation into X over its propagation of sexualised deepfakes; earlier this month it threatened action against Meta over an apparent breach of its antitrust rules.
Meanwhile, in December, the Trump administration barred five Europeans, including the former EU commissioner Thierry Breton, from entering the US over their work to regulate hate speech and disinformation.
This confrontation was prefigured by US vice-president, JD Vance, in a speech at the Munich Security Conference last year, in which he lambasted Europe for media censorship, content moderation and political correctness, saying that free speech was in retreat.
“This has been like a crusade of the Trump administration, even before they got into office. This free speech issue is one that they believe plays well with their base,” said Jankowicz.
“What they’re able to say is this kind of us-versus-them dichotomy: the US is defending free speech and all of these other countries that are regulating the internet.”
A state department spokesperson told Reuters the US government did not have a censorship-circumvention programme specific to Europe but added: “Digital freedom is a priority for the state department, however, and that includes the proliferation of privacy and censorship-circumvention technologies like VPNs.”
Madhu Gottumukkala, the acting director of CISA, said: “The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) manages the .gov registrar to ensure that only verified U.S. Government organizations receive these trusted domains. While CISA does not control the content on those sites, our mission is unwavering: to strengthen America’s cybersecurity, safeguard critical infrastructure, and build a resilient digital ecosystem to protect the homeland. For content of the site we refer you to the Department of State.”

'Remarkable' new cat cancer genome could benefit humans
February 19, 2026Cat lovers have more in common with the family feline than they may realize.
New research published in the journal Science suggests cats and humans develop similar cancers due to similar tumor-causing genetic mutations.
This finding could lead to new cancer treatments for both pets and people.
The researchers created a cat "oncogenome" — a profile of gene mutations in cats that can cause cancer — using samples from nearly 500 cats in Canada, the UK, Germany, Austria and New Zealand.
Thirteen different types of cancer found in cats were analyzed for 1,000 genes known to cause cancer in humans. The oncogenome showed:
- Half of cancer samples in cats had a mutation to the FBXW7 gene, which is associated with aggressive forms of breast cancer in humans.
- Just under half of the samples had PIK3CA mutations, which is also associated with human breast cancer.
- Tumor-protein 53 — also known as TP53 or p53 — was the most common mutation in cats, and is often implicated as a driver of many human cancers.
A better model for cancer treatment?
While lab rodents have long been used to study cancers and potential drugs, cats could provide a more suitable model for scientific research.
"Here, you've got a model of spontaneously developing tumors, just as spontaneously as occurs in a human," said Louise van der Weyden, the study's senior researcher, based at the Wellcome Sanger Institute in the UK.
"These pets — cats and dogs — are in the same environment that we're in, so they've got the same pollution […] something that you’re not going to get in the laboratory."
By using a large number of non-pedigree housecats, the researchers had a genetically diverse pool in which to search for gene mutations common in cats and humans.
Van der Weyden said the pool could be expanded to include cats from other countries to offer an even broader understanding of cancer causes shared by felines and humans.
Of greatest interest is the potential for this cat oncogenome project to help identify environmental risks within the home. If, for instance, a certain genetic change triggers mammary cancer in the family cat, it could indicate similar risks for humans in the same house.
"There's a lot of studies now that are starting to think of cats and dogs as sentinels for the environment — the canary in the coal mine — because they are in the exact same environment that we are in," said van der Weyden. "We saw UV mutations [in cats] that were exactly the same as in humans, for example."
What is next for the oncogenome?
Trialing potential cancer therapies on cats with potential benefits for humans was shown in 2025 in the US by a group at the University of California.
The team led by Daniel Johnson and Jennifer Grandis tested a drug used to treat squamous cell carcinomas in humans on a group of cats with an oral form of the disease. Around a third of the treated cats lived an extra half year on average.
Though they weren't involved in the new oncogenome research, the UC team welcomed its findings.
"This is truly an exciting paper that further supports the relevance to humans, as well as pets, of studies like ours," Johnson and Grandis wrote in an email to DW.
"It is remarkable that alterations in genes such as p53 are found in high prevalence in both humans and cats. We can now begin to use studies like this to develop personalized cancer therapies for both cats and humans."
Van der Weyden hopes that her group can continue exploring cancers in pets to benefit both animals and humans. Because animal harm is minimized by using "real world" rather than lab animals, with support of animal owners, unnecessary animal harm could also be avoided, she said.
"Most [pet owners] will sign a form to say they're happy for [biopsy samples] to be used for research purposes, which I think is really open-minded and really wonderful," van der Weyden said. "It would be wonderful if something could come out of it. I think it’s wonderful to acknowledge all the owners that do that because without it, we couldn’t do this kind of study."

The names of the 11 'ISIS brides' trying to leave Syria to come to Australia

Full list of 11 Australian women with ISIS links trying to leave Syria revealed
The ABC can reveal the names of the 11 women connected to former Islamic State fighters in Syria who attempted to journey home to Australia this week
The group of 34 Australians, including 23 children, has been living in camps in Syria since the fall of the so-called caliphate, and some of those children were actually born behind the razor wire.
Some of the women are believed to have accompanied their husbands to the war zone, but others came with family and married IS fighters once they arrived. Some say they got stuck in Syria by accident.
Many of them have previously spoken to the ABC.
They left the Al-Roj camp in north-eastern Syria on Monday in the hopes of returning to Australia, but were forced to turn back shortly afterwards.
An official at the Al Roj camp said that when the group left, staff started dismantling their tents, and when the group unexpectedly returned, some had to bunk in together.
On Wednesday, Home Affairs Minister Tony Burke revealed one of the women is now the subject of a Temporary Exclusion Order (TEO), potentially banning her from travelling to Australia for up to two years on national security grounds.
It is not clear who the woman subject to the TEO is.
But the ABC can reveal the names of the 11 women who tried to leave after obtaining a handwritten list from inside the camp.
Nesrine Zahab
Nesrine Zahab is now in her early 30s, but she came to Syria from Sydney in her early 20s.
She has previously claimed she did not realise she was entering Syria.
"Who walks into a war zone?" she told Four Corners in 2019.
Nesrine said she had been on a family holiday in Lebanon, when she and a female cousin snuck away to deliver aid to refugees on the Turkish side of the Syrian border.
She said someone then asked for her passport.
"That kind of freaked me out," she said.
She said she only realised she was in Syria when she saw an Islamic State (IS) flag.
"I found that I was in Syria. Did I have a heart attack? Of course I had a heart attack," she told reporter Dylan Welch.
"Did I cry and scream and chuck a fit like a little girl? I chucked the biggest tantrum.
"Did it work? No. I'm still here."
She later married an Australian-born IS fighter named Ahmed Merhi, who was later captured and sentenced to death.
She said she believed marrying offered her the best chance of survival.
Sumaya Zahab
Sumaya Zahab is in her early 30s.
She is the sister of Muhammad Zahab, a former Sydney maths teacher who joined IS.
He died in an air strike in 2018, but was known to have convinced several family members to travel to Syria.
Aminah Zahab
Aminah Zahab is the mother of Muhammad Zahab and Sumaya Zahab, and the aunt of Nesrine Zahab.
She would now be about 50 years old and had followed her son to Syria.
"We're clueless parents. We had a lot of trust in our children, a lot of trust," she told Four Corners in 2019 from the Al-Hol camp.
"We didn't know how to do much things in life. As we raised our children, and we just let the children rule our lives.
"I feel very angry. I feel very devastated. I feel sore, pain."
Aminah was clearly distressed when she spoke about the conditions in the camp at the time.
"Tents have been burning down, and they're right next to each other," she said.
"You don't understand, you see charcoaled women and children."
Zeinab Ahmed
Zeinab Ahmed is the second-eldest daughter of Mohammed and Kawsar Abbas.
She last spoke to the ABC from Al Roj in early 2025, as she made an impassioned plea to the Australian government to help get the group home.
She feared for her safety, and the lives of her children.
At the time, she revealed that Australian officials had travelled to the camp in 2022 to meet with the women and children.
Health checks and DNA tests were conducted.
Months later, four families were repatriated to Australia.
"They took the first group and we were so happy that some of us were getting out, some of our kids will be saved," Zeinab said.
"Once they took them in there was backlash, there was backlash from when the announcement was made and then they never came back."
The process undertaken by officials in 2022 likely paved the way for travel documents to be issued for the group of women ahead of their failed attempt to leave Al Roj earlier this week.
In recent days, the Australian government has repeatedly denied offering support to the group to make the journey home — with the exception of what they are legally obligated to do.
This would include issuing travel documents.
Al Roj officials have told the ABC that the group have been issued with single-entry passports.
Kirsty Rosse-Emile
The ABC also spoke to Kirsty Rosse-Emile in early 2025 in the Al Roj camp.
"Hello, I'm here. Can you just come and get me, finally, and my children and all the other Australians here?" she said in a message to the Australian government.
"We're ready to start our lives afresh."
She spoke of her desire to see her mother and take her kids to the beach, and conceded that detailing how she ended up in Syria "might make problems for me."
In 2020, The Guardian reported that Kirsty's husband, Moroccan-born Nabil Kadmiry, had his Australian citizenship stripped from him by the federal government.
Janai Safar
Janai Safar was among the women whom Four Corners met in the Al-Hol camp in 2019.
She mentioned at the time that the group were aware of new legislation which could prevent them from returning to Australia.
"We've heard about the laws being passed, TEOs and stuff," Janai told the program.
A TEO has been imposed on one of the 11 women in the group — but exactly who remains unclear.
Her grandfather, John Crockett, told the ABC at the time that it was better they return to Australia than languish in camps in Syria.
"If some of them are going to go to jail when they come home, it's far better for them to be in prison back here and do a term of whatever they've been convicted of," he told Four Corners.
"At least if they come back here and they're jailed, at least we'll be able to go and see them."
Kawsar Abbas
Kawsar Abbas, from Melbourne, is in her early 50s.
She's the wife of Mohammed Ahmad, who ran a charity to support the people of Syria.
The Australian Federal police suspected the charity of funnelling cash to Islamic State.
In 2019, Mohammed Ahmad told the ABC that he and his family got trapped in Syria after travelling from the charity's headquarters in Turkey to attend the wedding of his son, Omar.
Mohammed said soon after arriving in Syria, he realised Omar had sworn allegiance to Islamic State. Omar also kept a Yazidi slave, who Ahmad said was treated well.
Ahmad implied that he did not approve of his son keeping the woman, but said he did not raise his concerns as other fathers in the caliphate had been killed for standing up to their children.
Mohammed insisted he was never an Islamic State supporter, but he was imprisoned in north-eastern Syria when IS was defeated.
Zahra Ahmad
Zahra Ahmad is the eldest daughter of Mohammed and Kawsar Abbas.
She's in her early 30s.
According to her father, the family got trapped in Syria in 2014 when they came for a wedding.
But the circumstances of how Zahra's family came to be in Syria are contested, SBS reported in 2024.
The outlet wrote that when some male members of her family joined the IS group, Zahra said the women had no choice but to follow.
"I didn't make this bed," she told SBS.
"We are now forced to suffer for the decisions that other people — other male influencers — have made on our behalf, and now they're all gone, and we are left to suffer with our kids."
Zahra later married notorious Islamic State recruiter Muhammad Zahab, who died in an air strike.
Hodan Abby
The Sydney Morning Herald and The Age revealed details of Hodan Abby's case in 2021, through an emotional appeal from her father.
Hodan had left her western Sydney home and fled to Syria in 2015 when she was still a teenager, the newspapers reported, in a bid to become a jihadi bride.
She gave birth to a daughter in Syria, and the child later suffered shrapnel wounds to her head.
Doctors told her surgery was required outside of the camp.
Hodan's father said he feared for his daughter and granddaughter and urged the government to intervene.
The newspapers reported at the time that Hodan had agreed to be placed under a Terrorism Control Order if she returned to Australia, giving law enforcement and intelligence agencies the power to monitor her.
Kawsar Kanj and Hyam Raad
There are two more Australian women on the list: Kawsar Kanj and Hyam Raad.
Little to no public information is available about them.
Another woman with the same surname, Mariam Raad, returned in 2022.
She was convicted of travelling to a proscribed area in 2024.

Tucker Carlson's 'detention' claim unravels as new footage surfaces

The uproar surrounding the brief visit of conservative American media personality Tucker Carlson to Israel continues, after new footage released Thursday cast doubt on his claim that he was "detained" and "dragged into an interrogation room" at Ben-Gurion Airport.
Carlson told the Daily Mail that after concluding an interview with US Ambassador to Israel Mike Huckabee in Jerusalem, Israeli security officials confiscated his passport and led his producer into a side room to question him about the content of their discussion.
🚨EXCLUSIVE FOOTAGE:

However, footage first shared by social media activist Oli London shows Carlson at the VIP terminal at Ben-Gurion Airport, smiling, conversing with employees and even taking a photo with one of them, contradicting his narrative of being forcibly escorted and having his passport seized. In a post accompanying the video, London wrote that Carlson had been "exposed" and was neither arrested nor interrogated, but treated like any other visitor.
The US Embassy in Jerusalem rejected Carlson's claims on Wednesday, stating that he "received the same treatment as any visitor to Israel." The embassy said its only involvement was coordinating the landing of his private plane to help ensure a smooth visit.
An embassy spokesperson also clarified that it was inaccurate to suggest Israel had intended to allow Carlson into the country solely for the purpose of conducting the interview. According to the spokesperson, Carlson himself chose to remain in Israel for only a few hours before departing, a personal decision that was not imposed on him at any stage. The Israel Airports Authority likewise emphasized that there had been no unusual delay or interrogation.
Meanwhile, conservative commentator Laura Loomer alleged that the initial report of Carlson's "detention" had been planted. She claimed that Daily Mail reporter Philip Nieto had previously worked with Carlson and published a false story that Carlson himself had fed him, including an assertion that the White House had asked Carlson to confront Huckabee ahead of the US midterm elections. Loomer stressed that "the White House did not ask Carlson for anything" and described the episode as unethical conduct.
Ambassador Huckabee also weighed in online, stating that "everyone entering and leaving Israel is asked routine security questions." He noted that he too undergoes similar checks, despite holding a diplomatic passport and visa, and emphasized that passport inspections and security questioning are standard practice in every country.
The newly surfaced footage, together with the official denials and allegations that the story was deliberately planted, has placed Carlson at the center of criticism not only from Israeli officials but also from within segments of the American conservative camp.

ALBAWABA- At least four people were killed and 17 others injured after a tanker truck carrying liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) overturned and exploded in northern Santiago early Thursday, authorities said.
The incident occurred at the intersection of Ruta 5 Norte and General Velásquez in the Renca district, a major industrial and highway corridor in the Chilean capital.
According to Carabineros police chief Víctor Vielma, the tanker, operated by Gasco, lost control for reasons still under investigation, struck a guardrail, and overturned before igniting in a massive fireball. Thick white smoke billowed across the area as flames spread to nearby vehicles and structures.
Seven smaller vehicles were damaged in the blast, along with parts of a nearby vehicle scrapyard. Sections of the Autopista Central were closed as firefighters worked for hours to contain the blaze amid concerns about possible secondary explosions from residual gas.
The truck driver, an employee of Gasco, was among those killed. Most of the other victims were motorists caught in the chain-reaction crash. Authorities said 10 of the injured suffered severe burns or traumatic injuries and were hospitalized in critical condition.
In a statement, Gasco expressed condolences to the victims’ families and confirmed the tanker had been traveling from a terminal in Quintero to the company’s Maipú plant.
The company said it would fully cooperate with the investigation being led by the Carabineros’ SIAT traffic investigation unit and the LABOCAR forensic team.
While the exact cause remains unclear, preliminary hypotheses include a possible valve leak that may have ignited on impact. Investigators are also examining whether speed, mechanical failure, or driver error played a role.

Rheinmetall has demonstrated its new FV-014 loitering munition to a potential NATO customer.
The tests took place on February 18, 2026, at the National Test Center for Unmanned Aircraft Systems in Saxony-Anhalt. During the presentation, the system simulated various mission scenarios and carried out attacks on targets.
The system is designed for operations at ranges of up to 100 kilometers. It combines reconnaissance and target engagement functions. The main targets for the munition are armored vehicles, artillery positions, and enemy command posts.
Launch is carried out from a transport and launch container using a launch accelerator or from a multi-charge launcher. After leaving the container, the drone deploys its folding wings and enters flight mode. It can stay in the air for 70 minutes, giving the operator enough time to observe the territory and select a target for attack.
The FV-014 is controlled via a ground station. The operator can identify the target, track it, or cancel the mission if circumstances change.
The fuselage has a faceted structure to reduce visibility and is equipped with an electric motor to reduce noise. The warhead, weighing about 5 kg, is capable of penetrating more than 600 mm of homogeneous armor.
An important feature of the system is its ability to operate in conditions of electronic countermeasures and in the absence of satellite navigation (GNSS) signals. The device can also be used as part of a “swarm” to simultaneously engage multiple targets or overload enemy air defense systems.

Unidentified drone flew over anti-corruption prosecutor's office – Ukrainska Pravda

Unidentified drone flew over anti-corruption prosecutor's office – Ukrainska Pravda
A few weeks ago, a new wave of attacks began on Ukraine's anti-corruption agencies. An unidentified drone was recently spotted at night above the premises of the Specialised Anti-Corruption Prosecutor's Office (SAPO).
Source: Ukrainska Pravda article (English translation coming soon)
Quote from the article: "Sources in law enforcement said a drone was recently spotted at night above the premises of the Specialised Anti-Corruption Prosecutor's Office. Police were called to the scene. Work is currently underway to establish the provenance of the UAV."
Details: Semen Kryvonos, head of the National Anti-Corruption Bureau (NABU), said last week during a public report on NABU's work that attempts to put pressure on the anti-corruption agencies have not stopped. As an example, he cited a recent case when a listening device was found in the apartment of the head of a group of detectives who are working on uncovering crimes in the defence sector. The anti-corruption officials will not disclose details of the circumstances, but it is unlikely that such an operation could have been carried out without help from the special services.
Simultaneously, a new wave of negativity about the agencies can be seen on Telegram channels. A similar campaign was observed in summer 2025 ahead of the attempt to strip the anti-corruption bodies of their independence.
Then as now, NABU and SAPO have been accused of corruption and inefficiency. Between 12 and 26 January 2026, 238 posts containing negative sentiment were recorded on social media. The vast majority of the negative mentions came from anonymous or semi-anonymous resources, which may indicate that the influence is being controlled.
For their part, the anti-corruption bodies insist that no attempted influence will slow down their work. All the more so since Operation Midas, for example, has moved into other jurisdictions that are ready to cooperate and are already working with Ukrainian investigators.

Even Fox News hosts struggling to make sense of RFK Jr’s and Kid Rock’s workout video
‘Listen, somebody needs to tell RFK Jr. it’s okay to wear shorts. I mean, bro, don’t be upset about your legs,’ Fox News military analyst Johnny Jones said

Why did Department of Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F Kennedy Jr and aging rap-rocker Kid Rock release a sweaty, shirtless workout collab video? Not even Fox News is sure.
During an episode of The Five on Wednesday, the panel members were left scratching their heads during a discussion of the bizarre video.
In a clip posted to X, Kennedy and Kid Rock, both shirtless, take turns riding on a stationary bike and doing pushups in what looks like a sauna. At one point, Kid Rock flips the middle finger to the camera. A title screen, inexplicably featuring a great white shark, tells us this is Kennedy and Kid Rock's "Rock Out Work Out."
The video is apparently intended to promote the DHHS secretary's Make America Healthy Again agenda.
Fox News' Greg Gutfeld watched the video and asked his co-panelists, "This raises a question: who rubs off on who?"
“You would think, ‘Oh, my God. RFK Jr is hanging out with Kid Rock. Oh, poor RFK Jr. is going to end up drinking. He’s going to be drinking again. He’s going to be womanizing again.’ And then what happens? You see Kid Rock at the gym," Gutfeld said. "He’s like, you know, working out and cold plunge—it’s like RFK was a bad influence on Kid Rock. Who would have seen that coming?”
Fox News military analyst Johnny Jones pointed out that the DHHS secretary wore blue jeans throughout his entire workout.
“Listen, somebody needs to tell RFK Jr. it’s okay to wear shorts. I mean, bro, don’t be upset about your legs. I don’t care what they look like. Take it from me, nobody needs impressive legs. You look great with your shirt off. Throw the shorts on so we don’t all go, ‘Wow, that’s weird.’”
Emily Compagno jumped on the “no jeans” bandwagon with Jones.
“My pet peeve was jeans at the beach in California. Now it might be jeans at the gym,” she said.
Even with the minor critiques, The Five is still a Fox News product, so it wasn't long before the hosts found a way to praise the video.
“I’m obviously not the audience for this video, but I like the idea of people eating healthier,” Dana Perino said. “I think that is great, and the access to it is wonderful. So the more people that learn about it, the better. I’m all for that.”
In January, Kennedy introduced an inverted food pyramid, which now places nutrient-dense proteins, healthy fats, fruits, and vegetables at the top, and grains at the bottom.
“These Guidelines return us to the basics,” Kennedy said in a statement at the time. “American households must prioritize whole, nutrient-dense foods—protein, dairy, vegetables, fruits, healthy fats, and whole grains—and dramatically reduce highly processed foods. This is how we Make America Healthy Again.”
Harold Ford Jr split the difference, noting that he "doesn't get into cold plunges with guys" — referencing a moment when Kennedy and Kid Rock share glasses of whole milk while lounging in a pool together — but said he was otherwise "impressed by the video."
"I’m a Kid Rock fan. I love his music, but to the substance for one moment, I think what Secretary Kennedy is doing around food is really, really important,” he said.
He also offered an under-the-radar critique of Kennedy that may have been the sharpest to come out of the discussion.
“It’s an issue I think [Kennedy] knows, and knows more so than some of the professional medical and scientific, other things that he talks about,” Ford Jr said.

The Guardian view on the royals and the law: no more managed disgrace | Editorial
Unknown
Unknown Publisher

The arrest of Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor the king’s brother, should be the moment deference ends and accountability begins – a correction long overdue. For more than 15 years, allegations surrounding Mr Mountbatten-Windsor were managed away by silence, an out-of-court settlement and his withdrawal from royal duties. In short, his behaviour was viewed as an image problem to be handled privately. That era now looks to be over.
That the eighth in line to the throne was sitting in a police cell on his 66th birthday shows how far he has fallen. The formal investigation means that the question is no longer about protecting the monarchy but one of what happened, and who might be responsible for unlawful acts. Mr Mountbatten-Windsor’s descent into ignominy has unfolded slowly but inexorably. His stupidity and arrogance led him to believe that he could talk his way out of his relationship with the convicted child sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. Instead, he faces a legal and constitutional reckoning.
Thames Valley police arrested the royal on suspicion of misconduct in public office, following a complaint by the anti-monarchy group Republic. The offence carries a maximum sentence of life imprisonment. Within the 3m files and messages released by the US Department of Justice are emails that appear to show Mr Mountbatten-Windsor forwarding documents and commercial information to Epstein while serving as trade envoy. The king’s brother denies any wrongdoing.
A single 2001 photograph plunged the monarchy into crisis. It showed the then Prince Andrew with 17-year-old Virginia Giuffre and lent credibility to her trafficking allegations. The visual evidence made it hard to dismiss her statements as implausible. Though he denied knowing her and rejected the claims, a £12m settlement followed and the image shaped a scandal that shook the House of Windsor. More women have come forward alleging abuse, which Mr Mountbatten-Windsor denies.
Ms Giuffre died by suicide last year. Her family said that Mr Mountbatten-Windsor’s arrest shows that “no one is above the law”. MPs should not bend the knee before inheritance and rank. As this column has long argued, it cannot be right to call for the king’s brother to give evidence to US lawmakers, but not to parliament. Liam Byrne, the Labour chair of the cross-party business and trade committee, was correct, in a constitutional sense, that Mr Mountbatten-Windsor could be questioned by MPs. His public office as trade envoy answers to parliament. It is not the law, but convention – including Commons rules barring “reflections” on the royals – which restrains politics.
Mr Mountbatten-Windsor is still a counsellor of state, theoretically able to stand in for the king. He will never wear the crown. Parliament should now debate whether hereditary privilege can coexist with democratic accountability.
Symbolically, this episode surely marks the end of the assumption that being part of the royal household is a badge of impunity. Practically, it should deliver more victim-centred accountability. The story of Mr Mountbatten-Windsor’s Epstein connections is only beginning. If there are no charges, it becomes a story about institutional reform. If prosecution proceeds, he will answer to 12 jurors who will judge him by the evidence, not by his birth. Either way, the old model – of discreet exile and silence – seems finished.

UK may not allow US to use its bases to attack Iran over possible int'l law violations - report

The United Kingdom has yet to allow the United States to use its bases in the region to attack Iran, The Sunday Times reported on Thursday.
The hesitation reportedly follows concerns of possible international law violations, which “makes no distinction between a state carrying out the attack and those in support if the latter have 'knowledge of the circumstances of the internationally wrongful act.’”
According to a Wednesday Truth Social post by US President Donald Trump, the US may need to use the joint UK-US Diego Garcia military base and the Royal Air Force (RAF) Station base Fairford in Gloucestershire “in order to eradicate a potential attack by a highly unstable and dangerous Regime.”
Republican Senator Lindsey Graham sharply criticized the UK after the Time’s report, saying that if it is true, it would be an "astonishing" move that would raise “serious questions” about the status of Diego Garcia.
Graham argued that Iran, which he labeled as "the largest state sponsor of terrorism," is currently at its weakest point in years, due to internal mass protests and the "devastating blows" dealt by the US and Israel to the regime's military infrastructure.
He warned Britain that if it chooses to "sit on the sidelines," it will find itself "on the wrong side of history," and claimed this is yet another example of the erosion of US alliances in Europe.
Trump revokes support for Chagos Islands deal
The Times said that Trump and British Prime Minister Keir Starmer spoke on Tuesday night regarding Iran, and on Wednesday, Trump withdrew his support for Starmer’s deal to give the Chagos Islands, which include Diego Garcia, to Mauritius.
Britain and Mauritius last year struck a deal to transfer sovereignty of the islands to Mauritius, while allowing Britain to retain control of the air base under a long-term lease.
“Prime Minister Starmer should not lose control, for any reason, of Diego Garcia, by entering a tenuous, at best, 100 Year Lease,” Trump wrote on Truth Social. “This land should not be taken away from the UK and, if it is allowed to be, it will be a blight on our Great Ally.”
“We will always be ready, willing, and able to fight for the UK, but they have to remain strong in the face of Wokeism, and other problems put before them.”
Trump had previously called the deal “an act of total weakness” and "another in a very long line of national security reasons why Greenland has to be acquired."

High Court urged to lift Oct. 7 audit freeze, hold semi-classified hearing
Unknown
Unknown Publisher
2026-02-19
19:05:21 UTC
04:05:21 KST

State Comptroller Matanyahu Englman on Thursday filed a 163-page sworn response with the High Court of Justice, urging it to reject two petitions that prompted the court late last year to freeze a set of central audits into the failures surrounding the October 7 attack and the ensuing war.
Englman asked the justices to convene an urgent hearing whose first segment would be held behind closed doors so that he could personally present draft findings, including material classified at the level of “top secret.”
In the filing, submitted on Thursday in response to a conditional order issued by the court on December 31, 2025, the Comptroller’s Office also asked that the three-justice panel currently hearing the petitions be expanded, arguing that the issues raised now require a constitutional interpretation of Basic Law: The State Comptroller that goes to the heart of the institution’s authority and its ability to independently audit the political, military, and civilian echelons of government.
In response, the Prime Minister’s Office said that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu had published cabinet protocols under his authority in order to expose the truth to the public after the High Court halted the comptroller’s review. “The only way to expose the full truth is through an equitable and independent commission of inquiry that will represent the entire public and before which all materials will be presented,” the statement said.
The December ruling did not permanently bar the comptroller from auditing the events of October 7 but temporarily froze work on eight defined “core” audits while the court considers whether reviews that touch on matters of national security decision-making, wartime policy, and potential personal responsibility at senior levels fall within his statutory remit or should instead be reserved for a future state commission of inquiry.
Those petitions, filed by the Military Defense Counsel on behalf of IDF personnel and by the Movement for Quality Government, argued that audits dealing with policy and strategy or requiring broad investigative fact-finding risk exceeding the comptroller’s mandate and may undermine the procedural rights of individuals whose actions are being scrutinized.
The court’s interim injunction followed, ordering Englman to explain why he should not refrain from examining such issues in the context of October 7 and the war.
In his sworn response, Englman rejects the premise that the audits seek to evaluate the substance of national policy itself, arguing instead that they examine the processes by which decisions were made and implemented and the systemic gaps between established standards and operational reality.
Reviews of decision-making frameworks, intelligence coordination, and implementation failures, he contends, fall squarely within the traditional domain of state audit and are consistent with international standards governing supreme audit institutions.
The right to cross-examine witnesses
He further disputes a key demand raised in the petitions that audits touching on possible individual responsibility adopt the procedural framework used by state commissions of inquiry, including the right to cross-examine witnesses. According to the filing, the legislature’s selective incorporation of certain inquiry-type powers into the State Comptroller Law creates a negative arrangement that precludes importing the full procedural regime applicable to commissions into audit proceedings.
A central institutional concern raised in the response is that narrowing the comptroller’s authority to exclude issues labeled “policy” or “strategy” would create what the filing terms “immunity zones” in precisely the areas where failures on October 7 are alleged to have occurred, allowing strategic-level decision-making by senior political and military officials to evade independent oversight while leaving only tactical questions subject to review.
The Comptroller’s Office argues that such an outcome would create a structural gap in parliamentary supervision of the executive branch and risk long-term harm to the system of checks and balances.
The filing also asserts that the harm is already materializing on the ground.
Since the issuance of the conditional order and interim injunction at the end of 2025, the office says, some officials and agencies have cited the pending litigation as grounds to delay meetings or withhold documents even on matters not covered by the freeze, exposing the public to partial accounts of the audit process through media disclosures rather than the finalized reports themselves.
According to materials submitted alongside the response, the frozen audits address decision-making processes and preparedness at the political, intelligence, and military levels in the years leading up to October 7. This includes the functioning of the security cabinet, coordination between the political echelon and the intelligence community, defensive readiness along the Gaza border, and the formulation and implementation of understandings with Hamas from April 2018 until the outbreak of hostilities.
Other topics under review include wartime stockpiling targets for ammunition and the use of economic tools against terrorist organizations.
A table attached to the filing details meetings held between audit teams and senior officials across 2025 and early 2026, including with Netanyahu, former defense minister Yoav Gallant, former IDF chief of staff Herzi Halevi, and former Shin Bet (Israel Security Agency) chief Ronen Bar, where prewar intelligence processes, border defense doctrine, and the events of October 7 were discussed as part of the ongoing audits.
In requesting that the court hold the initial portion of the next hearing in camera, Englman argues that the publication of preliminary findings is legally barred unless expressly authorized by the comptroller, and that at least two draft reports – dealing with the defense of cities and aspects of the Nova festival attack near Re’im – contain material classified at the highest level.
The motion proposes that only representatives of the Attorney-General’s Office with appropriate security clearance be permitted to attend the confidential segment, given that the draft findings may touch on third parties not represented in the proceedings.
Englman also pushes back against claims that the existence of the audits conflicts with the potential establishment of a state commission of inquiry into October 7, maintaining that the legislature envisioned the two mechanisms as complementary rather than mutually exclusive and noting that past commissions have relied extensively on comptroller reports in carrying out their mandates.
The filing comes against the backdrop of a broader debate over accountability for the failures of October 7 and the still-unresolved question of whether and when a full state commission of inquiry will be formed.
Englman is asking the High Court to dismiss the petitions, lift the interim injunction freezing the eight audits, and schedule an expedited hearing to allow the audit process – which his office says has already consumed more than 300 person-years of work across multiple reviews – to proceed without further delay.

Bronze scale pan found in ancient Sussiya reveals how biblical law shaped daily Jewish life

A rare bronze scale pan was discovered during excavations in the ancient Jewish town of Sussiya by a father and daughter participating in an educational dig, the Mount Hebron Regional Council announced on Thursday.
The dig was conducted by schools from the area, in cooperation with the Civil Administration’s Staff Officer for Archaeology in the West Bank and the Mount Hebron Regional Council.
Neta, a second-grader at Sussiya's regional school, and her father, Nachshon, discovered the pan inside a residential building near the town’s main street.
According to the statement, the bronze pan was part of a set of portable hanging scales common in ancient Israel, which included two small bowls with tiny holes along their rims suspended across a balance.
The find will undergo a formal conservation process and is expected to be displayed to the public in the future.
'Project is invaluable'
“Finding a scale pan in the heart of an ancient Jewish settlement is like finding a book of ethics buried in the ground,” Dr. Achiya Cohen-Tavor, archaeologist and director of the excavation, said, adding that the discovery “illustrates how the residents of Sussiya put the biblical commandment of 'Just balances, just weights shall you have’ [Leviticus 19] into practice.”
“In a world where every human action was understood as capable of tipping the scales of the entire world between merit and debt, this physical find is testimony to a life of social and spiritual responsibility."
Eliram Azulay, head of the Mount Hebron Regional Council, affirmed the importance of the communal and educational digs, as they allow the “younger generation to take an active part in uncovering our heritage and connecting to our roots.”
“It's an amazing project that connects children to heritage, culture, and the land,” Nachshon added, echoing Azulay’s words. “It's uplifting to see young children digging with such professionalism and according to careful, delicate excavation protocols. The project is invaluable.”

The Guardian view on Merz and Meloni: an emerging Berlin-Rome axis is threatening the EU’s green deal
Unknown

04:05:08 KST

When the European Union launched its green deal in 2019, putting into law the goal of climate neutrality by the middle of the century, it showed strategic foresight as well as global leadership. Russia’s war in Ukraine has starkly underlined the extent to which the continent’s energy security – and its future prosperity – is dependent on the transition away from fossil fuels. Lately, however, EU leaders’ environmental approach appears to be echoing the youthful St Augustine’s plea on chastity: make us greener, but not yet.
The recent European Industry Summit in Antwerp made unusually big headlines thanks to Sir Jim Ratcliffe’s xenophobic outburst over immigration. But it was also notable for fierce attacks on one of the most important pillars of EU environmental policy. The bloc’s emissions trading system (ETS) – which makes polluters pay for the C02 they emit – has achieved dramatic results in driving down overall emissions since 2005 and encouraging green innovation. Worryingly, the German chancellor, Friedrich Merz, appeared to sympathise with demands from Sir Jim and other CEOs for a radical relaxation of the rules.
There will be much more of this to come. Together with the far-right Italian prime minister, Giorgia Meloni, Mr Merz is championing a deregulatory approach to delivering growth that risks hobbling Europe’s climate ambitions. Ms Meloni has long railed at what she has described as “green follies” imposed by Brussels. In Mr Merz, an economic liberal instinctively hostile to regulation, she has acquired a powerful ally.
The Berlin-Rome axis has already succeeded in diluting plans to ban the sale of new petrol and diesel vehicles by 2035. EU leaders have also voted to scale back overall 2040 targets for greenhouse gas reduction. Corporate sustainability reporting rules have been watered down. Italo-German calls for greater flexibility in achieving decarbonising goals, and attacks on regulatory systems such as the ETS, have the potential to license a full-scale pivot away from net zero targets.
This is disastrously shortsighted from an economic as well as an environmental point of view. When the green deal was launched, it was rightly seen as a means to encourage the changes needed to make economies competitive in a fossil-fuel-free era. Competition from China has underlined the importance of moving faster in this direction. Instead, the rising influence of rightwing populism across the continent is leading to a new go-slow consensus.
As the former head of the European Central Bank Mario Draghi has argued, the true path to future competitiveness lies in sustained investment, partly financed by common EU borrowing, and incorporating a bold green industrial strategy. Mr Merz is right to suggest that, in some areas, a simplification of bureaucratic hurdles could be beneficial for growth. But a blind faith in deregulation, and capitulation to corporate lobbying on environmental rules by the likes of Sir Jim, is not a remotely adequate strategy for the times, ethically or economically.
Given Donald Trump’s ongoing determination to undermine international attempts to combat global heating, Europe’s role as a climate leader is more vital than ever. So too is the need to develop an industrial vision that ensures the continent’s prosperity and security in the long term. As Mr Merz and Ms Meloni manoeuvre, it is time for defenders of the EU’s green deal to stand up and be counted.

Iranian-American journalist Masih Alinejad receives Courage Award on behalf of Iranian protesters

Iranian-American journalist Masih Alinejad accepted the Courage Award on Wednesday at the Geneva Summit for Human Rights and Democracy on behalf of Iranian protesters, many of whom have lost their lives this past month, demonstrating against the Islamic regime.
Demonstrations broke out across Iran in response to the country’s economic crisis and the rapid devaluation of the rial. As authorities began a brutal crackdown, murdering thousands of protesters and enacting a country-wide internet blackout, civilians spoke out in support of regime change.
Alinejad collected the award in front of a coalition of more than 30 human rights organizations.
The Courage Award was presented to the Heroes of Iran by Swedish Member of the European Parliament Alice Teodorescu Måwe, who said, “History will remember those who excused the brutality and those who closed their ears to the Iranian tiger’s abyssal roar. But history will also remember those who stood up – when it was dangerous, lonely, and therefore essential.”
“I do not accept this award as a personal honor. I accept it as a platform to indict the Islamic Republic for its massacre. The real courage belongs to the Iranian women and men who carry bullets in their bodies and still demand freedom,” Alinejad said.
“While diplomats of the Islamic Republic, including its foreign minister Abbas Araghchi, walk freely through the halls of the United Nations in Geneva, more than 40,000 innocent Iranians have been massacred at home.
“The same regime that blinded protesters, stormed hospitals, executed children, and sent assassins abroad is still granted the privilege of diplomacy. What a historical shame. Geneva cannot be a safe haven for representatives of a regime that behaves like ISIS.”
Recognizing victims maimed by the IRGC, she asserted, “The world cannot normalize a regime that shoots women and men in the eyes, executes protesters, and sends assassins across borders storming into hospitals, finishing off the injured, and hanging the protesters,” and demanded international intervention.
Iran must be deprived of seats at the UN, Alinejad said
The activist insisted that Tehran be deprived of seats at the UN and other institutions, and its officials exiled, sanctioned, and prosecuted for their roles in the regime’s crimes and international accountability. While Alinejad now lives in New York City, the Islamic regime has targeted her for her condemnations of the widespread human rights violations.
She has faced multiple kidnappings and assassination plots and now lives under FBI protection.
“We chose the heroes of Iran for this award because they have done what the United Nations has failed to do: they have looked the regime in the eye and refused to blink,” said Hillel Neuer, executive director of UN Watch, a co-organizer of the summit. “For nearly 50 years, this tyranny has relied on fear to survive. These heroes are proving that the fear is gone, and the regime is terrified.”
“While the world’s diplomats shake hands with the butchers of Tehran, we are honoring their victims. This award is our message to the people of Iran: You are not alone. When your government cuts the internet to kill in the dark, we will be your voice. We will ensure the world cannot look away,” he concluded.

Brazil court reinstates order to free up access to Cargill's Santarem port terminal
Sign up now: Get ST's newsletters delivered to your inbox
SAO PAULO, Feb 19 - A Brazilian court reinstated late on Wednesday an order to free up access to the Santarem river port terminal where U.S. grain trader Cargill operates, according to a ruling signed by federal judge Shamyl Cipriano and seen by Reuters.
Indigenous protesters have been blocking truck traffic at the entrance of Cargill's Santarem terminal in northern Brazil for several days, protesting against plans to dredge the Tapajos river and move even more grains like soy and corn destined for export markets.
Last Friday, a federal court issued a decision obligating the government to adopt measures in 48 hours to remove protesters and restore access to Cargill's facility in Para state.
Federal prosecutors told Reuters they appealed that decision, arguing the ruling ignored norms of the National Council of Justice, which requires the direct participation of indigenous peoples and the holding of mediation hearings before any removal.
That led to the ruling being overturned on Sunday, prosecutors said, before Wednesday's reinstatement offered a win for Cargill.
The prosecutors are analyzing the latest court decision.
Amport, which represents port terminal operators in the Amazon basin, welcomed the latest ruling as "it recognizes the essential nature of port infrastructure and ... the harm resulting from a prolonged shutdown."
On Thursday, local media reported indigenous people "intercepted" barges in operation for Cargill in the Santarem area while they were crossing the Tapajos river.

Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor on US law enforcement radar 15 years before UK arrest
Unknown
Unknown Publisher

04:01:05 KST

While Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor’s arrest by British police on Thursday came after years of uproar over his association with Jeffrey Epstein, documents show he had been on the radar of US law enforcement for nearly 15 years.
Mountbatten-Windsor’s name came up during a 2011 FBI inquiry into Epstein, investigative documents recently disclosed by the justice department reveal. Mountbatten-Windsor has denied all allegations of misconduct related to Epstein.
In March of that year, agents traveled to Australia after an Epstein victim contacted federal prosecutors in south Florida, saying she had “information pertinent” to the late financier and his accomplice, Ghislaine Maxwell.
The victim’s name is redacted from several documents chronicling the interview, but details closely track the public and legal claims made by Virginia Giuffre, a well-known Epstein accuser who died by suicide last year.
Giuffre said Epstein abused her and that he and Maxwell trafficked her to other men, including Mountbatten-Windsor.
During the FBI interview, the woman said that she was a locker-room attendant at Donald Trump’s Mar-a-Lago club in Palm Beach. Maxwell saw her reading a book on massage or anatomy and said she was seeking a traveling masseuse, the woman told investigators.
She told FBI agents she traveled with Maxwell and Epstein to London and that they went to a nightclub with Mountbatten-Windsor and alleged that she and the then-royal engaged in sexual activity at Maxwell’s home. She also alleged that there was sexual activity at Epstein’s Manhattan home, according to the FBI document.
Andrew has repeatedly denied engaging in sexual activity with Giuffre. During his Newsnight interview in November 2019, Andrew insisted he had been elsewhere during this alleged incident, saying: “I was with the children, and I’d taken Beatrice to a Pizza Express in Woking for a party at, I suppose, four or five in the afternoon. And then because the duchess [Sarah Ferguson] was away, we have a simple rule in the family that when one is away the other is there.”
The document does not appear to be online any longer, at least as initially indexed, but the Guardian downloaded the file and its URL is in the Internet Archive. Another document that appears near-verbatim to this one, but with accused men’s names redacted, appears in public records request filings that remain online.
Following Epstein’s arrest, Mountbatten-Windsor appeared to feature more prominently in law enforcement’s inquiries into Epstein, both in private Department of Justice communication and public statements.
An internal DoJ memo dated 19 December 2019 revealed prosecutors were interested in speaking to him. “We are in the process of obtaining the name of a lawyer who represents Prince Andrew. Once we have this contact information, we plan to request an interview,” a footnote in the memo states.
Epstein died in jail several months earlier, while awaiting his Manhattan federal sex-trafficking trial. Maxwell was found guilty in 2021 of sex trafficking for her involvement in Epstein’s abuse of teenage girls.
Geoffrey Berman, who was the Manhattan US attorney overseeing Epstein’s prosecution, repeatedly criticized Mountbatten-Windsor for alleged unwillingness to help their investigation. Berman said on 27 January 2020 Mountbatten-Windsor had provided “zero” cooperation in their Epstein investigation despite his promises to help.
“Contrary to Prince Andrew’s very public offer to cooperate with our investigation into Epstein’s co-conspirators, an offer that was conveyed via press release, Prince Andrew has now completely shut the door on voluntary cooperation and our office is considering its options,” Berman similarly said on 9 March 2020.
“Today, Prince Andrew yet again sought to falsely portray himself to the public as eager and willing to cooperate with an ongoing federal criminal investigation into sex trafficking and related offenses committed by Jeffrey Epstein and his associates, even though the Prince has not given an interview to federal authorities, has repeatedly declined our request to schedule such an interview, and nearly four months ago informed us unequivocally – through the very same counsel who issued today’s release – that he would not come in for such an interview,” Berman said in a statement.
“If Prince Andrew is, in fact, serious about cooperating with the ongoing federal investigation, our doors remain open, and we await word of when we should expect him.”
Contact information for Mountbatten-Windsor’s press representative was not immediately available.

Council CEO hiring process may have broken governance principles, insiders say

Council CEO hiring process may have broken governance principles, insiders say
Redland City Council may have gone against principles of the Local Government Act when it changed a hiring process for a $500,000 CEO job in a secretive meeting, according to sources with local governance experience.
The bayside south-east Queensland council appointed an internal applicant, Louise Rusan, to the $500,000 role in February last year, despite her not being shortlisted by an independent recruiter or being chosen by a panel as a top candidate.
Leaked documents obtained by this masthead showed a process where a staffer who reported to then acting CEO Rusan chaired the panel, and a decision made in a closed-door meeting, forbidden by council policy, altered the agreed-upon recruitment process.
This masthead is not suggesting any wrongdoing on the part of Louise Rusan, just that there were irregularities with the hiring process that saw her installed as council CEO.
Sources with experience in local government processes, granted anonymity to discuss the sensitive matter as they still work in the sector, said the process was worrying, and might not have complied with the principles of the Local Government Act.
The five principles of the act are that councils must ensure processes are transparent and effective, follow good governance, make sure councillors behave ethically and legally, have sustainable development and have democratic representation.
Two sources said it could be argued the council went against at least the first three of those principles by failing to act transparently, and three said it was unusual that the mayor did not chair the selection process.
One source said the second two principles, relating to good governance and ethical behaviour, may also not have been fully complied with.
A council spokesperson said the appropriate processes were followed for the appointment, and the council was not in breach of the principles laid out in the act.
“Anyone with evidence of impropriety by Council should refer the matter to the appropriate authority,” they said.
The documents show that a closed-door meeting decided to wedge Rusan into a final-round interview, going against a council policy that decisions cannot be made in such meetings.
The change irked long-time councillor Wendy Boglary, who wrote to integrity experts employed by the council.
“I am concerned that this deviation from the agreed process, including an inappropriate vote, may have influenced the selection outcome,” she said in an email obtained by this masthead.
In November 2024, the council voted in favour of a process where a panel consisting of mayor Jos Mitchell, deputy mayor Julie Talty, and two external members, and chaired by acting head of human resources Micah Beaumont, would recommend preferred candidates to present to the council.
That occurred, but following presentations by the two chosen candidates, the council decided to eliminate one of the preferred candidates and to hear from Rusan, in a meeting that excluded the independent panel members.
“The majority of councillors supported [the other preferred candidate] but requested to hear from the third ranked candidate, being Louise Rusan,” Beaumont, who reported to Rusan as acting CEO, wrote to the panel following the meeting.
It is unclear how Rusan became the third ranked candidate despite not being on a shortlist for the job.
In her email to the audit and risk committee, Boglary said the altered process opened the recruitment up to political interference.
“Given this was strongly driven by a councillor, Deputy Mayor Julie Talty, it could be perceived as political influence, which, in my opinion, undermines the principles of good governance,” she said, seeking advice about “how to manage the impending risks associated with this recruitment process”.
Talty, who has served on the council since 2012, is yet to respond to questions from this masthead.
Boglary also refused to comment, other than to say her issue was not with Rusan’s appointment but the process behind it.
A council spokesperson said the process followed the organisation’s recruitment guidelines, which do not stop employees with working relationships from being on the panel, but includes conflict-of-interest provisions.
The head of human resources – the position Beaumont was acting in – also chaired the recruitment panel the last time the council selected a new CEO in 2017, the spokesperson said.
Neil Henderson, the state secretary for The Services Union Queensland, who represents workers at the council, said the process for hiring such a well-paid and important position must be “fair, rigorous and transparent”.
“The public should be able to have absolute confidence that persons recruited for such a high-paying important role are the best available for the job,” he said.
Local Government Minister Anne Leahy would not say whether the state should take action at the council, but said the hiring of a CEO was a matter for the council.
A governance adviser was appointed at the council in late 2025 following a year of infighting that saw more than 10 per cent of complaints to the state council watchdog generated from the Redlands.

Voll's first big step in 'massive role' as Australia beats India in second T20

Australia beat India by 19 runs in the second Twenty20 after losing the first game.
Georgia Voll, replacing Alyssa Healy as opener after captain's retirement, notched 88 at Manuka Oval, which is her highest score in the format.
What's next?
Australia plays India in the third T20 in Adelaide before three ODIs and a Test.
As a starry-eyed youngster, Georgia Voll was inspired watching Alyssa Healy thrash the cricket ball around stadiums across the world.
The 22-year-old now feels she has an obligation to keep the legacy going as she prepares to take over the mantle as one of Australia's openers after Healy's impending retirement.
"It's a massive role at the top, to try and fill Midge's shoes," Voll said.
"She's someone who's been incredible for such a long period of time.
"Being a fan of the game and watching her over a long time, and to be able to put my own little spin on it as well has been super fun."
Voll hammered a game-defining 88 from 57 balls to guide Australia to 5-163 in their second Twenty20 against India on Thursday night in Canberra.
Their opponents could not overcome the target, slumping to 9-144 after some tidy bowling by Ashleigh Gardner (3-22), Annabel Sutherland (2-18) and Kim Garth (2-16).
But the victory for Voll meant a lot as it was her highest T20 international score.
But to Voll's benefit, she now gets to work with another one of her idols, Beth Mooney, whose 46 off 39 in Canberra took her past Meg Lanning (3,405) as Australia's greatest T20 run-scorer.

"I've known Moons for a long time and worked alongside her as a 16-year-old," Voll said.
"There's a reason why she's one of the best batters in the world … it's great to have her experience up the other end.
"She's the calm head. When I'm chunking the ball down the leg-side, she comes down and lets me know that it's all right. It turns your headspace."
Voll and Australia are now turning their attention to their final T20 match against India on Saturday in Adelaide, which will also be their fourth-last Twenty20 clash before June's World Cup in England and Wales.
After her side lost their first game of their bilateral series against the women in blue last Sunday, Voll believes they are back on track.
"We've been a part of playing franchise cricket for the last few months," she said.
"It was nice to get out there tonight and show what we're capable of as a group again. I'm sure that I'll take a lot of confidence going into Adelaide."
In announcing her retirement, Healy said she would not play the T20s to allow the team to prepare for the World Cup, but will link back up with the team for three ODIs and a Test.

Simulations shed light on how snowman-shaped body in Kuiper belt may have formed

It is the most distant and primitive object ever visited by a spacecraft from Earth: now researchers say they have fresh insights into how the ultra-red, 4bn-year-old body known as Arrokoth came to have its distinctive snowman-like shape.
Arrokoth sits in the Kuiper belt, a vast, thick ring of icy objects that lies beyond the orbit of Neptune. This region of space is home to most of the known dwarf planets as well as comets and small, solid rubble heaps called planetesimals – the building blocks of planets.
Not all of these planetesimals are rounded: indeed, astronomers estimate 10-25% of those found in the Kuiper belt, including Arrokoth, have two lobes, meaning they look a bit like a peanut or a snowman.
Experts have previously said Arrokoth’s shape, composition and small number of craters suggests both lobes formed at the same time and in a non-violent way, proposing that this could have occurred through a process known as gravitational collapse. However, the details of just how this would have happened have been debated.
Now researchers have used computer simulations to show that gravitational collapse can indeed produce such double-lobed objects, and to shed light on the mechanism.
“It’s so exciting because we can actually see this for the first time,” said Jackson Barnes, the first author of the research, based at Michigan State University. “This is something that we’ve never been able to see from beginning to end, confirming this entire process.”
As Barnes notes, the Kuiper belt is a remnant of the solar system’s primordial protoplanetary disk, within which vast rotating clouds of pebbles are thought to have formed. In the gravitational collapse scenario, gravitation forces within these clouds caused the pebbles to form into clumps, or planetesimals, of different sizes.
Writing in the Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society, Barnes and colleagues report how they ran 54 simulations involving an initial pebble cloud containing 105 particles, each with a radius of about 2km (1.25 miles). This is a low-resolution model of the true situation as it is thought real pebble clouds would have contained about 1024 millimetre-sized particles.
The team found that in some cases two small planetesimals ended up orbiting each other, eventually spiralling inwards until, at velocities of about 5 metres a second or less, they touched and joined, forming a doubled-lobed planetesimal, or “contact binary”.
“Some of the contact binaries in our model look strikingly like Arrokoth,” Barnes said.
He noted that researchers had simulated gravitational collapse before but, unlike the new approach, they did not take into account the physics of how particles rest upon each other when they make contact. As a result, these simulations suggested any collision between smaller planetesimals would simply result in one larger, spherical object.
Barnes said the new simulations were also important because they supported the long-held view that planetesimals in general were formed through gravitational collapse.
Alan Stern, a planetary scientist at the Southwest Research Institute and principal investigator of Nasa’s New Horizons mission to the Kuiper belt, welcomed the study.
“It’s in agreement with previous work and support[s] the hypothesis that Kuiper belt object Arrokoth, which New Horizons explored in a close flyby, is the result of gentle formation processes,” he said.
Alan Fitzsimmons, an emeritus professor of astronomy at Queen’s University Belfast, noted that the simulations only suggested 4% of objects “out there” formed as contact binaries.
“Telescopic surveys imply much higher fractions,” he said. “It may be that Mother Nature prefers other ways of making them, or that future even more complex simulations can close the gap between what is calculated and what we see.”

Extreme heat lab: enduring the climate of the future

What heat does to your body
After the first experiment, Jay explains to me what I just went
through.
"So whenever people think about hot weather, they always talk about
the temperature," he says.
"There's two issues with that. First of all, most people don't
realise that the temperature is measured in the shade.
"So if you're in direct solar radiation, the amount of heat stress
you're exposed to is much greater as it will stress your body out a
lot more."
That explains the heat lamps. And, according to Jay, the other
important variable is the humidity.
"Humidity is the amount of water vapour that's in the air. And the
reason that's important is that the only way in which your body can
physiologically keep cool is that you produce sweat.
"But it's not production of sweat that cools you down. It's the
evaporation of sweat and it's the humidity in the air that prevents
that sweat from evaporating, even though the ambient temperature
might be the same."
So when high humidity goes along with extreme temperatures, your
body can no longer cool itself down, and the heat becomes deadly.
This is why in the next experiment I'm going to experience
conditions at the same temperature as the first experiment, but with
a much higher humidity of 36%.
Even though 36% relative humidity doesn't sound high, at 43C that
means a lot of moisture because warmer air can hold more water. When
it's this hot, sweating isn't going to help me stay cool very much.
Another way to think about it is the "feels like" temperature that
weather forecasts sometimes tell us about. Under the conditions I am
experiencing, the "feels like" temperature is over 49C or 120F.

From the Château de Versailles to the Elysée, the unshakable Catherine Pégard

In cultural circles, rumors had been circulating for several weeks: Catherine Pégard, Emmanuel Macron's culture adviser at the Elysée since September, might replace Rachida Dati at the Ministry of Culture if Dati chooses to fully focus on her Paris mayoral campaign ahead of the municipal elections scheduled for March 15 and 22. For now, however, the candidate for Paris City Hall – whose home and offices were searched in December 2025 as part of a judicial investigation into corruption and influence peddling related to her time as a member of the European Parliament – does not appear to be in any rush to pack her bags. Asked by Sud Radio on November 5 whether it was possible to serve as both minister and candidate, Dati replied without hesitation: "Everything is compatible."
When questioned at the end of December about the rumors that could see her appointed to the Ministry of Culture, Pégard stiffened. "That is not the issue," she replied, her face expressionless and lips tightly pressed together, in her small, spartan office on the first floor of the west wing of the Elysée. At 71, the former political journalist, who served in Nicolas Sarkozy's staff between 2007 and 2011 before overseeing the Château de Versailles for 12 and a half years, was all too familiar with the fleeting nature of political whispers. She had already been considered for the Ministry of Culture in 2022, but Macron ultimately chose his then cultural adviser at the Elysée, Rima Abdul Malak.
She is also well aware that other candidates, with more political experience or stronger credentials, are being considered. Chief among them is the affable Philippe Bélaval, who spent 40 years working in the cultural sector at the Opéra de Paris, the French National Library, the French National Archives and the National Monuments Center. There's only one blemish on his record: In 2016, he failed to take the helm of the Château de Versailles, where Pégard began her second term. A graduate of the Ecole Nationale d'Administration and Macron's culture adviser from 2023 to June 2025, he left the Elysée for personal reasons in the spring, though he remained in charge of the thorny issue of loaning the Bayeux Tapestry to the United Kingdom.

Netherlands to allocate additional EUR 2 mln to help return Ukrainian children
The Netherlands will allocate an additional EUR 2 million in 2026 for the identification and return to Ukraine of children abducted by Russia, including the provision of DNA testing kits, Roos Bos, who is responsible for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs' activities in the area of combating child abduction, reported.
“Children are still being deliberately removed from Ukraine. Some have been forcibly adopted and placed in Russian families. There is only one reason Russia is doing this: the aim is to destroy Ukraine’s identity and culture and undermine its existence as an independent country,” she wrote in a blog on the Dutch government’s website.
Roos noted that most of the funds provided are earmarked for the supply of DNA testing kits, while the rest is for psychosocial support for children.
“The aim is to enable Ukraine to create a DNA database so that children who return from Russia can be reunited with their families as quickly as possible. Some of this financial support also helps provide psychosocial care for children who have returned to Ukraine from Russia. That is vital, because they often come back traumatised by their treatment by Russian occupying forces and authorities, which can include aggressive indoctrination,” she said.
According to her, DNA analysis has so far yielded impressive results.
“Collection of about 2,000 DNA samples from Ukrainian parents looking for missing children (as of late 2025). Collection of genetic material from more than 3,600 personal items belonging to Ukrainian children who have disappeared from children’s homes and other institutions. Identification of children killed in Russian acts of aggression, and the dignified return of bodies to families,” the diplomat noted.
Roos noted that the DNA database helps build evidence of child abductions, which will support prosecution of war crimes by courts, including the International Criminal Court.

'Canary in the coal mine': The possum on the frontline of Australia's extinction crisis

In Brief
- Conservation experts say Australia could lose many of these distinctive species in the near future.
- Researchers say the scale and pace of man-made climate change has made it nearly impossible for species to adapt to changes.
Australia's unique wildlife is facing an escalating extinction crisis, and researchers say urgent climate action and stronger environmental protections are critical to prevent further irreversible loss of Australia's signature biodiversity.
While Australia is famed around the world for its vast array of unique plants and animals, it also has the highest rate of mammal extinction in the world and the second-highest rate of biodiversity loss.
Conservation experts say Australia could lose many of these distinctive species in the near future.
Jess Abrahams, national nature campaigner with the Australian Conservation Foundation, said Australia's wildlife is being sent "to extinction" by climate change and other threats.
"We now have more than 2,300 plants, animals, and ecosystems threatened with extinction in Australia, and the list keeps growing.
"And unless we take some really urgent action to protect these unique plants and animals, our future generations won't be able to enjoy the unique nature that we have grown up with."
Species on the frontline
One animal on the frontline of this battle with a rapidly warming climate is the lemuroid ringtail possum.
The possum, native to north Queensland's Wet Tropics rainforests, is one of 34 species added to Australia's threatened species list as of February 2026.
Stephen Williams, who recently retired as a professor of biodiversity and climate change at James Cook University, has spent around 35 years studying the creatures.
He said he nominated the lemuroid ringtail possum as an endangered species in 2022 after noticing a rapid decline due to heatwaves and an increase in average temperatures.
"We've already lost about 60 per cent of the population of lemuroid ringtails in the last 15 years. And the predictions are that they're going to be almost extinct or extinct by about 2040 to 2050 kind of range.
"The increasing temperature, just the average temperatures across the whole year, decreases their reproductive biology, stops them breeding as much.
"And so there's sort of a double whammy. They're getting increased mortality and you're also getting decreased births. "
Abrahams said the decades of research gathered by Williams and his team showed the possums were constantly migrating higher and higher in their environment to escape the heat.
"It cannot survive under heatwave conditions, and it must climb higher and higher up the mountains to find cooler environments. But so many of our wildlife that are already living in higher altitude areas, when climate change comes, there's literally nowhere higher to climb. They're literally falling off the top of the mountain."
Williams said he didn't intend on focusing his research on the impacts of climate change, but its vast destructive impacts became unavoidable to him as early as 2003.
"I was studying rainforest animals with no intention of working on climate change. We did some analysis which showed that if things continued the way they were going, that about 50 per cent of the species that I worked on would go extinct by the end of this century.
"And that just completely blew my mind and I sort of thought, 'Well, there's not really much point in studying anything else at this stage.'"
James Watson, a conservation researcher from the University of Queensland, said the length of Williams' research offers a unique look at the threats that many other species are likely experiencing without researchers knowing.
"The fear is obviously that the lemuroid possum is kind of the canary in the coal mine. It's well studied. But there are tons of species that we don't know are actually being affected because they're not being monitored.
"So we suspect there's a massive underestimate on the amount of species actually imperilled by climate change."
What can be done to protect the lemuroid ringtail possum?
Abrahams said adding the possum to the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act's threatened species list helps raise their status to a "matter of national environmental significance" protected under Australia's national environment laws.
Australia's federal Environmental Protection Agency is scheduled to begin operations in July after a slate of environmental protection reforms was passed last year, however, Abrahams said the protections under the agency will need to be rigorous.
"There are also new rules and standards under these new laws, and the details of those rules are still being hashed out. But if these rules aren't strong, if they're full of loopholes, well an animal being added to the threatened species list perhaps won't give it the protection that it needs and they will still be at risk from extinction."
'Extreme' changes to climate
Williams said he and his colleagues have spent decades helping the lemuroid ringtail possum and other species adapt, but unless the pace of climate change is slowed by a rapid reduction of carbon emissions in Australia and around the world, their efforts will not amount to much.
"All these adaptation actions that we take in terms of protecting refugia, keeping animals in captivity, moving them around, whatever it is we do, it is still kind of fiddling at the edges a bit.
"It's doing the best we can, but the main thing that needs doing is stopping the temperature going too much higher. We're already at one and a half degrees, which is already a level which all of my analysis over the last 30 years says that the impacts will start to become worse and accelerate rapidly from one and a half degrees on."
Watson said most animals have an inherent ability to adapt to a changing climate, but the scale and pace of man-made climate change has made it nearly impossible for them to keep up with these changes.
He said humans have a duty to safeguard vulnerable animals as best as they can until the Earth can begin to recover from this damage.
"Every species that has evolved on Earth has undergone some kind of pressure from a changing climate simply because the climate is always changing. This climate changing event caused by humans is different. It's more extreme," he said.
"It's going to take hundreds of years for the climate to get back to normal. Even if we stop bad behaviour right now.
"These species are going to have to go through this kind of climate bottleneck, and we have to allow these species to have the best fighting chance."

Starlink loss a blow to Russian forces in Ukraine, say experts
Sign up now: Get ST's newsletters delivered to your inbox
- Elon Musk's Starlink cut-off likely disrupted Russian tactical command, restricting offensive capacity. Ukraine's defence adviser called it a "catastrophe" for crucial drone and command links.
- Russia sought Starlink accounts via Ukrainians and deployed less reliable Yamal/Express satellites. These large antennas are now Ukrainian targets, forcing Russia to move them back.
- Ukraine is exploiting Starlink disruption, regaining territory and launching counter-attacks. However, the overall impact on the conflict remains slow, with no dramatic shifts noted yet.

PARIS - US tech titan Elon Musk’s move to cut Russian access
Here is what we know about the importance of Starlink to Russia and in the Ukraine conflict:
Critical command and control role
Linking Russian drones to the Starlink satellites operated by Mr Musk’s SpaceX company
The satellites are also important for Russia’s command and control, “the organisation of the operational chain that allows the military at the top to give orders to all levels of responsibility, down to the combatants,” said a western military source.
“All armies that have a little money and need bandwidth use Starlink. It’s flexible, it’s not expensive, and it complements military systems that do not allow for increased bandwidth,” the source added.
In the Ukraine conflict, the US satellites “gave Russian units real-time control over their forces and drones, to have an overview of the line of contact” so they could make better decisions, Commander Yuriy Fedorenko, of Ukraine’s 429th Achilles Drone Brigade told Freedom TV.
The satellites are even more important as there is no real front line where the Russia and Ukrainian armies are in contact, according to a high-ranking European officer.
“It is a ‘kill zone’ several kilometres wide, patrolled by drones, where small mobile squads operate, trying to strike here and there,” the officer told AFP.
“Many Russian soldiers constantly move through the area. These are critical points,” Mr Serhii Beskrestnov, a technology adviser to the Ukrainian defence ministry, told AFP.
Blackout fallout
Ukraine says that blocking Starlink has an enormous impact on Russian forces.
AFP has not been able to independently assess the fallout.
“For the Russians, this is not just a problem, it is a catastrophe,” said Mr Beskrestnov. “We knew that they used Starlink on the front”, but “we did not believe that it was this crucial.”
The Russian side played down the consequences. Mr Valery Tishkov, a communications official for the Russian military, said that Starlink was only used marginally and that the army “has all modern, domestically-produced communication services. The operations control system functions reliably and ensures the command and control of troops at the front.”
How will Russia adapt?
According to several Ukrainian sources, Russia has sought to pay Ukrainians to organise legitimate Starlink accounts that it can then use for its drones at the front.
Ukraine’s SBU security service has warned that this is a crime punishable by a sentence jail of life.
Russia has deployed alternative solutions, according to the Ukrainian sources, but these are not as reliable as Starlink’s low orbiting network. Russia has instead used its Yamal and Express geo-stationary satellites that are higher up and there are fewer of them.
“They need a satellite receiver equipped with a large parabolic antenna,” said Mr Beskrestnov.
These are now a prime target for Ukrainian forces and Russia has had to move back the antennae by 10-15 kilometres and deploy reinforced wi-fi from the receivers to the front lines.
“We are trying to locate these terminals,” said the adviser.
Decisive in conflict?
Ukrainian forces regained territory from Russia in February, a rare occurrence during the four years of war when they have gradually lost terrain amidst bitter battles that have cost thousands of lives.
On Feb 5, Russian military observers reported disruption of the Starlink internet terminals used by Moscow on the front lines after Musk took measures following a request from Kyiv.
A senior Ukrainian military official said that counter-attacks had been launched all along the front line in a single day, but gave no further details.
The US-based Institute for the Study of War says that Ukrainian forces are probably taking advantage of Russia’s loss of Starlink.
But so far there have been no dramatic changes. The European military source said that “very few troops are making direct contact with opposing soldiers, and there is no mechanised combat (which could force a breakthrough), so progress is very slow.” AFP

Zelensky discusses impact of Russian attacks with UN High Commissioner for Refugees
Zelensky stated this on Telegram, Ukrinform reports.
"We discussed the consequences of Russia's ongoing attacks on Ukraine's energy system and the assistance our people need. There must be more pressure to stop these attacks and more support for our people – especially those who are currently in Ukraine or planning to return," Zelensky stated.
He expressed gratitude to Salih for his first visit to Ukraine in his role as High Commissioner and for all the support the UNHCR provides to Ukrainians living under Russian attacks.
As Ukrinform previously reported, the United Nations has confirmed that more than 15,000 civilians have been killed in Ukraine since the start of the full-scale war.

Iran and US expand military readiness amid nuclear negotiations

Iran has reinforced key military and nuclear facilities with concrete and earth barriers as the United States increases its military presence in the Middle East and President Donald Trump renews threats of action if talks fail.
New satellite images published by Reuters and verified by BBC Verify show extensive construction at sensitive Iranian sites, including the Parchin military complex southeast of Tehran. Analysts say a newly built structure at Parchin has been encased in concrete and covered with soil, a move designed to shield it from aerial attack.
Al Jazeera reported that the Institute for Science and International Security said in a January analysis that Iran appeared to be building what it described as a “concrete sarcophagus” around a facility known as Taleghan 2. The institute’s founder, David Albright, wrote that the work would provide “significant protection from aerial strikes”.
Images dated between October 2024 and February 2026 show reconstruction after reported Israeli strikes in 2024, followed by the erection of a metal frame, installation of a roof and eventual covering of the site in concrete and earth. Western intelligence agencies have long linked Parchin to past weapons-related research, an allegation Tehran denies. Iran maintains that its nuclear programme serves civilian energy needs.
Further satellite imagery indicates that Iran has buried tunnel entrances at the Isfahan nuclear complex, one of three enrichment sites targeted by US strikes last summer during a 12-day conflict involving Israel and the United States. Analysts cited by Reuters said the entrances were fully covered by early February.
Near Natanz, another major enrichment facility, images show reinforced tunnel openings in a mountain complex about 2km from the main site.
The activity coincides with a significant US military build-up. According to US media reports, Washington has deployed the aircraft carrier USS Abraham Lincoln to waters near Iran, along with guided missile destroyers and dozens of fighter jets. The USS Gerald R Ford is expected to arrive in the region within weeks.
Axios reported that more than 150 US military aircraft have transported weapons systems and munitions to the Middle East in recent days. The Wall Street Journal described the concentration of air power as the largest since the 2003 Iraq invasion. The Pentagon has also repositioned some personnel out of exposed areas as a precaution, according to CBS News.
Speaking at the inaugural meeting of his Board of Peace initiative in Washington, Trump said the United States had “some work to do with Iran”. He repeated his demand that Tehran end its nuclear programme. “They can’t have a nuclear weapon. Very simple. You can’t have peace in the Middle East if they have a nuclear weapon,” he said.
Trump added that negotiations were under way but warned that other options remained open. “We may have to take it a step further, or we may not. Maybe we’re going to make a deal. You’re going to be finding out over the next probably 10 days,” he said.
Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi said after recent indirect talks in Geneva that an understanding had been reached on “guiding principles” for further negotiations. Omani Foreign Minister Badr Albusaidi, whose country is mediating the talks, said discussions had concluded with “good progress” on common aims and technical matters.
Tehran has insisted that any agreement must focus on its nuclear activities and sanctions relief. Washington has indicated that missile development and regional alliances should also form part of any deal.
US lawmakers have reacted to the prospect of military action. Congressmen Ro Khanna and Thomas Massie said they would introduce a war powers resolution to require congressional approval before any strike on Iran. Khanna said the president “can’t” launch a war without Congress.
Iranian authorities advised airlines to avoid certain Middle Eastern airspace during military exercises in the Gulf.
Iran continues to deny that it seeks nuclear weapons. The United Nations nuclear watchdog has previously said it found no evidence that Tehran was actively pursuing a bomb.

Trump changed mind on Chagos deal ‘after UK blocked use of Diego Garcia for Iran strikes’

Donald Trump changed his mind on supporting the Chagos Islands deal because the UK will not permit its airbases to be used for a pre-emptive US strike on Iran, the Guardian has been told.
In his latest change of heart on the deal, the US president said on social media that Keir Starmer was “making a big mistake” by handing sovereignty of the islands to Mauritius in exchange for continued use by the UK and US of their airbase on one of the islands, Diego Garcia.
While Trump had previously criticised the plan, which is backed by the US state department, earlier in February he had described it as the “best” deal Starmer could make in the circumstances.
But in Trump’s post on his own Truth Social site he linked the deal with US military strikes against Iran in connection with Tehran’s nuclear ambitions, which are believed to be imminent. He wrote: “Should Iran decide not to make a Deal, it may be necessary for the United States to use Diego Garcia, and the Airfield located in Fairford, in order to eradicate a potential attack by a highly unstable and dangerous Regime.”
A pre-emptive strike on Iran would be unlikely to be in line with the UK’s interpretation of international law. US bases in the UK, like Fairford in Gloucestershire, the home for US B-2 bombers in Europe, are only used for military operations if the UK government agrees and they are considered legal.
UK government sources said this was viewed as the reason for Trump to again turn against the Chagos plan.
On Tuesday night, Starmer and Trump spoke in a conversation that covered the situation in Iran, although the Downing Street readout of the call made no mention of the Chagos plan.
The hope in No 10 is that Trump will again change his mind. The bill setting out the Chagos agreement is due to return to the House of Lords soon.
There has been speculation that the bill, which is nearing its final stages but was delayed last month amid continued uncertainty about the US position, might have returned to the Lords next week. However, it is now not expected for several weeks.
Under parliamentary rules, if it is not passed before the end of the current parliamentary session in May, the bill would have to be presented again.
One former government official who worked closely on the deal said he was concerned it might be scuppered. Ben Judah, who was until recently a special adviser to David Lammy, the former foreign secretary, told a Sun podcast: “It’s looking tricky for the government to get this deal through in the weeks and month ahead.”
The Conservatives are continuing to push the Trump administration to block the plan, which Downing Street has said can only go ahead with US buy-in.
The shadow foreign secretary, Priti Patel, is giving a speech in Washington DC next week, and is expected to hold talks with US officials about the Chagos plan.
In a statement, Patel said the deal was “now dead in the water”, adding: “It’s impossible for the deal to proceed without the support of our American allies, and Labour will soon run out of time to put anything before parliament.”
A government spokesperson said: “As routine, we do not comment on operational matters. There is a political process ongoing between the US and Iran, which the UK supports. Iran must never be able to develop a nuclear weapon, and our priority is security in the region.”

HUD proposes rule that would force noncitizens from public housing
The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development is proposing a rule that would limit public housing mostly to citizens, which advocates fear could lead to tens of thousand of people being evicted
- Bookmark
The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development on Thursday proposed a rule that would limit public housing mostly to citizens, which advocates fear could lead to tens of thousands of people being evicted.
The rule, published in the Federal Register, calls for limiting funding for those in public housing and other HUD-related housing to citizens and eligible noncitizens. The rule would require every resident in HUD-funded housing to show proof of citizenship or eligible status, including those 62 years and older who previously only had to show proof of age.
The measure would effectively bar mixed status families —- where some household members are eligible for help — from housing and is part of the government’s immigration crackdown. A similar rule was proposed but never finalized during the first Trump administration and is mentioned as a policy priority in the conservative blueprint Project 2025,
"Under President Trump’s leadership, the days of illegal aliens, ineligibles, and fraudsters gaming the system and riding the coattails of American taxpayers are over,” HUD Secretary Scott Turner said in a statement.. “HUD’s proposed rule will guarantee that all residents in HUD-funded housing are eligible tenants. We have zero tolerance for pushing aside hardworking U.S. citizens while enabling others to exploit decades-old loopholes.”
The proposed rule will be made official when it’s published in the Federal Register on Friday. HUD did not answer how long it may take before the rule takes effect.
Housing advocates were quick to criticize the move.
“Our country can ensure that every one of us, no matter where we come from or what language we speak, has a safe home," Shamus Roller, the executive director of the National Housing Law Project said in a statement. “Instead, Trump is trying to evict immigrant families, citizen and non-citizen, from HUD housing.
In December, the left-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities estimated that up to 20,000 families or as many as 80,000 people could lose assistance due to changes in eligibility that would overturn a rule that has been in place for decades.
The impact of the rule could affect many more people who struggle to provide proper documentation. About 3.8 million adults with citizenship lack any form of documentation proving their citizenship, and another 17.5 million cannot easily get the documents.
“Everyone deserves an affordable home, including our neighbors, friends, and coworkers who are immigrants,” said Sonya Acosta, a senior policy analyst with the Center. “This rule would force 20,000 families with mixed immigration statuses to make the agonizing choice between losing the assistance that helps them pay rent every month or separating their family. People without a documented immigration status have never been eligible for rental assistance.”

Schools in England to get budget for children with special needs as part of Send overhaul

Children in England with special needs will receive individual support and therapy directly from their schools as part of the government’s overhaul of England’s special education provision.
Under the plans, mainstream schools will be given commissioning budgets to spend on therapists or additional support, instead of the money being controlled by highly indebted local authorities.
The plans are part of a package of sweeping changes to special educational needs and disabilities (Send) provision that will be announced by the education secretary, Bridget Phillipson, on Monday.
The measures are aimed at fixing deep-rooted problems with the Send system and curbing spiralling costs that have brought several councils to the brink of bankruptcy. Critics of the current system say lopsided funding mechanisms leave hundreds of thousands of children with little or no support in mainstream schools, requiring their families to battle local authorities for help.
But government officials are concerned that proposals to limit who has access to educational, health and care plans could prompt a backlash from parents’ groups and Labour MPs when it comes to a Commons vote.
Some are particularly concerned about plans to test those who hold ECHPs according to the new tougher criteria when they move up to secondary school, while others want to make sure parents can make a legal appeal if they feel schools are not meeting their children’s needs.
Meg Hillier, the chair of the Treasury select committee, said: “The key thing is trust. If parents think their support could be ripped away from them they will worry.”
However, she added that unlike the welfare reforms, over which she led a successful rebellion last year, ministers had been at pains to consult Labour MPs and were not focusing the reforms on saving money.
Another Labour MP said: “The government has got everyone very, very anxious. But the truth is everyone recognises the need for reform and not letting things continue as they are.”
Government insiders say they are optimistic that a rebellion can be averted in part because the Treasury has been more generous with funding than expected.
The full package of reforms will be phased in over a decade, with mainstream schools to make extra provision and support “ordinarily available” to any pupils.
Those schools will also be expected to make “reasonable adjustments” to accommodate children with conditions such as autism, ADHD or mental health issues, or face potential legal action.
That action could involve appealing to an independent ombudsman, or changing equalities rules to make disabled children’s rights more explicit.
Children with special needs at mainstream schools will be eligible for individual support plans (ISPs), which offer enhanced legal rights and assurances without a child requiring an EHCP.
But policymakers say the reforms could be derailed if the government fails to make clear the benefits of the new system, including continuing protections for EHCPs, which agree the needs and support for individual children between families and councils.
The new format for EHCPs will affect children only from 2030 onwards, and will take into account the extra provision available in mainstream schools.
Those involved with the negotiations told the Guardian: “If MPs hear there are protections for EHCPs and there’s more money [in the system], I think they will come onboard.”
More than 480,000 children and young people at schools in England have EHCPs, and reports have concentrated on fears that EHCPs could be curtailed or taken away at the transition from primary to secondary school after 2030.
The first tier equalities tribunal will still be available for appeals involving EHCPs although its role will be “refocused” and take account of the other legal routes available to families.
Ministers will also introduce new price bands for independent special schools, which currently charge more than twice the cost of a state special school on average.
Under plans announced on Thursday, private providers will be forced to comply with set price bands for certain services and will have to sign up to minimum service standards.
Phillipson said: “We’re cracking down on providers who put profit before children. New standards and proper oversight will ensure every independent special school placement delivers real outcomes for children – not unreasonable bills for local authorities.”

In Brief
- The 4.41 per cent average increase comes into effect on 1 April.
- Experts say there are various ways you can seek to save money on your health insurance.
The federal government has approved the largest health insurance premium increase since 2017 in a move Health Minister Mark Butler said reflected the "rising costs of providing medical and hospital services".
The 4.41 per cent average premium increase will be implemented from 1 April.
However, individual policies could increase by much more. For example, financial comparison site Canstar found that despite last year’s average premium increase of 3.73 per cent, the cost of an individual gold policy rose by an average of 11.6 per cent between March and April 2025.
According to Finder, another financial comparison site, 26 per cent of people with health insurance ranked it as one of their top three most stressful bills last month.
Fourteen per cent — or around 2.1 million people — said they won’t be renewing their private health insurance this year.
Canstar analysis found an average-priced gold hospital policy for an individual could increase by $167. For families, the increase could be $330, based on the average yearly wage of $104,807 and applying the relevant private health insurance rebate.
SBS asked financial experts to share their top considerations for Australians amid the premium increase.
What is a premium?
A premium is the amount you pay an insurer for insurance cover. Depending on your individual circumstances, the cost of your premium can change.
Factors can include the type of cover you select, previous claims you’ve made, government taxes, discounts, and any optional benefits you select.
Why are insurance premiums rising?
The increasing cost of medical services, as well as higher claims costs, inflation, and more extreme weather events are behind this year’s increase, said Sarah Megginson, a personal finance expert at Finder.
In a statement, the government said the rise also reflects increasing wage bills and securing the viability of private hospitals.
How will I know how much my premium will increase by?
These are the average premium increases approved for some funds:
- ACA Health Benefits Fund: 4.48 per cent
- AIA: 5.98 per cent
- Australian Unity: 3.98 per cent
- Bupa: 4.8 per cent
- Hunter Health Insurance: 3.92 per cent
- GMHBA: 1.98 per cent
- HBF: 2.15 per cent
- HCi: 4.53 per cent
- HIF: 2.6 per cent
- Health Partners: 3.94 per cent
- HCF: 4.96 per cent
- Latrobe Health Services: 4.53 per cent
- Medibank: 5.1 per cent
- Mildura Health Fund: 4.25 per cent
- nib: 5.47 per cent
- Peoplecare: 4.01 per cent
- Phoenix Health Fund: 2.95 per cent
- Reserve Bank Health Society: 4.13 per cent
- St. Lukes: 4.25 per cent
- Westfund: 3.26 per cent
You can view the full list here. The federal government also has a website where you can compare products.
The government says it is up to each insurer to explain to their policyholders any changes to premiums, the reasons why they have made this decision and their policyholders’ options.
Canstar’s data insights director Sally Tindall said: "Get on the phone to your provider to understand exactly how much your premium is going up by. Then spend 30 minutes doing a health check on your insurance. It could potentially save you hundreds."
What other steps can I take to find out more about health insurance premiums?
Canstar suggests exploring options including reviewing the level of cover and extras insurance, but being wary of the risks that could come from downgrading. The financial comparison site found that if an individual switched from an average-priced gold hospital insurance to the lowest, it could potentially save them $1,397 in a year.
Another suggestion is to pre-pay the next year’s premiums at today’s prices, before 1 April when the increase kicks in. According to Canstar, many insurers will let you pre-pay the next 12 months before they increase.
Megginson agreed and said: "You don’t have to accept the first renewal quote. Comparing policies, increasing your excess where affordable and reviewing whether you need all your current cover can help lower costs."
Changing to an entirely new and cheaper provider is also an option, with some offering the same level of cover you had before.
"Switching to a comparable policy within the same tier can help mitigate or even neutralise the price hikes," Tindall said.
Even just asking about bundling policies and asking about loyalty discounts with insurers can save you money, said Megginson.

At least 4 dead and 50 cars damaged after truck exploded on Chilean highway
Firefighters reported that the blast was felt within a 150 to 200-metre radius

At least four people have died and 17 others have been injured after a liquid gas truck overturned and exploded in Santiago, Chile's capital, authorities confirmed on Thursday.
The driver of the vehicle, who reportedly lost control before the crash, is among the fatalities, a police chief stated.
The incident, which involved a truck affiliated with local gas company Gasco, is now under investigation by the prosecutor's office. Gasco has not yet responded to requests for comment.
Dramatic videos circulating on social media captured plumes of flames rising from the scene in Renca, a northern commune of Santiago, situated near a major highway and industrial zone. Firefighters reported that the blast was felt within a 150 to 200-metre radius, causing damage to at least 50 vehicles.
President Gabriel Boric noted that debris from the explosion struck three local businesses, though no further widespread damage has been reported.
However, the human toll remains severe, with Claudio Orrego, the governor of the Santiago metropolitan region, confirming that five individuals are in serious condition. He added, "One has burns covering 100% of their body with imminent risk to their life."

How Trump is stacking the deck so his ballroom project sails through DC and comes to fruition
Trump said he plans to have the White House ballroom completed within a year and a half
- Bookmark
- CommentsGo to comments
President Donald Trump’s grand $400 million White House ballroom design was swiftly approved by the U.S. Commission of Fine Arts Thursday, clearing the first hurdle to move forward with construction months after he fired board members and replaced them with allies.
A panel of six commissioners chosen by Trump approved the latest and final design despite massive public resistance, while praising the president for designing a “beautiful structure.”
Since announcing his new ambitions for a 90,000-square-foot ballroom in July 2025, Trump has sought to expedite construction of the ballroom, which is nearly the size of the White House residence and West Wing combined.
Trump wasted no time tearing down the historic East Wing, changing initial cost estimates, and stacking two boards tasked with reviewing the construction plans with allies.
Here’s how else the president is making sure his new White House addition comes to fruition:
Demolishing the East Wing
Lawmakers and members of the public were shocked in October when construction teams began demolishing the historic East Wing of the White House – after Trump asserted the new ballroom would not “interfere” with the original building.
White House officials justified the change by saying architects had determined it was more cost-effective and structurally sound to demolish the East Wing.
But Democrats were quick to accuse the president of circumventing traditional processes of seeking permission from the National Capital Planning Commission, Commission of Fine Arts and congressional approval.
The National Trust for Historic Preservation sued the administration, hoping to halt construction. While the East Wing demolition has been completed and is therefore unable to be halted, the judge has not ruled on the new construction.
Installing allies on the Commission of Fine Arts
In October, the Trump administration fired all six members of the U.S. Commission of Fine Arts to make room for new commissioners “more aligned with President Trump’s America First Policies” after public criticisms over the demolition of the East Wing.
Typically, the seven-member panel tasked with giving expert advice to the president, Congress and D.C. government on design and aesthetic matters is made up of individuals with expertise in art, architecture, landscape architecture and urban design.
But Trump has tapped a group of individuals with a range of backgrounds, including some with no experience in the arts, to sit on the commission.
That includes 26-year-old Chamberlain Harris, the deputy director of Oval Office operations with no formal experience in art.
“This is sort of like the greatest country in the world. It’s the greatest house in the world. And we sort of want it to be the greatest ballroom in the world,” Harris said Thursday during the meeting.
James McCrery II, the architect originally hired to design the ballroom, is serving as the vice-chairman of the commission. McCrery stepped down as the architect in December. He has not participated in the review or vote on the ballroom.
The commission is being chaired by Rodney Mims Cook Jr., a developer and designer who founded the National Monuments Foundation. During the hearing, Cook offered Trump generous praise for his design and his efforts to promote world peace.
“No president has really stepped up to the plate to require that this be corrected until President Trump,” Cook said of Trump requesting a ballroom to host formal events.
The other members are: Roger Kimball, a conservative political commentator and art critic. Mary Anne Carter, the chairwoman of the National Endowment for the Arts, previously worked as a policy adviser in Florida. Pam Patenaude, who worked in the Department of Housing and Urban Development during the first Trump administration and second Bush administration. Matthew Taylor, a conceptual artist and film director who previously worked with Rudy Giuliani.
Installing allies on the National Capital Planning Commission
In December, a federal judge asked the government to maintain its promise to submit plans to both the Commission of Fine Arts and the National Capital Planning Commission, which is tasked with reviewing and providing guidance for construction projects on federal land and buildings.
In preparation to have plans go before the commission, Trump installed his former personal lawyer and current White House Staff Secretary, Will Scharf, as the chairman.
James “Michael” Blair, a White House official, has been installed as its commissioner. Stuart Levenbach, the chief statistician of the United States, was appointed vice chairman.
The National Capital Planning Commission is expected to review the design plans March 5.
Using private donors to pay for increasing costs
Initially, the president asserted the ballroom would cost around $200 million and promised to pay for it himself to avoid burdening taxpayers. But that price has doubled to $400 million and now requires donations from private companies and individuals.
That includes tech giants such as Amazon, Apple, Google, HP and Microsoft. Coinbase, Lockheed Martin, Palantir Technologies and T-Mobile are also among the reported donors.
Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, an ethics watchdog group, said the donations raise concerns about corruption.
“All of this money that they’re giving for something that’s important to the president could influence his decision-making, and he could be thinking about that instead of thinking about what’s best for the American people,” Noah Bookbinder, the president of CREW, told Axios.
The president and his allies have said it's necessary to build the ballroom because the White House currently does not have enough space to host large events. Currently, the White House will use outdoor tents to expand space – which has raised security concerns.
Trump plans to have the ballroom built and open to guests by summer 2028, giving builders roughly a year and a half to construct the new event space.

Trump announces billions of dollars in Gaza aid at Board of Peace meeting
Donald Trump announces pledges to a Gaza reconstruction fund during the first meeting of his Board of Peace.
Donald Trump has told the first meeting of his Board of Peace that nine member nations have pledged $7bn to a reconstruction fund for the Gaza Strip, with five countries agreeing to deploy troops to an international stabilisation force for the Palestinian territory.
Addressing the board in a meeting in Washington, DC, on Thursday, the United States president said the US will make a contribution of $10bn to the Board of Peace, although he didn’t specify what the money will be used for.

Kazakhstan, Azerbaijan, the United Arab Emirates, Morocco, Bahrain, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Uzbekistan and Kuwait have raised an initial down payment for Gaza reconstruction, Trump said.
“Every dollar spent is an investment in stability and the hope of a new and harmonious [region],” said Trump. He added, “The Board of Peace is showing how a better future can be built right here in this room.”
The funds pledged, while significant, represent a fraction of the estimated $70bn needed to rebuild the Palestinian territory that has been decimated after more than two years of Israel’s genocidal war.
Proposed stabilisation force
Meanwhile, Indonesia, Morocco, Kazakhstan, Kosovo and Albania have pledged to send troops for the Gaza stabilisation force, part of Trump’s 20-point plan to end Israel’s war on Gaza. Egypt and Jordan have committed to training police officers.
Indonesian President Prabowo Subianto announced his country would contribute up to 8,000 troops to the proposed force “to make this peace work”.
The force, led by a US general with an Indonesian deputy, will start in the Israeli-controlled city of Rafah and train a new police force, eventually aiming to prepare 12,000 police and have 20,000 troops.
While the disarmament of Hamas was a part of Trump’s 20-point plan for Gaza, the group has been reluctant to hand over weaponry as Israel continues to carry out daily attacks on Gaza.
Hamas spokesperson Hazem Qassem said any international force must “monitor the ceasefire and prevent the [Israeli] occupation from continuing its aggression.” Disarmament could be discussed, he said, without directly committing to it.
Trump first proposed the board last September as part of his plan to end the war. But since the October “ceasefire”, Trump’s vision for the board has morphed, and he wants it to have an even more ambitious remit to tackle other conflicts worldwide.
The board has faced criticism for including Israeli representatives but not Palestinians.
Reporting from Gaza City, Al Jazeera’s Hani Mahmoud said that Palestinians want to see concrete solutions rather than pledges.
“Past experiences with conferences, with regard to reconstruction, with regard to the peace process, all ended up with large needs for funding that were delayed or [plans] that were not implemented,” he said.
“Palestinians don’t want to see this again; they don’t want to see the Board of Peace as another international body that falls into the category of crisis management rather than finding a tangible solution to this longstanding problem, the Palestinian problem,” Mahmoud noted.
More than 40 countries and the European Union confirmed they were sending officials to Thursday’s meeting. Germany, Italy, Norway, Switzerland and the United Kingdom are among more than a dozen countries that have not joined the board, but are taking part as observers.

Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor arrest: History of his royal homes – from Wood Farm to Royal Lodge

Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor arrest: History of his royal homes – from Wood Farm to Royal Lodge
Police searches were being carried out at both Wood Farm and Royal Lodge
- Bookmark
Following the arrest of Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor, police searches were being carried out at both Wood Farm and Royal Lodge.
Unmarked police cars were seen at his temporary home on the Sandringham estate in Norfolk.
Plain clothes officers were also at his former residence in Windsor Great Park.
Earlier this month, Andrew moved out of his home in Windsor to the Sandringham Estate.
Here is a look at the history of his royal homes:
Wood Farm
Andrew temporarily relocated to Wood Farm on the King’s private Sandringham estate in Norfolk this month after leaving Royal Lodge, while waiting for his new home, Marsh Farm, to be ready nearby.
His father Prince Philip, the late Duke of Edinburgh, spent much of his retirement at Wood Farm.
The late Queen once said her husband “loved” the property and part of its attraction was because the “sea was so close”.
Located in Wolferton, it is nestled in the far reaches of the vast 20,000-estate.
It was originally a large farmhouse before being converted into two cottages and over the years was used as a regular informal weekend retreat by the royals, particularly for annual shooting parties.
Philip is said to have organised the installation of a new kitchen in the modestly furnished cottage.
Andrew’s ex-wife Sarah Ferguson frequently stayed there alone as a guest of the late Queen over the Christmas period following her separation from Andrew in the 1990s.
While the duchess’s children Princesses Beatrice and Eugenie joined their royal relatives for festivities at nearby Sandringham House, “Fergie” was exiled to Wood Farm, and was not invited.
She described it in her autobiography as a “comfortable open beamed cottage two miles from the ‘big house’”.
Teresa Thompson, the cottage’s retired housekeeper, said after chatting to the Queen at an event in Sandringham to mark the Platinum Jubilee in 2022: “All the royal family love Wood Farm, because it’s out of the way, it’s small, It’s intimate. You haven’t got lots of officials and household, it’s just the close staff.
“And they literally can relax in the family house, it’s wonderful, and I had a wonderful 22 years down there, it was the best time of my life without a doubt.”
In 1917, it was where Prince John, the youngest son of George V, moved with his nurse.
An epileptic, John was kept apart from the rest of his family and died at Wood Farm two years later from a severe seizure at the age of 13.
Royal Lodge
In what was dubbed the siege of Royal Lodge, Andrew faced growing pressure to give up his 30-room mansion after it emerged last year he had been paying a “peppercorn” rent for decades.
He finally agreed to quit the property in Windsor Great Park, Berkshire, for a new home on the King’s private Sandringham estate in the New Year, with Charles personally funding him with an annual stipend.
The secluded 19th century Grade II-listed Royal Lodge is nestled in 98 acres of private land.
From 1815, it was used by Prince Regent, later George IV, as a hunting lodge.
King William IV had it almost completely demolished and rebuilt in 1830.
By 1840 it was used as grace-and-favour accommodation for senior members of the royal household.
In the 1930s, it became the country retreat of Andrew’s grandparents, the Queen Mother and King George VI, when they were the Duke and Duchess of York, and their children Queen Elizabeth II and Princess Margaret learned to swim in its pool as youngsters.
Part of the Crown Estate, it remained the Queen Mother’s favourite Windsor residence for 50 years, and she died there in 2002.
Andrew then took over the home, using it as his main residence for more than 20 years, with his ex-wife Sarah Ferguson also later moving in.
It was previously a distinctive Windsor pink but after Andrew signed a 75-year lease in 2003, he began refurbishments, including painting it white.
A copy of the leasehold agreement revealed he paid £1 million for the lease and that since then, he paid just “one peppercorn” of rent “if demanded” per year.

WASHINGTON, February 19. /TASS/. Qatar, Kuwait, the United Arab Emirates, and Saudi Arabia have announced their intention to allocate a total of $4.2 billion to finance the activities of the Board of Peace for Gaza, according to the statements by their representatives at the Board of Peace first meeting in Washington.
The United Arab Emirates has committed to allocate the largest contribution worth $1.2 billion. "Today, Mr. President the UAE announces a further $1.2 billion for supporting Gaza through the Board of Peace," UAE Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Foreign Affairs Sheikh Abdullah bin Zayed Al Nahyan said. He recalled that Abu Dhabi has allocated $3 billion in assistance to the Palestinian people in the Gaza Strip since the outbreak of the current escalation.
According to Qatari Prime Miniser and Minister of Foreign Affairs Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman bin Jassim Al-Thani, Doha "pledges $1 billion in support to the board of to award mission aimed at reaching a final resolution that fulfills Palestinian aspiration for the statehood and recognition and the Israeli aspiration for security and integration."
Saudi Minister of State for Foreign Affairs Adel bin Ahmad al-Jubeir, in turn, reiterated his country’s commitment to "establishing a lasting and just peace in the Middle East" that will result "in two states, Israel and Palestine, living side by side in peace and security." He also announced the pledge to allocate $1 billion to the Board of Peace within the next few years.
Kuwait also joined the donor states pledging $1 billion to support Palestinians in the Gaza Strip. According to Kuwaiti Foreign Minister Sheikh Jarrah Jaber Al-Ahmad Al-Sabah, the money will be allocated over the next few years.
On January 22, representatives of 19 countries signed the charter establishing the Board of Peace for Gaza in a ceremony on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum in Davos. According to US President Donald Trump, more countries have joined it. While the Board was established under the agreement between Israel and the radical Palestinian movement Hamas to govern the enclave, its mission is expected to extend to conflicts in other parts of the world as well.

Türkiye urged permanent ceasefire, inclusive political process in Sudan
'The efforts of the international partners should turn into an inclusive peace process that will enable a permanent ceasefire,' says UN envoy
HAMILTON, Canada
Türkiye's UN envoy urged a permanent ceasefire and an inclusive political process in Sudan on Thursday, stressing that any resolution must be Sudanese-led to ensure lasting stability.
"Türkiye is gravely concerned regarding the ongoing conflict and the humanitarian situation in Sudan," Ahmet Yildiz said during a Security Council session on Sudan.
Reaffirming Ankara's support for Sudan's territorial integrity, he said Türkiye supports "Sudan's unity, sovereignty and territorial integrity, which we consider very important for the stability of Sudan and the whole region."
Pointing to the role of external actors in prolonging the fighting, he said, "We also note with grave concern the negative impact of foreign interference in Sudan and its implications on the continuation of the conflict, as well as the potential spillover risks it creates on the wider region."
"Türkiye is of the opinion that the most effective way for ending the conflict is dialogue and diplomacy," he noted.
Emphasizing the need for a meaningful outcome of peace talks, he said Türkiye believes "that this outcome cannot be achieved if the dialogue is not owned and led by Sudan."
Calling on international partners to support a comprehensive solution, Yildiz added, "The efforts of the international partners should turn into an inclusive peace process that will enable a permanent ceasefire, followed by a comprehensive political process and accountability."
He also noted that Türkiye continues to provide humanitarian assistance and urged the Security Council to prioritize the humanitarian situation and facilitate Sudanese-led dialogue efforts.

Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor arrested as police raid royal homes over Epstein links
King Charles’s brother is released under investigation after being arrested on his 66th birthday
- Bookmark
Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor was arrested on Thursday – his 66th birthday – and his homes at Sandringham and Berkshire were raided, over his links to the paedophile Jeffrey Epstein.
The former prince was held on suspicion of misconduct in public office over claims that he leaked sensitive documents to the disgraced financier while working as a UK trade envoy.
He was held for 11 hours in police custody while searches were undertaken at his Wood Farm property on the King’s estate in Norfolk as well as his former home, Royal Lodge, in Windsor.
Later, he was seen slouched in the back of a vehicle being driven away from Aylsham police station in Norfolk. Thames Valley Police said he had been released under investigation following his arrest.
King Charles said that “the law must take its course” after expressing his “deepest concern” over the arrest of his brother, who was stripped of his royal titles last year.
Neither Buckingham Palace nor the King was informed of his arrest in advance, with both the monarch and Queen Camilla facing hecklers and questions from bystanders as they continued with their royal duties during a visit to London Fashion Week on Thursday.
The Prince and Princess of Wales have not publicly commented, but are understood to support the King’s statement.
Mr Mountbatten-Windsor’s arrest, the first of a senior royal in modern history, comes after more than 15 years of scrutiny over his ties to Epstein, who died in a US prison in 2019 while awaiting trial on sex-trafficking charges.
In response to his brother’s arrest, Charles said: “I have learned with the deepest concern the news about Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor and suspicion of misconduct in public office.
“What now follows is the full, fair and proper process by which this issue is investigated in the appropriate manner and by the appropriate authorities.
“In this, as I have said before, they have our full and wholehearted support and co-operation. Let me state clearly: the law must take its course.”
Mr Mountbatten-Windsor was arrested at his home after a convoy of police vehicles arrived at around 8am, before he was taken to be interviewed by officers.
The news of the former Duke of York’s arrest comes as pictures circulated online appearing to show unmarked police cars in attendance at Wood Farm, with plainclothes officers gathered outside the property.
In Windsor, vans carrying police officers were seen entering the gates of his former home, where a search is believed to be ongoing. Runners, dog walkers and children on scooters were still roaming the sprawling parks surrounding the residence, while reporters and photographers were held at an outer gate beyond Windsor Great Park and barred from entering.
Mr Mountbatten-Windsor is facing allegations that he shared sensitive information with Epstein while serving as the UK’s trade envoy, which included forwarding confidential documents.
According to the Crown Prosecution Service’s (CPS) website, misconduct in public office carries a maximum sentence of life imprisonment.
Confirming the probe, Oliver Wright, Thames Valley Police’s Assistant Chief Constable, said: “Following a thorough assessment, we have now opened an investigation into this allegation of misconduct in public office.
“It is important that we protect the integrity and objectivity of our investigation as we work with our partners to investigate this alleged offence. We understand the significant public interest in this case, and we will provide updates at the appropriate time.”
Before the arrest was announced, Sir Keir Starmer told BBC Breakfast that “nobody is above the law” when he was asked about Mr Mountbatten-Windsor.
He added: “Anybody who has any information should testify. So whether it’s Andrew or anybody else, anybody who has got relevant information should come forward to whatever the relevant body is, in this particular case, we’re talking about Epstein, but there are plenty of other cases.”
Several police forces across the UK are assessing information released as part of the latest dump of Epstein files, including the Metropolitan Police and forces in Surrey, Bedfordshire, Essex, Norfolk, Wiltshire and the West Midlands.
Thames Valley Police has also said it is reviewing allegations that a woman was trafficked to the UK by Epstein to have a sexual encounter with Mr Mountbatten-Windsor. And on Wednesday, the Metropolitan Police said it was also looking into claims that the then Prince Andrew’s protection officers turned a “blind eye” to his visits to Epstein’s island, Little St James.
Responding to news of Mr Mountbatten-Windsor’s arrest, former prime minister Gordon Brown said he had submitted a five-page memorandum to UK police forces, including the Met, Surrey, Sussex and Thames Valley Police.
“This memorandum provides new and additional information to that which I submitted last week to the Met, Essex and Thames Valley police forces where I expressed my concern that we secure justice for trafficked girls and women,” he said.
Mr Brown previously claimed that the Epstein files showed in “graphic detail” how the financier was able to use London Stansted airport to “fly in girls from Latvia, Lithuania and Russia”, and called for police to investigate.
Separately, Virginia Giuffre, who took her own life last year, alleged in a civil court case that Mr Mountbatten-Windsor had sexually assaulted her. She claimed to have met the then prince while being trafficked by Epstein and his accomplice Ghislaine Maxwell, who is currently serving a 20-year prison sentence. Mr Mountbatten-Windsor has always vehemently denied the claims, but he paid millions to settle Giuffre’s civil case in 2022, despite insisting he had never met her.
Her family welcomed the news of Mr Mountbatten-Windsor’s arrest, stating: “At last, today our broken hearts have been lifted with the news that no one is above the law – not even royalty.
“On behalf of our sister, we extend our gratitude to the UK’s Thames Valley Police in their investigation and arrest of Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor. He was never a prince. For survivors everywhere, Virginia did this for you.”
The King’s brother was stripped of both his prince title and his dukedom last year after it emerged that he had maintained his friendship with Epstein for longer than he had previously claimed.
He does, however, remain in the line of succession – he is eighth in line to the throne, having gradually moved down after being born second in line.
Removing someone from the line of succession is impossible without new legislation, but Labour MP Rachael Maskell and Conservative MP Chris Philp have called for a law change, saying the former duke should no longer be in line to the throne.

Faltering fighter jet deal casts doubt on European defense plans

Faltering fighter jet deal casts doubt on EU defense plans
February 19, 2026The simmering spat between France and Germany bubbled over publicly when German Chancellor Friedrich Merz told the Machtwechsel podcast that the collaboration to build a nuclear-capable fighter jet with France is "not what we currently need in the German military."
The project, known as the Future Combat Air System (FCAS), was launched in 2017 with then-Chancellor Angela Merkel and still-in-post French President Emmanuel Macron, but now looks in jeopardy.
Europe is scrambling to become a resurgent military force in its own right due to significantly diminished trust in the Trump administration's commitment to European defense. Germany pulling back from the FCAS project could be seen as a serious setback to progress.
"The Germans should not make the same mistake as the French did and isolate themselves from the rest of Europe," said Christian Mölling, director of the Berlin-based think tank, European Defence In a New Age (EDINA).
"The defense ramp up we are doing in Europe is primarily a national ramp up, but losing other Europeans politically is not the best way for the joint defense of Europe," said Mölling.
Reducing dependence on the US
Trump's threats to annex Greenland, his administration's wavering support for the NATO military alliance and Ukraine, and his trade tariffs, have caused a shift in atmosphere in Brussels and around EU capitals towards reducing dependence on the US, especially regarding military systems.
"That's why some of Merz's public comments are not so smart," said Guntram Wolff, senior fellow at the Brussels-based Bruegel think tank.
"What you don't want to do is give the impression that you will continue buying American equipment at all costs," said Wolff. "We need to shift away from US equipment, towards European equipment — I think most people have understood that by now."
The US had been concerned that the FCAS programme could result in EU countries halting purchases of American-made F35-fighter jet, but that fear hasn't materialized.
For Christian Mölling, the White House will take a clear lesson from the spat which has erupted between France and Germany on FCAS — "that you can split the Europeans," he told DW.
Both industry and governments clashing
The big sticking point between Paris and Berlin has been the involvement of French arms giant Dassault Aviation, which has demanded significantly more control over the project than the other industry partner, European consortium company, Airbus Space and Defence.
"In recent years, Macron has failed to convince Dassault Aviation not to be a hindrance — once again — to the success of a major European cooperative armament programme," Samuel Faure, an expert on European defense policy at Sciences Po, told DW.
"The pressure is much greater on the French head of state than on the German chancellor," said Faure. "France's budgetary situation is much more worrying than Germany's, and Germany now has a much larger military budget than France."
For Faure, different operational requirements, like France needing the jets to be capable of carrying its nuclear weapons, are not a reason to stop the project.
"This is never an insurmountable problem unless political leaders decide that it is," he said.
That was a position broadly echoed by the CEO of Airbus in a recent exclusive interview with DW.
"It's a danger that if you start on these big European projects, it takes more than political will," said Michael Schoellhorn, CEO of Airbus Defence and Space. "It takes the industrial alignment of the players involved."
EU defense projects unlikely to be harmed
Rearming Europe has not only been a priority for the two biggest economies of the continent but has also for all 27 members of the European Union, many of whom have legitimate concerns about their own safety following Russia's invasion of Ukraine.
The RearmEU proposal, rebranded as Readiness 2030," is the EU's flagship, €800 billion‑scale plan to boost defence spending, pool procurement, improve rapid deployment capabilities, solidify an industrial base for European defense companies, and to support Ukraine.
"But FCAS is deliberately not a European project," said Christian Mölling from EDINA. "If there is a spillover in terms of atmosphere, then possibly, yes, this situation could have an effect on the EU."
"I wouldn't be too afraid," said Mölling. "Nobody was waiting for FCAS to be the solution, the savior, or the avant garde of European defense industrial projects."
System clouds over system hardware
Despite the growing rancor between France and Germany, the general consensus from experts and observers is that while the hardware side of the deal could fall apart, the cloud system it's creating will likely remain on course.
"More important to the Germans than the fighter jet itself is the 'combat cloud', because, not only the French or the Germans, but the Europeans, have to lose something," said Mölling. "There we are also dependent on the US."
The FCAS agreement sets out work on an interlinked drone swarm and a cloud system which links the drones to jets in real-time.
"We need to invest so much more in intelligence — the software bit that connects it all," said Guntram Wolff. "And if that is staying as a really strong Franco-German project, then I think we are actually in very good territory in terms of European cooperation."

New York Gov. Hochul drops robotaxi service proposal for outside NYC in blow to Waymo

03:37:50 KST

New York Gov. Kathy Hochul has pulled a proposal that would have allowed commercial robotaxi services, like Alphabet's Waymo, to start in some parts of the state, according to her office.
"Based on conversations with stakeholders, including the legislature, it was clear that the support was not there to advance this proposal," Sean Butler, a spokesperson for the governor, said in a statement.
Hochul's reversal represents a blow to robotaxi operators like Waymo, which plans to expand its ride-hailing service to several new cities this year.
A Waymo spokesperson told CNBC in a statement that it was "disappointed" by Hochul's decision.
The decision will not affect Waymo's testing in New York City.
In August, the company received its first permit from the New York Department of Transportation to start testing in the city, an approval made under New York City Mayor Zohran Mamdani's predecessor, Eric Adams.
Waymo began testing a handful of AVs in Manhattan and downtown Brooklyn with human safety drivers on board under a permit that was extended through March.
Hochul introduced the proposal during her State of the State address last month. It outlined plans to allow for limited deployment of commercial robotaxis in the state, notably outside of New York City, a huge potential source of rider demand.
Companies interested in piloting their services would be required to submit applications that "demonstrate local support for AV deployment and adherence to the highest possible safety standards," Hochul said in her address.
The proposal drew scrutiny from labor unions, rideshare drivers and transit workers, who raised concerns about safety risks and potential job losses from robotaxis entering the New York market. It also faced the prospect of pushback from Mamdani, who has been a staunch advocate for taxi drivers.
Bhairavi Desai, executive director of the Taxi Workers Alliance, applauded Hochul's move and called it a "sensible decision." The group represents more than 28,000 yellow cab, Uber and Lyft drivers in New York City.
"Waymo thinks by targeting Buffalo and Rochester it can divide and conquer our driver-led movement," Desai said in a statement. "But, once again, billionaire tech bosses underestimate workers at their own peril."
Waymo plans to start its commercial driverless ride-hailing service in several new cities this year, including Dallas, Denver, Nashville, Orlando, and Washington D.C. It also plans to expand to London, its first international market.
"We're committed to bringing our service to New York and will work with the State Legislature to advance this issue," the Waymo spokesperson said. "The path forward requires a collaborative approach that prioritizes transparency and public safety."
The company currently offers 400,000 rides per week across its markets in the U.S., including the San Francisco Bay Area, Los Angeles, Phoenix, Austin, Atlanta, and Miami.
Potential rivals, including Tesla and Amazon-owned Zoox, are testing their driverless systems in the U.S. but do not yet offer driverless ride-hailing services widely. Chinese robotaxi companies, such as Baidu-owned Apollo Go and WeRide, have been expanding abroad at a faster clip than Waymo.
The Alphabet-owned company reported safety incidents involving its robotaxis in recent weeks, including one involving a minor.
One of its driverless vehicles struck a child near an elementary school in Santa Monica, California, last month, triggering an investigation by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.
In a separate incident last month in Los Angeles, a Waymo Ojai vehicle operated in manual mode by a human sped through a one-way residential street near Dodger Stadium.

Airbus aims for record aircraft deliveries in 2026

Airbus announced a record net profit of €5.2 billion for the 2025 fiscal year on Thursday, February 19. This historic result is up by 23% compared to 2024. This far exceeded its previous record of €4.2 billion set in 2022. This increase in profits came despite Airbus missing its aircraft delivery targets in 2025. The company had originally planned to deliver 820 aircraft to its customers, but was only able to deliver 793, due to "quality issues" with A320 fuselage panels announced in December 2025. On Thursday, Airbus CEO Guillaume Fleury said, "2025 was a landmark year, characterized by very strong demand for our products and services across all businesses, a record financial performance and strategic milestones." This optimism was buoyed by a 6% rise in annual revenue, reaching €73.4 billion.
For 2026, Faury anticipated a further acceleration in production, forecasting record deliveries of 870 aircraft, surpassing the level reached in 2019 when Airbus delivered 863 planes to airlines and leasing companies. However, these projections would have been even higher if not for difficulties faced by some suppliers. "Global demand for commercial aircraft underpins our ongoing production ramp-up, which we are managing while facing significant Pratt & Whitney engine shortages," said the company's chief executive.

French prosecutor seeks murder charges over killing of far-right activist

A French prosecutor is seeking murder charges against seven suspects in the fatal beating of a far-right activist that has fuelled political anger beyond France’s borders, prompting Emmanuel Macron to tell Italy’s Giorgia Meloni to keep out of French affairs.
Quentin Deranque, 23, died from head injuries after being attacked by at least six people on the sidelines of a far-right protest in Lyon on 12 February. Most of the 11 suspects who have been detained are from far-left movements.
The prosecutor Thierry Dran told a press conference he had requested murder charges against seven men and recommended they remain in custody to avoid any “disturbance to public order”.
The killing has fuelled political tensions before French municipal elections in March and the 2027 presidential race, in which the far-right National Rally party is expected to have its best chance yet of winning the highest office.
On Wednesday, Meloni said the killing of Deranque was “a wound for all of Europe”.
Macron said there was no place in France “for movements that adopt and legitimise violence” and he called on all political parties to “clean up” their act. “Nothing can justify violent action – neither on one side nor the other, and not even in a head-to-head confrontation that is deadly for the republic,” he said.
Macron also suggested that people should “stay in their own lane”, after Meloni lamented “a climate of ideological hatred”.
“I’m always struck by the fact that people who are nationalists – who don’t want anyone bothering them at home – are always the first to comment on what is happening elsewhere,” Macron said while on a visit to Delhi.
Italy’s foreign minister, Antonio Tajani, hit back, saying the killing of the French activist was “a serious matter that concerns us all”. Tajani said on X that there had been similar incidents in Italy’s history and that condemning such violence aimed “to ensure that we do not return to a terrible past”.
He said there had been “many Quentins in Italy, some during the darkest periods of the republic”.
Macron was “closely monitoring” events, a member of his team said on Thursday, adding: “We must avoid any spiral of violence.”
Eleven people – eight men and three women – were taken into custody over the killing. Dran said that of the seven men who could be charged with homicide, two had refused to speak while in custody.
He said others acknowledged being at the scene and “some admit to having struck blows” but they had all disputed having had any homicidal intent. Four suspects had been released but more were being sought, he added.
Among those originally detained are two parliamentary assistants to Raphaël Arnault, a MP with the hard-left France Unbowed (LFI) party, as well as a former intern.
A lawyer for Deranque’s parents said they called “for calm and restraint”. “The family condemns any call for violence. Any form of political violence,” Fabien Rajon told the broadcaster RTL.
In snap parliamentary polls in 2024, Macron’s supporters and the left, including the hard left, joined forces in an effort to bar the far right from power. But after Deranque’s killing, some high-profile politicians have sought to distance themselves from the hard left, ruling out any possible future alliance.
The justice minister, Gérald Darmanin, called on Arnault to “draw the consequences” if the judiciary “finds serious and consistent evidence concerning him or the aides he hired”.
LFI’s national coordinator, Manuel Bompard, said Arnault would “certainly not” be suspended or excluded from the LFI group in the national assembly’s lower house.
An anti-immigration collective called Nemesis has blamed the killing of the activist on an anti-fascist youth group called La Jeune Garde (Young Guard) that was co-founded by Arnault before he was elected to parliament.

Trump issues 10-day ultimatum to Iran or face ‘bad things’
- Donald Trump issued a new 10-day ultimatum to Iran, demanding an agreement to curb its nuclear programme or face "bad things", including potential military action.
- He made these remarks during a Board of Peace meeting, where he also touted his efforts in the Gaza peace deal.
- Despite ongoing "good talks" between US and Iranian officials, no breakthrough has been achieved, leading to a significant US military build-up in the Middle East, including warplanes and two aircraft carrier groups.
- Trump suggested potential attacks on Iran could originate from Diego Garcia or RAF Fairford, raising concerns about British involvement.
- In response, Iran's Supreme Leader warned of severe retaliation, while Iran conducted naval drills, including closing the Strait of Hormuz and joint exercises with Russia.

Zelenskyy: We expect UNHCR Office to increase its support for Ukrainians
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy met with newly appointed UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) Barham Salih, during which, among other things, the consequences of Russian strikes on the Ukrainian energy grid and the necessary assistance were discussed.
"First of all, I sincerely thank you for your visit and for supporting our people during these difficult days and nights for Ukrainians. We greatly appreciate your support throughout this entire period. I hope we can count on its continuation," Zelenskyy said.
The President noted that Ukraine expects the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees to increase support for Ukrainians forced to live under constant Russian attacks.
"They don't want to stop. We're trying to do everything we can at various levels of negotiations, relying on the support of our American partners. But we feel we need more pressure. And also more support for the morale of our people," Zelenskyy emphasized.
Salih, in turn, noted that he wanted to come to Ukraine at this particular time, in winter, to express solidarity with its people.
"We are proud to cooperate with you. UNHCR will continue and strengthen our support, complementing the emergency efforts of the authorities, and will do more to support resilient communities in the recovery process," he said.

Trump appears to set short deadline for Iran, warning of ‘bad things’
US president said he will decide within the next 10 to 15 days whether or not to strike Iran
The US military is stationing a vast array of forces in the Middle East, including two aircraft carriers, fighter jets and refuelling tankers, giving US President Donald Trump the option for a major attack against Iran as he pressures the country to strike a deal over its nuclear programme.
The deployment is unlike anything the US has done since 2003, when it amassed forces ahead of the invasion of Iraq. It dwarfs the military build-up that Trump ordered off the coast of Venezuela in the weeks before he ousted President Nicolas Maduro.
While the US is not likely to deploy ground troops, the build-up suggests Trump is giving himself discretion to launch a sustained campaign lasting many days, in cooperation with Israel. It would look far different from the overnight strikes the US launched against Iran’s nuclear programme last June.
Trump warned Iran that it must reach a deal or “bad things” would happen and appeared to set a 10-day deadline before the US might take action.
“Maybe we’re going to make a deal,” Trump said in a speech on Thursday morning. “You’re going to be finding out over the next probably 10 days.”

No specific date set for Ukraine's accession to EU – Costa
The President of the European Council Antonio Costa stated this at a press conference in Oslo during his visit to Norway, Ukrinform correspondent reports.
Costa said that EU enlargement is the most important geopolitical investment the European Union can make in the future of peace and stability in Europe, and that the EU is fully committed to the enlargement process regarding Ukraine, Moldova, and the Western Balkans.
He added that he is impressed by what Ukraine is doing during the war in terms of implementing reforms and adapting to European standards in order to become a member of the European Union.
Costa confirmed readiness to officially begin accession negotiations as soon as possible and to move forward in the enlargement process.
He said that he could not say whether Ukraine's accession would happen in 2027, 2026, or later, but emphasized that it is important not to lose momentum or the time and technical work Ukraine is carrying out.
A successful completion of Ukraine's EU accession process is important for stabilizing the country and ensuring prosperity for the Ukrainian people after the war, Costa added, recalling that in June 2022 the European Council decided to grant Ukraine candidate status for membership.
He said that since then, the EU has been working hard, and that it is very difficult and challenging for Ukraine to implement reforms while at war. Costa emphasized that all EU member states will strive to fulfill their commitments.
Regarding Hungary's resistance to Ukraine's progress in accession talks, Costa explained that the EU must deal every day with 27 member states because the Union is based on diversity. He noted that bilateral issues, particularly between Hungary and Ukraine, must be resolved, but reminded that Hungary had voted to grant Ukraine candidate status.
He noted that in negotiations, decisions sometimes require a great deal of time.
Costa recalled that his own country, Portugal, had waited nine years to be admitted to the European Union, and that Ukraine is now moving much faster. He expressed optimism that the EU will be able to achieve success very soon.
As reported, Ukraine's representative to the European Union, Vsevolod Chentsov, said in an interview with Ukrinform that Ukraine's phased accession to the European Union is not a compromise but a pragmatic tool intended to accelerate the country's integration and ensure quality preparation. He noted that the concept itself is not new and has been used in the past.

NABU, SAPO charge four more in case tied to ex-State Property Fund head
Law enforcement officers have notified four additional individuals of suspicion in the case of a criminal organization headed by former State Property Fund chief Dmytro Sennychenko; they are suspected of laundering corrupt proceeds totaling UAH 300 million.
"NABU and SAPO have issued new suspicions in the case of the criminal organization headed by the former head of the State Property Fund of Ukraine. This concerns four individuals involved in the legalization of property obtained through criminal means," the National Anti-Corruption Bureau said in a statement.
According to the report, to launder corrupt proceeds, the suspects created companies abroad and used them to purchase various assets. These included land plots in Croatia, expensive cars, and an entire floor of apartments in a residential building in the United Arab Emirates, among other things. The total value of the laundered property exceeds UAH 300 million.
The identification of new participants in the scheme became possible thanks to the work of a joint investigative team with several European countries.
As previously reported, according to investigators, the former SPFU head, together with accomplices, installed "their own" people as directors of PJSC Odesa Port Plant and PJSC United Mining and Chemical Company. These directors then signed contracts with pre-selected companies and sold products at artificially low prices. The price difference was siphoned off and converted for the benefit of the criminal organization. This caused state losses of more than UAH 700 million. Members of the criminal organization are also suspected of laundering over UAH 10 billion in criminal proceeds. The total number of suspects in the organization's activities now stands at 15.
In May 2024, the High Anti-Corruption Court arrested former SPFU head Sennychenko in absentia. Since April 2023, he has been on an international wanted list. In March 2023, NABU announced suspicion against Sennychenko.

Talarico and Crockett Test How to Convert Huge TikTok Followings Into Votes
Unknown

Few politicians command audiences on TikTok large enough to rival traditional media outlets. But in the increasingly volatile Texas Senate race, two rising-star Democrats have built precisely that kind of reach, turning the platform into a central battleground in their primary contest.
Congresswoman Jasmine Crockett and State Representative James Talarico have TikTok followings that would be the envy of most national political figures. Crockett counts more than 2.4 million followers, placing her among the most followed members in Congress, behind just Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Bernie Sanders. Talarico, a former middle school teacher from the Austin suburbs, is not far behind with more than 1.6 million followers on the platform.
Together, they have amassed the largest TikTok followings of any candidates in competitive statewide races this year, according to a TIME analysis, making the March 3 primary a test of which of their distinct approaches to leveraging viral attention will translate into electoral success in a state where Democrats have not won a Senate seat since 1988.
Crockett’s most watched TikTok lasts just five seconds. Filmed outside the Capitol, she delivers a profane dismissal of Elon Musk with a flicker of exasperation that feels calibrated for the scroll. “F—k off,” she says when asked what she would tell the former DOGE director. The clip from last February has been viewed more than 20 million times. One of Talarico’s most popular videos runs closer to a minute and a half. Standing at a lectern, he argues that “the biggest division in our politics is not left versus right, it’s top versus bottom,” casting inequality as a moral crisis. That video from last summer has drawn more than 15 million views.
The contrast is instructive. Crockett, 44, a former public defender who flipped a Dallas-area House seat in 2022, has fashioned herself into one of the Democratic Party’s most combative messengers. Her televised clashes with Republicans—including a now-famous exchange with former Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene in which Crockett mocked Greene’s “bleach-blonde, bad-built, butch body”—ricocheted across social media and landed her on late-night television. She speaks openly about doing “the edgy things” consultants warn candidates to avoid, arguing that in an era of attention scarcity, bluntness cuts through.
Talarico, 36, offers a different register. He is training to be a Presbyterian minister, and many of his viral moments have the cadence of sermons. He has invoked scripture to criticize conservative proposals and to frame economic inequality as a betrayal of Christian teaching. In one widely viewed video, he criticized lawmakers for advancing a bill requiring the Ten Commandments in classrooms while working on the Sabbath, quipping that they should try following the commandments before mandating them.
Where Crockett’s videos often feel like a punchline delivered with precision timing, Talarico’s resemble closing arguments, carefully paced and morally freighted. Party veterans describe the online spectacle as both exhilarating and unnerving. The reach that once would have required a television buy across Texas’ 19 media markets can now be achieved with a well-timed clip.
TikTok Drama
The rise of candidates like Crockett and Talarico reflects a broader shift in how Americans encounter politics. A September Pew study found that more than half of adults now consume news on social media, and research from Johns Hopkins found that nearly three-quarters of Gen Z Americans say social platforms are their primary news source.
In Texas, that shift has produced an unexpected consequence: the loudest clashes in the Democratic primary have not been between Crockett and Talarico, but among the sprawling ecosystem of creators on TikTok and other platforms who have turned the race into a proxy battleground. Both campaigns recently found themselves consumed by whether Talarico had described former Democratic Senate nominee Colin Allred as a “mediocre Black man.” The allegation began with an interaction with a TikTok influencer and quickly metastasized into days of online recrimination. Talarico has said he had been misquoted and taken out of context.
Kyle Tharp, who closely follows the intersection of politics and online influencers and writes the left-leaning newsletter Chaotic Era, says the Texas race offers a revealing snapshot of a rapidly maturing “political influencer class.”
In recent weeks, he adds, online discourse surrounding the Texas primary has been “defined by drama between political creators,” many of whom publicly feud, criticize rival candidates, and amplify accusations originating far from the campaigns’ official operations.
Both campaigns have sought to cultivate relationships with creators by offering access to events or messaging, even as the financial relationships behind some online advocacy remain opaque. “We have no idea who is being paid by what campaign or affiliated PACs or groups,” Tharp says, describing what he called an emerging “undisclosed creator payment ecosystem.”
The Talarico campaign declined to comment for this story. The Crockett campaign did not respond to a request for comment, though a spokesperson previously told the Texas Tribune that her campaign does not pay for any content creators.
“If you think this is messy,” Tharp added, “just wait until there’s 30 Democrats running for president all trying to secretly pay these influencers to fight each other on their behalf.”
Polling suggests that TikTok is more than just a sideshow in the race. A recent survey from Texas Public Opinion Research found that 47% of likely Democratic primary voters said they had recently seen or heard from Crockett on social media; 35% said the same of Talarico. Digital platforms were the leading source of exposure for both candidates, outpacing cable and broadcast news. In a state with chronically low turnout and a large population of younger, less consistent voters, that kind of visibility is no small asset, says Luke Warford, a Democratic strategist who leads a political action committee focused on turning Texas blue and separately runs the Texas Public Opinion Research.
“The two things that candidates most need to do to be effective in 2026 is get attention and raise money,” says Warford. “Talarico and Crockett are two of the most effective TikTok communicators in the country and they've both been able to translate their ability to get attention on TikTok into really strong fundraising.”
A Colbert Bump
The primary fight between the two Texas Democrats has been among the most closely watched of the midterms thus far, becoming a national story this week after TV host Stephen Colbert alleged CBS blocked him from airing his interview with Talarico, a charge CBS has denied. The ensuing drama has drawn millions of viewers to the interview segment on YouTube, and has spurred a fundraising boom for Talarico. A clip of the interview Talarico posted on TikTok received more than 1 million views.
Yet polls show the race is either tied, or Crockett is several points ahead. Asked who is more likely to energize the Democratic base, voters give Crockett the edge according to most polling data. But when asked who is better positioned to appeal to the broader coalition needed to win statewide in November, Talarico holds a slight advantage. The primary, in effect, has become a referendum on two competing theories of Democratic revival in Texas: mobilization versus persuasion.
Crockett has embraced a turnout argument, contending that Texas is less a red state than a low-participation one, and that inspiring infrequent voters—particularly voters of color—is the key to breaking the Republican hold on statewide offices. Critics counter that past statements like her calling conservatives “inherently violent” and saying Latino Trump supporters have a “slave mentality,” will make for easy and effective attack ads in the fall.
“Our goal is to make sure that we can engage people that historically have not been talked to, because there’s so many people that get ignored, specifically in the state of Texas,” Crockett told CNN, adding that her strategy is to appeal to people who “vote for who they believe is fighting for them.”
Talarico argues that Democrats must broaden their appeal in a culturally conservative state. His religious language is not incidental but strategic, an attempt to compete on moral terrain that Republicans have long attempted to dominate.
The general election landscape adds another layer of unpredictability. Republicans are engaged in their own bruising contest between incumbent Senator John Cornyn, Attorney General Ken Paxton, and Congressman Wesley Hunt. Democrats see an opening, as they have before. Yet history weighs heavily: no Democrat has won a statewide federal race in Texas in more than three decades.
The unanswered question hanging over the race is whether cultural prominence can be alchemized into durable political power. A TikTok following may signal authenticity, charisma or anger at the status quo. It does not, on its own, build a turnout operation across a state with 254 counties.
“Every data point we get suggests that 2026 is going to be some sort of wave year,” Warford says. “The biggest question is: How big of a wave? What you're seeing on TikTok is that people are fighting this hard because they actually think that whoever becomes the nominee might have a shot of winning in November.”

Issuance by Russia of license to operate power unit No. 2 of Zaporizhia NPP has no legal basis – Greenpeace Ukraine

Issuance by Russia of license to operate power unit No. 2 of Zaporizhia NPP has no legal basis – Greenpeace Ukraine
The issuance by the Russian nuclear regulator Rostekhnadzor of a license to operate power unit No. 2 of the Zaporizhia Nuclear Power Plant (ZNPP) has no legal basis either in Ukraine or in international jurisdiction, Greenpeace Ukraine believes.
According to the organization's release Thursday, Rostekhnadzor, like Rosatom, is a criminal organization, and the signing of a license for a facility that has been under occupation for nearly four years and where reactor maintenance has been destroyed has no safety justification. Earlier, on December 23, 2025, Rostekhnadzor had already issued a similar illegal license for Unit No. 1 of the Zaporizhia Nuclear Power Plant.
"The idea that Russia has any right to issue an operational license for Ukraine’s nuclear plant at Enerhodar is outrageous. But is not surprising given the scale of their criminal operations at the plant since 2022," said Shaun Burnie, senior nuclear specialist of Greenpeace Ukraine.
According to a new satellite study conducted in 2025 by McKenzie Intelligence Services (MIS) on behalf of Greenpeace Ukraine, systematic militarization and disregard for nuclear safety principles have been documented at the plant. In particular, satellite analysis showed that the surface area of the cooling pond decreased by more than 100,000 square meters during the summer of 2025.
Greenpeace Ukraine added that new fortified military positions and anti-drone structures have also appeared around the facility.
The organization noted that the issuance of an operating license does not mean the Zaporizhia Nuclear Power Plant's reactors face an immediate threat of restart. The term "operating license" refers to the reactors in their current mode, which since 2022 has primarily been a "cold shutdown" state.
Additionally, Rosatom has declared its illegal intention to restart the reactors. However, the scale of safety concerns at the plant is extraordinary.
"This is also a further example of the dangerous nuclear disinformation campaign by Rosatom to try and convince the world that all is proceeding as normal at the plant... There is nothing normal about a full scale military occupation of Europe’s largest nuclear plant," said Jan Vande Putte of Greenpeace Ukraine.
He also noted that since 2022, torture and intimidation of Ukrainians by Russian forces, facilitated by Rosatom, have been widely employed on the grounds of the Zaporizhia Nuclear Power Plant, and that the plant itself is being used as a military platform for attacks on and killings of Ukrainian civilians in Nikopol and other regions of Ukraine.
As previously reported, during negotiations in early February, Moscow rejected a U.S. proposal, put forward as part of a peace deal, for full American control over the Zaporizhia Nuclear Power Plant, which would have given the United States the right to distribute the plant's energy between Ukraine and Russia.

Moldovan gas reserves almost used up, 8 mcm remains
Moldova's gas reserves for the current heating season decreased from 101.2 million cubic meters (mcm) on November 1, 2025 to 7.8 mcm on February 18, CEO of state-owned company Energocom Eugeniu Buzatu said at a meeting of Moldova's parliament.
"As of February 18, 2026, the remainder of the gas reserve decreased to 83,400 MWh or around 7.84 mcm, showing a drastic decline since the beginning of the cold season," Buzatu is quoted as saying by the bani.md publication.
He said that 13.6 mcm had been taken from gas storage facilities in November, 14.24 mcm in December, 41.6 mcm in January and 24 mcm from February 1 to February 18.
Moldova keeps gas reserves in underground storage facilities in Ukraine and Romania.
In November, Moldovan Energy Minister Dorin Junghietu said that Energocom had signed contracts to have over 700 mcm of gas delivered during the heating season. According to data from Energocom, the gas is acquired with firm delivery in the corresponding month of consumption and is bought at both fixed and indexed prices, which are correlated with the quotations of the main stock exchanges in Central and Southeastern Europe - TTF (Title Transfer Facility) in the Netherlands and BRM (Romanian Commodity Exchange) in Romania.
Moldova consumes 0.8-0.9 billion cubic meters (bcm) of gas each year.

Hamas condemned the Palestinian Authority after security forces conducted an arrest operation in the West Bank that led to the accidental death of two children, aged 16 and four, this week.
Hamas cited the incident as a reason to end security coordination with Israel, describing it as a “serious crime” and a “black mark” on the PA’s record, saying the establishment “used force against their own people instead of protecting them”.
Palestinian media, citing the family, reported that PA masked officers waited at a junction for 44-year-old Samer Samara to drive by before opening fire in the direction of his car, where he was driving his children.
It is unclear who Samara was wanted by
After the incident, the PA expressed “deep regret” for the event, saying the two were shot dead during an operation to arrest their father in Tubas.
While the PA confirmed Samara was a wanted individual, it is unclear what his crimes were, though Palestinian reports claimed he had ties to Islamic Jihad and had been arrested by Israeli forces several times.
Samara's family released a statement demanding that he be released immediately and that those responsible for the killings be held accountable.

Trump asks Board of Peace members about Guns n Roses during photo op
This is what Donald Trump asked world leaders whilst standing on stage for a photo opportunity at his inaugural Board of Peace meeting.
On Thursday (19 February), delegates from nearly 50 countries gathered for the first Board of Peace meeting in Washington. Twenty-seven of the countries have joined the board, whilst the others came as observers.
As members gathered on stage for a picture, Guns N’ Roses’ “November Rain” played. “Does everybody like the music?” he asked, which was met with nods and approval. “It’s good music,” he said.
Guns N’ Roses has repeatedly voiced their opposition to the Trump administration using their music as part of their campaign.

Israeli FM Sa'ar honors fallen IDF soldiers, thanks Trump for Board of Peace

Israeli Foreign Minister Gideon Sa'ar recalled the sacrifice of the 925 IDF soldiers killed in the Israel-Hamas war in his speech to US President Donald Trump's Board of Peace at its inaugural meeting in Washington, DC, on Thursday.
Trump gave the first address at the meeting, followed by several officials from participating countries, including Israeli FM Sa'ar.
"As I stand here," Sa'ar said, "I recall the 925 brave soldiers that gave their lives in a war against pure evil: Hamas, Islamic Jihad, and Hezbollah. These are the best people."
"They went from front to front and charged forward under enemy fire," the foreign minister added," To them we owe our existence and all our achievements. They will not be forgotten."
Sa'ar was highly complimentary toward President Trump for spearheading the peace initiative in Gaza.
"President Trump," he said, "This is an important day. Your historic actions have proven time and again: You are a leader who takes initiative, forges new paths, and works toward a better future for the entire world."
Sa'ar's statements covered the atrocities of October 7 and the ensuing war, and the steps that Trump, Israel, and the BoP plan to take toward imminent peace, emphasizing disarmament of Hamas and de-radicalization of the Gazan Palestinian population.
"The infrastructure that indoctrinates Palestinian children to hate and kill Jews - in educational and religious institutions - should no longer exist," he said.
The foreign minister ended his speech expressing gratitude toward President Trump. "President Trump’s visionary leadership creates, for the first time, an opportunity for a better future," he said.
On behalf of Israel, I say: Thank you, Mr. President, for your leadership."
Trump presides over Board of Peace,
Trump's International Board of Peace, which is meant to supervise Gaza's transitional governance, held its inaugural meeting in Washington on Thursday.
Trump told the first meeting of his Board of Peace on Thursday that nations had contributed $7 billion to a Gaza reconstruction fund that aims to rebuild the enclave once Hamas disarms.
Hamas previously said it is ready to hand over administration of the enclave to a US-backed committee of Palestinian technocrats headed by Ali Shaath, a former Palestinian Authority official in the occupied West Bank. But it says Israel has not yet allowed committee members to enter Gaza to assume their responsibilities.
The appointment of Shaath's committee in January marked the start of the next phase of Trump's plan to end the war in Gaza, even as key elements of the first phase - including a complete cessation of hostilities between Israel and Hamas - remain unfulfilled.
The meeting in Washington came amid a broader push by Trump to build a reputation as a peacemaker in hopes of winning the Nobel Peace Prize. It also took place as the United States threatens war against Iran and has embarked on a massive military buildup in the region in case Tehran refuses to give up its nuclear program.

Uganda to build statue in memory of Yoni Netanyahu at site of daring hostage rescue - report

Uganda will soon build a statue honoring Lt.-Col. Yonatan “Yoni” Netanyahu at Entebbe International Airport, Uganda’s Chief of Defence Forces, Gen. Muhoozi Kainerugaba, said in a Thursday post on X, at what he described as the exact spot where Netanyahu was killed during the 1976 hostage rescue operation.
Kainerugaba, the son of Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni, framed the proposed monument as a symbol of ties between Uganda and Israel. He did not provide a date for an unveiling, and no formal Ugandan government announcement was immediately available.
Netanyahu, the older brother of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, was the only Israeli soldier killed in the raid, which freed Jewish hostages held at Entebbe after the hijacking of an Air France flight in 1976.
In Israel, the Entebbe operation remains a defining moment in national memory, and Yoni Netanyahu’s role and sacrifice to ensure the mission's success are an integral part of the story.
Israeli officials have previously marked Entebbe anniversaries in Uganda, including Prime Minister Netanyahu’s 2016 visit to a memorial ceremony at the airport and his public remarks there.
The proposed statue, if advanced, would come against that backdrop of longstanding Israeli commemoration of the raid and periodic diplomatic engagement with Uganda around the anniversary.
The 1976 Entebbe Hijacking
Air France Flight 139, the plane at the center of the 1976 Entebbe hijacking, was seized by four hijackers, two Palestinians affiliated with the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine, External Operations (PFLP-EO), and two Germans from the Revolutionary Cells. The attackers are widely identified as Wilfried Böse and Brigitte Kuhlmann of the Revolutionary Cells, along with Fayez Abdul-Rahim al-Jaber and Jayel (also reported as Jael or Jalil) al-Arja from the PFLP-EO.
There, the hijackers separated roughly 100 Jewish and Israeli hostages from other passengers and demanded the release of dozens of prisoners, before Israeli forces launched the long-range rescue on July 4, flying about 4,000 km to Entebbe and freeing almost all the hostages in a raid that lasted less than 90 minutes.

West Virginia sues Apple over iCloud's alleged role in distributing child sex abuse material

The office of West Virginia's attorney general said it has filed a lawsuit accusing Apple of allowing its iCloud service to become what the company's internal communications described as the "greatest platform for distributing child porn."
Attorney General JB McCuskey, a Republican, accused Apple of prioritizing user privacy over child safety, his office said in a statement on Thursday. It is called the first of its kind by a government agency over the distribution of child sexual abuse material on Apple's data storage platform.
Apple has previously denied wrongdoing in a lawsuit by private plaintiffs making similar claims.
The company has considered scanning images but abandoned the approach due to concerns about user privacy and safety, including worries that it could be exploited by governments seeking other material for censorship or arrest, Reuters has reported.
"These images are a permanent record of a child's trauma, and that child is revictimized every time the material is shared or viewed," McCuskey said in the statement. "This conduct is despicable, and Apple's inaction is inexcusable."
His office cited a text message Apple's then anti-fraud chief sent in 2020 stating that because of Apple's priorities, it was "the greatest platform for distributing child porn."
The state said it is seeking statutory and punitive damages, and that the lawsuit filed in Mason County Circuit Court asks a judge to order Apple to implement more effective measures to detect abusive material and to adopt safer product designs.
Alphabet's Google, Microsoft, and other platform providers check uploaded photos or emailed attachments against a database of identifiers of known child sex abuse material provided by the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children and other clearing houses.
Until 2022, Apple took a different approach. It did not scan all files uploaded to its iCloud storage offerings, and the data was not end-to-end encrypted, meaning law enforcement officials could access it with a warrant.
Reuters reported in 2020 that Apple planned to implement end-to-end encryption for iCloud, which would have rendered data unusable by law enforcement officials. It abandoned the plan after the FBI complained it would harm investigations.
Implementing Communication Safety to blur nudity
In August 2021, Apple announced NeuralHash, designed to balance child abuse material detection with privacy by scanning images on users' devices before upload.
The system was criticized by security researchers who worried it could yield false reports of abusive material, and it sparked a backlash from privacy advocates who claimed it could be expanded to permit government surveillance.
A month later, Apple delayed the introduction of NeuralHash before canceling it in December 2022, the state said in its statement. That same month, Apple launched end-to-end encryption for iCloud data.
The state said NeuralHash was inferior to other tools and could be easily evaded. It said Apple stores and synchronizes data through iCloud without proactive abuse material detection, allowing such images to circulate.
While Apple did not go through with the effort to scan images being uploaded to iCloud, it did implement a feature called Communication Safety that blurs nudity and other sensitive content being sent to or from a child's device.
Federal law requires US-based technology companies to report abuse material to the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children. Apple in 2023 made 267 reports, compared to 1.47 million by Google and 30.6 million by Meta Platforms, the state said.
The state's claims mirror allegations in a proposed class action lawsuit filed against Apple in late 2024 in federal court in California by individuals depicted in such images.
Apple has moved to dismiss that lawsuit, saying the firm is shielded from liability under Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, a law that provides broad protections to internet companies from lawsuits over content generated by users.

Rachael Maza on sisterhood, truth-telling and new play Black Light
Unknown
Unknown Publisher

03:30:00 KST

Sisters Lisa and Rachael Maza reunite on stage for the world premiere of Black Light
The first day of rehearsal is always the best and worst day of the creative process for Rachael Maza.
"It's the first time you hear your voice out loud, and the entire theatre company's there watching," she tells ABC Radio National's Awaye.
"But it's also super exciting because you're beginning this massive journey."
The Yidinji/Meriam/Dutch actor — who recently stepped away from renowned Indigenous theatre company Ilbijerri after 18 years as artistic director — was especially excited to start rehearsing Black Light, which opened at Melbourne's Malthouse Theatre this week.
It's the first time Maza has shared the stage with her younger sister Lisa since the play they co-wrote wrapped in late 2009. And, just as they did in Sisters of Gelam, the pair are playing sisters.
Black Light follows four women — Bub, Mum, Aunty and Nan — who are stuck in a family home on the outskirts of Darwin, waiting out what seems to be a natural disaster.
Rachael and Lisa have taken on the roles of Aunty (Rachael) and Mum (Lisa), who bicker over everything from groceries to caring responsibilities for their mother (Trisha Moreton-Thomas; Kangaroo).
For Maza, having the chance to work with her sister on a new show has been "pretty cool".
"There's a real familiarity that means that we can just get on with the work," Maza says.
And that work never stops.
"Even over lunch, we're still talking about it. And when we go home we're still talking about it."
Parallel careers
Maza says she has an "incredible, easy relationship" with Lisa — something she in part credits to their shared love of music and live performance as teenagers.
"There was a moment, a really distinct turning point in our kind of fractious relationship as siblings, where suddenly Lisa and I really honed in and became best buddies and really shared a lot of interests when we started going out and seeing bands," she says.
"We definitely have our moments but it's great. It's so easy. We kind of can finish each other's sentences. It's a classic sibling relationship. We just know each other so well."
The sisters each have stage and screen acting credits stretching back to the 90s.
Both have starred in productions of beloved family drama Radiance (Rachael in 1993 and Lisa in 1997), the seminal Stolen Generations play Stolen (Rachael in 2003-4 and Lisa in 1999 and 2002), and hit Indigenous musical The Sapphires (Rachael in 2005 and Lisa in 2011).
They've also sung together for most of their lives.
First, at the behest of their late father who would play guitar and encourage them to sing along. Later, they formed the Maza Sisters and performed at a number of festivals and events including the 150th anniversary of the National Gallery of Victoria in 2011 and the Dreaming Festival in 2009.
That same year, their play Sisters of Gelam brought together cabaret, puppetry, dance and spoken word to tell the story of two sisters who decide to journey together to their grandfather's Country on Mer (Murray Island) in the Torres Strait.
"Working together [on Black Light] is just a kind of continuation of that closeness that we've had since we first started going out and seeing bands together [as teenagers]," Maza explains.
Their closeness allows the Maza sisters to bring some real fire to their characters' squabbles in Black Light.
"We can just bust out screaming at each other and there's no 'I hope you didn't take that the wrong way'," Maza says.
"There's none of that because we know who we are, we know our relationship and we know we're acting."
'Poetically bold'
There's plenty for Maza to sink her teeth into in Black Light.
Written and directed by critically acclaimed playwright Jada Alberts (Brothers Wreck), the show doesn't just explore the lived experience of Blak sisterhood but also honours Blak motherhood.
"Women are the pillars and the centre of our families, the pillar and the centre and the anchor of our communities," Maza says.
Loading..."And it's a theme that we as Blakfullas particularly gravitate towards and we can all relate to it."
The experiences of three generations of Blak women are represented in the play, as well as their sometimes complicated relationships to one another.
While those experiences and relationships resonate deeply with Maza, they're brought to life on stage in new and inventive ways.
"[The play is] really quite poetically bold in its form," she says.
That's best demonstrated by the character of Nan.
At times, Nan seems to represent the loss of language and cultural knowledge, yet at others, she steps out of her wheelchair and becomes "the deep, timeless placeholder of knowledge".
"Jada really gives us full access, so, it becomes incredibly powerful, incredibly beautiful," Maza says.
"It's like those experiences that you have of Country, for instance, and you can't find the words for it but you feel it in every cell of your being."
Maza reckons the almost magical realist style in Black Light is a step forward for Blak theatre, from the early days of "naturalistically telling our stories with truth-telling at its core" to pushing against the boundaries of form.
"It's really, really incredible and very intentional what [Alberts] is exploring within this work," she says.
Change better than a holiday
Returning to the stage in such an ambitious work is a thrill for Maza.
It comes just two months after she stepped away from Ilbijierri. While some might have expected Maza to take a break after handing the reins to new artistic director Andrea James, that isn't her style.
"Not being an artistic director and just being an actor actually is a holiday," Maza says. "[It's] an opportunity to just go into my actor bubble and explore.
"The world of an artistic director is you've constantly got 12 things on the go and looking after a team of people. To suddenly not have to be thinking about that is like a holiday.
"And look, to be honest, I couldn't think of anything worse than lying on a beach. That would just bore me."
Black Light is at Malthouse Theatre, Melbourne, until March 7.

Timeline of Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor’s scandals as royal arrested on his birthday amid Epstein allegations
Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor has seen his reputation damaged over his friendship with paedophile Jeffrey Epstein
- Bookmark
Widely purported to have been the late Queen’s “favourite” child, Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor has suffered a sharp fall from grace over the past decade.
Plagued by a string of controversies, the latest blow has seen him arrested on suspicion of misconduct in public office following allegations he shared sensitive information with paedophile financier Jeffrey Epstein while serving as the UK’s trade envoy.
Thames Valley Police confirmed the arrest on Thursday following claims made against the former prince after the release of millions of pages of files related to Epstein, which included messages between the two sent months after Mr Mountbatten-Windsor claimed to have ended his friendship with the convicted sex offender.
The arrest comes as pictures circulated online appearing to show unmarked police cars attending Wood Farm on the Sandringham Estate in Norfolk, with plain-clothed officers gathering outside Mr Mountbatten-Windsor’s home on his 66th birthday.
Thames Valley Police previously said the force was also reviewing allegations that a woman was trafficked to the UK by Jeffrey Epstein to have a sexual encounter with Mr Mountbatten-Windsor. The King’s brother has consistently denied any wrongdoing.
Emails between Mr Mountbatten-Windsor and Epstein reportedly show that he and Epstein were still exchanging messages until at least late February 2011, when the duke wrote: “Keep in close touch, and we’ll play some more soon.”
As a result, he was stripped of his remaining royal titles in October and was forced to leave his Windsor home, Royal Lodge, to relocate to a smaller privately funded address in Sandringham.
With the release of the so-called Epstein files and Virginia Giuffre’s posthumous memoir, his relationship with the financier, who took his own life in 2019, has increasingly made its way into the headlines.
In her book, Giuffre claims that Mr Mountbatten-Windsor considered it his “birthright” to sleep with her when she was 17 years old. While recognising that Giuffre may well be a victim of abuse by Epstein, Mr Mountbatten-Windsor has always denied her allegations against him.
Mr Mountbatten-Windsor’s ties to the convicted paedophile eventually forced him to step down from his royal duties, and in January 2022, he was stripped of his royal patronages.
In the years since, he has faced a number of other scandals, including a “close confidante” of his being banned from the UK over allegations he was a Chinese spy.
Here, The Independent takes a look at a timeline of Mr Mountbatten-Windsor’s fall from grace and his retreat from the public eye.
Queen’s favourite
The Queen stood by Mr Mountbatten-Windsor’s side even when he was caught up in the Jeffrey Epstein scandal in 2019 and “stepped back from royal duties for the foreseeable future”.
In October 2021, it was claimed that the monarch intended to spend millions of pounds privately funding her son’s defence against allegations of sexual abuse made by Epstein victim Virginia Giuffre.
She also signalled her support for her disgraced son by arriving alongside him for Prince Philip’s memorial service in March 2021.
Mr Mountbatten-Windsor provided a steady arm for the Queen as she walked into Westminster Abbey to remember the life of her husband, just a few weeks after he reached a multimillion-pound out-of-court settlement with Giuffre.
Friendship with Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell
During his 2019 interview with BBC Newsnight, Mr Mountbatten-Windsor said he had known British socialite Ghislaine Maxwell, the daughter of media magnate and former MP Robert Maxwell, since she was at university.
She introduced Mr Mountbatten-Windsor to her then-boyfriend Jeffrey Epstein in 1999. The trio enjoyed a close friendship, even after Epstein was convicted of procuring a child for prostitution and of soliciting a prostitute in 2008.
Mr Mountbatten-Windsor is alleged to have personally invited the couple to Balmoral, the Queen’s Scottish residence, in 1999.
Maxwell was sentenced to 20 years in prison in June 2022 following a New York sex-trafficking trial for procuring teen girls for Epstein to abuse.
Mr Mountbatten-Windsor continued to visit Epstein in New York after the financier’s conviction for child sex offences in 2008.
Epstein received an 18-month sentence but was allowed to go on “work release” to his office most days and was released on probation after 13 months.
Mr Mountbatten-Windsor faced criticism when pictures emerged which showed him opening the door of Epstein’s palatial East Side townhouse in December 2010 and the pair strolling through Central Park.
In the now-infamous 2019 BBC Newsnight interview, the royal claimed he had cut contact with Epstein in December 2010.
2011: Steps down as trade envoy
After facing severe criticism for his continued association with Epstein, Mr Mountbatten-Windsor agrees to step down as trade envoy with Buckingham Palace confirming he would only support businesses in the UK.
Pictures of him in New York with Epstein had placed intense pressure on the royals, with the former prince acknowledging he had made a mistake in visiting the convicted paedophile.
It was the latest in a string of controversies that plagued his tenure as trade envoy, which included criticism over his use of private jets and his links with unsavoury foreign dictators and business leaders.
2015: Virgina Giuffre allegations emerge
In April 2015, allegations emerged in court documents filed in Florida that Mr Mountbatten-Windsor had sexual intercourse with Virginia Giuffre when she was 17 years old.
Both Buckingham Palace and Mr Mountbatten-Windsor strenuously deny the allegations.
2019: Virginia Giuffre sex abuse case
In 2019, Epstein accuser Virginia Giuffre, formerly known as Virginia Roberts, filed a lawsuit in Manhattan alleging she was trafficked by Epstein to have sex with Mr Mountbatten-Windsor on three occasions when she was 17 and a minor under US law.
Giuffre has accused Mr Mountbatten-Windsor of sexually abusing her on Epstein’s private island, Little St James, as a teenager, which the former prince “unequivocally” denied.
2019: BBC Newsnight interview
Mr Mountbatten-Windsor was criticised for a car crash BBC Newsnight interview that aired on 16 November 2019.
During the interview, he denied he slept with Giuffre, saying an encounter could not have taken place because he was at a branch of Pizza Express in Woking with his daughter Princess Beatrice.
He also said Giuffre’s claim he was sweaty at a nightclub was untrue because an “overdose of adrenaline in the Falklands war” had left him unable to sweat.
The royal faced a public backlash, with equality campaigners claiming he was “too stupid to even pretend concern for Epstein’s victims”.
2019: Step back from public duties
Four days later, Mr Mountbatten-Windsor announced the Queen had given him permission to step back from public duties in the wake of the interview.
He said it had become clear to him in recent days that his association with Epstein had become a “major distraction” to the royal family’s work.
The royal said he regretted his association with Epstein and “deeply sympathises” with his victims.
2022: Stripped of royal titles and military affiliations
In January 2022, the Queen stripped Mr Mountbatten-Windsor of his military titles and royal patronages in the wake of a US judge allowing Giuffre’s civil sexual abuse case against her son to move to trial.
The former prince stopped using his HRH (His Royal Highness) style his roles – including Colonel of the Grenadier Guards, one of the oldest regiments in the British army – were handed to other members of the royal family.
His other military titles included honorary air commodore of RAF Lossiemouth; colonel-in-chief of the Royal Irish Regiment; colonel-in-chief of the Small Arms School Corps; commodore-in-chief of the Fleet Air Arm; royal colonel of the Royal Highland Fusiliers; deputy colonel-in-chief of The Royal Lancers (Queen Elizabeth’s Own); and royal colonel of the Royal Regiment of Scotland.
2022: Out-of-court settlement
In March 2022, Mr Mountbatten-Windsor paid Giuffre a multi-million-pound out-of-court settlement, meaning both sides avoided the case going to trial.
As part of the agreement, he was due to pay damages to Giuffre and a donation to a charity “in support of victims’ rights”.
Mr Mountbatten-Windsor has faced calls to confirm how he funded settlement – which is reported to be as much as £12m – and whether the Queen or even King Charles, then Prince of Wales, contributed to the sum.
December 2024: ‘Confidante’ banned from UK over Chinese spy allegations
In December 2024, it emerged that a “close confidante” of the royal had been barred from entering the UK because authorities felt he was likely to pose a threat to national security.
Yang Tengbo brought a case to the Special Immigration Appeals Commission (SIAC) after the then-home secretary Suella Braverman said he should be excluded from the UK in March 2023.
British authorities allege the businessman was working on behalf of the United Front Work Department, an arm of the Chinese Communist Party that is used to influence foreign entities.
He is said to have twice visited the royal residence at the invitation of the King’s younger brother and was described as a “close confidante” of Mr Mountbatten-Windsor.
Mr Mountbatten-Windsor insists he “ceased all contact” with the businessman accused of being a Chinese spy when concerns were first raised about him. He met the individual through “official channels” and “nothing of a sensitive nature was ever discussed”, a statement from his office said.
January 2025: New messages reveal ties with Epstein continued for months after New York visit
Newly surfaced messages revealed the Duke of York remained in contact with Epstein until February 2011 – despite having claimed to have cut him off in December 2010.
Emails between Mr Mountbatten-Windsor and Epstein reportedly show they were still exchanging messages until at least late February 2011, when the duke wrote: “Keep in close touch and we’ll play some more soon.”
Messages were exchanged between the pair on the same day a photograph of Mr Mountbatten-Windsor with 17-year-old Virginia Giuffre and Ghislaine Maxwell – who is currently behind bars for recruiting and trafficking underage girls for Epstein – was published, Bloomberg reports.
The emails were obtained by Bloomberg after being disclosed in a filing by the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), defending an appeal by former Barclays boss, Jes Staley, who is challenging its decision to ban him from the finance industry for misleading regulators on his ties to Epstein.
October 2025: Mr Mountbatten-Windsor forced to renounce Duke of York title
Mr Mountbatten-Windsor is forced to relinquish all his titles, including the Duke of York and Knight of the Garter as his former friendship with Epstein threatens to overshadow the work of the royal family.
Mr Mountbatten-Windsor has given up his title as Knight Grand Cross of the Royal Victorian Order and his Garter role as a Royal Knight Companion of the Most Noble Order of the Garter.
He released a statement saying that he, the King, and his family “have concluded the continued accusations about me distract from the work of His Majesty and the royal family”.
He continued: “I have decided, as I always have, to put my duty to my family and country first. I stand by my decision five years ago to stand back from public life”.
Mr Mountbatten-Windsor’s former wife, Sarah Ferguson, will also no longer be known as the Duchess of York. Their daughters, Princess Beatrice and Princess Eugenie, will be unaffected.
The news came after the publication of extracts of the posthumous memoir of Epstein victim Virginia Giuffre. In the book, Giuffre claimed that Mr Mountbatten-Windsor considered it his “birthright” to sleep with her.
In his statement, issued on 17 October, Mr Mountbatten-Windsor repeated that “I vigorously deny the accusations against me”.
December 2025: New photos released in connection with Epstein
Mr Mountbatten-Windsor was pictured in a set of images released from the Epstein estate released by the Democrats on the House Oversight Committee. They also included images of US President Donald Trump, and Steve Bannon. It’s not clear when the photos were taken, as they are undated. No captions or context have been provided for any of the images.
Of the 19 photos shared by the Democrats, there is only one photo of Mr Mountbatten-Windsor where he stands with Microsoft magnate and philanthropist Bill Gates during the Malaria Summit in London in 2018.
Epstein is not featured in the image, which appears to be a cropped version of a professionally taken-photograph, which excludes the then-Prince Charles, who was also in frame. It remains unclear why the photo was part of Epstein's estate. Mr Mountbatten-Windsor’s appearance in the photo is not an indication of wrongdoing.
More personal photos saw Epstein with director Woody Allen and Virgin magnate Sir Richard Branson. Sir Richard and many other people photographed with Epstein have denied any wrongdoing in their association with the disgraced financier.
January 2026: Images show former prince kneeling over woman
New pictures from another tranche of Epstein files brought further scrutiny upon the King’s brother, with one showing him crouched over a woman as she lay on the floor.
In the undated images, the royal appears to kneel on the ground as he leans over an unidentified woman, while another angle shows the woman’s abdomen being touched.
Emails also appear to suggest he invited the sex offender for dinner at Buckingham Palace and agreed to meet a “beautiful” 26-year-old Russian woman.
February 2026: Mr Mountbatten-Windsor arrested
On his 66th birthday, the former prince was arrested by Thames Valley Police officers at his new home in Sandringham, on suspicion of misconduct in public office.
The force previously said it was reviewing allegations that a woman was trafficked to the UK by Jeffrey Epstein to have a sexual encounter with Mr Mountbatten-Windsor, as well as claims he shared sensitive information with the paedophile while serving as the UK’s trade envoy.
Searches are being carried out at addresses in Berkshire and Norfolk, the force said.
Assistant Chief Constable Oliver Wright said: “Following a thorough assessment, we have now opened an investigation into this allegation of misconduct in public office.
“It is important that we protect the integrity and objectivity of our investigation as we work with our partners to investigate this alleged offence.
“We understand the significant public interest in this case, and we will provide updates at the appropriate time.”

The Epstein files arrest of former ‘Prince’ Andrew makes Trump’s Justice Department look pathetic

The Epstein files arrest of former ‘Prince’ Andrew makes Trump’s Justice Department look pathetic
The British police have taken action. Where on Earth is Pam Bondi’s DOJ? asks Holly Baxter
- Bookmark
- CommentsGo to comments
On Thursday, America woke up to the news that Andrew (the artist formerly known as Prince) had been arrested over serious allegations made in the Epstein files. And you know what? It felt good.
There has been much consternation in the U.K. about the fact that Andrew’s “punishment” for alleged bad behavior looked very much like being handed a fancy free house and a lavishly funded retirement in obscurity. If that’s what you get for being a creep, then you might find a lot of similarly sweatless men lining up to be publicly “shamed” for their past misgivings.
The fact that the ex-royal has now been formally arrested on suspicion of misconduct in public office looks like a big PR win for the embattled U.K. Because, given the same access to the same documents as the U.S., British police actually did something. King Charles’ response to his brother being taken into custody — that “the law must take its course” — was similarly indicative of actually letting something be done. If you squint, it all looks very open and sensible and upstanding.
Obviously, if you stop squinting and think about the whole “pedophile island visited regularly by international elites” thing, it all starts to look a bit less shiny.
And now let’s take a look at the other side of the Atlantic, where I currently sit: the side where Donald Trump — mentioned multiple times in the Epstein files, famously pictured partying with Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell, though he denies wrongdoing and claims that he cut ties with the sex trafficker pedophiles who were his former friends long before Epstein’s first conviction in 2008 — says it’s “really time” for us to all move on.
Because yes, there are a lot of emails, a lot of photographs. There are lots of claims, many salacious and unfounded. There are also a whole load of redactions. Of course, of course, it’s clear some bad stuff happened. But didn’t a couple of people resign from a couple of posts at a couple of universities? Anyway, have you heard about the Board of Peace?
The problem is that when you make the Epstein files a central part of your election strategy, it’s hard to shrug your shoulders and say, “that’s all, folks” as soon as they actually get released. Despite some truly shocking claims — that there may have been children as young as 9 years old, perhaps even younger, who were trafficked by Epstein and his associates; that there was a “torture video” shared among them; that Epstein and Maxwell paid their victims to recruit their friends into the trafficking network — there has been very little action by the DOJ.
In fact, it’s unclear whether the Justice Department has even looked closely enough at the tranche of files to know the basic specifics. Attorney General Pam Bondi erroneously claimed that all the files had been released just days ago. She also refused to acknowledge the victims at a congressional hearing who said they had been unable to meet with her Justice Department thus far, shrugging the claim off as “theatrics.”
Bondi’s reaction followed a now-familiar script: claim a “Democrat” witch hunt, refuse to mention the victims, immediately deflect into whataboutism. But loudly asking why the previous administration did nothing doesn’t count as action. It gets old quickly.
We have now seen releases of FBI files and heard the shock and horror of both Democrats and Republicans in Congress. We, the American public, have access to a lot of the emails but lawmakers have seen even more of them behind closed doors. We have heard from the U.N. itself that some of these allegations amount to crimes against humanity.
So where are the arrests? Where is the crack team poring over every single date and word in order to hold as many people as possible to account? Where are the back-to-back, day-and-night meetings with the victims to gather every single possible morsel of data, to piece together a constellation of crimes so that the perpetrators may be held to account? Where is the DOJ? And why, oh why does justice in America these days look like a bunch of millionaires stepping down from their very prestigious jobs?
As yet, we are waiting to see a single U.S. arrest following the release of the files: Epstein (dead) and Maxwell (currently seeking a pardon from Trump in exchange for clearing his name and doing so in a “Club Fed”-style prison she was moved to by Trump’s DOJ after being interviewed by the president’ former personal lawyer Todd Blanche) remain the only ones.
At risk of stating the obvious: When a cabal of ultra-wealthy and ultra-connected individuals stand accused of some of the worst crimes against humanity, “moving on” is a hard sell. This isn’t a nasty divorce where everyone said some things they all regret. This is not behavior within the norm. And as a society, we simply cannot afford to absorb this.
The behavior we leave unchallenged now is the behavior that we tacitly accept.
Andrew Mountbatton-Windsor should have been removed from public office earlier. And no, it doesn’t feel entirely satisfactory that he was stripped of his titles — few of us have aristocratic titles, after all — and no longer (no longer?!) living off British taxpayers’ money (he now lives off King Charles’ private funds, which Charlie Boy didn’t exactly accrue by working the checkout counter at Tesco.) We do not know whether his arrest will lead to a formal charge or a criminal trial.
Nevertheless, this whole thing clearly makes one side of the Atlantic look undeniably better than the other in the handling of the Epstein files. And sure, the royals must be cognizant a crisis could be looming, considering public support for the gilded freeloaders is now lower than ever. Andrew’s not exactly a shining ambassador for their brand.
But by God, doesn’t Britain’s willingness to go after him make America look absolutely pathetic in comparison?

The UK village that has endured 50 days of rain
- Cardinham, a village in Cornwall, has experienced 50 consecutive days of rain, receiving 441.4mm since 30 December and already surpassing its typical February rainfall.
- The prolonged deluge across the UK, particularly in the south-west, is attributed to low-pressure systems being blocked by a persistent high-pressure area over Scandinavia.
- Northern Ireland recorded its wettest January on record, with south-west England and the east of Scotland also experiencing unusually high rainfall for the month.
- The Environment Agency has issued 67 flood warnings and 169 flood alerts for England, while the UK Health Security Agency has a cold health alert in place for several regions.
- While Cardinham is still forecast to have rain, the Met Office suggests conditions may moderate, with periods of more settled weather interspersed with rain.

Russia’s Andreeva falls to American Anisimova in quarters of Dubai Tennis Championships

DUBAI, February 19. /TASS/. Russia’s top female tennis player Mirra Andreeva has been knocked out from the 2026 Dubai Tennis Championships after she lost on Thursday in the quarterfinals round of the tournament to Amanda Anisimova of the United States.
The 5th-seeded Andreeva, who is playing under a neutral status at the tournament, started confidently in the opening round against 2nd-seed Anisimova, but eventually lost to the US player 6-2; 5-7; 6-7 (4-7).
"I was almost in tears there at the end," the tournament’s official website quoated Anisimova as saying after the match. "It was such a tough battle, and I thought we played incredible tennis."
"Seeing Mirra [Andreeva] down like that, it's understandable," Anisimova continued in regard to Andreeva, who almost cried in tears after the match. "We both fought so hard today, and it made me emotional seeing her like that. She was playing so well, she's the defending champion and I feel like we both won on the court today."
"These type of matches, it's always tough that someone has to lose at the end of the day," she pointed out.
"It's not easy to see someone that gives their all and then to react like that," Anisimova said. "It made me really sad for her. In my mind, I was just thinking if she keeps playing like this, there's a title around the corner for her."
"Obviously she's going to have a great year. She seems to be doing all the right things," the US tennis player added.
The 24-year-old US player is currently 6th in the WTA Top-10 Rankings and she is now set to play in the next round against her compatriot Jessica Pegula (4th-seed).
Andreeva, 18, is a four-time WTA champion. She is currently Russia's top-ranked female player at 7th place in the WTA Rankings. Her best finish at Grand Slams was at the 2024 French Open when she reached the semifinals. In 2023, the WTA named Andreeva the rookie of the year. Playing at the 2024 Summer Olympic Games in Paris, she won a silver medal in women’s doubles paired with Diana Shnaider.
The 2026 Dubai Tennis Championships is a WTA-1,000 event. It is played on February 15-21 on outdoor hard courts at the Aviation Club Tennis Centre in Dubai, the United Arab Emirates (UAE). Russia’s Mirra Andreeva is the tournament’s reigning champion.
Russian and Belarusian players’ neutral status at tennis tournaments
On February 28, 2022, the International Olympic Committee (IOC) issued recommendations to international sports federations to bar athletes from Russia and Belarus from taking part in international tournaments, citing Moscow's special military operation in Ukraine as the reason.
Following the IOC's recommendations in late February 2022, the majority of global sports federations moved to exclude athletes from Russia and Belarus from all international sports tournaments.
The International Tennis Federation (ITF) ruled on March 1, 2022, to suspend the membership of the Russian and Belarusian national tennis federations while also canceling all previously scheduled tennis tournaments in the two countries.
On March 14, 2022, the ITF also confirmed its prohibition on the Russian and Belarusian national tennis teams from participating in the 2022 Davis Cup and the 2022 Billie Jean King Cup.

Board of Peace necessary, because other organizations fail to keep global peace — Orban

WASHINGTON, February 19. /TASS/. The creation of the Board of Peace, which is to deal with the Gaza issue and other regional conflicts, was necessary because other international organizations are falling short in maintaining global peace and stability, Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban said.
During the inaugural meeting of the Board of Peace, chaired by US President Donald Trump, Orban said that there were "serious talks going on in Europe about the Board of Peace and its future role."
"We understand that during the recent decades, international organizations have failed to fulfill their role to preserve peace and stability worldwide. Therefore, new initiatives are needed to bring forward the issue of peace globally. We are sure that President Trump’s initiative to establish the Board of Peace is such a step in the right direction," Orban said.
Trump’s return to the White House in 2025 offered "a great chance" toward peace "not only in Gaza, but in Ukraine as well." In his opinion, the armed conflict between Russia and Ukraine would have never started if Trump was the US president four years ago.
"The security situation in the Middle East, and especially in Gaza, has a significant impact on the security of Europe," he said. "Therefore, our participation in the Board of Peace is not only based on principle, but also on our own security interests."
The Board of Peace was established as part of efforts to resolve the crisis in Gaza, in line with an agreement between Israel and the radical Palestinian movement Hamas. On January 22, representatives from 19 countries signed the charter of the new international organization during the World Economic Forum in Davos. US President Donald Trump intends to chair the board. Many countries have refused to participate in the body, which plans to address not only the situation in Gaza but also conflicts in other regions.

Board of Peace first meeting: What is known about organization at this point

WASHINGTON, February 19. /TASS/. Addressing the first meeting of the Gaza Board of Peace that has been established at the United States’ initiative, US President Donald Trump said that he believes that all countries that were invited to become board members will accept.
TASS has compiled key facts about the organization and preparations for its first meeting.
Expectations for the first meeting
The Board of Peace is currently focused on settling the conflict in the Gaza Strip, US Permanent Representative to the United Nations Michael Waltz said.
However, in his words, it is flexible enough to also address other global challenges.
The Board of Peace member countries, at their first meeting in Washington on February 19, will announce the allocation of more than $5 billion to restore the Gaza Strip, US President Donald Trump said on February 15.
Member countries "have committed thousands of personnel to the International Stabilization Force and Local Police to maintain Security and Peace for Gazans," he noted.
The United States is expected to present a plan for Gaza restoration and the formation of an international stabilization force, Reuters reported.
Participants
According to Reuters, representatives of at least 20 world nations will take part in the meeting.
EU Commissioner for the Mediterranean Dubravka Suica will represent the European Union at the Board of Peace meeting, spokesman Guillaume Mercier said.
Cyprus, Turkey, Italy, Israel will be represented by top diplomats, according to their foreign ministries.
Poland and Greece will be represented by deputy foreign ministers.
Kazakh President Kassym-Jomart Tokayev, Romanian President Nicusor Dan, Uzbek President Shavkat Mirziyoyev, General Secretary of the Communist Party of Vietnam, To Lam, Armenian Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan, Egyptian Prime Minister Mostafa Madbouly, Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Manet have confirmed their participation.
The Czech and Slovak foreign ministers, and two representatives of the Swiss foreign ministry will attend the Board of Peace meeting as observers.
Russia’s position
Russian President Vladimir Putin said that Russia is ready to allocate $1 billion to the Board of Peace from its assets immobilized in the United States.
He stated that Moscow is prepared to do so even before the issue of participation in the Board's composition and its work is resolved.
Russia is currently the only country in the world to have committed such a lofty sum in aid to Palestine, Russian presidential press secretary Dmitry Peskov said.
Moscow continues analyzing the entire set of proposals concerning the board’s functioning procedures, Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergey Ryabkov said.
Moscow, in his words, is in no hurry to decide whether or not to participate in the Gaza Board of Peace.
Moscow’s position on the Board of Peace is being formulated, including taking into account the positions of its Middle East partners, Russian Foreign Ministry Spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said.
Russia’s representatives will not take part in the first meeting of the Board of Peace, Zakharova said.
Russia expects the Board of Peace to unequivocally call for de-escalation both in the Gaza Strip and in the West Bank, Russian Permanent Representative to the United Nations Vasily Nebenzya said.
Who refused to join
Mexico will attend the first meeting of the Gaza Board of Peace as an observer, but will not join it due to the absence of Palestine there, Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum said.
The Holy See will not participate in the work of the Board of Peace "due to its specific nature, which differs significantly from that of other states," Vatican State Secretary Cardinal Pietro Parolin said.
France thinks it unacceptable to take part in the work of the Board of Peace and will demand explanations from the European Commission, which sent its representative there without EU Council mandate, French foreign ministry spokesperson Pascal Confavreux said.
About the organization
On January 22, representatives of 19 countries signed the charter establishing the Board of Peace for Gaza in a ceremony on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum in Davos.
Along with US President Donald Trump, the leaders and representatives of Azerbaijan, Argentina, Armenia, Bahrain, Bulgaria, Hungary, Indonesia, Jordan, Kazakhstan, Qatar, Morocco, Mongolia, the United Arab Emirates, Pakistan, Paraguay, Saudi Arabia, Turkey, Uzbekistan, and self-proclaimed republic of Kosovo signed the document.
More than 50 countries will join the Board of Peace, Trump said after the ceremony.
While the Board was established under the agreement between Israel and the radical Palestinian movement Hamas to govern the enclave, its mission is expected to extend to conflicts in other parts of the world as well.
Each member state will remain on the board for not more than three years, except those who will pay a permanent membership fee of at least $1 billion, Bloomberg said, citing the board’s draft charter.
The actual powers of the Board of Peace, established on the initiative of US President Donald Trump, remain unclear, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said.
The Board cannot replace the United Nations, he stressed.

The benchmark 30-year fixed rate mortgage rate fell to 6.01% from 6.09% last week, mortgage buyer Freddie Mac said Thursday. One year ago, the rate averaged 6.85%.
The modest pullback brings the average rate to its lowest level since Sept. 8, 2022, when it was 5.89%. That was the last time the average rate was below 6%.
Mortgage rates are influenced by several factors, from the Federal Reserve’s interest rate policy decisions to bond market investors’ expectations for the economy and inflation. They generally follow the trajectory of the 10-year Treasury yield, which lenders use as a guide to pricing home loans.
The 10-year Treasury yield was at 4.08% at midday Thursday, down from around 4.09% a week ago.
Mortgage rates have been trending lower for months, helping drive a pickup in home sales the last four months of 2025, but not enough to lift the housing market out of its slump dating back to 2022, when mortgage rates began to climb from pandemic-era lows.
Sales of previously occupied U.S. homes remained stuck last year at 30-year lows. And more buyer-friendly mortgage rates this year weren’t enough to lift home sales last month. They posted the biggest monthly drop in nearly four years and the slowest annualized sales pace in more than two years.
Meanwhile, new data on contract signings suggest home sales could remain sluggish in the near term.
A seasonally adjusted index of pending U.S. home sales fell 0.8% in January from the previous month, the National Association of Realtors said Thursday. Pending home sales fell 0.4% from January last year.
There’s usually a month or two lag between a contract signing and when the sale is finalized, which makes pending home sales a bellwether for future completed home sales.
“Improving affordability conditions have yet to induce more buying activity,” said Lawrence Yun, NAR’s chief economist.
A sharp run-up in home prices, especially in the early years of this decade, and a chronic shortage of homes nationally worsened by years of below-average home construction have left many aspiring homeowners priced out of the market.
That's put the focus on mortgage rates, which can boost home shoppers' purchasing power when they come down, but also reduce how much homebuyers can afford when rates rise.
That makes the recent decline in rates a favorable lead in to the annual spring home-buying season — at least for home shoppers who can afford to buy at current rates.
“Lower rates should improve affordability and bring out more buyers,” said Lisa Sturtevant, chief economist at Bright MLS. “Assuming mortgage rates remain at about where they are, or come down even further, we should see more buyers this spring as both inventory and the weather improves.”
Homeowners eager to refinance their existing home loan to a more favorable rate are also benefiting from easing rates.
Borrowing costs on 15-year fixed-rate mortgages, popular with homeowners refinancing their home loans, edged lower this week. That average rate fell to 5.35% from 5.44% last week. A year ago, it was at 6.04%, Freddie Mac said.
Mortgage applications, which include loans to buy a home or refinance an existing mortgage, rose 2.8% last week from a week earlier, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association. Applications for mortgage refinance loans made up 57.4% of all applications.
The latest drop in mortgage rates comes three weeks after the Federal Reserve decided to pause cuts to its main interest rate after lowering rates three times in a row to close out 2025 in an attempt to shore up the job market.
Minutes released Wednesday from the Fed’s last meeting showed many officials want to see inflation fall further before they would support additional interest rate cuts this year.
The central bank doesn’t set mortgage rates, but its decisions to raise or lower its short-term rate are watched closely by bond investors and can ultimately affect the yield on 10-year Treasurys that influence mortgage rates.

WASHINGTON, February 19. /TASS/. At least 5,000 Palestinian police officers will be deployed to the Gaza Strip in the next two months to ensure security there, Chairman of the National Committee for the Administration of Gaza Ali Shaath said.
"Our priorities therefore are defined into four categories: first, restore security via professional civilian police under one authority, one law and one weapon, including training and developing 5,000 Gazan police to be deployed in 60 days," Shaath told the first meeting of the Board of Peace, according to a White House broadcast.
Shaath said the organization also plans to "restore basic services, including electricity, water and education," restore basic communal infrastructure facilities and "revive economic activities" of the sector.
"Our goal is simple: step by step to lay the foundation for lasting peace, dignity and prosperity," Shaath concluded.
On January 22, representatives of 19 countries signed on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum in Davos the Charter of the Peace Council, established as part of a peaceful settlement in the Gaza Strip. Washington said that other states had joined the organization. The Peace Council was established in accordance with an agreement between Israel and the radical Palestinian movement Hamas to govern Gaza, but it is assumed that it will also deal with conflict prevention and resolution in other regions.

ASX set to slide as Wall Street drifts lower; Oil jumps on US-Iran tensions

ASX holds steady as US and Iran tensions rise; Guzman y Gomez dives
Updated ,first published
The Australian sharemarket held steady at the end of the week after global markets retreated on the back of renewed tensions between the US and Iran, and as investors punished companies seen as being under threat from AI.
The S&P/ASX 200 closed on Friday marginally down, by 4.8 points or 0.05 per cent, at 9081.4, holding on to a five-day gain of 1.84 per cent. Six of its 11 industry sectors ended trade in negative territory.
As American carrier groups, fighter jets, bombers and refuelling aircraft massed in the Middle East, investors were left to weigh US President Donald Trump’s comment that Iran had 10 to 15 days at most to strike a deal over its nuclear program.
Oil settled at its highest level since August. West Texas Intermediate rose above $US66 a barrel, on the second-to-last day of trading of the March contract, while Brent settled below $US72. Gas extractor Woodside Energy added 1.22 per cent, but Santos slipped 0.86 per cent.
Insurance giant QBE bounced 7.08 per cent after reporting a 21 per cent rise in full-year net profit to $US2.16 billion ($3.1 billion). Financial stocks overall were mixed, though. Commonwealth Bank was up slightly (0.83 per cent) and National Australia Bank was flat. ANZ Group and Westpac both advanced, 1.57 and 1.55 per cent, respectively.
Mining giant Rio Tinto lost 3.11 per cent after it unveiled a $14.1 billion full-year profit in London on Thursday. Rio will pay a fully franked 2025 final dividend of $US2.54 a share on April 16. BHP was flat and Fortescue had lost 1.33 per cent by the afternoon’s end, while gold miners Northern Star and Evolution Mining were stable.
Tech stocks slumped on the back of more AI-induced jitters on Wall Street, where Booking Holdings fell 6.1 per cent in one of the market’s sharper losses, though the company behind the Booking.com, Priceline and OpenTable brands reported a profit for the latest quarter that edged past analysts’ expectations.
Its stock has been under pressure because of worries that competitors powered by artificial intelligence could upend its industry and take away customers. Booking’s stock has lost about a quarter of its value this year to date.
Such worries have been rolling through Wall Street, hitting industries as far-flung as software and legal services and trucking logistics. Investors have been punishing stocks of companies seen as under threat from AI so suddenly and aggressively that analysts have likened it to a “shoot first-ask questions later” mentality.
On the Australian bourse, WiseTech (down 3.8 per cent) and Xero (down 3.75 per cent) suffered similar punishment. Data centre dynamo NextDC also edged down slightly.
Food chain Guzman y Gomez slumped 13.94 per cent as underlying earnings failed to meet analyst expectations, even as it posted an 18 per cent uplift in total sales to $681.8 million in the first half of the 2026 financial year.
Comparable sales in Australia gained 4.4 per cent, and group underlying earnings rose 23.3 per cent to $33 million. Net profits came in at $10.6 million, a 44.9 per cent increase on the same period a year earlier. The company declared a fully franked interim dividend of 7.4¢.
The Australian dollar traded lower at US70.38¢.
On Wall Street, the S&P 500 slipped 0.3 per cent for its first loss in four days. The Dow Jones dropped 267 points, or 0.5 per cent, and the Nasdaq composite slipped 0.3 per cent.
The worries about AI are hurting not just companies seen as potential victims but also the private-credit companies that have lent them money. Blue Owl Capital fell 5.9 per cent to bring its loss for the year to date to 22.5 per cent, for example. Apollo Global Management fell 5.2 per cent, and Ares Management sank 3.1 per cent.
In the bond market, Treasury yields held relatively steady after a report found that the number of US workers applying for unemployment benefits had eased last week. That could be a signal that the pace of layoffs is slowing.
A solid jobs market, in turn, could delay the Federal Reserve for longer from resuming its cuts to interest rates. Fed officials said at their last meeting that they wanted to see inflation fall further before supporting further rate cuts this year.
Other US economic reports said that growth for manufacturing in the mid-Atlantic region was accelerating, but potential home buyers across the country didn’t sign as many contracts in January to purchase. The US trade deficit also widened in December by more than economists expected.

Israeli army forces briefly detain 2 shepherds in Syria’s Quneitra
Israeli forces also fired 2 artillery shells toward, with no immediate reports of casualties or material damage
ISTANBUL
Israeli forces briefly detained two shepherds in Syria’s southern Quneitra province on Thursday.
The SANA news agency reported that Israeli troops arrested a young man west of Ruwayhina village and another youth west of Kodna village while they were tending sheep. Both were later released.
Israeli forces entered the western outskirts of Ruwayhina and took the shepherd to an undisclosed location before releasing him hours later, the agency said.
Israeli forces also fired two artillery shells toward the village’s surroundings, with no immediate reports of casualties or material damage, it added.
In a separate incident, Israeli forces detained a teenager while he was herding sheep west of Kodna village and released him after several hours, SANA said.
Earlier, the state-run Alikhbariah TV reported that Israeli troops arrested a child west of Kodna villag before he was released hours later.
There was no immediate comment from the Israeli military regarding the reported detention.
Damascus has repeatedly affirmed its commitment to the 1974 disengagement agreement between the two sides. Tel Aviv announced unilaterally that it was canceling the agreement after the fall of Bashar Assad’s regime on Dec. 8, 2024.
Recent Israeli actions have included ground incursions, artillery shelling—particularly in the countryside of Quneitra and Daraa in southern Syria—arrests of civilians, the establishment of checkpoints to search and question residents, and the destruction of crops.
The Israeli incursions come despite the announcement on Jan. 6 of the formation of a contact mechanism between Syria and Israel, under US supervision, to coordinate information exchange, reduce military escalation, promote diplomatic engagement, and explore trade opportunities.
Syrians say the continued Israeli actions limit their ability to restore stability and hinder government efforts to attract investment to improve economic conditions.

YEKATERINBURG, February 19. /TASS/. Russia returned this year to the pool of countries where electronic engineering industry products are manufactured, First Deputy Prime Minister Denis Manturov said.
"The microelectronic industry is the one where we still have to labor hard. We need to significantly close the gap with global leaders there, while we were such in 1970s. Regrettably, we started gradually losing our position since the middle of 1980s, even somewhat from 1983. But I can say since this year <…> we returned to the pool of countries, and there are actually just three of them, which manufacture electronic engineering industry products," Manturov said.
Russia should master the new lithography machine for 130 nanometers, but global leaders are working with smaller standard sizes, the official added.

‘Extremely disappointed’: Minister defies residents’ noise complaints to dump Barangaroo curfew

‘Extremely disappointed’: Minister defies residents’ noise complaints to dump Barangaroo curfew
Planning Minister Paul Scully has intervened to allow an inner Sydney cultural venue to operate around the clock, overriding a decision from bureaucrats to scale back trading hours at the harbourfront site after residents voiced concerns about late-night noise.
The NSW government had originally proposed 24/7 operating hours at the Cutaway arts and culture space, which is scheduled to reopen underneath Barangaroo’s headland park within months following a $100 million renovation.
The proposal sparked a backlash from residents in Barangaroo and Millers Point, who were worried about crowd control and noise disturbances from after-dark events. Their opposition prompted Placemaking NSW, the government agency overseeing the development, to cap operating hours for most events at midnight, with limited exceptions for major occasions such as New Year’s Eve.
In a blow to dissenting residents, Scully this week reversed that decision on grounds the Labor government was committed to its “vibrancy” reforms, which are aimed at boosting the 24-hour economy by reducing restrictions on live music, hospitality and entertainment at NSW venues.
“The new and improved Cutaway will support everything from festivals and installations to community gatherings and contemporary performance and following my request, it can operate 24 hours a day, seven days a week as needed,” Scully said.
“We will be maximising the benefit of this venue given the significant taxpayer investment made to allow it to host events that support Sydney’s growing events calendar.
“The Cutaway was created as a first-class event venue and should be allowed to function as one.”
Millers Point Community Resident Action Group president Anne Crabb said the group was “extremely disappointed” by Scully’s decision. She said the government had “overspent” on the venue and now was “desperate to find any excuse to keep the place open 24/7”.
“We believe the extended hours at this enormous, cavernous venue next to Millers Point homes will result in the erosion of residential amenity, particularly during the sensitive midnight to 7am period,” she said.
The group requested a permanent decibel monitoring system and a dedicated complaints hotline.
Crabb previously said the venue’s scale and design had heightened concerns about the cumulative effects of late events, particularly noise, crowd control and disruption to residential amenity.
“Unlike current 24/7 venues such as The Crown casino and The Star, this is a huge and open cavernous space located on the harbourfront,” she said.
“Barangaroo can and should be a vibrant cultural precinct, but this must not come at the expense of our long-standing residential community who will have to deal with the late-night impacts.”
Other residents and strata representatives from nearby apartments worried about sleep disturbance and voiced concerns the semi-enclosed structure could amplify sounds and make them reverberate.
Once completed, the renovated Cutaway will include multiple event spaces carved into the headland beneath Barangaroo Reserve, creating a space to host large art installations, performances, festivals, concerts, gala dinners, fashion shows and events including Vivid Sydney.
Originally, Placemaking NSW argued 24-hour operations would advance the state’s vision to boost nightlife, tourism and Sydney’s global standing. The Cutaway’s location next to the Barangaroo metro station was cited as a major advantage, allowing for extended trading hours supported by improved public transport access. Metro services generally operate from about 4am to midnight.
Placemaking NSW used its response to public submissions on the proposal to wind back the operating hours to 8am to midnight, with some noise controls from 10pm. Scully wrote to the agency on Monday directing staff to reinstate the original plan for 24/7 trading at the venue.
Concerns around noise were best dealt with through individual event conditions of consent, not restricting operating hours, as has been done for other event venues, the government said.
NSW 24-Hour Economy Commissioner Michael Rodrigues supported the extended hours, while Business Sydney executive director Paul Nicolaou had described the curfew as “disappointing”.
“If you choose to live in Barangaroo – in the heart of a global city – a level of noise should be expected,” Nicolaou said.
“We desperately need to ensure there are enough venues and facilities that are open 24/7.”
Construction of The Cutaway is more than 85 per cent complete. The first events are expected to start by July.

Türkiye neutralises threats at source beyond its borders: Erdogan

Türkiye takes all necessary steps beyond its borders for its security, neutralising threats at their source without seeking permission from anyone, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said on Thursday.
Speaking at an iftar programme with families of martyrs at Cankaya Palace in the capital Ankara, Erdogan said that significant progress has been made in efforts towards a "terror-free Türkiye".
"Today, Türkiye takes all necessary steps not only within its borders but also beyond its borders for its security. Wherever there is a threat or danger, we neutralise it at its source without seeking permission from anyone," Erdogan said.
"There has been a serious decrease in security risks directed at our country, both within and beyond our borders," he said.
"In the terror-free Türkiye initiative we launched 16 months ago, we have made notable progress in a short time," he added, noting a marked reduction in security risks targeting the country.
Referring to terrorism, Erdogan said: "We are determined to rid Türkiye forever of this scourge that has burned the hearts of our nation for nearly half a century."
"For nearly half a century, this calamity has wounded our nation's heart. God willing, we are determined to free Türkiye from it permanently," he said.
He noted that thanks to operations by the armed forces and other security units, "we have significantly restricted the mobility of terrorist organisations".
Erdogan said that in the defence industry, the country has reached a domestic production rate of around 80 percent, compared to a previous dependence of about 80 percent on foreign sources.
"Today, we can meet almost all our needs ourselves in nearly every field, including uncrewed aerial vehicles (UAVs), armed UAVs, missiles, rockets, ships, helicopters and tanks," he said.
"God willing, next in line will be fighter jets and aircraft carriers," he added.
"Positive developments are also taking place in our neighbour Syria. An agreement was reached last month to resolve the issue in northern Syria without bloodshed, and the process toward full integration has begun," Erdogan said.

Opinion
Should I have stood up to my boss? Or was it better to trust my gut?
A messy thing happened at work. Mistakes and miscommunication turned into a snowball that slowly got bigger. As the consequences became apparent, I could see it might have looked like I was partly to blame – though, I wasn’t. I respect my boss, but they can be deaf to certain complex conversations, so my first instinct was to leave things be.
But the advice from people whose opinion I value – friends, family and experts I listen to or read – all went the same way: you must stick up for yourself, no matter what.
So I second guessed myself and spent a lot of time and energy gathering evidence and building a “defence” of myself. As I expected, when the “news” broke, some colleagues looked my way. I went straight to my boss and, long story short, my hours of preparation were a waste of time.
Is standing your ground, no matter what, worth it on principle alone?
Thanks for your detailed email and generously candid correspondence. What you’ve described to me is a dense and jumbled problem, and we won’t go into the details to avoid risking anyone’s anonymity.
It’s the kind of highly specific case that is tricky to pick apart in a few hundred words. But I do think one thing you brought up is worth digging into a bit further.
Work is rarely like a quiz show; you don’t get rewarded for shouting the first answer that comes into your head.
You mentioned in your question (and in your longer email) that your experience of working with your boss for a long while led you to an instinctive reaction – one that proved correct. If I can summarise your conclusion in perhaps over-simplistic terms, you ultimately realised you should have followed your gut.
I’ll start by saying that I don’t think your friends and family were outrightly wrong. But their blanket, well-intentioned advice didn’t quite work when applied to a tangled, knotty and idiosyncratic situation.
Their protestations might have been persuasive, but my guess is the main reason you were pulled towards their opinion had more to do with a kind of subtle stigma attached to going with your instincts in a professional setting.
So often we frame the world of work, especially corporate work or work conducted for a private business, as hyper-rational. It’s not true to any significant extent, but it’s a pervasive, stubborn and even a seductive story.
And although it often relates to corporate entities and those who run them – the efficient private company, the numbers-oriented founder, the cold truth of the balance sheet – it has a trickle-down effect. In some shape or form, it ends up affecting everyone involved in “the business world”.
So when a person like you, with a lot of experience, a long-term relationship with your boss and every reason to trust your instincts comes across a situation like yours, there’s often a ghostly presence pulling at your sleeve, whispering “Isn’t that the risky option?”
Of course, sometimes, going with your first intuitive thought is dangerous. Or even foolish. Work is rarely like a quiz show; you don’t get rewarded for shouting the first answer that comes into your head before anyone else.
But work is rarely a maths equation, either; what you’ve outlined in our correspondence is not the Bat and Ball Problem*, where the apparently obvious answer is, in fact, objectively wrong.
You knew that your boss would give little thought to any well-evidenced “defence” (as you put it), not because you read some tea leaves or had a vague hunch, but because many, many years of experience had told you this was highly likely. You were guessing, perhaps, but it was an educated guess.
And sometimes an educated guess is the best you can do in an intricate, labyrinthine social situation like a large workplace. Indeed, cognitive science is moving away from the long-held conventional wisdom that logic/reason and intuition/gut feel are polar opposites, and largely separate mental processes.
Again, the advice you received wasn’t inherently bad. Often, sticking up for yourself (and others) at work is critical, especially if the situation works as a kind of test case or creates a precedent.
This is where standing on principle becomes critically important. But that was not ever happening here. It sounds like the sideways glances came, the problem blew over, your reputation wasn’t damaged in the slightest, and you wasted far too much time and effort on a carefully organised explanation that was always going to be disregarded. And none of this was a surprise to you.
If you can apply any generalisation to such a convoluted affair, it’s that sometimes it’s OK – and even rational – to trust your gut.
*A bat and a ball cost $1.10 in total; the bat costs $1.00 more than the ball; how much does the ball cost?

Driver cleared of murder after killing boy, 4, in pick-up truck after high-speed crash
Owen Maughan, 27, had previously admitted to the manslaughter of Peter Maughan following the incident in Kent last year
- Bookmark
A driver who admitted killing a four-year-old boy in a crash after deliberately hitting the family’s car at around 60mph has been cleared of murder.
Owen Maughan, 27, had previously admitted to the manslaughter of Peter Maughan following the incident on New Barn Road, Dartford, Kent, on June 1 last year.
His father, Patrick Maughan, 54, who was a front-seat passenger and accused of encouraging the act, was also cleared of murder but found guilty of manslaughter by a jury at Maidstone Crown Court on Thursday.
Peter was thrown from the family pick-up truck and died of “severe and devastating injuries” to his head, chest and abdomen.
The trial had heard that Owen and Patrick Maughan “chased” the car down the A2 in Kent for several miles.
There was shouting between the two cars before Owen Maughan drove into the wrong lane and clipped the Ford pick-up truck at about 60mph, and the car rolled over multiple times, the court heard.
Peter Maughan was in the back of the car with his one-year-old sister Annarica Mahon, while their mother Hayley, Owen Maughan’s cousin, was in the front passenger seat and her partner Lovell Mahon was driving.
Mr Mahon suffered serious injuries including a skull fracture and is unlikely to walk again.
Owen Maughan had previously admitted inflicting grievous bodily harm on Mr Mahon.
The jury also found Patrick Maughan guilty of the same charge.
The court had heard that Mr Mahon and Owen Maughan had never met and he did not associate with his cousin Hayley.
Hayley Maughan filmed video clips of the two men following them, leaving a voice note for her mother Erica in which she said she was afraid.
Giving evidence during the trial, Owen Maughan told jurors he did not know there were children in the car.
He said he believed he and Mr Mahon were going to fight after arguing back and forth between the cars, and he decided to dent the side of Mr Mahon’s car so he would stop and get out.
He denied trying to cause serious injury.
After the crash, Owen and Patrick Maughan drove off and paused for Patrick Maughan to pull the registration plate off the truck, which Owen said was done in a state of “panic”.
Jurors heard the pair had been drinking in Rochester earlier that day, and had about 12 bottles of beer and 13 pints respectively, before they began driving their Ford Ranger pick-up truck home.
Owen Maughan told jurors that they spotted a similar vehicle which made them think the drivers may also be from the traveller community, and pulled up alongside.
But he said Mr Mahon was “aggressive and pointing at me” and Maughan got “pretty pissed off with it” so he started “following him just to try and annoy him”.
He said he decided to dent the side of the other car so Mr Mahon would pull in and fight, and “couldn’t believe” what he was seeing when the car flipped over.
The pair will be sentenced at a later date.

Gaza reconstruction fund ready for donations: World Bank chief

The Gaza Reconstruction and Development Fund is ready for donations, World Bank President Ajay Banga said Thursday.
Banga said at the first Board of Peace meeting in Washington that the fund secures donor money while the board directs disbursements for crucial reconstruction and development projects in Gaza.
He assured donors that robust financial, legal and oversight mechanisms remain in place to guarantee absolute transparency about how the money is utilised.
A financial controller from the World Bank is currently seconded to the Board of Peace to help integrate the highest financial standards into the rebuilding process.
"We are helping along with the Board of Peace, which takes the ownership of ensuring that the right kind of financial, legal and oversight mechanisms are being put in place," he said.
The World Bank Group plans to leverage its triple-A rating to attract private bond money to bolster public finance initiatives for the region.
"Because of our triple-A rating, we have the ability to leverage private bond money to help to create the resources we need," he said.
Banga highlighted the global institution's capacity to effectively de-risk private investing to support the extensive rebuilding operations.
He emphasised that the World Bank brings vital on-the-ground expertise and practical knowledge gathered from operating in challenging markets worldwide.
The World Bank president stated that the institution refuses to be an armchair critic, aiming instead to be an active participant in providing Palestinians the opportunities and lives they deserve.

Nordic goodbye?
It could be the last Olympics for a sport that mixes the grace of ski jumping with the grind of cross-country skiing.
Nordic combined events at the Milan Cortina Games ended Thursday. And the International Olympic Committee is considering scrapping it from future Games because of a small TV audience and podium positions dominated by a tiny group of nations.
As if to illustrate that point, Norway swept took gold in all three events — including Thursday's men’s team sprint — and the same countries stood on the podium at all three Nordic combined events at these Winter Games.
“Hopefully these three events have been fun to watch and I think it has been a lot of nations fighting for their medals,” Jen Luraas Oftebro, who won three golds, said after sharing the win with teammate Andreas Skoglund. “Hopefully the IOC will see the value in that.”
Nordic combined was invented some 150 years ago when a Norwegian crown prince seeking glory as a champion paired the two disciplines he excelled at.
The contest opens with a daredevil ski jump to determine the starting order for a lung-busting cross-country ski race.
“Nordic combined is such a beautiful sport and I think it deserves much more popularity because I think the races are really, really fun to watch and the athletes are doing amazing,” said Jan Vytrval, a Czech competitor. “It deserves much more than to be deleted from the Olympics.”
The sport has been included since the first Winter Games in 1924, but it is the only winter sport that doesn’t include women. Female athletes who compete on the World Cup tour and in world championships have lobbied hard to change that.
But their fate is tied to the larger sport.
The IOC has previously put off a decision on the sport's future but will revisit the question after the Games wrap up Sunday.
“If it stays, it’s for both,” said Lasse Ottesen, the Nordic combined director of the International Ski Federation. “It makes no sense to say, ‘Yes, we’re just going to have the Nordic combined men in or, yes, we're going to take the men out and we’re going to throw the women in.’ I mean why would anyone do that in these times?”
Ottesen said FIS had exceeded requirements the IOC set out in 2022, increasing the competition in the women’s sport and building media interest globally. While audience numbers grew slightly over each of the last three Olympics, he conceded it was not as much as FIS expected.
Two of the three events — the men’s individual normal hill jump and large hill ski jump competitions that were each followed by 10 kilometer ski races — sold out all 4,500 tickets allocated and 90% of the team event tickets were sold, Ottesen said.
But, he added, the cross-country venue has twice that capacity, so it “looks a little bit thinner.”
FIS President Johan Eliasch attended the Feb. 11 normal hill event with IOC President Kirsty Coventry to try to showcase the excitement that two disciplines generate.
IOC member Ingmar de Vos, a member of the committee reviewing the fate of the sport, attended the large hill event.
The contests in the last three Olympics were won by Norway, Austria, Germany and Japan. In Milan Cortina, Germany and Japan — despite starting two of the races in first place after the jump — were shut out as Finland took two individual bronzes and a team silver.
That is progress in the eyes of the sport’s supporters — and the Finns, who gave a thrilling chase for the silver medal on Thursday.
“We have done our part with competing,” said Eero Hirvonen, who won an individual bronze and shared the silver with Ilkka Herola. “We have had really interesting competitions here and I think all the attention with what our success and medals have got in Finland ... I hope it helps.”

Germany and ArianeGroup Negotiate to Develop Ballistic Missiles

European missile developer ArianeGroup is negotiating with the German government and other countries to develop land-based ballistic missiles.
These discussions took place ahead of the Munich Security Conference amid Europe’s growing need for deep strike capabilities, according to Hartpunkt.
According to the company’s director of defense programs, Vincent Peryi, the company is ready to develop systems with a range of 1,000 to 3,000 kilometers and more.
The company has already presented conceptual designs for tactical ballistic missiles called Missile Balistique Theatre (MBT) in single- and multi-stage versions.
It has significant experience in this field, as it manufactures French M51 intercontinental missiles for submarines. According to experts, the development of new weapons for European customers may take only a few years.
The German side is interested in accessing technologies and supply chains to avoid complete dependence on foreign partners. This issue will require coordination with the French government, as ArianeGroup is a joint venture between Airbus and Safran.
The company is currently exploring the possibility of launching rocket fuel production at one of its German facilities to support future projects.

Israeli settlers kill 19-year-old Palestinian-American, officials and witnesses say
The Palestinian Health Ministry and a witness say that Israeli settlers in the occupied West Bank shot and killed a Palestinian-American in an attack on a village
- Bookmark
Israeli settlers in the occupied West Bank shot and killed a Palestinian-American during an attack on a village, the Palestinian Health Ministry and a witness said Thursday.
Raed Abu Ali, a resident of the village of Mukhmas, said a group of settlers came to the community Wednesday afternoon and tried to attack a farmer, prompting clashes after residents intervened. Israeli forces later arrived, and during the violence armed settlers killed 19-year-old Nasrallah Abu Siyam and injured several others.
Abu Ali said that the army shot tear gas, sound grenades and live ammunition. Israel's military acknowledged using what it called “riot dispersal methods” after receiving reports of Palestinians throwing rocks but denied that its forces fired during the clashes.
“When the settlers saw the army, they were encouraged and started shooting live bullets,” Abu Ali said. He added that they clubbed those injured with sticks after they had fallen to the ground.
The Palestinian Ministry of Health confirmed Abu Siyam's death from critical wounds sustained Wednesday afternoon near the village east of Ramallah.
Abu Siyam’s killing is the latest in a surge in violence by extremist settlers in the West Bank, which killed 240 people last year, according to the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs. Seventeen Israelis were killed over the same period. The Palestinian Authority’s Wall and Settlement Resistance Commission said Abu Siyam was the first Palestinian killed by settlers in 2026.
Mukhmas and its surrounding area — most of which lies under Israeli civil and military administration — have become a hotspot for settler attacks, including arson and assaults, as well as the construction of outposts that Israeli law considers illegal.
The Israeli military said late Wednesday that unnamed suspects shot at Palestinians, who were later evacuated for medical treatment. It did not say whether any were arrested.
Abu Siyam's mother told The Associated Press that he was an American citizen, making him the second Palestinian-American to be killed by Israeli settlers in less than a year.
The U.S. Embassy did not respond to questions on Thursday.
Palestinians and rights groups say authorities routinely fail to prosecute settlers or hold them accountable for violence. Under National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir, investigations into settler attacks have plummeted, according to the Israeli rights group Yesh Din.
UN says Israel's acts in West Bank may be ethnic cleansing
The U.N. human rights office on Thursday accused Israel of war crimes and said practices that displace Palestinians in the occupied West Bank “raise concerns over ethnic cleansing.”
The Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights, citing findings collected November 2024 to October 2025, said Israel was engaged in “concerted and accelerating effort to consolidate annexation” while maintaining a system “to maintain oppression and domination of Palestinians.”
It said Israeli military operations in the northern West Bank “employed means and methods designed for warfare” including lethal airstrikes and forcibly transferring civilians from their homes. It also said Israel “forbade” residents from returning to their homes in northern West Bank refugee camps. The operation, which Israel said was aimed against militants, has displaced tens of thousands of Palestinians.
The report also accused Palestinian security forces of using unnecessary lethal force in the same areas, killing at least eight people, and noted that the Palestinian Authority had engaged in “intimidation, detention and ill-treatment of journalists, human rights defenders and other individuals deemed critical of its rule.”
Neither Israel’s Foreign Ministry nor the Palestinian Authority responded to requests for comment. Israel has repeatedly accused the U.N. rights office of anti-Israel bias.
Last year, the U.N. human rights monitor warned of what it called “an unfolding genocide in Gaza” with “conditions of life increasingly incompatible with (Palestinians’) continued existence.”
Report finds imprisoned Palestinian journalists were tortured
The Committee to Protect Journalists said that dozens of Palestinian journalists who were detained in Israel during the war in Gaza experienced terrible conditions, including physical assaults, forced stress positions, sensory deprivation, sexual violence and medical neglect.
CPJ has documented the detention of at least 94 Palestinian journalists and one media worker during the war in Gaza. It covers 32 journalists and one media worker from Gaza, 60 from the West Bank, and two from Israel. Thirty of the journalists are still in custody, CPJ said.
The report found that half of the journalists detained were never charged with a crime and were held under Israel’s administrative detention system, which allows for suspects deemed a security risk to be held for six months and can be renewed indefinitely.
Israel’s prison services did not immediately respond to a request for comment about the report, but had rejected a similar report in January about conditions for Palestinian prisoners as “false allegations,” contending it operates lawfully, is subject to oversight and reviews complaints.
UN development chief says removing Gaza rubble will take 7 years
The vast destruction across Gaza will take at least seven years just to remove the rubble, according to the United Nations Development Program.
Alexander De Croo, the former Belgian prime minister who just returned from Gaza, said that the UNDP had removed just 0.5% of the rubble and people in Gaza are experiencing “the worst living conditions that I have ever seen.”
De Croo said 90% of Gaza’s 2.2 million people live in “very, very rudimentary tents” in the middle of the rubble, which poses health dangers and a danger from exploding weapons.
He said UNDP has been able to build 500 improved housing units, and has 4,000 more that are ready, but estimates the true need is 200,000 to 300,000 units. The units are meant to be used temporarily while reconstruction takes place. He called on Israel to expand access for goods and items needed for reconstruction and the private sector to begin development.

Uzbekistan to make a ‘meaningful contribution’ to Gaza reconstruction, says Uzbek president
Shavkat Mirziyoyev says Board of Peace to help create favorable environment for economic, social recovery of Gaza
ISTANBUL
Uzbekistan is ready to make a “meaningful contribution” to the construction of residential buildings, kindergartens, schools and hospitals in the Gaza Strip, Uzbek President Shavkat Mirziyoyev said Thursday at the first Board of Peace meeting in Washington.
Mirziyoyev expressed confidence that the boar’s work "will help create a favorable environment for the economic and social recovery of the Gaza Strip."
"Uzbekistan supported the peacekeeping initiative to establish the Board of Peace and firmly stated its intention to play a practical role in its successful implementation," said Mirziyoyev, adding that the meeting reflects international solidarity, peacemaking and a shared desire to improve the situation in the Middle East.
"We must use this historic opportunity to build a new Gaza with a thriving economy and decent living conditions for all its people," he noted.
Mirziyoyev underlined that the summit is "the result of the political will and pragmatism" of US President Donald Trump.
Israel began its war in Gaza on Oct. 8, 2023, resulting in more than 72,000 Palestinian deaths and over 171,000 injuries, most of them women and children, and damage to 90% of civilian infrastructure.

Postwar Gaza framework presented at Board of Peace meeting
New administrative office, police recruitment, demilitarization plan outlined as part of transition roadmap
ISTANBUL
Senior officials on Thursday presented a framework for Gaza’s postwar governance, security, and reconstruction during a meeting of the Trump-backed Board of Peace, detailing proposals ranging from institutional rebuilding to the formation of a new Palestinian police force.
Nickolay Mladenov, director-general of the Board of Peace, announced the creation of a new administrative mechanism intended to support Gaza’s future civilian leadership.
“Today we're very happy to announce that we're creating the Office of the High Representative for Gaza, of the Board of Peace, which will be there to support, to guide, and to assist the National Committee for the administration of Gaza, hopefully removing the roadblocks that they will be facing in taking over civilian and administrative control of the Gaza Strip,” he said.
Mladenov said the office would operate under the supervision of the board and its executive body and coordinate with Israeli and Palestinian institutions, as well as an international stabilization force.
He also revealed that recruitment for a transitional Palestinian police force had already begun.
“As of this morning, we started the process of recruiting the Palestinian police force … and just in the first few hours, we have 2,000 people who have applied to join a new transitional Palestinian police force to be formed in Gaza under the authority of the National Committee, with the support of the Board of Peace trained in Egypt,” he said.
According to Mladenov, the force would be central to restoring order during the transition phase.
“It is this Palestinian security force under the authority of the National Committee for the transition period that will allow us to ensure that all factions in Gaza are dismantled and all weapons are put under the control of one civilian authority,” he said.
He thanked Qatar, Egypt and Türkiye for supporting mediation efforts and emphasized that reconstruction depended on disarmament, saying: “There is no other option except the full demilitarization and decommissioning of all weapons in Gaza for reconstruction to begin and for people to have a new way of life going forward.”
Former UK Prime Minister Tony Blair also addressed the meeting, describing Gaza’s governance record as deeply troubled and calling for sweeping reforms.
“For decades, Gaza's governance has been characterized by extremism, corruption, ineffective institutions, and the complete absence of a route to prosperity for the Gazan people,” he said.
Blair outlined a vision for Gaza based on functioning public institutions, economic opportunity and technological development.
“This is a vision of Gaza as part of the Middle East at peace … a genuine commitment to a region where, whether you're a Muslim, Jew, Christian, of any faith or none, you can rise by your own efforts, and feel your government by your side, not on your back,” he said.
He added that President Donald Trump’s proposed framework “remains the best, indeed the only hope for Gaza, the region and the wider world.”

Trump extends some US sanctions against Russia for another year
US President Donald Trump has officially extended sanctions against Russia over its aggression against Ukraine for another year.
Source: a notice published in the US Federal Register, as reported by European Pravda
Details: The executive order, which takes effect on 20 February, provides for the extension of a number of anti-Russian sanctions introduced by US presidents' executive orders in 2014, 2018 and 2022.
The first executive order on sanctions against Russia was issued in 2014. US President Barack Obama's executive order No. 13660, which was published on 6 March 2014, provided for the freezing of the property of a number of individuals.
Initially, sanctions were applied to those who had facilitated Russia's occupation of Crimea.
The sanctions list was subsequently updated several times during the presidency of Joe Biden.
Background:
- On 8 January, US Senator Lindsey Graham announced that President Donald Trump had given the green light to a bipartisan Russia sanctions bill.
- In mid-November, Graham announced that Trump had given Congress his "blessing" to move on the long-stalled Russia sanctions bill.
- In September it was reported that US senators have drafted new legislation aimed at significantly expanding US sanctions on Russia's shadow fleet of oil tankers.

Feb 19 - Belarusian opposition politician Mikola Statkevich, who refused deportation to Lithuania after his 2025 release and was imprisoned again, has been freed after he suffered a stroke while in custody, exiled opposition leader Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya said on Thursday.
Statkevich was one of 52 prisoners freed in Belarus in September 2025 after an appeal from U.S. President Donald Trump, including journalists and political opponents of President Alexander Lukashenko. All were brought to the Lithuanian border, but Statkevich was the only one who refused to cross.
"I am relieved that he is free and able to hug his wife, who waited for him for so long," Tsikhanouskaya wrote on X, posting a picture of Statkevich and his wife smiling. She said that he could barely speak following the stroke.
Statkevich, 69, ran unsuccessfully against Lukashenko in a presidential election in 2010. He was arrested in May 2020 and sentenced in 2021 to 14 years in a maximum-security prison for "organising riots". REUTERS

Three ways to stop nerves from ruining your next job interview

Opinion
Three ways to stop nerves from ruining your next job interview
Job interviews are strange arenas. Capable people walk in prepared and walk out wondering why their brain suddenly forgot things it’s known for years.
I’ve worked with senior leaders, high-potential graduates and seasoned executives for over a decade, and I can say this with confidence: interview nerves are common, human, and say far less about ability than most people think.
Yet, we still keep to a comfortable myth that interviews reward the most qualified person. In reality, they often reward the person who can access their competence under pressure. That’s an entirely different skill. And we don’t teach it enough.
The moment evaluation and judgement enter the room, the nervous system goes into overdrive. Your heart rate rises, your memory retrieval dips, self-consciousness creeps in, and suddenly, a simple question feels loaded.
So beyond rehearsing answers, here are three practical ways to show up with calm, credible confidence.
1. Treat it as a two-way conversation. One mistake many candidates make is they approach the interview with desperation: you have a job, and I need that job. But that can turn into tension, or worse, desperation.
Instead of saying, “I handle pressure well”, describe a time you managed a tight deadline or a difficult stakeholder.
That mindset creates pressure instantly. And when people feel desperate to impress, they become overly self-conscious, monitoring how they sound, how they look, whether they’re saying the “right” thing. That’s when answers get stiff and authenticity disappears.
A stronger frame is mutual evaluation. Yes, the employer is assessing capability. But you’re also assessing fit. Is the role, the culture, the leadership, the growth something that’s aligned with what you want? This is a two-way decision.
This shift changes how the brain reads the situation, and that changes how you show up.
2. Replace adjectives with evidence. Early in my career, I conducted thousands of screening interviews. I constantly heard: I’m proactive. I’m a strong communicator. I’m a team player.
None of these landed without evidence. What made someone stand out was when they provided a specific example or short story to back up what they were saying.
Instead of saying, “I handle pressure well,” describe a time you managed a tight deadline or a difficult stakeholder. Paint the picture briefly. What happened, what action you took, what changed as a result.
For example, “Two weeks before a product launch, our supplier pulled out. I sourced alternatives and reworked the timeline with the team. As a result, we launched only three days late and kept our biggest client.”
People remember stories and they trust examples.
3. Calm the body first. Interview anxiety is physiological. Trying to “think calm” rarely works if the body feels under threat. The body needs to know it’s safe first. So here are two simple tools you can use in the moment to help signal internal safety and help regulate your state.
First, before the interview begins, breathe with a longer exhale (for instance, inhale for four counts, exhale for eight). A slow, extended exhale tells the nervous system there’s no immediate threat.
Second, ground your posture. Whether you’re standing or sitting, plant your feet firmly on the ground, relax your shoulders, and hold your chin level. Because of the brain-body feedback loop, your posture influences how steady and assured you feel, and how you appear.
Interviews rarely reveal the full picture of someone’s capability. All they do is capture a narrow snapshot of how someone handles evaluation, judgement, uncertainty and pressure in a short window of time. It’s an imperfect system, but it’s the one most workplaces still rely on.
Anxiety often shows up because something matters. But left unmanaged, it can distort how capable you appear. That’s why the person who manages their nerves best in the moment often ends up being the one who gets the callback.

Trump says Iran deal won't come easy, but talks going well

WASHINGTON, February 19. /TASS/. Washington’s negotiations with Tehran are going well, but it won't be easy to reach an agreement, US President Donald Trump said during the inaugural meeting of the Board of Peace.
"You know, good talks are being held," he said. "It's proven to be, over the years, not easy to make a meaningful deal with Iran. We have to make a meaningful deal, otherwise bad things happen, but we have to make a meaningful deal."
He reiterated that Washington will not allow Iran to obtain nuclear weapons and claimed that Tehran is still entertaining the idea.
"We do have some work to do with Iran," Trump said. "They can't have a nuclear weapon. It's very simple. You can't have peace in the Middle East if they have a nuclear weapon."
Earlier, CBS reported that the American administration is considering striking Iran on February 21. In January, the White House warned that it was ready to use force if Tehran fails to engage in talks aimed at reaching a "fair deal" under which Iran completely drops any plans to obtain nuclear weapons. The Iranian government has repeatedly said it had no plans of creating a nuclear bomb.
On February 17, the second round of negotiations between the US and Iran on the nuclear issue took place in Geneva, mediated by Oman. According to Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi, the parties reached mutual understanding on a number of issues, which could serve as a basis for a draft future agreement on the nuclear program. US Vice President JD Vance said that the talks went well on a number of aspects, but Tehran is not yet ready to accept some of the fundamental positions outlined by the White House. Earlier, the United States and Israel insisted that Iran not only scrap its nuclear program, but also stop producing ballistic missiles and supporting pro-Iranian forces in the Middle East.

Trump tells Board of Peace he’ll decide on bombing Iran within 10 days
Washington: US President Donald Trump says he will likely decide whether to launch strikes against Iran over the next 10 days, as he continues the biggest American miliary build-up in the Middle East since the invasion of Iraq in 2003.
Trump made the remarks in Washington at the first meeting of the Board of Peace, a new international alliance convened by Trump that has so far been snubbed by a number of major US allies, including Australia.
“Iran is a hotspot right now,” Trump said. “Good talks are being had. It’s proven to be over the years not easy to make a meaningful deal. We have to make a meaningful deal otherwise bad things happen.”
The president referred to his strikes in June on Iran’s major nuclear facilities, which he said had decimated the Islamic Republic’s ability to develop nuclear weapons and cleared the way for a deal to end Israel’s war in Gaza.
“Now we may have to take a step further, or we may not,” Trump said. “Maybe we’re going to make a deal. But you’re going to be finding out over the next probably 10 days.”
The comments followed reports in US media outlets on Wednesday (Washington time) that Trump had been briefed that the US was now militarily ready to strike Iran, given the number of assets surged to the region.
That includes two of the US’s largest aircraft strike carrier groups, the USS Abraham Lincoln and USS Gerald Ford – the latter of which is still on its way – and dozens of aircraft refuelling tankers that were tracked heading toward Europe and the Middle East this week.
Trump has previously given false timelines to Tehran. Last June, ahead of the strikes on Iran’s nuclear facilities, he said he would decide “within two weeks” – but dropped bombs two days later.
Meanwhile, representatives of the Board of Peace said progress had been made towards securing Gaza, which was the original impetus for the organisation before Trump expanded its remit.
Five nations have agreed to commit troops to the United Nations-mandated International Stabilisation Force (ISF) that will be tasked with securing peace in the wartorn territory: Indonesia, Morocco, Kazakhstan, Kosovo and Albania.
The force will be commanded by US Major General Jasper Jeffers, who said Indonesia agreed to fill the deputy commander’s post. Egypt and Jordan have agreed to train a Palestinian police force.
An ISF brigade would be assigned to each of five sectors in Gaza, Jeffers said: Rafah, Khan Younis, Deir al-Balah, Gaza City and North Gaza, starting with Rafah in the south.
Former Bulgarian minister and diplomat Nickolay Mladenov, the board’s director-general for Gaza, said 2000 Palestinians signed up to join a transitional police force in just a few hours this week.
Trump, meanwhile, announced nine Board of Peace members had pledged $US7 billion ($10 billion) towards a Gaza relief package. The Associated Press reported that figure was about a 10th of what was ultimately needed to rebuild the shattered territory after the two-year war between Israel and Hamas.
Former British prime minister Tony Blair, speaking about the future governance of Gaza, said the territory had “vast” potential, with 40 kilometres of Mediterranean coastline, proximity to regional and global markets and a population whose median age was just 19.
Blair pledged that a future Gaza would boast effective public institutions, a tolerant education system and a business-friendly, tech-enabled society – though he provided no details about how this would be achieved.
“This is a vision of Gaza as part of the Middle East at peace – not a phoney peace of declarations no one means, and agreements no one intends to keep,” he said.
Trump’s peace plan remained “the best and only” hope for Gaza, the region and the wider world, Blair said.
Billionaire Cypriot-Israeli real estate mogul Yakir Gabay presented an ambitious six-stage redevelopment plan for Gaza, again starting in the south. The coastline, he said, “can be developed as a new Mediterranean riviera with 200 hotels and potential islands”.
The inaugural meeting of Trump’s Board of Peace attracted several heads of state from founding members, including the King of Bahrain and the presidents of Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, Romania and Argentina.
Indonesian President Prabowo Subianto confirmed his country would contribute 8000 or more troops to the peacekeeping force in Gaza, and said he was optimistic Trump’s peace plan could succeed. “There will be problems, but we will prevail,” he said.
Other members sent prime ministers or other ministers, including Israel, which was represented by Foreign Minister Gideon Sa’ar, while some countries attended the meeting as “observers”.
Numerous US allies were absent, especially from Western Europe. The United Kingdom, France and Germany have rejected joining the board, while Trump rescinded an invitation to Canada.
Ukraine refused to join after Trump extended an invitation to Russia, which has not yet agreed to participate.
Australia has not made a final decision, but Foreign Minister Penny Wong told Senate estimates that joining the organisation would incur legally binding obligations.
“That requires a range of considerations that are quite different to those which apply to other international groupings or commitments we’ve entered into,” she said earlier in February.

Which Perth suburb had the most crime in 2025?

Which Perth suburb had the most crime in 2025?
Crime last year was down to its lowest level in Western Australia since 2022, according newly released WA Police statistics.
And while some suburbs saw a dramatic downturn in criminal activity, for others it was a different story.
WAtoday has examined the data and compiled a per capita snapshot of each suburb, giving a fairer picture of which areas of Perth suffered the most issues.
While some of the top contenders are to be expected, given their proximity to nightlife and retail precincts, others emerged as surprising crime hotspots.
The data collect by police unsurprisingly shows that Perth and Northbridge topped the list of suburbs with the most crime, followed by Cannington, south of the city, which is home to Carousel shopping centre.
The figures show that while crime in Cannington has decreased by 2 per cent over the last 12 months, it has risen by nearly 70 per cent since 2020. Stealing offences, in particular, have almost doubled in that time.
Fourth on the top 10 list is the eastern suburb of Forrestdale, where crime has risen sharply – an increase of 93 per cent since 2021.
The suburb sits within the City of Armadale and is advertised to potential home owners as offering a semi-rural lifestyle where the median house price is currently about $850,000 and median rent is just over $700 a week.
Forrestdale houses just over 1000 residents, according to the last census, but assault reports – both family and non-family – appear to blame for the big increase in crime statistics.
The next suburb on the list sits on the end of the train line and is generally considered a crime zone due to its low socio-economic status.
While house prices in Midland have risen, they still sit at a more affordable median range of $600,000 with rents also sitting at around $600 a week.
But while Midland is home to over 6000 people and regularly sits at the top of the most crime-ridden suburbs in Perth, crime there has actually decreased significantly in the last year.
The figures show crime in the town has dropped by 15 per cent from 2024 to 2025. Stealing is down, graffiti is down, breaching a restraining order is down, sexual offences are down and so is robbery.
Fremantle sits sixth on the top 10 list, but it has also seen a reduction in crime of 10 per cent over the last 12 months, followed by Karawara, just south of the city.
However, the centrally located suburb that is close to Curtin University has bucked the trend and seen an increase in crime of nearly 5 per cent which, despite the area now commanding on average nearly $1 million for houses.
Burswood, home to WA’s only casino, is eighth on the list and has also seen a reduction in crime of 15 per cent, along with Cockburn Central at ninth, where crime has reduced by more than 7 per cent in the last year.
Tenth on the list this year is Armadale, where the crime rates have almost remained the same between 2024 and 2025.
Other suburbs across the metro area that also saw a big reduction in crime include Rivervale in Perth’s east, which sits in the City of Belmont about six kilometres from the CBD. Home to almost 11,000 residents, the crime there over the past year dropped dramatically by 33 per cent.
An even bigger reduction was seen in Queens Park, where crime reports halved, and in Karrinyup where crime dropped by 35 per cent between 2024 and 2025.
Cloverdale, about 10 kilometres east of the city, also saw a big reduction in crime by 30 per cent, while Victoria Park and Carlisle saw crime drop by 28 per cent and 25 per cent, respectively.
Crime has gone up in a few instances, including in the northern Perth suburb of Two Rocks, where reports almost doubled, and in Shoalwater near Rockingham, where crime rose by 40 per cent over the last 12 months.
Other suburbs that saw a rise in issues included Woodbridge (39 per cent), Maylands (26 per cent), Parmelia (25 per cent), Balcatta (20 per cent) and Alkimos (19 per cent).
Our regional towns also saw some big jumps in crime numbers, with both Narrogin and Newman seeing a reduction in crime.
Kununurra, however, still rates as one of the worst places for crime in the state, rivalling Perth’s entertainment precincts for crime reports per capita.

Plan to protect children from toxic metals erased from NSW government report

Plan to protect children from toxic metals erased from NSW government report
A draft proposal to relocate childcare centres, playgrounds and schools at high risk of toxic metal exposure was one of several recommendations removed from an independent report into lead contamination in Broken Hill, new documents reveal.
NSW Chief Scientist Hugh Durrant-Whyte on Thursday published his agency’s report into the health and environmental impacts of lead contamination in Broken Hill, the mining town 14 hours west of Sydney, built on one of the world’s largest deposits of silver, zinc and lead.
Durrant-Whyte said lowering dangerously high levels of lead in the blood of Broken Hill’s children was “an urgent public health priority”, after finding progress on the issue had slowed and many historical recommendations were yet to be implemented.
“The purpose of this report is not to delay progress but to realign current efforts toward minimising community exposure to lead, particularly in children,” he wrote. “The development window from birth to five years old is critical and delays in effective intervention risks irreversible impairment and potential lifelong complications to successive generations.”
Three of the seven recommendations initially proposed by Durrant-Whyte’s office did not make the final report, drafts of the document made public through a parliamentary call for papers reveal.
One of the recommendations, contained in an October draft, suggested developing a detailed map to “identify and visualise contamination hotspots”. This data could be used to guide planning decisions around remediation and possible relocation of high-risk facilities “such as childcare centres, schools and public play areas from zones of elevated lead exposure”.
In 2023, two of three preschools in the town had lead levels above the threshold for intervention, according to data published in the draft report.
A sixth recommendation, also removed from the final report, suggested conducting a cost-benefit analysis of dust-reduction strategies such as street sweepers and revegetation.
The final recommendation in the October draft proposed seeking additional funding from alternative government programs such as the Commonwealth’s Closing the Gap measures or the NSW social housing energy performance initiative.
Emails from March last year show funding for Broken Hill’s lead program was under strain. The program had fallen outside the priority projects being taken to the Expenditure Review Committee “as their allocation has been exhausted”.
In reply, one public servant warned it would be challenging for the community if the program were “not funded and momentum is lost”.
‘There’s virtually zero interest from the NSW government in the health and wellbeing of Aboriginal children in Broken Hill ... [It is] a waste of time really.’Richard Weston, chief executive of Maari Ma Health Aboriginal Corporation
Emails from November 6 show the Office of the Chief Scientist and Engineer (OCSE) invited bureaucrats from NSW Health, the NSW Environment Protection Authority (EPA), and the premier’s department to a confidential briefing the next week.
The bureaucrats were told the briefing would “not be open to editorial commentary” and only minor adjustments may occur before the final publication of the report.
The parliamentary documents include a November media request from the Herald asking the chief scientist when the report would be published, which was escalated to the premier’s department for approval.
The report was due to be submitted to the premier’s department and published in December but was not made public until Thursday, shortly after the Herald sent questions about the drafts and why the publication had been delayed by two months.
The OCSE declined to respond to questions, stating they did not comment on published reports.
A spokesperson for the premier’s department said they did not request changes to the report’s recommendations.
The department will now consider the chief scientist’s recommendations, including a $2.5 million proposal to conduct further investigations until December, the spokesperson said. “A response will be confirmed in due course.”
The government’s response to the issue has caused frustration in the town’s Indigenous community.
Durrant-Whyte’s report noted that Aboriginal children in Broken Hill were disproportionately affected by lead contamination, with much higher lead exposure risk compared to the general population.
Half of all government-owned homes for Indigenous families had high levels of lead, and 23 per cent were at very high risk from lead contamination, the report said.
Maari Ma Health Aboriginal Corporation chief executive Richard Weston said the Indigenous health service withdrew from the Broken Hill Environmental Lead Response Group in November in protest at the government’s inaction.
“There’s virtually zero interest from the NSW government in the health and wellbeing of Aboriginal children in Broken Hill,” Weston said. “[It is] a waste of time, really.”
An earlier draft from October said Broken Hill was a case study for what can happen with mining elsewhere, “including Mudgee”, where a new silver, zinc and lead mine was approved in 2023.
Greens MP Cate Faehrmann, who requested the documents, described the final report as “politically palatable” for Premier Chris Minns.
“The people of Broken Hill have the right to be very angry at the government,” she said. “They just refuse to do what’s necessary to keep the kids of Broken Hill safe.”

The NSW town where home buyers splashed the most cash last year

The NSW town where home buyers splashed the most cash last year
Orange has been revealed as the regional NSW suburb where buyers splashed the most cash on houses in 2025.
Most top-ranked towns were inland, with only one by the beach. The Central West foodie destination took out the top spot, recording $688,087,299 in house sales, according to Cotality’s Best of the Best 2025 report, which tracks the total value of sales in the 12 months to September.
While the median house price was a modest $693,783 at the end of November, high-end listings, including an $8 million trophy sale, helped Orange take the top spot. There were 898 house sales over that period in the Central West city.
Cotality research director Tim Lawless said Orange was the second-largest suburb in NSW by area, which also contributed to the result.
It nudged ahead of the largest suburb, Port Macquarie, partly due to the sheer number of houses that changed hands. The Mid North Coast suburb was the only coastal spot to feature in Cotality’s regional top five.
“Orange had a turnover rate of 5.7 per cent, well above the national average of 5 per cent,” said Lawless.
The drivers of Orange’s economy – a large teaching hospital, a gold mine and an outpost of the state’s Departments of Primary Industries and Regional Development – meant workers came and went, increasing turnover, according to Lawless.
The large numbers of students and temporary workers also supported Orange’s rental market, in turn attracting investors, said Michael Wright, an agent at Peter Fisher Orange.
“People who are priced out of the city market will buy an investment property here as a way to build wealth, with a view to possibly moving here down the track.”
Orange last year was named Australia’s top retirement destination in research from rewards platform Citro (backed by AMP).
Wright said the hospital, which expanded in 2011, and the adjoining medical precinct were drawing growing numbers of visitors and new residents.
“Instead of having to go to Sydney to get treated, people from the bush can come to Orange. We also get a lot of people from further out west retiring here because they want the things a city can offer, but in the country.”
Wright retired from farming and moved to Orange in the 1990s with his wife and three children. He said the city was a “magic” place to raise kids.
“Our springs and autumns have to be seen to be believed.”
Orange Mayor Tony Mileto said it had changed over time but had kept its heart. “It’s still welcoming, inclusive and community focused.”
Mileto said the community reached out to support his sister when she lost her husband in a motor vehicle accident in 1989, for example.
The growing Orange Food Week and Orange Wine Festival were attracting tree-changers from larger cities, Mileto said.
“The diversity in our economy is supporting consistent demand for housing at different cost points,” he said.
Orange’s tight rental market and rising house prices – the median has jumped 42.9 per cent in the past five years, according to Cotality – was “a concern” for some long-time residents, Mileto said.
“The challenge is managing growth in a way that welcomes new residents without displacing the people who already call Orange home.”
To address this, Orange City Council has partnered with Landcom to develop a vacant parcel of land. Dubbed Redleaf, the development will deliver more than 300 new homes.
Of the city’s existing stock, houses priced below $800,000 have been attracting the greatest interest, said agent Anthony Cook of John Cook Real Estate.
“We are receiving a lot of investment enquiries for lower-end properties – anything from $400,000 up to $800,000,” he said.
Cook said many affordable properties sold while tenanted. “If they’re not, generally you can find a tenant before the property settles.”
In the centre of town, on the streets surrounding Cook Park, large Victorian homes can change hands for between $3 million and $4 million, Cook said.
On the outskirts, large acreages with grand homesteads can command much higher prices. In August, the 49-hectare Rosedale Farm sold for $8 million.
Cook said the town’s positives far outweighed any worries.
“We’ve got some of the greatest vineyards in the country, for example, and they’re all quite close to town. There is something for everyone here.”
Lawless said Orange’s diverse economy, lifestyle attractions and relative affordability meant the city would probably continue to see price growth.
“That blend of affordability and liveability makes it very attractive. And it’s got some good wine, which never hurts.”

Taylor may shoot for the summit. Even his backers will settle for base camp

Opinion
Taylor may shoot for the summit. Even his backers will settle for base camp
Depending on who you talk to in the Liberal Party, the early mail on Angus Taylor’s leadership prospects ranges from “he will be gone by the end of 2026” to “he will put in a good showing but lose in 2028.”
Some Liberal MPs, especially those in the centre-right and unaligned groupings who were booted out of shadow cabinet, are upset. But most moderates were spared a purge of the shadow ministry, and the 34-17 margin (in the Taylor-Sussan Ley leadership ballot) has drawn a line under the contest.
Now Taylor’s real task begins: restoring the Coalition as a credible alternative government.
Taylor and his allies have just executed a relatively bloodless coup.
First, they stayed the hand of the younger Andrew Hastie in the contest to replace Sussan Ley and then, after prevaricating for most of a week, Taylor and his crew pulled off the double and brought the career of the first woman to lead the Liberal Party to an unhappy end.
Taylor, his deputy Jane Hume and his allies have also pulled off a deft refresh off the frontbench, bringing back harder-edged conservatives including Jacinta Nampijinpa Price, Hastie and Sarah Henderson while promoting younger talent including Tim Wilson and Claire Chandler to the two most senior economic portfolios.
Of the 22 Liberals in the 30-member shadow ministry, 12 are now under 50 (up from seven) and 10 MPs are over 50.
That matters because as even one of Taylor’s close allies admits, when not hyperbolically claiming the Albanese government is the worst in Australian history: “Gus might be able to get us to base camp in 2028 [the next federal election] but it’s hard to see him reaching the summit.”
Why some Liberals think it’s a good idea to regularly insult Australians’ intelligence and tell them they elected the worst government in history just nine months ago is a question for another time.
Another Taylor ally told me in the lead-up to the leadership ballot: “We need to make generational change. We need to shock Labor. What we need to do is put in place the mechanisms for success over a longer period of time. We need a five-year pathway to 2031.”
In other words, it may not be until 2031 – under a leader who is not Taylor – that the Coalition has a chance of winning government. So Taylor’s allies are glum rather than cock-a-hoop because they realise their man probably only gets one shot at leading the party and that’s now – given his age (59), the need for further renewal and, most of all, because they can count.
Labor holds a record 94 seats in the lower house and the Coalition a paltry 42. A Taylor win or even forcing the Albanese government into minority in 2028 would be a near-miracle. As a Ley supporter observes: “Every time they claim Albanese is the worst government in history, they’re telling voters they got it wrong … even though he won 94 seats.”
The predictions of bruised and cranky Ley supporters about Taylor’s prospects are, unsurprisingly, far more pessimistic than the new leader’s supporters’.
“I think the party room is going to start realising by the end of March they’ve made a terrible mistake and he’s not up to it,” a second Ley supporter told me this week. “They will switch to Hastie by the end of the year.”
Of course, that would mean installing Hastie (or Wilson) before they may be ready to lead – and so prematurely burn through a future leader.
The idea that Taylor could be ousted by the end of the year, as sketched out by the second Ley supporter, seems less likely given his colleagues’ benchmark for his success should be low, in line with the Liberals’ record-low poll numbers.
Angus Taylor is no Tony Abbott. He risks damaging his own credibility, rather than that of the government, if he attempts to emulate Abbott, one of his mentors, and simply opposes everything. Taylor is not facing an unstable minority government at war with itself.
Yet he has already signalled opposition to any change to the capital gains tax – as Labor has foreshadowed could be made in the next budget – and labelled it a tax that would reduce the supply of housing, rather than a tax discount for investment properties.
The new opposition leader’s situation is less like Abbott’s in 2010 and more like that faced by John Howard in 1985, when he became Liberal leader after Bob Hawke’s second election win. Howard realised that the way to return the Liberals and Nationals to base camp and a chance of reaching the summit was by restoring the Coalition’s economic credibility. He backed some of the Hawke government’s free-market reforms.
There is an argument that this kept the Coalition in opposition for longer at the time, but it also set up Howard to lead a long-term government from 1996 – because the parties’ economic and policy credentials had been restored. That, rather than opposition for its own sake, should be Taylor’s goal, even if it means he has to pass the torch to Hastie or Wilson one day.
It’s not clear that Taylor has realised this. He doesn’t sound credible when he opposes tax policy sight unseen, or describes the Albanese government in overblown terms.
There are people in the Coalition who believe a modest structural reform to the tax system is reasonable and that the opposition should simply bank the savings and move on.
There are two more things Taylor can do to begin the task of restoring the Coalition’s credibility: release the election review conducted by party elders Nick Minchin and Pru Goward, which has been put on hold after a legal warning from Peter Dutton, and address the Coalition’s failures.
As that first Ley supporter puts it: “It’s the worst election result in the party’s history and they haven’t even released a summary document [of the review], let alone a conclusive document.
“I’m still waiting for a Liberal MP to say they’re sorry – ‘We got it wrong, we let you down, we made mistakes and we will make sure we don’t do it again’ … but they can’t even do that.”
Taylor, at least, has apologised for the opposition’s decision to oppose a tax cut. He should go further. The road to credibility for a federal opposition runs through sensible commentary and constructive criticism, not hyperbole. It must present itself as a “safe change”, as Howard realised and as Albanese did in 2019-22 when he strategically backed certain Coalition government decisions and opposed others.
Can Taylor turn the volume down from 11?

Role of the media in Israel’s national security psychological crisis - opinion
Unknown

Israel’s greatest strategic asset has never been its size, geography, or even military strength. It has been resilience – the collective psychological ability of society to absorb shock, mobilize under pressure, and recover from trauma while preserving democratic life.
In a country where nearly every family is connected to the military, where reserve duty interrupts careers, and where conflict periodically disrupts daily life, resilience is not a slogan – it is infrastructure. It is what allows a small, embattled democracy to function in a volatile region.
Yet today, an uncomfortable question must be asked: Is Israeli media, despite its democratic vitality and professional strengths, inadvertently weakening the very resilience that sustains the country?
The issue is not freedom of the press, nor criticism of government – both essential in a democracy. The problem lies in how modern media dynamics, competition, and political polarization combine to create a constant psychological stress environment that erodes social cohesion over time.
In conditions of persistent conflict, the media ceases to be merely an information channel. It becomes part of a national security psychology crisis – shaping how citizens emotionally experience threats and crises.
And right now, that experience is often corrosive.
I came to understand this firsthand two decades ago while serving as strategic adviser to then-public security minister Uzi Landau, then minister of public security, at a time when Israel broadened its understanding of internal security challenges in ways similar to the United States after 9/11.
While terror attacks inflicted horrific human costs, they were tactically destructive but psychologically strategic.
Terror aimed to spread panic far beyond the immediate victims.
To counter this, I developed training programs for police and first responders focused on managing the public psychological environment during and after attacks – rethinking the terror scene from a media coverage perspective. The guiding principle was simple: restore visible law and order quickly. Demonstrate control. Reduce panic. Help society return to normal life as quickly as possible.
I recruited leading members of the Israeli media who participated in simulations alongside police commanders, learning how coverage could either amplify terror or limit its psychological spread.
On February 22, 2004, theory collided with reality.
I was in a taxi on my way to the gym in Jerusalem, several cars ahead of Egged bus No. 14A, when a suicide bomber detonated explosives during morning rush hour near Liberty Bell Park. The explosion threw our taxi forward. As the driver sped away from the blast, I jumped out and ran back toward the scene to help.
The devastation was horrific. But what mattered most to me was how the event would be communicated to millions of Israelis watching at home.
At the scene, I worked with the police and first responders to arrange that local media focus on police and rescue operations – restoring order, assisting victims, demonstrating control – rather than broadcasting graphic images that would magnify fear nationwide. For the foreign media, I suggested we get them focused on the gruesome visuals, while the role of the Israeli coverage was to help signal something critical: the state was functioning, authorities were in control, and society would continue.
In that moment, the media played a direct and responsible role in national resilience and securing Israel’s National Security Psychology.
Two decades later, the environment has grown worse by leaps and bounds. While the advent of new television channels like 14 and 15 has, in many ways, created a better balance for the effects of political leanings in our media coverage, some of the systemic challenges to our national security have gone unaddressed.
Perpetual cycle of breaking news in Israel
Today, nonstop crisis coverage exhausts the public. Israeli viewers live in a perpetual state of breaking news. Studio panels, speculation, and political confrontation dominate airtime. Even routine developments are framed as dramatic turning points. Emotional fatigue replaces solidarity.
National resilience requires psychological recovery breaks, even if they are designed into the news coverage of the day. Instead, coverage often keeps the country in permanent alarm mode.
Polarization is amplified nightly. Television panels resemble political battlegrounds rather than forums for sober analysis. Debate is healthy in a democracy, but when internal conflict becomes the main spectacle, citizens absorb a message of division rather than shared purpose. While this phenomenon is not unique to Israel, as anyone who has watched the international news can attest, it is Israel’s security challenges that make our situation unique and a far greater risk.
Endless repetition of traumatic images compounds the damage. Ongoing reporting becomes psychological overload when replayed continuously, creating despair rather than resilience.
In the movie Network (1976), Sidney Lumet’s biting satire about television, media power, and public outrage, veteran news anchor Howard Beale grabs the attention of his TV audience in a pivotal scene by urging them to literally stand up, go to their windows, and – as an expression of collective frustration and disillusionment with the state of the world and their own helplessness in it – shout in unison, “I’m as mad as hell and I’m not going to take this anymore!”
That scene feels particularly relevant to Israel’s current media environment because many outlets today mirror the same dynamics Network satirized decades ago: prioritizing outrage-driven content that stokes emotional reaction over sober reporting, chasing ratings over responsibility by amplifying sensationalism, elevating celebrity news personalities whose personas overshadow factual context, and turning news into spectacle rather than journalism.
When journalistic ethics lose out to profit or politically focused motives, societal trust is one of the first casualties.
Trust also erodes when the line between journalism and political messaging blurs.
Only a few months ago, while opening one of Israel’s most trusted news platforms on my phone, I encountered a highly charged political advertisement dominating the screen without clear labeling distinguishing it from editorial content. Only after clicking through, was it clear that this was paid messaging rather than journalism, but it had already influenced how I read and interpreted the news that I consumed after seeing the advertising.
Concerned, I wrote privately to a senior representative of the organization warning that blurring news and advertising risks sacrificing long-term credibility for short-term revenue. The response I received was candid: “You are correct. I will deal with it.”
The incident was resolved, but the lesson remains: when citizens cannot distinguish whether they are seeing journalistic reporting or editorial messaging, trust declines. This collapse of trust is not only in the media, but in the government, in the army, in the courts, and across all the major institutions that are critical to our collective survival. None of this necessarily implies malicious intent.
Democracy requires accountability – but it also requires social cohesion. A society cannot sustain constant internal psychological conflict while facing persistent external threats.
National resilience-oriented responsible journalism does not mean propaganda. It means informing without inflaming, scrutinizing without destroying confidence, and exposing failures without convincing citizens their society is irreparably broken.
National security is not only about armies and missile defense: it is also about our collective psychology. It is about whether citizens have the trust and belief that their society can endure.
And that belief and trust is reshaped, every day, on the news.

Three cars lurked in Balga’s bushland the night a woman was murdered

Three cars lurked in Balga’s bushland the night a woman was murdered
John Napier-Winch remembers in vivid detail a late evening in October, 1974.
He and his wife had been driving home from their parents house in Girrawheen about midnight with their sleeping children, through the backstreets of Balga.
Napier-Winch remembers how still and eerie it was when he slowed his car to a crawl on the dimly lit Balga Avenue and saw a car parked near the bushland.
The car stood out on the dark street, with all four doors ajar and its interior lit up.
“I remember ... because it was parked in a funny place,” Napier-Winch told this masthead.
The spot on Balga Avenue had no houses bordering it, and was practically enveloped in bush. There were no driveways, and the nearest sign of life at midnight would have been the nearby Malthouse Tavern.
“The doors were open, and the lights were on … but there was no one around,” Napier-Winch said.
His first thought was someone had crashed their car and gone to get help. But a quick look around revealed there was no damage to the exterior at all, and it appeared to be running fine. The odd thing, Napier-Winch said, was that no one was there.
It was only days later he realised what he and his family may have just stumbled across.
This week, WAtoday has brought you the story of Gwenneth Graham’s murder, which remains unsolved after five decades. The first two parts of this series were published on Monday and Wednesday. This is part three.
The missing window
Gwenneth Graham was murdered in September 1974.
She was last seen at the Malthouse Tavern in Balga, the evening before the WAFL grand final.
A bartender called a taxi for her, but it’s not known whether she ever got in, accepted a lift or attempted to walk to her house which was about two kilometres away. She never made it home.
Gwen was found murdered in Balga’s bushland nine days later, inexpertly concealed under some leaf litter and an old refrigerator. She had been bashed, strangled and sexually assaulted.
Napier-Winch remembers reading the paper the day after her body had been found, and realising he and his family had likely only been metres from the dead mother-of-two.
“We thought, ‘That’s the same location we saw the car’,” he said.
“We ran to the police, and they came out [to the house], and I described to them the exact make and year of that car.”
Related Article
More than 50 years on, Napier-Winch and his wife find it difficult to place when exactly they had come across the car parked on Balga Avenue, but place it only days before Graham’s body was discovered.
As an avid car fan, Napier-Winch was able to recall the vehicle down to minute details – it was a Ford or Valiant, he said, with a swapped-out boot lid that appeared to be chrome. It had a spoiler at the rear that didn’t match the rest of its body.
“It means one of two things – they changed the boot, or they just put on a fancy chrome lid that came off another model,” he said.
“We gave police all the details, but we don’t know what they did with it.”
Muddying the waters
Identifying the cars became a primary focus of detectives, particularly due to the last sighting of Graham taking place in a pub’s carpark.
Police released details of a number of cars and implored their drivers to come forward so they could eliminate them from the investigation, and ended up going through about 4000 separate vehicles.
However, three went unclaimed.
They included a Holden station wagon and two separate Valiants that had been seen in the time frame narrowed down by police: between 11.30pm, when Gwen was last seen, and 10am the next day when locals remembered seeing some discarded shoes on Redcliffe Avenue.
For officers, it was tough sorting out fact from distraction.
The Valiants
There were reports relating to two Valiants that had been seen in the Balga area on the night of Graham’s murder.
A 16-year-old boy said he heard the voices of a man and woman coming from a green sedan parked on Balga Avenue around 11.30pm.
The witness told police at the time he heard the man demand a “perverted sex act” from the woman, and “threats to kill if the other person did not do as he asked”.
Witnesses said they also saw a car of the same make but in a light colour parked on the verge of Balga Avenue about the 11.40pm.
In an account that matches the one Napier-Winch gave in 2025, witnesses said they too came across the car parked up near the bush with all its interior lights on – but there was no driver.
The witnesses said they drove past again about half an hour later, and saw a man get into the car and slide across the front bench seat towards the driver’s side.
The man looked to be aged between 28 and 35, about 5′10 with a thin build, and was in a light-coloured, long-sleeved shirt with medium-length curly, dark hair. It would later emerge the car was seen extremely close to where Graham’s body was eventually found.
On interrogating the statements, police were unable to rule either vehicle in or out and neither car nor driver were ever located.
Teen comes forward
However, it wasn’t long before one car emerged as an interest to detectives.
A WA police gazette from 1974 recalled what a witness told officers about what he saw in Balga on the evening of September 27.
“About 11.30pm a 15-year-old youth observed a white woman being forced into the front passenger seat of a 1964 model (Holden) station sedan, bluish/green colour, with a white top. The vehicle may have a roof rack, but this is not certain,” it reads.
While this was set out in the gazette, a vintage car expert told this masthead the year was likely inaccurate, given the Holden model identified was only built from February 1965 to April 1966, making it unlikely it was a 1964 car.
“The youth described the person who pushed the woman into this vehicle as a part Aboriginal man about 5ft 8in to 5ft 9in, stocky build, black hair, wearing a white shirt with sleeves rolled up and dark trousers,” the police gazette read.
“His age is not known but he has an untidy appearance. He then hurried around the front of the car, entered the vehicle and drove off in the direction of Balga Avenue.”
The car was again spotted just about 1am the next morning, near where Graham’s body was found.
But neither the driver nor the car were never located.
A taxi driver’s account
Police experienced a further headache when a taxi driver came forward and told them he had picked up a “part-Aboriginal man” and a woman matching Graham’s description from the Malthouse Tavern on the night of September 27.

The driver said he had been parked at the taxi rank outside the pub when a man approached him and got in the passenger seat.
The driver described his passenger as a “casually dressed” and “well-spoken”, and claimed he directed him towards a woman who appeared drunk, sitting nearby behind the local service station.
The driver said the woman claimed to have hurt her ankle – he said he wasn’t sure if she was feigning or if was a real injury – and accepted a lift.
He said she was carrying two bottles of beer, and was wearing a white cardigan and a skirt when he dropped them at a house in Balga.
While he was unable to tell police which house he took them to, he said he did remember the man pulling the woman from the car and the exact fare he paid.
As detectives sought to check, verify and exclude all the claims surrounding the cars that evening, sorting fact from fiction was proving difficult.
“Extensive enquiries have failed to trace those vehicles or the persons referred to,” the police gazette said.
One thing police knew for sure is that Graham was not en route to her house when she left the pub that night.
Her home on Felpham Avenue was in the opposite direction of where her body had been found, making it more and more likely she had been in a car before her death.
But with all the car sightings seemingly leading to dead ends, detectives had to ask other questions. Had she noticed mid-drive they were not going in the direction of her house? Had she said something? What about the reports she got in an argument the night of her murder?
And why was her murder so similar to one that happened months earlier a few kilometres away?

News Corp HQ locked down as Lachlan Murdoch, Albanese make Holt St pilgrimage for Sky’s name change
In this week’s On Background, News Corp staff to make way for the unveiling of Sky News’ rebrand, Sharri Markson’s decision to steer clear of Pauline Hanson (for a time) is vindicated, and the ABC tries to find a new 7.30 boss.
Nothing to see here
In pre-modern Japan, ordinary people were often forbidden from looking their emperor in the eye. At times, he was said to hold audiences behind bamboo screens.
So it seems to be with Lachlan Murdoch – the heir to the Sun King – who is set to be on hand to open Sky News’ plush new Holt Street studios in Surry Hills (and announce the network’s new name!) on Friday afternoon.
On Thursday evening, Sky issued an “areas closure” notice to staff, telling those not invited to the august event, which will also be attended by the likes of Prime Minister Anthony Albanese and NSW Premier Chris Minns, to stay out.
They won’t be allowed access to the main foyer, cafe, or main stairwell from Thursday evening, all the way through until Friday night.
Organisers have also gone as far as disconnecting the cameras in the studio where the event will be held, so nobody can see in as they get ready for the big reveal. Or maybe it’s just to keep Lachie separate from the foot soldiers? Or is there insufficient catering?
It’s a total lockdown, with all of Friday’s on-air programming to be produced in Melbourne, instead.
Sky is, of course, being forced to rebrand after its naming licence holder, Comcast-owned British broadcaster Sky News, decided against renewing the latest decade-long deal that expires this year.
The name change is expected to come into effect in the middle of the year, but the company has chosen to kill two birds with one stone, and use the studios’ opening party for the big reveal, one day after the station turned 30.
A Sky spokesperson did not respond to a request for comment.
Along with Murdoch, the event will be hosted by Sky News Australia chief executive and former newspaper editor Paul Whittaker, with News Corp Australia boss Michael Miller also in attendance. There are rumours of News Corp chief executive Robert Thomson jetting in, too.
Sky’s Sydney studios were previously in Macquarie Park, northern Sydney, but were relocated to News Corp’s long-term Holt Street offices near Central Station in December. The premises are also home to The Australian, news.com.au and The Daily Telegraph.
Sky Australia’s current licence deal was agreed while the British Sky News was still part-owned by News Corp.
One source with knowledge of the planned rebrand, who was not authorised to speak on the record, said in August that a proposal to rebrand Sky as Fox News Australia was rejected by New York HQ because of the latter’s polarising reputation Down Under, and the need for brand differentiation. The final decision needed ticking off by the company’s Avenue of the Americas offices, the source said.
There has since been suggestions the word “Australia” may also be excluded from the new name, to encourage the channel’s growing international audience to stick around.
Was Sharri right all along?
Here at On Background, we have something of a mea culpa to offer. It seems this column may have accidentally contributed to the inception of this week’s dominant political story.
Last week, we brought you the definitive numbers behind Sharri Markson’s prolonged snubbing of right-wing agitators One Nation amid an otherwise station wide love-in.
Maybe we struck a nerve, or maybe the bosses gave Markson a friendly nudge because on the very next show, last Monday, who appeared as the star guest? Pauline Hanson.
The move appears to have vindicated Sharri’s initial judgment, though, as Hanson proceeded to issue racially charged remarks about Muslims.
“You say, oh, well, there’s good Muslims out there,” Hanson said. “Well, I’m sorry, how can you tell me there are good Muslims?”
While the comments were hardly a surprise, considering the last time Markson hosted Hanson was after she wore a burqa into the Senate (for the second time), the latest comments were so bad that after the interview, the host took time to tell viewers “as an Australian Jew, I don’t support what Pauline Hanson just said”.
Ray Hadley, Markson’s next guest, urged the One Nation leader to apologise. Later, Matt Canavan did the same and even new One Nation recruit Barnaby Joyce didn’t back up Hanson’s words. Yikes.
Hanson partially walked back her comments on Wednesday before essentially retracting the quasi-apology.
“And I am not going to apologise … I will have my say now before it’s too late,” she said.
Pretty awful stuff all around. Good thing Sky doesn’t hold a grudge, though. Hanson was back on Sky on Wednesday night. And guess what? On Background has confirmed she and her One Nation crew even received an invitation to their big bash as well.
Markson was approached for comment.
Costello: Back in the game
A week is a long time in modern media, what with the 24-hour news cycle and all that.
But still, it’s been less than a year since former A Current Affair reporter Seb Costello exited Nine, following a review into how he ended up chasing a male interview subject into some women’s toilets, and he’s already back on his feet.
It was the second Nine exit for a Costello to make headlines in less than 12 months, after his father, former federal treasurer and then-company chairman Peter Costello stepped down days after an altercation with a reporter for The Australian at Canberra Airport.
Just six weeks after Daily Mail Australia announced a new column under his name, On Background can reveal Costello jnr has been appointed a senior reporter with rival outlet the Herald Sun.
Editor Sam Weir officially announced the appointment internally on Thursday after Costello’s byline began running in News Corp’s Melbourne tabloid last month as a freelancer. He’d already filed a front page story on Monday. But a leftover column from the man the Mail had dubbed “Melbourne’s ultimate insider” still went online at the digital publication a day later.
7.30 job hunt proves a hard slog
It has been more than two months since the ABC announced wunderkind former 7.30 chief Joel Tozer as the new executive producer of its flagship investigative program, Four Corners.
Tozer begins work on Four Corners on Monday. But the talk of the ABC is the fact they still haven’t managed to fill the top 7.30 job he’s set to vacate.
There is word the headhunting process has come up empty-handed so far. Commissioning editor of 7.30 Patricia Drum will be the show’s acting boss in the meantime.
The show has been a breeding ground for talent, on and off-air. The ABC’s current overall news boss Justin Stevens held the show’s executive producer gig before he was appointed to the top job in 2022.
Under Tozer, the show’s nightly average audience rose by 5 per cent to 789,000 in the 2025 financial year, and continues to rate well.
With host Sarah Ferguson not going anywhere and a newly minted political editor in Jacob Greber, it isn’t exactly a product a new boss could play around with.
An ABC spokesperson said: “This is an important role and the ABC is running a thorough and competitive process which is still ongoing, delayed slightly by the timing falling over summer and coverage of major news events.”
Siobhan McKenna, still a Mel-ebrity
Life is probably a lot quieter this year for Siobhan McKenna, Lachlan Murdoch’s former consigliere, fixer and general right hand.
She signed off from her various jobs running his private company Illyria last year, as well as her role as chief executive of broadcasting for News Corp Australia, which by the end mainly just meant being chair of Sky News. It is probably a relief she doesn’t have to attend any more Sky events, having been referred to by one friend as a “teal” with heavy Labor-links in a profile by this masthead in October.
But it seems McKenna still has time to stay connected. Victorian Premier Jacinta Allan’s diary entries show McKenna is one of a crack team of Mel-ebrities on the organising committee for this year’s Melbourne NFL Game. There is plenty of pressure to get the big game right, as only a lucky few cities are handed one by the powerhouse US football code to show off their stars abroad.
McKenna did not respond to a request for comment.
Alongside McKenna in the team, there is also Lord Mayor Nick Reece, AFL boss Andrew Dillon, Eddie McGuire (of course) and local Disney boss and Western Bulldogs president Kylie Watson-Wheeler among others.
Allan’s diaries also show News Corp’s Thomson still holds some love for his home state. He found time in December for a cup of tea with the premier alongside News Corp powerbroker and Rupert Murdoch’s niece, Penny Fowler, at the Herald & Weekly Times offices in Southbank.
As it is with News Corp, the pollies always come to them.

The Victorian town where home buyers splashed the most cash last year
By Emily Power
Mildura is more famous for oranges than auctions, but the city in Australia’s food bowl is the new epicentre of real estate spending.
The agricultural city, which also has a flourishing tourism and culinary scene, is the location where the most money was spent on houses in regional Victoria in the 12 months to last September, Cotality data shows.
The regional suburb of Mildura had 821 house sales, for a total transaction value of $418,459,341, according to the Cotality Best of the Best 2025 report.
The second most active and lucrative market was Torquay, which had 303 sales resulting in $389,022,040 worth of deals.
Also in the top five were Ocean Grove (352 sales, $388,189,982 total value), Shepparton (755 sales, $369,172,002 total value) and Warrnambool (545 sales, $345,491,388 total value).
Mildura’s low median and multi-pronged economy, across healthcare, farming, hospitality and tourism, has been a magnet for investors and owner-occupiers alike. “It’s really been a story about affordability and opportunity driving that particularly strong growth that we’ve seen,” Cotality’s head of research Gerard Burg says.
The border city also has one of Australia’s sunniest climates. Locals like to quip that it has more hours of blue sky than the Gold Coast. “Mildura is quite an attractive place to move to,” Burg says.
Mildura attracts foodies to establishments such as Stefano’s Restaurant, which consistently wins Good Food Guide accolades. But investors’ appetites are strong, too.
Cotality’s median rental yield in Melbourne is 3.6 per cent, compared to Mildura’s 4.7 per cent. “Investors who can get into the market at a lower value are getting a higher rate of return,” Burg says.
However, the federal government has not ruled out cutting the capital gains discount for investors, and the ongoing debate could affect confidence in markets such as Mildura. “The speculation at the minute that we could see a shift in the capital gains discounts for investors, and that sort of uncertainty might make people wary of buying,” Burg says.
Mildura is typical of the tree-change destinations that welcomed new residents during COVID, but limited stock has since sustained demand. “What we’ve seen over that period is a slowing trend in the number of houses or dwellings that have been listed for sale,” Burg says.
Average days on market in Mildura have also fallen from 30 days to about 20 days.
Mildura’s rise comes after fluctuations in previous reports. It had the fifth-highest total house transactions in regional Victoria in 2024, third in 2023, fell off the list in 2022, and was fifth in 2021.
Founder of One Agency Mildura, Mark Thornton, says when he launched his business in 2021, Mildura’s market was known for its consistency, but not large gains. That has changed. “In the last two years, we’ve seen nothing but extraordinary growth,” he says.
The median house value in Mildura has spiked 20.1 per cent over 12 months, according to Cotality.
Thornton says homes priced about $600,000 are most popular. Two years ago, he says those same properties were trading for about $150,000 less. “When I tell these home owners what their houses are worth, they are surprised.”
Town residents are using equity to upgrade to premium acreage on the outskirts, Thornton says.
Mildura’s performance indicates proximity to a capital city (it’s roughly 400 kilometres to Adelaide and 550 kilometres to Melbourne) is not essential. “We have a diversity of industry, projected population growth and an airport,” Thornton says. “We stand on our own two feet. People drive through hundreds of kilometres of nothing and then they get to Mildura, and it is like a big, green tourism oasis.”
While Mildura’s isolation plays in its favour, Torquay and Ocean Grove are “realistically commutable” for Melbourne workers, Burg explains. With seven-figure medians, these coastal havens are attracting aspirational buyers.
Tim Carson, director of Torquay-based McCartney Real Estate, has noticed home owners in Geelong’s growth corridor suburbs of Armstrong Creek and Warralily are upsizing in Torquay. “They are selling their homes for $600,000 to $900,000, and coming to Torquay to buy from $900,000 up to $1.2 million.”
There has been a knock-on effect, as those vendors pour their gain into a higher-end Torquay property, worth up to $1.5 million. “That’s where we’ve really seen growth,” Carson says.
Overall days on market have shortened, Carson says, but that is owner-occupier driven. Other segments have been stung by the state’s land and vacancy taxes. “Most of our buyers are definitely owner-occupier,” he says. “Investors and the holiday home people have gone out of the market, even though there is a shortage of rentals here and the yield is getting better.”

No good Muslims? Pauline Hanson has removed her racism fig leaf and mulched it

No good Muslims? Pauline Hanson has removed her racism fig leaf and mulched it
Until now, most commentary on the One Nation surge has been about the effect this would have on the Coalition. That’s fair enough given it’s overwhelmingly a story of Coalition voter flight, and it is therefore the Coalition that must respond. But we’ve thought less about the effect this might have on One Nation. It’s never been here before. And we’ve never seen how a pitched battle for conservative major party status might look.
This week, we might have had our first glimpse. It began on Monday night when Pauline Hanson asked rhetorically, incredulously, “I’m sorry, how can you tell me there are good Muslims?” She wasn’t sorry, of course. At least not until a couple of days later when – having previously dug in – she conceded she didn’t “genuinely believe” what she said. She cited at least one good Muslim: the non-practising Muslim woman who stood as a One Nation candidate. She apologised to certain kinds of good Muslims “if” they were “out there”, but somehow still did it defiantly: it’s the only apology I’ve encountered that includes the words “and I am not going to apologise”.
It’s true, this wasn’t a huge departure from what Hanson has always said. Going into the 2016 election, she’d called for a royal commission into Islam. A year later, she declared “Islam is a disease, we need to vaccinate ourselves against that.” Her maiden Senate speech dismissed the idea of embracing “good Muslims”: “How should we tell the difference? … How many lives will be lost or destroyed trying to determine who is good and who is bad?” With this in mind, she’s consistently called for an end to Muslim migration, though in 2007 she said she didn’t have a problem with “Christian Muslims”.
But note the (very) subtle difference. Until this point, Hanson hasn’t disputed the existence of “good Muslims” in theory. She’s argued they’re too hard to identify in practice, or reduced them to a literal contradiction in terms. But this week she just came out and said it: they don’t exist; every Muslim you see, hear from, hear about, is an enemy of Australia. She’s taken the fig leaf and mulched it.
Perhaps this was an accident. Perhaps Hanson suddenly found herself in the middle of a sentence she hadn’t intended to say, but was then committed. More likely, though, she felt perfectly ready to make this statement; to expand the frontiers of a sordid debate.
When Angus Taylor deposed Sussan Ley as Liberal leader last week, two things happened. A poll showed a bump in the Coalition vote at the expense of One Nation. And Taylor framed his leadership around stopping “bad migration”, which he would do by discriminating against applicants “based on values”. “No one will ever be as strong as One Nation on immigration,” retorted Hanson in a flash, challenging him to restrict immigration from “fundamentalist Islamic countries”. Then, on Monday, came a leaked Liberal immigration policy, ostensibly developed under Sussan Ley’s leadership, which sounded very much like a Trumpian version of doing exactly that: banning entry to anyone coming from nominated regions within 13 nations, including Palestine and Somalia, and instituting phone searches at the border to inspect people’s views.
Senior Liberals disowned it, and Taylor dismissed it. But in this sequence of events lurks the ghost of a bidding war. Taylor, clearly worried about One Nation as most Coalition members are, signals he’ll be tough on the politics of culture. Hanson goads the new Coalition leader to put up and declares herself tougher. Then, with the first sign of a modest Coalition recovery, she goes and proves it. If that’s close to the truth, the story is not merely about the possibility of the Coalition moving to the right. It’s about One Nation moving even further that way, too.
That is why what came next is so significant. “It’s just wrong and it’s insulting,” boomed Nationals senator for Queensland Matt Canavan, who will be competing directly with Hanson on the ballot. “There are 800,000 Muslims – most of them are great people. It’s a ridiculous statement; Pauline should just say sorry. Just own it and admit it.” Elsewhere, he called it “totally un-Australian”. “These remarks from One Nation are absolutely disgusting and outrageous,” echoed Liberal senator Andrew Bragg.
Then came the true thrust of the response. “It is these kinds of ill-disciplined comments that make people worry that Pauline just doesn’t have what it takes to lead a major party,” added Canavan. And then Bragg: “Leadership is not about bashing up on diverse groups in our community.” That is, they decided to draw a line. Then they used that line to sketch Hanson as a pretender, incapable of anything serious. In doing that, they got some version of a backdown.
That approach might just work. An intriguing survey this week showed that of those supporting One Nation, only 17 per cent nominated border control and reduced immigration as their motivation. The dominant reason, accounting for 36 per cent, is a “desire for an alternative” and a “rejection of the major parties”. That sketches more a protest vote than an affirmation of anything particular One Nation is selling. You might even say the appeal is aesthetic.
The Coalition can’t disrupt that aesthetic by being a facsimile of it. The disruption is to redraw Hanson as unserious, and to explain how that shows up in the policy that those flirting with One Nation aren’t focusing on. Not so much to disrespect her, as to respect yourself enough to know you shouldn’t be following her down burrows. That in doing so, you’ll eventually find one of them is dug all the way to the edge of a cliff. And if you’re not careful, the whole country might fall through it.

RSF siege of El Fasher in Sudan has ‘hallmarks of genocide’, UN mission finds

The siege and capture of the Sudanese city of El Fasher by the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces group last October bore “the hallmarks of genocide”, a UN-mandated fact-finding mission has said.
In a report detailing the harrowing 18-month occupation of the capital of North Darfur, investigators concluded that the RSF and allied militias deliberately inflicted conditions calculated to bring about the physical destruction of the Zaghawa and Fur ethnic communities.
“The scale, coordination, and public endorsement of the operation by senior RSF leadership demonstrate that the crimes committed in and around El Fasher were not random excesses of war,” said Mohamed Chande Othman, the mission’s chair, who called for a thorough investigation of the perpetrators.
The report was published a day after the UK, Canada and the European Union denounced possible war crimes and crimes against humanity in Sudan during the nearly three-year war.
Its release coincides with the latest wave of drone strikes that have left dozens dead across Sudan’s Kordofan region, an area where the UN has consistently said that grave abuses are taking place.
Unicef said at least 15 children were killed this week when a drone struck a displacement camp in West Kordofan. Local rights defenders reported that another strike on a market in nearby North Kordofan left 28 people dead. Blame for the West Kordofan attack has been directed at the Sudanese army; while the RSF has been accused of carrying out the strike in North Kordofan.
Since April 2023, the RSF has been waging war against the army after a falling out between its commander, Muhammad Hamdan Dagalo, and the army chief, Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, former allies who came to power after the 2019 Sudanese revolution ousted longtime dictator Omar al-Bashir.
The RSF has been backed by the United Arab Emirates, a position the Gulf state denies despite evidence compiled by the UN, independent experts and reporters.
The group grew out of the Janjaweed militias, notorious for atrocities committed in the early 2000s in a ruthless campaign in Darfur that killed 300,000 people and drove 2.7 million from their homes.
The war, the latest crisis in Sudan’s history of violence, has forced 11 million people to flee their homes and killed tens of thousands, triggering what the UN calls one of the world’s worst humanitarian crises.
The fact-finding report said that after the seizure of El Fasher, the RSF inflicted “three days of absolute horror” and that thousands of people, particularly from the Zaghawa ethnic group, were killed, raped or disappeared.
Othman said: “The scale, coordination and public endorsement of the operation by senior RSF leadership demonstrate that the crimes committed in and around El Fasher were not random excesses of war. They formed part of a planned and organised operation that bears the defining characteristics of genocide.”
Investigators said RSF militiamen had acted with impunity and “with genocidal intent” and that as conflict’s focus shifts from Darfur to Kordofan, outside countries must act decisively to hold perpetrators to account “and bring an end to this senseless violence”.
The mission interviewed 320 witnesses and victims from El Fasher and the surrounding areas, including in investigative visits to Chad and South Sudan. It authenticated, verified and corroborated 25 videos.
The report documents widespread sexual violence against girls and women aged seven to 70, including those who were pregnant. Survivors said they were attacked in front of family members, with the assaults often involving severe physical abuse.
In one incident, a 12-year-old girl was raped by three RSF fighters as her mother watched, moments after her father was killed while trying to shield her. The girl later died from her injuries.
According to the findings, such assaults frequently occurred at the same locations where mass killings had taken place, including El Saudi hospital and El Fasher University. Witnesses said RSF fighters also carried out public gang rapes of at least 19 women in rooms strewn with corpses, among them the bodies of the victims’ husbands.
On Thursday the US announced that it was placing sanctions on three RSF commanders over their roles in the siege and capture of El Fasher. The US Treasury said the RSF had carried out “ethnic killings, torture, starvation, and sexual violence” in the operation.

France to provide EUR 71M in grant support, part of which will go to energy sector – Shmyhal
This was agreed during a meeting between First Deputy Prime Minister of Ukraine and Minister of Energy Denys Shmyhal and France's Minister of the Economy, Finance and Industry, Energy and Digital Sovereignty Roland Lescure, Ukrinform reports, citing Shmyhal's post on Telegram.
The parties also signed a document on cooperation in the field of nuclear energy.
Shmyhal expressed gratitude to the French government for its support, in particular for the decision to deliver an additional 150 generators to Ukraine during February.
He recalled that Ukraine has already received more than 50 shipments of humanitarian energy aid from France, including over 140 high-capacity generators. An additional EUR 5.7 million was contributed by France to the Energy Support Fund.
Ukraine and France are also implementing three infrastructure projects aimed at strengthening the resilience of regional energy systems.
As Ukrinform previously reported, Denys Shmyhal held a series of bilateral meetings with international partners during a working visit to France, where he is participating in a meeting of the International Energy Agency (IEA).

Les Wexner: How the billionaire enabled Jeffrey Epstein’s rise
Former Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak received Wexner Foundation funds. Years later, he partnered with convicted US sex offender Epstein.
In a closed-door session at his Ohio home on Wednesday, billionaire Leslie Wexner faced mounting questions from United States lawmakers about Jeffrey Epstein’s rise to wealth and influence – and the role he may have played in that ascent.
Five members of the House Oversight Committee had travelled to depose the 88-year-old after Democrats subpoenaed him in the wake of the latest US Department of Justice release tied to Epstein.

The latest tranche of documents, published by the Justice Department on January 30, 2026, is part of a vast wealth of materials amassed during federal investigations into Epstein, who pleaded guilty in 2008 to procuring a minor for prostitution and was later charged in 2019 with sex trafficking of minors before his death by suicide in federal custody. Wexner’s name appears, both redacted and unredacted, on communications and financial documents within these files.
“I was naive, foolish, and gullible to put any trust in Jeffrey Epstein,” Wexner said in a statement. “He was a con man. And while I was conned, I have done nothing wrong and have nothing to hide.”
For decades, Epstein cultivated relationships with business leaders, politicians and academics.
Central among them was Wexner, the founder of L Brands, the retail empire behind Victoria’s Secret, Bath & Body Works and The Limited, whose fortune helped build the foundations for Epstein’s access to global elites, including former Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak.
The newly released files shed fresh light on how deeply Epstein embedded himself within Wexner’s financial and philanthropic world, a relationship that proved pivotal in transforming him from an obscure money manager into a figure of extraordinary wealth and influence.
Epstein and Wexner’s townhouse
Epstein was introduced to Wexner in the mid-1980s. At the time, Epstein was a college dropout who had briefly taught at Manhattan’s elite Dalton School after reportedly exaggerating his academic credentials. He had passed through Bear Stearns under executive Alan “Ace” Greenberg before leaving to set up his own advisory firm.
By 1986, he had met Wexner. Five years later, the retail billionaire had granted him full power of attorney, an extraordinary delegation allowing Epstein to sign cheques, hire staff, borrow money, and buy or sell property on Wexner’s behalf.
Al Jazeera has reviewed newly released Justice Department records, including a 1998 purchase and sale agreement and related promissory note and guaranty, which detail the mechanics of asset transfers between the two men.
The documents show how control of Wexner’s Manhattan townhouse at 9 East 71st Street was formalised through a structured transaction involving a $10m promissory note and a personal guaranty signed by Epstein. The property became Epstein’s New York base and a symbol of his growing stature.
By the early 1990s, Epstein was embedded in Wexner’s philanthropic and corporate world, serving as a trustee of the Wexner Foundation and as the president of Wexner-affiliated property companies. In 1996, he relocated his firm to the US Virgin Islands, positioning himself as an offshore financier.
The authority Wexner granted him over assets, philanthropy and property did more than elevate his status socially. It conferred institutional legitimacy. With control over substantial wealth and formal roles inside a major foundation, Epstein could present himself as a financier with access to capital and global networks.
The Wexner Foundation and the Israel connection
One of the clearest through-lines from that period runs to former Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak, who was introduced to Epstein by former Israeli President Shimon Peres at a large event in Washington in 2003.
Between 2004 and 2006, the Wexner Foundation paid Barak approximately $2.3m for two commissioned research studies, one on leadership and another on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. The foundation later said only one paper was completed, but determined that the work justified the payment.
Barak, who served as Israel’s prime minister from 1999 to 2001 and later as defence minister from 2007 to 2013, maintained contact with Epstein for several years.
A court filing included in the newly released Epstein records contains an allegation that prominent victim Virginia Giuffre claimed that Wexner and Barak were two of the men Epstein trafficked her to.
The filing does not provide supporting evidence for the claim. Neither man has been charged with wrongdoing in connection with Epstein.
In February this year, Barak told Israel’s Channel 12 he had been unaware of the full scope of Epstein’s crimes and regretted ever meeting the financier.
Wexner has said he severed ties with Epstein around 2007 after he discovered the financier had “misappropriated vast sums of money from me and my family”.
But the financial and institutional credibility Epstein accumulated during his years managing Wexner’s wealth did not evaporate when that relationship ended.
Epstein ‘editing’ Barak’s op-ed
Even after his relationship allegedly ended with Wexner, Epstein now had the social prestige, and money, to develop ties with powerful decision-makers, emails newly released by the Justice Department and reviewed by Al Jazeera show.
In October 2014, Nili Priel Barak – Barak’s wife – wrote to Epstein about travel plans to New York, suggesting dates when Ehud Barak would be in town and asking whether he would be available to meet.
Days later, she forwarded him a draft opinion piece, writing: “Herewith the Op Ed. Please let me know your opinion and your remarks. Thanks.”
Epstein replied with what he labelled “beginning edits”, returning a version of the unpublished article. The draft speaks in Barak’s political voice, including the line: “As the Minister of Defence of Israel I’ve met more than once with [US] President [Barack] Obama…” and lays out arguments about the “two states solution” versus a “one state solution”.
A year later, in 2015, Epstein invested in Reporty Homeland Security, later rebranded as Carbyne, a startup chaired by Ehud Barak that developed advanced emergency communications technology – further tying their political relationship to a shared commercial venture.
The company’s leadership included CEO Amir Elichai, a former special forces officer, and director Pinhas Buchris, a former Israeli Defence Ministry director-general and former commander of Unit 8200, the Israeli military’s cyber intelligence unit.
Between 2012 and 2014, documents reportedly indicate Epstein also assisted Barak in exploring security-related business with African world leaders. The documents illustrate how Epstein managed to convert financial credibility into political access, and then reinforced those relationships through shared commercial ventures.
Barak has said: “I am responsible for all my actions and decisions. There is room to question whether I should have investigated more thoroughly. I regret not doing so.”
Wexner has never been charged with any crime and has said he was unaware of Epstein’s criminal conduct. But his name appears repeatedly throughout the newly released files, a reminder of how central their relationship once was.

Gaza relief funds, troops pledged at inaugural Board of Peace meeting

U.S. President Donald Trump said Thursday at the inaugural meeting of the Board of Peace that nine participating members have committed a combined $7 billion for a relief initiative in Gaza and five nations have pledged to contribute troops to an international stabilization force aimed at supporting the war-battered Palestinian territory.
In a flurry of announcements at the end of a long, meandering speech to representatives from nearly 50 nations, Trump said the United States will contribute $10 billion to the Board of Peace. He didn't specify what the money would be used for. It was also not clear where the U.S. money would come from – a sizable pledge that would need to be authorized by Congress.
The Board of Peace includes Israel but not Palestinian representatives.
Indonesia, Morocco, Kazakhstan, Kosovo and Albania have pledged to send troops for a Gaza stabilization force, while Egypt and Jordan have committed to train police. Troops will initially be deployed to Rafah, a major population center where the U.S. administration hopes to first focus reconstruction efforts.
The countries making pledges are Kazakhstan, Azerbaijan, the United Arab Emirates (UAE), Morocco, Bahrain, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Uzbekistan and Kuwait, Trump said.
Trump said FIFA will raise $75 million for soccer-related projects in Gaza and that the United Nations will chip in $2 billion for humanitarian assistance.
"Every dollar spent is an investment in stability and the hope of new and harmonious (region)," Trump said in thanking the donors. He added, "The Board of Peace is showing how a better future can be built right here in this room."
The dollars pledged, while significant, represent a small fraction of the estimated $70 billion needed to rebuild the Palestinian territory decimated after two years of Israel's genocidal war.
Maj. Gen. Jasper Jeffers, the leader of the newly created International Stabilization Force, said the plans call for 12,000 police and 20,000 soldiers for Gaza. Indonesian President Prabowo Subianto announced his country would contribute up to 8,000 troops to the force.
"With these first steps, we help bring the security that Gaza needs for a future of prosperity and enduring peace," Jeffers said.
The board was initiated as part of Trump's 20-point peace plan to end the conflict in Gaza.
But since the October cease-fire, Trump's vision for the board has morphed and he wants it to have an even more ambitious remit – one that will not only complete the Herculean task of bringing lasting peace between Israel and the Palestinian resistance group Hamas but will also help resolve conflicts around the globe.
But the Gaza cease-fire deal remains fragile and Trump's expanded vision for the board has triggered fears the U.S. president is looking to create a rival to the United Nations.
Trump, pushing back against the criticism, said the creation of his board would help make the U.N. viable in the future.
"Someday I won't be here. The United Nations will be," Trump said. "I think it is going to be much stronger, and the Board of Peace is going to almost be looking over the United Nations and making sure it runs properly."
Even as Trump spoke of the gathering as a triumph that would help bring a more persistent peace to the Middle East, he sent new warnings to Iran.
Tensions are high between the United States and Iran as Trump has ordered one of the largest U.S. military buildups in the region in decades.
One aircraft carrier group is already in the region and another is on the way. Trump has warned Tehran it will face American military action if it does not denuclearize, give up ballistic missiles and halt funding to extremist groups.
Trump said he should know in 10 days whether a deal is possible to end a standoff with Tehran.
"We have to make a meaningful deal. Otherwise, bad things happen," he said.
Nearly 50 countries and the European Union sent officials to Thursday's meeting. Germany, Italy, Norway, Switzerland and the United Kingdom are among more than a dozen countries that have not joined the board, but that took part as observers.
Most countries sent high-level officials, but a few leaders – including Indonesian President Prabowo Subianto, Argentine President Javier Milei and Hungarian President Viktor Orban – traveled to Washington for the gathering.
"Almost everybody's accepted, and the ones that haven't, will be," Trump offered. "And some are playing a little cute – it doesn't work. You can't play cute with me."
The U.N. Security Council held a high-level meeting on Wednesday on the cease-fire deal and Israel's efforts to expand control in the occupied West Bank.
The U.N. session in New York was originally scheduled for Thursday but was moved up after Trump announced the board's meeting for the same date and it became clear that it would complicate travel plans for diplomats planning to attend both.
Vatican Secretary of State Cardinal Pietro Parolin told reporters earlier this week that "at the international level it should above all be the U.N. that manages these crisis situations."
Official after official used their speaking turns to heap praise on Trump for his ability to end conflicts around the world. Pakistani Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif called him the "savior of South Asia," while others said that years of U.S. foreign policy efforts by his predecessor failed to do what Trump has done in the past year.
Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan said Trump and others gathered for the meeting deserved thanks for their collective efforts on Gaza. But Fidan, who said Türkiye was also prepared to contribute troops to the stabilization force, cautioned that the situation remains precarious.
"The humanitarian situation remains fragile and cease-fire violations continue to occur," Fidan said. "A prompt, coordinated and effective response is therefore essential."
Fidan said President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan "remains fully" committed to ensuring the stability of Gaza, while noting that Türkiye could offer significant support in rebuilding the enclave's health and education sectors, as well as training a new police force.
Secretary of State Marco Rubio acknowledged there is a "long ways to go" in Gaza.
"There's a lot of work that remains that will require the contribution of every nation state represented here today," Rubio added.
In Gaza, Hamas spokesperson Hazem Qassem said any international force must "monitor the cease-fire and prevent the (Israeli) occupation from continuing its aggression."
Hamas says it is ready to hand over to a U.S.-backed committee of Palestinian technocrats led by Ali Shaath.
Nickolay Mladenov, a Bulgarian with a senior role in the Board of Peace, said at the meeting that 2,000 Palestinians have applied to join a new transitional Palestinian police force.

No, this video does not prove Israel used a thermobaric bomb in Gaza
Social media users have shared footage of a spectacular explosion that they claim proves the Israeli military is using a highly lethal new weapon in Gaza: a thermobaric bomb. However, the footage has been taken out of context; it actually depicts a conventional explosion.
A spectacular shockwave followed by a massive plume of black smoke. A video viewed more than 8 million times on X reportedly reveals Israel's use of "thermobaric and pressure bombs" in Gaza. The post was shared by China Pulse, a pro-Beijing account which was recently flagged for spreading disinformation.
"These bombs, which burn at a temperature of 3,500 degrees Celsius, are capable of killing thousands in seconds, leaving no trace," the post reads.
To display this content from X (Twitter), you must enable advertisement tracking and audience measurement.
Controlled explosion
The FRANCE 24 Observers team had already worked on this video in November 2025. At the time, online users were claiming that the video was showing the explosion of a "miniature nuclear bomb" in Gaza.
Our team spoke with several experts and found that the footage actually shows a controlled ground-level explosion using conventional explosives to destroy a tunnel dug by Hamas.
As for the recent allegations, Trevor Ball, a conflict researcher with the online investigative site Bellingcat, said on X that "there's nothing that indicates this is thermobaric".
‘Conventional explosive device’
Gilles Denglos, an explosives expert accredited by the French courts, told our team that the video likely shows a conventional explosive device. "Social media users are talking nonsense. A thermobaric bomb is designed to detonate above the ground, not on it." Denglos said the video shows the explosion of "a significant charge on the ground".
Another weapons expert who spoke to our team on the condition of anonymity also said that the spectacular shockwave visible in the video was the result of a "completely conventional" explosion:
"This phenomenon is a ‘Wilson cloud’: a condensation cloud that can occur when the shockwave from an explosion passes through humid air. This effect occurs regardless of the specific type of explosive used."
The expert further explained: "Thermobaric bombs are weapons whose lethality stems from the combined impact of heat and overpressure [Editor’s note: the bomb’s heat and the resulting shockwave]. This distinguishes them from munitions whose lethality relies on flying metallic fragments, such as conventional high-explosive shells or defensive grenades."
Al Jazeera investigation on Israeli bombs
These allegations against Israel come in the wake of an Al Jazeera investigation published on February 10, which claims the Israeli forces deployed “thermal” and "thermobaric" weapons in Gaza. According to the report, the intensity of the strikes "made thousands of Palestinians evaporate".
The investigation indicates that the Civil Defence agency in Gaza, which operates as a rescue force under Hamas authorities, has documented 2,842 Palestinians who have "evaporated" since the war began.
However, the Israeli military's alleged use of thermobaric bombs in Gaza remains a subject of debate.
According to the fact-checking outlet Snopes, which reviewed Al Jazeera’s investigation, it is currently impossible to independently verify the use of such weapons based on the information available at this stage.
We spoke to Michael Shurkin, programme director at the US consulting firm 14 North Strategies, who said the specific model of thermobaric weapons that could be available to the Israeli military for its bombing operations remains unknown. "There is no evidence that the Israeli army has used thermobaric weapons in Gaza. They may have, or they may not have; Al Jazeera provides no concrete proof," Shurkin told us.
In this investigation, Al Jazeera identifies several types of bombs used by the Israeli army: MK-84 900kg bombs, BLU-109 bunker busters, and GBU-39 glide bombs. According to official military specifications, none of these models currently in the Israeli arsenal are equipped with thermobaric explosives, Trevor Ball indicated on X.
"The aerial bombs mentioned in the Al Jazeera article are all loaded with aluminised explosives – compositions where the addition of aluminium enhances the blast effect by raising the temperature of the resulting combustion gases. However, the use of aluminium is extremely common in explosive devices for artillery, aerial bombs, and naval munitions," noted the weapons expert.
Due to their sheer power, these bombs are indeed capable of disintegrating bodies. However, this is a "common effect" of aerial bombs and not exclusive to thermobaric weapons, the expert said. Nevertheless, Amnesty International has denounced the Israeli military's use of MK-84 bombs in "deliberate" or "indiscriminate" strikes on residential areas and civilian infrastructure in Gaza as a violation of international law.
According to figures released by the Palestinian Ministry of Health and accepted by the Israeli army, 72,045 Palestinians have been killed in Gaza as of January 29.

Appointment of Antonia Romeo as head of civil service shows ‘poor judgment’, say former colleagues

Keir Starmer’s decision to appoint Antonia Romeo as the country’s most senior civil servant has prompted dismay among former colleagues who complained about what they considered bullying behaviour when she was a diplomat in New York.
Several people who worked with Romeo at the New York consulate nearly 10 years ago have told the Guardian they are upset by the prime minister’s decision to make her cabinet secretary despite knowing about their complaints.
The allegations from several colleagues were made as part of one formal complaint against Romeo in 2017. That complaint was investigated by a senior diplomat who found that she had a case to answer, but was then dismissed by her line managers at the Cabinet Office, who gave her the all clear.
The complaint has resurfaced in recent days after Simon McDonald, the former lead civil servant at the Foreign Office, urged the prime minister to do more due diligence before making his decision. Starmer put aside those objections on Thursday when he confirmed Romeo’s appointment, making her the first ever female cabinet secretary.
One former complainant said: “It is pretty extraordinary but not exactly out of character for the current No 10. It is just another example of poor judgment, and the elevation of those with questionable integrity despite the concerns raised by ordinary people.”
Another said: “There is a real risk this comes back to bite the prime minister. The many people she bullied and intimidated, most of them women, will now feel failed for a second time. It’s not a good look for the civil service or the government.”
A third complainant said: “Taking shortcuts to make appointments based on special treatment instead of merit and due diligence has already created chaos. This is an indication that problematic leadership decisions will persist.”
Government sources have insisted that the allegations against Romeo should not be counted against her given they are 10 years old and were dismissed at the time by the Cabinet Office.
Starmer defended his decision on Thursday, calling Romeo “an outstanding public servant, with a 25‑year record of delivering for the British people”.
He added: “Antonia has shown she is the right person to drive the government to reform and I look forward to working with her to deliver this period of national renewal.”
Romeo said it was a “huge privilege” to become the head of the civil service.
“The civil service is a great and remarkable institution, which I love,” she said. “We should be known for delivery, efficiency and innovation, working to implement the government’s agenda and meet the challenges the country faces.”
Romeo’s supporters say she is dynamic and willing to break civil service conventions to achieve the government’s goals.
But her critics say she is more focused on promoting herself than the government she works for and that her impatience at more junior staff has sometimes tipped over into bullying.
According to the complaint made in 2017, Romeo told several colleagues she would end or damage their careers after disagreements in the normal course of work.
One allegation says Romeo warned that the refusal by a junior member of staff to comply with a particular request was a “career-limiting move” and “would only happen once”.
Another who disagreed with one of Romeo’s ideas said Romeo told her she “would make sure [that person’s] reputation and career in London suffered”.
Other allegations included in the complaint concerned her financial affairs. They included her decision to get Farrow & Ball to provide more than $100,000 (£74,000) worth of paint to redecorate her residence in return for free publicity, as well as a $250 (£186) expense claim for a taxi to a football match.
The allegations, which were part of one complaint, were all investigated at the time by Tim Hitchens, a former ambassador to Japan, who was flown in to conduct a week-long review.
Hitchens found that she had a case to answer on her management style, but not on her financial affairs. His finding was overturned by the Cabinet Office however, which said she had no case to answer.
Three complainants from the time have contacted the Cabinet Office in recent weeks to raise concerns about her previous behaviour.
Downing Street insisted on Thursday that full vetting had taken place on a previous occasion when she was considered for the job. No 10 said it had consulted the civil service commissioner, Gisela Stuart, who said the full process did not need to be re-run.

Uzbek Mining Giant Defends $200M in Tenders to Secretive Firms, Silent on Other OCCRP Findings

02:53:00 KST

A major state-owned company in Uzbekistan has defended the more than $200 million in tenders it awarded to foreign companies that OCCRP found included firms with proxy owners, financial filings that falsely declared they were dormant, and procurement contracts featuring signatures of people who deny signing them.
The statement issued this week by Almalyk Mining Metallurgical Complex (AMMC) follows a joint investigation by OCCRP and Finance Uncovered revealing that in several cases these foreign firms competed against one another for AMMC tenders despite being under common control – and had their true beneficiaries hidden behind apparent straw owners.
AMMC, often described as a “crown jewel” of the Uzbek economy, said in a statement Wednesday that all cited tenders were awarded to the lowest bidder through an automated government procurement system.
“The winners of the tenders/competitions delivered goods in full – in compliance with the quality indicators stipulated in the contract, and, most importantly, within the timeframes specified in the contract – to the plant's warehouses,” the company said, adding that it had conducted an internal probe.
AMMC did not respond to previous questions from OCCRP and Finance Uncovered regarding contracts worth more than $7 million awarded to two U.K.-registered firms, Lemixton Solutions Ltd and Golders Business Ltd, that feature electronic signatures of accounting associates who deny signing the documents. One of them has since reported the matter to British authorities.
The two firms collectively received over $35 million in tenders and sent dozens of shipments of goods to the Uzbek mining giant despite U.K. financial filings stating they were dormant, OCCRP revealed.
The investigation found both firms were under common control but competed against one another for the same AMMC tenders.
Similar patterns were identified in Georgia, where firms that had won tens of millions of dollars in AMMC tenders were purchased for a nominal amount by a South Korean medical coordinator with Uzbek roots and no apparent experience in the mining sector.
Like the U.K.-based tender winners, the Georgian firms did not indicate any economic activity in financial filings during the period in which they were awarded the tenders.
A representative for the U.K. companies said that a single individual controlled both of the firms. The Uzbek, Colombian, and Georgian figures identified in the report did not respond to inquiries or declined to comment.
The findings raise questions about transparency and oversight in one of Uzbekistan’s key industrial sectors, though AMMC maintains that all procurement processes complied with internal and legal requirements.

WASHINGTON, February 19. /TASS/. US President Donald Trump extended for one year certain sanctions introduced earlier against Russia in connection with the situation in Ukraine, according to the notice posted on the Federal Register, the daily journal of the US government.
The document refers to restrictions against Russia introduced in executive orders of the US President in February 2022, September 2018, and March and December 2014 in respect of Crimea. All these restrictive measures "must continue in effect beyond March 6, 2026," Trump said.
"The actions and policies addressed in these Executive Orders continue to pose an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security and foreign policy of the United States," the US leader said. "Therefore, in accordance with section 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)), I am continuing for 1 year the national emergency declared in Executive Order 13660," Trump added.

DOHA, February 19. /TASS/. Russian tennis star Andrey Rublev cleared the quarterfinals round of the 2025 Qatar Open tennis tournament in Doha on Thursday, defeating Stefanos Tsistipas of Greece.
The 5th-seeded Rublev, who is playing under a neutral status at the tournament, outplayed his Greek opponent 6-3; 7-6 (7-2). In the semifinals, he awaits the winner of the quarterfinals duel between his countryman Karen Khachanov (7th-seeded) and top-seed Carlos Alcaraz of Spain.
Rublev, 28, is currently ranked 14th in the ATP Rankings list. He has won 17 career ATP singles tournament titles and four more in men’s doubles. Rublev has never made it past the quarterfinals in any Grand Slam.
The Russian tennis player took home the gold at the 2020 Summer Olympic Games in Tokyo in mixed doubles (with teammate Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova) and also won the 2021 Davis Cup as part of the Russian national team.
The 2026 Qatar Open Tennis tournament is an ATP-500 event on the organization’s calendar which takes place at the Khalifa International Tennis and Squash complex in Doha, Qatar, between February 16 and 21. The tournament is played on outdoor hard courts. Rublev is the reigning champion.
Russian and Belarusian players’ neutral status at tennis tournaments
On February 28, 2022, the International Olympic Committee (IOC) issued recommendations to international sports federations to bar athletes from Russia and Belarus from taking part in international tournaments, citing Moscow's special military operation in Ukraine as the reason.
Following the IOC's recommendations in late February 2022, the majority of global sports federations moved to exclude athletes from Russia and Belarus from all international sports tournaments.
The International Tennis Federation (ITF) ruled on March 1, 2022, to suspend the membership of the Russian and Belarusian national tennis federations while also canceling all previously scheduled tennis tournaments in the two countries.
On March 14, 2022, the ITF also confirmed its prohibition on the Russian and Belarusian national tennis teams from participating in the 2022 Davis Cup and the 2022 Billie Jean King Cup.

'In a hotspot right now,' Trump says Iran deal clarity coming in 10 days

US President Donald Trump has said that it would soon become clear whether a deal with Iran is possible, warning that Washington may be forced to escalate if negotiations fall short.
"We may have to take it a step further, or we may not," he said at the inaugural meeting of the Board of Peace in Washington on Thursday, adding that the situation would likely become clearer "over the next probably 10 days."
Trump said his envoys, Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner, built a solid working relationship with Iranian representatives and talks were progressing well.
"Iran is a hotspot right now, and they're meeting, and they have a good relationship with the representatives of Iran," he said. "Good talks are being had."
US Vice President JD Vance described talks in Geneva on Tuesday as productive "in some ways," but said Iran was "not yet willing" to engage on Trump's "red lines." Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi called the atmosphere "more constructive."
Trump acknowledged that reaching a "meaningful agreement" with Tehran had historically proven difficult.
"It's proven to be, over the years, not easy to make a meaningful deal with Iran," he said. "We have to make a meaningful deal. Otherwise, bad things happen."
He urged Tehran to seize the moment. "Now is the time for Iran to join us on a path that will complete what we're doing," said Trump. "If they join us, that'll be great. If they don't join us, that'll be great too, but it'll be a very different path."
The president said Iran "cannot continue to threaten the stability of the entire region" and must reach an agreement.
The remarks come as Washington has deployed the USS Abraham Lincoln carrier strike group to the region, with the USS Gerald R. Ford aircraft carrier also on its way, alongside additional fighter jets.

Jordan Stolz Wins His Third Olympic Medal. In a Surprise Twist, It’s Not Gold

The upset of the Olympics has gone down.
Hold the phone, just a little, on Jordan Stolz.
And say hello to Ning Zhongyan.
The speedskater from China set a new Olympic record in the 1,500-m competition on Wednesday, crossing the finish in 1 min., 41.98 sec. at the Milan Speed Skating Oval. American Jordan Stolz, 21, already a double Olympic champion at these Games and the overwhelming favorite to win this distance, had his shot to best Zhongyan in the final pairing. He’d already set two Olympic records here in Milan. What’s one more?
Skating alongside the reigning 1,500-m world champion, Norway’s Peder Kongshaug—Stolz was recovering from pneumonia at that 2025 race and still finished second—Stolz was 0.37 sec. behind at 300 m. We’d seen Stolz fall behind the pace at the start of the 1,000-m race too, which he won on Feb. 11. “He wins on the speed and on the kick,” Joey Cheek, the 500-m Olympic champion in 2006, told TIME before the race. “No one has the speed and the kick. He's so physically strong, he can absorb so much workload. These are just a set of traits that don't exist in a single person.”

So no cause for major concern. But at 700 m, with two laps to go, Stolz lost even more time. He was now nearly a full second behind Zhongyan. With one lap to go, Stolz bled more time: he was now 1.35 sec. off the pace. Stolz is the best finisher in his sport. But this gap was just too wide. He now was sitting fourth. Off the podium.
Which seemed impossible. Stolz put on his burners in the last lap and crossed the line with a medal: a silver, never anything to sniff at. He finished .77 sec. behind Zhongyan. As Zhongyan raised his arms and took his victory lap holding the Chinese flag, Stolz bowed his head. He was exhausted, using all his kick to salvage a medal. Zhongyan shed joyous tears.
“When Jordan was skating in the last pair, I still did not think the gold was mine,” said Zhongyan after his win. “He has been in incredible form all season. Even after he crossed the line, I was still not completely sure. It was only when the result was confirmed that it started to sink in. It is an amazing feeling.”
No doubt, Stolz’s silver stalls his storyline’s momentum. As with a Summer Olympics counterpart—says, Michael Phelps—Stolz’s quest for perfection, stretched across multiple races at the Games, was catnip for NBC, and even casual fans of a niche sport like speedskating. Will he or won’t he become just the second male speedskater in history to win four golds at an Olympics, with American Eric Heiden, who won five in 1980, being the only other? (Heiden has been on hand in Milan, cheering on his fellow Wisconsinite.)
Read More: U.S. Speedskater Jordan Stolz Sets a New Olympic Record in His First Milano Cortina Race
Cheek thought that more than the 500 m, or the 1,000 m, Stolz was a safe bet in the 1,500 m. He is a two-time world champion and the reigning back-to-back World Cup champion in the distance. Going into the Games, he had won eight of nine 1,500-m World Cup races, battling that case of pneumonia in his only loss.
“I think he’s going to do it,” Cheek, an NBC speedskating commentator, told TIME a few hours before Thursday’s race. “I think it would take a meteor strike for him not to.”
That meteor, it turns out, was Zhongyan, one of China’s opening-ceremonies flag bearers at these Olympics. Zhongyan, 26, won his third medal of the Games, as he finished third in the 1000-m competition and the team pursuit. Zhongyan had also won the 2024 1000-m sprint world title, becoming the first male Chinese speedskater to ever do so. He’s not some unknown. But smashing the Olympic record, and besting Stolz, counts as a stunner.
Stolz is not done. With a win in Saturday's mass start, in which 24 athletes skate 16 laps to decide the winner, Stolz would be the first male speedskater to win three golds at a single Olympics since Johann Olav Koss of Norway did it at his home Lillehammer Olympics in 1994. Zhongyan, however, is set to join Stolz on the starting line.
Look out for the meteor.

The Cornish village where it has rained every day this year
Cardinham has experienced 50 consecutive days of rain as the deluge continues to drench Britain

A village in Cornwall has experienced a 50-day spell of rain and has already received more rainfall in February than it typically would over the whole month.
Cardinham, near Bodmin, has not had a dry day since 30 December, and has endured 441.4mm of rain since the beginning of the year, according to the Met Office. However, the village is still short of its record from 2000, when it experienced 72 consecutive days of rain.
The UK has been continuously battered by unsettled weather this winter, with Storm Pedro bringing more ice and rain across the country just this week.
Met Office spokesperson Grahame Madge said the south-west region of England has had particularly high levels of rainfall due to several low-pressure systems coming towards the UK.
He said: “There's been a blocking area of high pressure over Scandinavia for much of winter, which has meant that because that air is very cold and very dense, it's hard to budge.
“So these low-pressure storms have been coming across the Atlantic with nowhere to go. They've run into this immovable block, and that means that they've been depositing more rainfall across areas of the UK because they can't move any further because of that blocking area of high pressure.”
Mr Madge said Cardinham is still forecast to have rain in the coming days, but the bad weather could soon ease as conditions begin to settle.
“We've still got an unsettled picture,” he added. “The forecast has moderated a little bit in that we are getting periods of more settled condition in between the pulses of rain.”
The UK’s rain deluge saw Northern Ireland have its wettest January on record after it experienced 70 per cent more rainfall than the long-term average.
South-west England and the east of Scotland also had some of their wettest Januaries on record.
Currently, the Environment Agency has 67 flood warnings in place for England, where flooding is expected, and 169 flood alerts, where flooding is possible.
The UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) has issued a cold health alert for the East Midlands, East of England, North East, North West, West Midlands, Yorkshire and the Humber, and the South West until Friday evening.
Met Office weather forecast for the week
Thursday
Cloud for most, with early rain or showers in the North and East. Some clear spells elsewhere before strengthening winds bring heavy rain into Northern Ireland and western Scotland later. Turning chilly where skies remain clear, but staying frost-free.

Carried an injury, but returned to Gaza: Paratrooper laid to rest after fatal friendly fire

More than 1,000 friends, relatives and acquaintances gathered Thursday at the cemetery in Moshav Hayogev in northern Israel’s Jezreel Valley to attend the funeral of Staff Sgt. Ofri Yafe, who was killed a day earlier by friendly fire in the southern Gaza city of Khan Younis.
Yafe, a soldier in the Paratroopers Brigade’s reconnaissance unit, is survived by his parents, Hadas and Yiftach, and three siblings — Noy, Tzuf and Itamar.
Lt. Col. Nevo De-Han, commander of the Paratroopers Brigade’s reconnaissance unit, eulogized Ofri and said, “I failed as a commander.”
“We were given two missions in this maneuver in Gaza,” he said. “The first was to destroy enemy infrastructure in the Khan Younis area, and in that mission we succeeded. The second mission was to bring the entire unit home safely. In that mission we failed. We failed as a unit and I failed as a commander. I am sorry we were not good enough to bring you back.”
He described his final conversations with Yafe, a soldier who had declined to attend officers’ training in order to remain at the head of his team.
“Just two weeks ago we spoke about it again,” De-Han said. “I told him that someone like him had to be a commander in the reconnaissance unit. He simply told me, ‘I am a person of giving, I have other missions.’ A few hours before he fell I told him, ‘Stay sharp.’ He replied that the team was ready at the highest level.”
Despite the circumstances of his death, Ofri’s family chose to send a message of support to the soldiers still fighting, even as he was laid to rest. De-Han said that while the unit was coping with the incident in the heart of Gaza and continuing efforts to destroy enemy infrastructure, a message arrived from his parents: “We love you and embrace you. We have no anger.”
His father, Yiftach Yafe, addressed the sniper team involved in the friendly fire incident directly in his eulogy. “We embrace the sniper and the entire team who found themselves in an illogical situation in an illogical place,” he said. “We have no anger or blame toward you. You were and remain our children.”
He reserved his criticism for Israel’s political leadership. “The anger and blame are directed solely at the country’s leadership, which sends the best of our sons on futile missions, after all our hostages have already returned home,” he said.
His mother, Hadas, added: “I still cannot comprehend it. For me, I am in a nightmare and any moment you will come and laugh at me for believing all of this.”
Yafe, a descendant of the founders of Moshav Hayogev, was a young entrepreneur who built and designed wooden furniture on the family farm. His aunt, Tzvia Gutman, spoke of dreams cut short.
“He had the mind of an entrepreneur — car restoration, pergolas, wood decks,” she said. “He planned to conquer the world after his discharge this August. Instead of revival, you found your death on the cursed soil of Gaza.”
She described him as a young man who “devoured life” and said, “You were meant to be the material that rebuilds this country.”
Roni, his partner of five and a half years, stood by the grave and spoke of plans that ended in Khan Younis. “We’ve been together since ninth grade, and we were supposed to be together forever,” she said. Just two weeks earlier they had traveled in northern Israel. “We talked all night about fulfilling our dream of living together,” she recalled, thanking him for his support. “Thank you for not leaving my side during the difficult year I went through. Thank you for teaching me what love is.”
Before Staff Sgt. Yafe was laid to rest, his father spoke to the ynet, after the parents had accused the state a day earlier of placing their sons in “unnecessary situations.”
“Ofri was a child who basically lived on the edge,” his father said. “He always loved doing extreme things. He traveled a lot. He had a Jeep and drove everywhere — the Arava desert, the Golan Heights. That was always him. Parties, lots of friends. When you live on the edge, you live on the edge — but usually he didn’t tell us anything.”
Yiftach said his son had carried an injury but continued to serve despite a recommendation that he undergo surgery. “During paratroopers training he landed badly on a rock and injured his knee,” he said. “He carried the pain for a long time but completed the course and excelled in basic training. A week and a half ago he had an orthopedic exam and they recommended surgery, but he wanted to stay with his team so he chose to return to Gaza. He also told Hadas he had bad feelings. He was a child who was never afraid of anything. That may have been one of his problems — he was not afraid of anything.”
He said that despite the parents’ criticism of government policy, their views did not influence their son’s decisions. “Ofri believed deeply in his team, in his friends. They were the closest thing to him,” he said. “If his team went in, then he went in with them. There was no other option.”
He added that their public statement reflected only his and his wife’s views. “What we said was our opinion alone,” he said. “We did not ask Ofri and we did not ask our other children. We believe the government’s current policy in Gaza is not the right policy.”
The father emphasized that the family had no accusations against the military. “We have no pointing finger toward the army, any of its commanders, the Paratroopers Brigade or the reconnaissance unit,” he said. “They are the best of our sons. They are our children, and we embrace them — including the sniper who was tragically involved in an incident that should not have happened. Our only criticism is why the best of our sons are inside the Gaza Strip when there are no hostages left and nothing more to achieve there.”
He continued, criticizing the government: “When there is no leadership and no strategy, this is the result. When you do not look at things holistically and correctly but in a populist way. Unfortunately this time it is us. We all hope Ofri will be the last casualty of this very unnecessary campaign.”
Asked what Ofri would want to say to the nation at this difficult time, his father replied: “Very simply. He would say, ‘Be good to one another and love life.’”

Trump launches his 'Board of Peace' as US-Iran tensions escalate

The first meeting of Trump’s new "Board of Peace" took place on Thursday, bringing together some two dozen allies from across the world in Washington.
US President Donald Trump pledged $10 billion for his new "Board of Peace" as he hosted the first meeting of the amorphous new institution, which was first focused on revuilding Gaza but has since expanded its scope.
Trump, who has in recent weeks repeatedly threatened war with Iran, did not specify what the money would be used for.
The US president also announced that nine other members of the body pledged an additional $7 billion towards a Gaza relief package. The donors include Kazakhstan, Azerbaijan, UAE, Morocco, Bahrain, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Uzbekistan and Kuwait.
“Every dollar spent is an investment in stability and the hope of new and harmonious (region),” Trump said during Thursday's inaugural meeting of the "Board of Peace".
Although the pledged donations represent a substantial sum, they remain a far cry from the estimated $70 billion needed to rebuild the Palestinian territory, which was reduced to rubble after more than two years of Israel’s offensive in Gaza.
Trump launched the initiative after the US, together with Qatar and Egypt, brokered a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas in October.
The initiative has drawn widespread criticism for its vague nature, including on how it would operate alongside, or potentially seek to compete with, existing institutions such as the United Nations.
The US leader pushed back against the criticism: "I think it (the United Nations) is going to be much stronger, and the Board of Peace is going to almost be looking over the United Nations and making sure it runs properly".
Trump would hold a veto power over most of the Board's decisions, a level of centralised control that is unprecedented in international institutions, and can remain head of the initiative even after leaving office. Other countries, meanwhile, would have to pay $1 billion if they want to stay on permanently.
'Board of Peace' launched amid Trump warnings towards Iran
The inaugural meeting of the "Board of Peace" came as Trump issued fresh threats towards Iran. Also on Thursday, multiple US media reports said US officials estimate the military will be ready to strike Iran within days, as Trump weighs out his next move.
Any US military operation would likely be a massive, weeks-long campaign conducted jointly with Israel, sources told US media outlets, and the Trump administration was "closer than most Americans realise" to a major war in the Middle East.
Meanwhile, the "Board of Peace" meeting also focused on the launch of an international stabilisation force, which would be tasked with overseeing borders, maintaining security and demilitarising Gaza.
Indonesia, Morocco, Kazakhstan, Kosovo and Albania have pledged to send troops as part of the force, while Egypt and Jordan have commited to train police, according to its commander Maj. Gen. Jasper Jeffers.
Most countries sent high-level officials to the Board's meeting, but a few world leaders including Indonesian President Prabowo Subianto, Argentinian President Javier Milei, and Hungarian President Viktor Orbán, attended the inauguration in Washington themselves. FIFA President Gianni Infantino was also in attendance.
EU Commissioner for the Mediterranean Dubravka Šuica was in Washington as an observer, which drew the ire of many in Europe who warned that her presence risked being interpreted as a collective endorsement of the controversial body.
France led calls for the European Commission to explain Šuica's presence, with Belgium, Spain, Ireland, Slovenia, Sweden and Portugal also raising objections.

Turkish president remains committed to Gaza's security stabilization, recovery, says top diplomat
Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan says humanitarian situation in Gaza ‘remains fragile, and ceasefire violations continue to occur’
ISTANBUL
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan remains committed to security stabilization and recovery in the Gaza Strip, Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan said Thursday.
Fidan made the remarks at the inaugural Board of Peace meeting, which convened in Washington under the chairmanship of US President Donald Trump.
He said that “after two years of human suffering, (a) ceasefire in Gaza has been achieved, thanks to President Trump's personal engagement and our collective efforts.”
“Yet the humanitarian situation remains fragile, and ceasefire violations continue to occur. A prompt, coordinated and effective response is therefore essential,” said Fidan.
“President Erdogan remains fully committed to Gaza's security stabilization and recovery. Türkiye has already been providing (an) immense amount of humanitarian assistance to Gaza,” he said. “We can also contribute meaningfully to the rehabilitation of health and education sectors, as well as the training of the police force. In addition, we are prepared to provide troops to the International Stabilization Force.”
“Türkiye will continue to support your (Trump’s) efforts towards a just and lasting peace. We remain convinced that the foundation of such peace is a two-state solution. Let us work towards that objective for the benefit of all peoples of the region,” he added.

Five countries have committed troops to the newly formed Gaza International Stabilization Force (ISF), with Indonesia pledging up to 8,000 soldiers to anchor the mission aimed at securing the enclave and laying the groundwork for lasting peace.
Major General Jasper Jeffers, commander of the ISF, announced at the inaugural Board of Peace meeting in Washington on Thursday that Indonesia, Morocco, Kazakhstan, Kosovo and Albania have formally pledged troops to the nascent security body. Egypt and Jordan will instead focus on training Palestinian police forces.
Jeffers also confirmed that Indonesia has accepted the position of deputy commander of the force.
"With these first steps, we will help bring the security that Gaza needs for our future prosperity and enduring peace," he said.
Indonesian President Prabowo Subianto underscored Jakarta's commitment, pledging 8,000 "or more" troops to the stabilisation mission.
"We reaffirm our commitment to contribute a significant number of troops, up to 8,000 or more, if necessary," Prabowo said. Despite expected challenges, he voiced optimism that "with the leadership of President Donald Trump, this vision of real peace will be achieved".
The troop commitments come as Gaza's local administrative leadership outlined its own roadmap for rebuilding the enclave.
Ali Shaath, head of the National Committee for the Administration of Gaza (NCAG), set out four priorities: restoring security through a unified civilian police force; reviving economic activity and jobs, particularly for youth; ensuring sustainable emergency relief; and rebuilding essential services such as electricity, water, health and education while improving freedom of movement.
"Our mandate is simple," Shaath said. "Step by step, to build the foundation for lasting peace, dignity and prosperity for the people of Gaza."

The quiet conquest of the West Bank and the death of the Oslo Accords

The quiet conquest of the West Bank and the death of the Oslo Accords
Through a new land registration drive, Israel is trying to secure through paperwork what warfare alone has failed to deliver.
Israel always had a plan to annex more land in the occupied West Bank, and its actions prove it.
This week, the Israeli cabinet approved a plan to claim Palestinian lands in the West Bank as “state land”. The proposal, pushed by far-right Israeli leaders, including Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich, Justice Minister Yariv Levin and Defence Minister Israel Katz, emphasises Israeli supremacy over Palestinians.
The Israeli government has created 35 new positions and allocated 244.1 million shekels (nearly $79m) for the land registration project from 2026 to 2030.
The process outlined in the proposal is not new in itself. It is a process that has been frozen since 1967, and the most recent resumption is a continuation of Israel’s longstanding plan to take over Palestinian lands. While Israel suspended the land registration process in 1967, it did not suspend its practices of ethnic cleansing, colonial violence and de facto land annexation.
For Palestinians, this decision does not mark a new escalation but a solidification of the Israeli presence in the West Bank. While it may seem like mere paperwork, it is actually a milestone in Israel’s gradual takeover of the West Bank, the last remaining territorial obstacle to the completion of Israel’s colonial project in Palestine.
Bureaucracy as annexation
This shift cannot be understood without revisiting the Oslo Accords. Under the 1993 and 1995 agreements, the West Bank was carved into Areas A, B and C as an “interim” arrangement that was never meant to become permanent. Area C, the largest area containing the most land and resources, remained under full Israeli control while Areas A and B were left as fragmented Palestinian islands with limited Palestinian authority.
That made Area C the real battlefield.
As part of the new policy, land registration in Area C, which constitutes more than 62 percent of the West Bank, is to take place through the Land Title Settlement Administration, part of Israel’s Ministry of Justice. What this in effect does is shift Area C from military administration into direct Israeli civilian governance.
These measures should not be taken lightly. They are telling of Israel’s latest annexation strategy: governance.
On February 8, a week before the Israeli cabinet’s approval to register West Bank lands as state land, Israeli authorities adopted new measures that open land purchase mechanisms for settlers while reducing oversight. That same day, Israeli authorities also moved to further erode Palestinian Authority powers in Areas A and B, which under international agreements signed by Israel should be under full administrative Palestinian control.
Taken together, these measures mark a new phase of Zionist territorial conquest in the 21st century – one that relies less on overt warfare and more on administrative consolidation.
In 1948, Zionist militias pursued territorial conquest through large-scale warfare, mass displacement and the redrawing of borders. Today, conquest increasingly operates through clerical mechanisms.
It is not accidental that a minister as vocally racist as Smotrich explained the plan as an attempt to end “current chaos that is bad for everyone – Jews and Arabs alike”. While Israel’s goal of taking over Palestinian lands has remained unchanged, the post-Oslo era and the reputational damage Israel has sustained during its genocidal war on Gaza mean that visible and large-scale violence is not sustainable for long-term achievements in the West Bank.
So rather than tanks, bombs and dramatic declarations of territorial conquest, Israel is lowering both regional and international alarm by consolidating land through perceived bureaucracy.
From paperwork to dispossession
Israel is pushing its West Bank policies as neutral cadastral clean-up when in reality they are large-scale land grabs carried out through administrative means. It is an act of state building that allows Zionist Israelis to determine whose claims over Palestinian lands are legal and whose vanish.
This is precisely why land registration matters: Once land is entered into the Israeli registry as “state land”, it becomes a legal reality far more difficult to reverse than a temporary military seizure.
For Palestinians, this policy signals serious danger because we have seen it before. After the large-scale dispossession of hundreds of thousands of Palestinians from their lands in 1948, about 150,000 Palestinians remained in what became Israel.
These Palestinians were put under military rule until the 1960s despite holding Israeli citizenship. This was not done for security; it was done to ensure territorial restructuring. Lands that did not have Palestinians physically present on them were absorbed through the Absentees Property Law.
A similar dynamic is unfolding today in the West Bank, where physical displacement and restricted access are again being converted into legal dispossession. In the West Bank, the last two years have seen alarming rates of settler violence that have pushed thousands of Palestinians off their lands while other areas have been taken and declared closed military zones. This denied Palestinians access to their homes, farmlands and properties. Under Israeli law, these can all be considered absentee lands, even if their rightful owners are just a few metres away and unable to reach their lands due to Israeli hostilities.
Through this, Israel is creating a system in which the default legal outcome produces territorial absorption. The bureaucratic aspect of this means that annexation becomes irreversible. It is no longer a temporary military seizure operation; it is transforming territory into property operating within a state system, in this case the Israeli legal system.
More dangerously, historical evidence shows that Israel has not only absorbed Palestinian lands through bureaucracy but also coerced Palestinians to engage with Israeli legal structures as a final avenue.
Still today, Palestinians with Israeli citizenship in areas such as Ein Hod are in legal battles over land. Not only were they displaced from their village, which now serves as a Jewish artist colony, but Palestinians are also just a few kilometres away, holding Israeli citizenship. Decades later, they remain in legal battles to secure building permits to live on the nearby lands they were forced to move to.
Why the world enables administrative conquest
It is important to realise that all of this was made possible by the international community’s refusal to address the criminality of the Israeli regime as a whole.
Condemnations of individual Israeli settler attacks in the last two years and refusal to disarm Israel despite having committed genocide are precisely what is allowing Israel to persist in its colonial expansion. For years Palestinians, as well as international human rights organisations, have warned not only of rising Israeli settler violence but also of a clear synchronisation of efforts by the army and armed Israeli militias in the West Bank.
Palestinians shared reports, tried to tell the stories of trees uprooted by the thousands, of water pipelines being destroyed by Israelis, of large-scale arson attacks and pogroms across different cities and towns, of settlers being armed with military-grade weapons and trained by the army in illegal settlements.
However, the world defined violence only when it came in the shape of bullets and bombs, which is what allowed Israel to shift strategies in the West Bank. While Palestinians are disarmed in the West Bank, all that was left were outcries and calls for media coverage. Violence enacted against Palestinians was reduced to random and exceptional acts of hostility.
Yet in the West Bank, Israel did not choose dramatic war; it chose subtlety. In the last two years, the battlefield in the West Bank has diffused into everyday life and relocated into the nervous system. Violence no longer depends on constant lethal force but on permanent anticipation of a settler attack, a military raid or a court demolition order. Constant surveillance, drones overhead, incessant home invasions, arrests and checkpoints every few metres hold the body captive.
All of these practices paved the way for the ongoing displacement and dispossession of Palestinians from their lands. More importantly, they are precisely why Israel is able to push renewed policies to register lands as state lands and to allow Israelis to buy lands with little oversight.
What this must teach us is that sometimes war exists in the subtleties, and the absence of relentless bombing does not mean the absence of war.

Costa meets with wounded Ukrainian soldier at hospital in Oslo
He stated this on X, Ukrinform reports.
"To date, more than 2,750 patients have been evacuated with Norway's support to hospitals across Europe under the EU Civil Protection Mechanism — a vital contribution to our collective support for Ukraine," he stressed.
He expressed gratitude to the "dedicated doctors and nurses" of Oslo University Hospital, who have been providing medical assistance to many evacuated Ukrainian patients since the start of the full-scale invasion.
He also shared his impressions of meeting a Ukrainian serviceman, Ihor, who continues to recover from injuries sustained on the Zaporizhzhia front last autumn.
"I wish him a full and speedy recovery," Costa wrote, adding that he was "deeply moved" by the meeting.
As Ukrinform previously reported, President of the European Council Antonio Costa arrived in Oslo today for high-level meetings to mark the strong momentum in EU–Norway bilateral relations.
According to the visit program, he had an audience with the Crown Prince Regent and then met with Prime Minister of Norway Jonas Gahr Store.
He also visited Oslo University Hospital, which plays a key role in Norway's support for Ukraine by treating hundreds of patients evacuated due to the war. As a major trauma center, it provides specialized care for war-related injuries.
Costa is also set to visit the Norwegian Defence Research Establishment (FFI) in Kjeller, near Oslo. FFI has been a key player in supporting and strengthening Norway's defense capabilities through advanced research and innovation. It has participated in joint defense research and development under the European Defence Fund (EDF), receiving financial support from the EU.

Two suspects charged over killing of French far-right activist Quentin Deranque
A French court on Thursday brought homicide charges against two suspects in the fatal beating of far-right activist Quentin Deranque, 23, after violent clashes in the French city of Lyon. Most of those detained are from far-left movements.

A French court brought homicide charges Thursday against two suspects in the fatal beating of a far-right activist that has fuelled political anger in France and beyond.
In the latest fallout from the killing, President Emmanuel Macron told Italy's Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni to keep out of French affairs after she expressed concern about a perceived ideological motive for the violence.
Quentin Deranque, 23, died from head injuries after being attacked by at least six people on the sidelines of a far-right protest in Lyon on February 12. Most of the 11 suspects who had been detained are from far-left movements.
Prosecutor Thierry Dran told a press conference he had requested "intentional homicide" charges against seven men and recommended they remain in custody to avoid any "disturbance to public order".
He later told AFP that two of the men had been charged with homicide.
A third suspected was charged with complicity in the killing – identified as Jacques-Elie Favrot, a parliamentary assistant to lawmaker Raphael Arnault of the hard-left party France Unbowed (LFI) – the suspect's lawyer Bertrand Sayn told reporters.
Favrot was remanded in custody, his lawyer said.
A judge was scheduled to rule later on whether four others would face charges.
The killing has fuelled political tensions ahead of municipal elections in March and France's 2027 presidential race, in which the far-right National Rally (RN) party is seen as having its best chance yet at winning the top job.
On Wednesday, Italy's far-right leader Meloni said the killing of Deranque was "a wound for all of Europe".

Macron said there was no place in France "for movements that adopt and legitimise violence" and called on all political parties to "clean up" their act.
"Nothing can justify violent action – neither on one side nor the other, and not even in a head-to-head confrontation that is deadly for the republic."
Macron also suggested that everyone must "stay in their own lane", after Meloni lamented "a climate of ideological hatred".
"I'm always struck by the fact that people who are nationalists – who don't want anyone bothering them at home – are always the first to comment on what's happening elsewhere," Macron said, while on a visit to New Delhi.
'Terrible past'
Italy's foreign minister hit back saying the killing of the French activist "is a serious matter that concerns us all".
Antonio Tajani said on X there had been similar incidents in Italy's history, and that condemning such violence aims "to ensure that we do not return to a terrible past".
He said "there have been many Quentins in Italy, some during the darkest periods of the Republic".
Macron is "closely monitoring" events, a member of his team said Thursday. "We must avoid any spiral of violence."
Eleven people – eight men and three women – were taken into custody over the killing.
Lyon prosecutor Dran said that of the seven men who could be charged with homicide, two have refused to speak while in custody.
Others have acknowledged being at the scene and "some admit to having struck blows", but he added, they all dispute having had any homicidal intent.
Four suspects have been released, but more are being sought, Dran said.
Among those originally detained are two parliamentary assistants to Raphael Arnault, a member of parliament from the hard-left France Unbowed (LFI) party, as well as a former intern.

A lawyer for Deranque's parents said they called "for calm and restraint".
"The family condemns any call for violence. Any form of political violence," Fabien Rajon told broadcaster RTL.
In snap parliamentary polls in 2024, Macron's supporters and the left, including the hard-left, joined forces in an effort to bar the far-right from power.
But following Deranque's killing some high-profile politicians sought to distance themselves from the hard-left, ruling out any possible futue alliance.
Justice Minister Gérald Darmanin called on Arnault to "draw the consequences" if the judiciary "finds serious and consistent evidence concerning him or the aides he hired".
LFI party coordinator Manuel Bompard said that Arnault would "certainly not" be suspended or excluded from the LFI group in the National Assembly lower house.
An anti-immigration collective called Nemesis has blamed the killing of the activist on an anti-fascist youth group called La Jeune Garde (Young Guard) co-founded by Arnault before he was elected to parliament.

YAOUNDE, Feb 19 - A freelance journalist on assignment for the Associated Press was slapped by police and briefly detained alongside three other reporters and a lawyer in Yaounde while attempting to interview Africans recently deported from the United States, two sources told Reuters.
The journalists had their equipment confiscated, which has yet to be returned, and were taken to the judicial police by plainclothes officers on Tuesday after attempting to film the facility hosting the deportees, sources said.
"It was an extremely stressful experience," said freelance journalist Randy Joe Sa'ah, who was briefly detained.
"I was surprised by how quickly the situation escalated. It felt as though our only 'offence' was simply being present at the facility where people were being held," he said.
AP declined to comment.
Cameroon's Ministry of Foreign Affairs and police did not respond to requests for comment.
The first group of deportees arrived in Cameroon in January, including two individuals from Ghana, two from the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), two from Morocco, two from Angola, and one from Zimbabwe. The Moroccans have since returned home but the remaining seven migrants remain in Cameroon.
A second group arrived early on Monday and included three Ethiopians, one Senegalese, one Kenyan, one Sierra Leonean, and two from the DRC.
The Trump administration has approached a number of African governments about accepting deportees as part of its campaign to deter immigration through high-profile deportations to so-called "third countries." In some cases migrants have voiced concerns for their safety. Cameroon has not disclosed whether it participated in the U.S. administration's program. The State Department could not be immediately reached for comment.
The recent flights brought the total number of deportees in Cameroon to 17, according to four deportees and two lawyers.
All the deportees had been granted withholding of removal status in the U.S., which protects individuals from deportation to countries where they fear persecution or harm. REUTERS

They survived Russian imprisonment, torture and sexual violence. In "Traces", seven Ukrainian women tell their story - and transform pain into strength. A documentary about war crimes, dignity and the fight for justice.
Traces is a documentary about almost unimaginable cruelty as seven women from Ukraine talk about their experiences of violence at the hands of Russian soldiers.
The film, which premiered at the Berlinale in its Panorama programme, also deals with the terrible reality of women in Russian captivity or under Russian occupation and tales of women who did not let it break them.
One of them, Iryna, fought her way through and created something new - strength, community, and hope.
Traces left behind by the war
The Ukrainian embassy fell silent as the trailer for the documentary began. The protagonists all sat in the front row; the seven women who say they experienced violence in Russian captivity.
When Iryna spoke, the audience listened attentively. She talked about imprisonment, abuse and trying to preserve her dignity. The descriptions of violence were hard to fathom in the warm, safe space of the screening in the centre of Berlin. For Iryna, however, they are part of her reality. She survived and with her the memories of what she experienced.
"They threatened to rape my son and said that people like us shouldn't live," said another woman in the trailer. "And only after that will I kill you with this child. Time stood still and I just stood there."
We've gathered for the launch of the social impact campaign for Traces. Representatives of civil society have come to the embassy, along with a UN representative and the Ukrainian ambassador Oleksii Makeiev. The majority of the invited guests are women.
The campaign aims to draw attention to the fate of imprisoned and abused Ukrainians - and to demand political and legal consequences.
Portrait of seven women: "They sacrifice their privacy"
In the film, Iryna takes us through her own fate and that of six other women in Russian captivity. They survived torture, sexual and other forms of violence - war crimes allegedly committed by Russian soldiers.
Iryna is accompanied by documentary filmmaker Alisa Kovalenko, who is also a survivor of suspected sexual violence at the hands of Russian soldiers.
The filmmaker fought against the occupation of Crimea in 2014 and experienced Russian captivity herself. "To be honest, I didn't want to make this film. I just had the feeling that I had to do it," Kovalenko tells Euronews. "I knew it would be very, very difficult. That I would suffer. But I knew why I was doing it. It was worth it to me."
In her opinion, the women also had to make another sacrifice. "They sacrifice their privacy. But they know what they did it for. Because they also speak for those who are still silent," said Kovalenko.
The film is proof of dignity, solidarity and the common fight for justice and sisterhood.
According to the director, Iryna and the other women have succeeded in transforming their pain into strength. "So I believe that this film can evoke empathy, active empathy that is followed by action," Kovalenko added.
"I spoke about it for the first time after five years"
Few women have gone public with their story. Iryna is part of the SEMA Ukraine association, which encourages women to share their experiences with each other. "It took me many years to gather this strength," she told Euronews. "I only spoke about it for the first time five years after my experience, and that wasn't easy."
Ultimately, she wants to document Russia's use of sexual violence against women as a weapon of war and records interviews with six other women. In the course of the film, the viewer not only learns about their harsh experiences, but also perceives the strength of their community and the mutual support.
"This will be our small victory. And once again, this will be proof that justice does exist," says Iryna about the film and the campaign, Iryna says:
No explicit depictions of violence are shown; instead, the women return to their former homes, some of which have been bombed and destroyed, to tell their stories. They find walls with dozens of bullet holes, parts of the roofs missing, the garden infiltrated by mines. In one scene, a fire can be seen in the distance, it bangs every second, then the siren alarm sounds. Some of the audience are startled.
Alisa Kovalenko deliberately refrained from showing the interviews: "I decided that I wouldn't film any women, but only make audio recordings," explained the director. You're more likely to build trust "when you talk to a person, when you look them in the eye, when you're not behind the camera."
However, when she was in the Kherson region for the interviews, she saw traces of war everywhere. "There were minefields, burning fields, destroyed houses, but also wounded people." Ultimately, however, she also wanted to depict the wounds that are not visible at first glance, such as the women's memories of the violence they experienced.
Carrying on as proof that the enemy had failed
However, the aim was not only to make a documentary film, but also to depict possible Russian war crimes. Iryna, Kovalenko and the other women don't just want the world to know what Russian soldiers did. They are standing in the Ukrainian embassy in Germany and using the platform of the Berlinale to ensure that their film's message is just the beginning.
"The best way to overcome a trauma is to look forward. For me, it was very important not to let them make me unhappy," says a woman in the trailer. "This is my weapon that I could give to other women. The fact that they have overcome it is the best proof that the enemy has failed."
On the sidelines of the Berlinale, numerous civil society representatives in the embassy supported the women's initiative called SEMA, which fights against sexual violence as a weapon of war and supports those affected.
The organisation demands recognition that Russia is using sexual and gender-specific violence (conflict-related sexual violence, CRSV) as a weapon of war. The organisation offers both financial and psychological support to those affected.
Recognising systematic violence as a war crime
At the end of the documentation, it is written that Russia should be placed on the UN's "shame" list. The United Nations organisation has its own definition of CRSV. The violence used is linked to a conflict.
According to the latest UN report for 2023, 85 cases of conflict-related sexual violence against civilians and prisoners of war were identified in Ukraine. This is said to have been directed equally against men and women.
"In most of the documented cases involving adult male victims, sexual violence was used as a method of torture during their captivity by Russian armed forces and law enforcement agencies," the report states.
The Ukrainian side is also said to have initiated 10 such cases. They range from the threat of violence to execution. The SEMA Ukraine association assumes that the number of unreported cases of Russian CRSV violence is high.
"This is not a documentary that people will talk about. Many people prefer to look the other way," said Ukrainian Ambassador Oleksii Makeiev. For him, the community of Ukrainian women, "this pursuit of truth", is "a component of Ukrainian resilience".
"Ukrainians today can be a good example of how society works, how democracy is defended and what the European values that underlie our consciousness in Europe actually mean," Makeiev continued.
Both the world premiere of the film and the presentation of the campaign at the Ukrainian Embassy left the audience with a feeling of hope and strength.
The way the women have pulled each other out of the cruel memories and stand shoulder to shoulder on the stages of Berlin also shows the creative power that has arisen from this. They see their voices as a sword against the violence of the Russian soldiers.

Trump's 'Board of Peace' members pledge $7 billion for Gaza
February 19, 2026US President Donald Trump launched the inaugural meeting of his "Board of Peace" on Thursday, with representatives from over 40 countries and observers from a dozen others present.
Trump said that $7 billion (just under €6 billion) had been pledged by nine members of the organization for a Gaza relief package. That amounts to just 10% of the $70 billion needed to rebuild after the devastation of two years of war.
The US president also pledged $10 billion, but without saying where that money would go.
Who has pledged money to the Board of Peace?
Trump said Kazakhstan, Azerbaijan, UAE, Morocco, Bahrain, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Uzbekistan and Kuwait were the countries offering to fund the Board of Peace relief package for Gaza.
"Every dollar spent is an investment in stability and the hope of new and harmonious [region]," the US president said.
"The Board of Peace is showing how a better future can be built, starting right here in this room," he added.
Trump also used his platform to attack domestic opponents and praise his own endorsements of foreign leaders in elections.
Beyond pledges for financing, the following countries also said they would send troops to Gaza to be part of a stabilization force: Indonesia, Morocco, Kazakhstan, Kosovo and Albania.
What is Trump's 'Board of Peace'?
The so-called "Board of Peace" came out of a ceasefire deal negotiated between Israel and Hamas in Gaza to end two years of war. However, that deal has not brought an end to the deadly violence, with more than 600 Palestinians killed since the ceasefire began, according to the Gaza Health Ministry.
Though the Board originated as a Gaza-specific reconstruction body, its charter evolved into a broader and more ambiguous mandate. The founding charter, signed in Davos on January 22, 2026, does not explicitly mention Gaza. Trump's opaque comments have led to criticisms that he is trying to overshadow the UN, from which he has also withdrawn much US funding.
However, the organization functions very differently from the UN. Members are obliged to pay $1 billion to extend their membership beyond the first two years and Trump has appointed himself chair, meaning he will remain in control even after leaving office.
Besides obvious Trump allies such as leaders from Israel, Hungary and Argentina, there are also countries such as Pakistan seeking favor with the White House who have signed up to the board.
Germany, Italy, Norway, Switzerland, the United Kingdom and several others sent observers rather than representatives. Meanwhile, France has rejected any participation and criticized the EU for sending officials.

Archaeologists confirm 2,000-year-old discovery at Scottish beach
- Two dog walkers discovered 2,000-year-old human and animal footprints on a Scottish beach at Lunan Bay, Angus, after recent storms revealed a fresh layer of clay.
- Archaeologists from the University of Aberdeen confirmed the prints date back to the height of the Roman Empire, noting it is a unique and rare discovery for Scotland, with no previous record of such a site.
- The archaeological team faced a race against time and extreme weather, working in windspeeds over 55mph to record the site before it was reclaimed by the sea within 48 hours.
- Despite the rapid destruction, the team successfully recorded and mapped the site, capturing 3D models and physical casts of the prints for further analysis.
- Ongoing analysis has identified footprints from humans, roe deer, red deer, and other animals, providing insights into the ancient environment and its inhabitants during the late Iron Age.

Spending even more on defence won’t buy us peace | Letters

We are told to spend even more, and more quickly, on the armed forces, whose current budget for this year is expected to amount to more than £60bn (‘Britain ‘needs to go faster’ on defence spending, Starmer says, 16 February). The Ministry of Defence must surely first show it can put its house in order.
The government is considering whether to scrap Ajax, the army’s planned new armoured vehicle, even though more than £6bn of taxpayers’ money has already been spent on the project. Ajax is eight years late, its defects so serious that vibration and noise have made soldiers training on it sick, with some suffering hearing loss.
It is the latest and most egregious example of the huge waste caused by the MoD’s incompetence and profligacy over recent years. It has spent many billions on items, including aircraft carriers, that would be extremely vulnerable in modern conflicts, something that has been evident for a long time.
The chairs of the Commons defence and public accounts committees told the MoD last month that its failure to publish its equipment plan in 2023, and again in 2024, has resulted in an unacceptable gap in parliament and the public’s ability to scrutinise defence spending. Repeated delays in publishing the MoD’s current plan risk sending damaging signals to adversaries, they added. The delays also signal that the MoD culture is unfit for purpose and its leadership cannot be trusted with so much of the British public’s money.
Richard Norton-Taylor

Desire for greater security comes from people and countries feeling unsafe and fearful (British and German military chiefs press ‘moral’ case for rearmament, 15 February). But experience has shown that the apparent security that comes from rearmament is temporary at best and can provoke the conflict it tries to prevent.
The British and German defence chiefs may argue that “strength deters aggression”, but this conceals the reality that Britain already has the world’s sixth-largest military budget, and that Nato’s military spending already dwarfs Russia’s. Their argument could easily come from defence chiefs in Russia or any other hostile state. As we are seeing with the US as well as Russia, strength also begets aggression.
Countries aren’t static in responding to each other, and there’s a high likelihood that military buildup in Europe will spur further militarisation elsewhere. Long-term peace comes from building trust, friendship and mutual dependence between nations, not the constant threat of military retaliation.
Oliver Robertson
Head of witness and worship, Quakers in Britain
So the British and German military chiefs are making the moral case for rearmament in order to “preserve peace”. Doing so, they say, is not warmongering. However, when doing so has led to a 45% cut in the government’s funding through the Integrated Security Fund dedicated to building peace and preventing conflict and when the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office is being “restructured” with the loss of considerable conflict expertise, it does rather look like warmongering.
If we are serious about preserving peace, we need to be investing in those diplomats and peacebuilders who are able to de-escalate and reduce tensions. Rearming without investing in these skill sets will simply increase tensions still further. It is the opposite of preserving peace.
Lt Col David Couzens (retired)
Faringdon, Oxfordshire
The defence chiefs of the UK and Germany quite rightly warn us of the increasing threat from a rapidly rearming Russia, and call for “an honest conversation” with citizens about defence being the responsibility of each and every one of us.
Any meaningful conversation must be preceded by a crash course in recent events and an outline of the specific threats. Few people in the UK nowadays have any reason to be concerned about defence, and successive governments have been much too timid to talk openly about the threat of war for fear of spooking the population.
There is one significant omission from the proposed conversation. If the government wants citizens to engage in building a whole-of-society defence, it must spell out in detail how it will protect us should open conflict break out. Civil defence organisations disappeared along with the cold war, and the (very few) nuclear shelters allocated to civilians have fallen into complete disrepair.
Hannah Walker
Wymondham, Norfolk
The British and German defence chiefs write of the “moral dimension” of rearmament and say that weakness invites aggression. I would suggest that the people of Moldova, Georgia and Ukraine have offered no such invitation to their bear-like neighbour. Nor, indeed, the people of Iraq to this country’s catastrophic aggression in 2003. Greenlanders will likewise be anxiously checking their own invitation list.
The top brass are nonetheless right that a whole-of-society approach is required to meet the complexity of threats to the UK and Europe – not just those emanating from Vladimir Putin, Donald Trump and their ilk, but also climate breakdown, grotesque inequality, and deadly new technologies. But that approach cannot be reduced to a lecture on how military industries must prevail at the expense of our health and welfare.
Eight months since the last defence and security reviews, we are still nowhere near the “continent-wide conversation with the public” that the prime minister and security elites glibly prescribe. The public remains wholly outside the conversation on its own security, excluded from even tokenistic input to the last national security strategy.
We ignore at our peril how the “peace dividend” investment of the post-cold-war era strengthened our society, as well as how that trust, unity and resilience has been steadily undermined by austerity, corruption, misinvestment in wars of choice, and the politics of polarisation. If morally conscious leaders genuinely want to protect their people, they would do well to listen and look at home too. The UK’s weakened society invites not deflection and aggression, but recognition and action.

Denmark says unclear why it was not invited to Trump's Board of Peace meeting
Foreign minister says: 'We want lasting peace in Gaza, and we want it to happen in a way that includes the Palestinian Authority'
BRUSSELS
US President Donald Trump announced billions of dollars in contributions for relief in the Gaza Strip at the inaugural meeting Thursday of the Board of Peace in Washington.
Trump said the US is contributing $10 billion to the new body.
Kazakhstan, Azerbaijan, the United Arab Emirates, Morocco, Bahrain, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Uzbekistan and Kuwait collectively pledged more than $7 billion, he added.
The UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs is raising an additional $2 billion, said Trump.
The US president noted Japan is committed to host a fundraiser, "which will be a very big one."
US Ambassador to the UN Michael Waltz said humanitarian flows into Gaza have improved significantly, with 4,200 aid trucks entering the territory each week for 13 consecutive weeks, “the longest stretch of high-volume assistance to Gaza in years.”
"Aid is up," he said, adding that it was now reaching the full 2.1 million Gazans, up as much as five times from previous delivery levels.
Israel began its war in Gaza on Oct. 8, 2023, resulting in more than 72,000 Palestinian deaths and over 171,000 injuries, most of them women and children, and damage to 90% of civilian infrastructure.
Despite a ceasefire, the Israeli army continued its attacks, killing at least 611 Palestinians and injuring 1,630, according to Gaza’s Health Ministry.

Romania, Hungary back Trump peace initiative for Gaza at first Board of Peace meeting
Leaders outline humanitarian aid, reconstruction plans for Gaza while praising US president’s role in global peace diplomacy
ISTANBUL
Romania’s President Nicusor Dan and Hungary’s Prime Minister Viktor Orban expressed support Thursday for US President Donald Trump’s peace initiative in remarks at the first meeting of the Board of Peace.
Dan thanked Trump for his “involvement and leadership” and described the proposed Gaza Strip peace plan as “comprehensive and stable,” while outlining steps Romania could take, particularly in humanitarian and institutional support.
“I think everyone desire peace, stability, prosperity in Gaza, but the question is how to act for and that's why this meeting is and this format, it's important what Romanian can do first on the humanitarian situation, we can increase the number of flights in order to extract children with disease and to treat in the Romanian hospitals we've done already, and we can do 4,000 children and 4,000 family members,” he said.
He added that Romania could help rebuild emergency response systems and public institutions in Gaza, citing prior international experience.
“Secondly, we had a good expertise in emergency report systems, like ambulance fire systems, and we can help in order to rebuild that system, and we can donate some infrastructure, some equipment. Third, we (are) already offering some scholarships for Palestinian students, and we can extend the program. And we can also help to rebuild, refurbish the schools in Gaza and force," he added.
Orban praised Trump’s global diplomatic efforts and framed Hungary’s participation as principled and strategic.
“First of all, let me express the appreciation of the Hungarian people to President Trump for his tireless peace efforts all around the world,” he said.
He emphasized Hungary’s status within the EU representation at the meeting. “Hungary is the only country to be represented here on the highest level among the founding members from the European Union.”
Linking Middle East stability to Europe’s security, Orban said, “We in Europe understand clearly that the security situation in (the) Middle East, and especially in Gaza, has a significant impact on the security of Europe.”
He argued that new mechanisms were needed to address global conflicts, criticizing existing institutions.
“We understand that during the recent decades, international organizations have failed to fulfill their role to preserve peace and stability worldwide. Therefore, new initiatives are needed to bring forward the issue of peace globally,” he said.
Israel began its war in Gaza on Oct. 8, 2023, resulting in more than 72,000 Palestinian deaths and over 171,000 injuries, most of them women and children, and damage to 90% of civilian infrastructure.

Etsy stock pops on Depop deal despite disappointing revenue, merchandise sales

Etsy shares popped 9% on Thursday after the company said it plans to offload its fashion resale app Depop to eBay for about $1.2 billion in cash.
The online marketplace also reported mixed earnings results for the fourth quarter.
Here's how Etsy did, compared with estimates from analysts polled by LSEG:
- Earnings per share: 92 cents vs. 84 cents estimated
- Revenue: $882 million vs. $885 million estimated
Gross merchandise sales, or the dollar value of items sold, slid 3.8% year over year to $3.59 billion and missed analyst estimates of $3.6 billion, according to FactSet. The company attributed the annual decline to its sale of musical instrument marketplace Reverb, which was completed last June.
The downbeat results were overshadowed by the Depop deal announced on Wednesday. Etsy CEO Kruti Patel Goyal said in a statement that the sale would allow the company to "focus exclusively" on its core marketplace.
EBay said Depop, a resale app popular among younger consumers, complements its business and would strengthen its presence in fashion, which has become one of its fastest-growing categories.
Shares of eBay also climbed 3% on Thursday.
In the fourth quarter, Etsy's net income dropped 14.8% year over year to $110.7 million, or 92 cents per share, compared with $129.9 million, or $1.03 per share, one year ago.
The company, known for its marketplace of handcrafted and artisan wares, has recently stepped up its marketing investments as it looks to reach more U.S. consumers.
Etsy has been contending with stiffer competition in online retail, along with a challenging macroeconomic backdrop. The company said in its annual filing released Thursday that it's been pressured by an ongoing pullback in consumer discretionary spending and "evolving buyer behavior."
Active sellers grew 7.7% year over year to 8.76 million, surpassing analysts estimated 8.5 million. Active buyers declined 2% year over year to 93.54 million, compared with Wall Street's estimated 93.1 million.
For the first quarter, Etsy guided for gross merchandise sales to come in between $2.38 billion and $2.43 billion, compared with GMS of $2.8 billion one year earlier. Analysts anticipated $2.68 billion in GMS.

SANTIAGO, Feb 19 - Chilean authorities on Thursday raided the homes of two recently dismissed executives of state copper miner Codelco as they continue their investigation into a deadly collapse at the El Teniente mine last year.
Officials during the searches seized digital equipment from ex-Chief Operations Officer Mauricio Barraza and former mine manager Claudio Sougarret, Chile's prosecutor's office said in a statement.
Codelco facilities were also searched, with some equipment voluntarily handed over by the company. Codelco declined to comment.
Authorities added that items belonging to Rodrigo Andrades, former El Teniente projects manager, had been seized in October.
The three executives were removed from their jobs last week after an internal audit found inconsistencies tied to a 2023 rock explosion at El Teniente, including in Codelco's following reports to mining regulator Sernageomin.
Sernageomin said earlier this week it would file formal complaints to authorities.
Last year, the same mine was the site of a collapse that killed six people. REUTERS

Polish president signs new law on aid for Ukrainian refugees
Polish President Karol Nawrocki has signed a document that provides for the transfer of all instruments supporting Ukrainian refugees to the general Law on the Protection of Foreigners.
Source: European Pravda, citing RMF24, a Polish news portal
Details: The so-called Special Assistance Act for Ukrainians, in place since 2022, has established a separate legal framework that simplifies rules for residence, work, access to benefits and education for refugees from Ukraine.
The new law gradually abolishes this system and key support instruments will be included in the general provisions on the protection of foreigners.
Additionally, the signed document also extends the legitimacy of staying in Poland for Ukrainian citizens who fled the war until 4 March 2027.
One of the significant changes in the law is the introduction of the requirement to apply for a PESEL number, a personal identification number that provides access to various services and simplifies bureaucratic procedures, within 30 days of entering Poland.
Failure to submit an application within this period will result in the expiry of the temporary protection and will be regarded as a refusal to receive this form of support.
Background:
- In November 2025, President of Poland Karol Nawrocki announced that he had signed the law on assistance to citizens of Ukraine for the last time, and in the future, they will be treated like other national minorities.
- The previous law on aid for Ukrainians was vetoed by the Polish president, citing what he called an allegedly excessive amount of social assistance provided to Ukrainian refugees.
- The new law, rapidly prepared by the Polish government, was finally approved by the parliament on 17 September.

Ukrainian model allegedly recruited girls for Epstein
A Ukrainian model who met Jeffrey Epstein in person and likely received expensive gifts and money from him may have recruited girls for the American sex offender.
Source: an investigation by Slidstvo.Info, an independent team of investigative journalists
Details: Correspondence between the financier and a Ukrainian woman known as Nastia N. has been found in the Epstein files – the latest documents and photographs which the US Department of Justice released at the beginning of 2026.
During 2015-2019, Nastia N. corresponded with Epstein's assistant, Lesley Groff, and the financier himself, who built a network of sexual exploitation and human trafficking, including children.
The messages indicate that Groff scheduled meetings between Nastia and Epstein and also arranged payment for her education, visits to beauty salons, tickets from Kyiv to New York, and gifts including a new laptop worth US$3,500.
The files include messages in which the financier asks the model to find him an "assistant" aged 22 to 25, who had to be "smart and willing to travel".
"Of course I will find you girls," Nastia replied.
The model offered Epstein several candidates, including 25-year-old Elena from Russia. It was later arranged for the woman to go on a multi-day trip to one of the financier's islands, where many women have testified that they were raped.
Later, Nastia wrote to the sex offender again to suggest that he consider another candidate for "Jeffrey-land" – likely Epstein's island. Epstein turned this one down, and the model sent him further suggestions.
In 2019, Epstein wrote to his assistant to remind her about "10k for Nastia N". It is not known what this money was for or whether the Ukrainian model received it.
When the Slidstvo.Info journalists attempted to contact Nastia, she read their messages but did not reply to them, and then made her Instagram page private.
They did manage to speak to Nastia's mother, who lives in Ukraine.
She replied: "I asked her [about the Epstein files – ed.]. She said she's very glad that she is on the sidelines of these events. I don't know how she can appear there." She promised to let her daughter know that the journalists had approached her for comment.

Ex-South Korean President Yoon gets life sentence for insurrection

Former South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol was convicted on Thursday of orchestrating an insurrection and received a life sentence for his short-lived declaration of martial law in 2024, in a verdict that brings a dramatic close to what has been the nation's most severe political turmoil in decades.
The conservative leader was ousted from office after he declared martial law and sent troops to surround the National Assembly on Dec. 3, 2024, in a baffling attempt to overcome a legislature controlled by his liberal opponents.
Judge Jee Kui-youn of the Seoul Central District Court said he found Yoon, 65, guilty of rebellion for mobilizing military and police forces in an illegal attempt to seize the Assembly, arrest political opponents and establish unchecked power for an indefinite period.
Yoon's martial law imposition, the first of its kind in more than four decades, recalled South Korea's past military-backed governments when authorities occasionally proclaimed emergency decrees that allowed them to station soldiers, tanks and armored vehicles on streets or in public places such as schools to prevent anti-government demonstrations.
As lawmakers rushed to the National Assembly, Yoon's martial law command issued a proclamation declaring sweeping powers, including suspending political activities, controlling the media and publications, and allowing arrests without warrants.
The decree lasted about six hours before being lifted after a quorum of lawmakers managed to break through a military blockade and unanimously voted to lift the measure.
Yoon was suspended from office on Dec. 14, 2024, after being impeached by lawmakers and was formally removed by the Constitutional Court in April 2025. He has been under arrest since last July while facing multiple criminal trials, with the rebellion charge carrying the most severe punishment.
An expressionless Yoon gazed straight ahead as the judge delivered the sentence in the same courtroom where former military rulers and presidents have been convicted of treason, corruption and other crimes over the decades.
Yoon Kap-keun, one of the former president's lawyers, accused the judge of issuing a "predetermined verdict" based solely on prosecutors' arguments and said the "rule of law" had collapsed. He said he would discuss whether to appeal with his client and the rest of the legal team.
Former President Yoon claimed in court that the martial law decree was only meant to raise public awareness of how the liberals were paralyzing state affairs, and that he was prepared to respect lawmakers if they voted against the measure.
Prosecutors said it was clear Yoon was attempting to disable the legislature and prevent lawmakers from lifting the measure through voting, actions that exceeded his constitutional authority even under martial law.
The court also convicted and sentenced five former military and police officials involved in enforcing Yoon's martial law decree.
They included ex-Defense Minister Kim Yong Hyun, who received a 30-year jail term for his central role in planning the measure, mobilizing the military and instructing military counterintelligence officials to arrest 14 key politicians, including National Assembly speaker Woo Won-shik and current liberal President Lee Jae Myung.
In announcing Yoon and Kim's verdicts, Jee said the decision to send troops to the National Assembly was key to his determination that the imposition of martial law amounted to rebellion.
"This court finds that the purpose of (Yoon's) actions was to send troops to the National Assembly, block the Assembly building and arrest key figures, including the National Assembly speaker and the leaders of both the ruling and opposition parties, in order to prevent lawmakers from gathering to deliberate or vote," Jee said.
"It's sufficiently established that he intended to obstruct or paralyze the Assembly's activities so that it would be unable to properly perform its functions for a considerable period of time."
As Yoon arrived in court, hundreds of police officers watched closely as Yoon supporters rallied outside a judicial complex, their cries rising as the prison bus transporting him drove past. Yoon's critics gathered nearby, demanding the death penalty.
There were no immediate reports of major clashes following the verdict.
A special prosecutor had demanded the death penalty for Yoon Suk Yeol, saying his actions posed a threat to the country's democracy and deserved the most serious punishment available, but most analysts had expected a life sentence since the poorly-planned power grab did not result in casualties.
South Korea has not executed a death row inmate since 1997, in what is widely seen as a de facto moratorium on capital punishment amid calls for its abolition.
Jung Chung-rae, leader of the liberal Democratic Party, which led the push to impeach and remove Yoon, expressed regret that the court stopped short of the death penalty, saying the ruling reflected a "lack of a sense of justice."
Song Eon-seok, floor leader of the conservative People Power Party, to which Yoon once belonged, issued a public apology, saying the party feels a "deep sense of responsibility" for the disruption to the nation.
The office of current President Lee Jae Myung did not immediately comment on the ruling.
Last month, Yoon was sentenced to five years in prison for resisting arrest, fabricating the martial law proclamation and sidestepping a legally mandated full Cabinet meeting before declaring the measure.
The Seoul Central Court had previously convicted two other members of Yoon's Cabinet in connection with the martial law debacle. That includes Prime Minister Han Duck-soo, who received a 23-year prison sentence for attempting to legitimize the decree by forcing it through a Cabinet Council meeting, falsifying records and lying under oath. Han has appealed the verdict.
Yoon is the first former South Korean president to receive a life sentence since former military dictator Chun Doo-hwan, who was sentenced to death in 1996 for his 1979 coup, a bloody 1980 crackdown on pro-democracy protesters in Gwangju that left more than 200 people dead or missing, and corruption.
The Supreme Court later reduced his sentence to life imprisonment, and he was released in late 1997 under a special presidential pardon. He died in 2021.

Türkiye takes all necessary steps beyond its borders for its security, neutralizing threats at their source without seeking permission from anyone, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan said on Thursday.
Speaking at an iftar program with families of martyrs at Çankaya Mansion in the capital Ankara, Erdoğan said that significant progress has been made in efforts toward a “terror-free Türkiye.”
“There has been a serious decrease in security risks directed at our country, both within and beyond our borders,” he said.
Referring to terrorism, Erdoğan said: “We are determined to rid Türkiye forever of this scourge that has burned the hearts of our nation for nearly half a century.”
He noted that thanks to operations by the armed forces and other security units, “we have significantly restricted the mobility of terrorist organizations.”
“Today, we can meet almost all our needs ourselves in nearly every field, including UAVs, armed UAVs, missiles, rockets, ships, helicopters and tanks,” he said.
He further added that an agreement was reached last month to resolve the issue in northern Syria without bloodshed, adding that “the process leading to full integration has begun.”

Drinks, darts, DJs and drag queens: the artwork that’s a fully-functioning pub – with the artist pulling pints

‘The art world has a real issue with making things overly conceptual, too complicated and using wanky jargon,” says Trackie McLeod. “It alienates people.” So, for his latest show, Utopia, the 32-year-old Glaswegian has decided to create something more welcoming and familiar: a pub.
Custom-built from scratch, the exhibition is a fully functioning boozer. McLeod will pull pints for punters, there’s a dartboard where you can take aim at images of Thatcher or Trump, and visitors can explore his mixed-media artworks, spanning print, sculpture and sound, and swing by to catch drag acts, DJs and panel discussions.
“I’ve even got a fruit machine that spits out chocolate coins,” he says. “Which is a comment on how these machines rinse working-class pockets for their own gain. Whereas with this work, everyone’s a winner.”
Utopia takes place at Factory International’s Aviva Studios in Manchester, and was commissioned by its Young Curators team. Touching on themes of nostalgia, class, identity and gentrification, it is also an ode to pubs and working men’s clubs as vital community hubs.
“I grew up in places like this,” McLeod says. “All our family occasions were there – weddings, birthdays, funerals. It’s where all the disputes happened. Spaces that were cheap and cheerful but championed character and comfort. I’m trying to bring back a sense of togetherness that we’re lacking at the moment.”
McLeod – whose nickname, Trackie, is based on his propensity, when younger, for bringing out a fresh tracksuit to put on when a party ran into day two – is having a very busy run. After two successful exhibitions, Fruit (2024) and Fruit II (2025), he now also has Soft Play running at the Charleston in Lewes until mid-April, where he has recreated an outdoor play park in the exhibition space. It explores “the awkward transition from childhood into teenager”, he says. “When you’re playing as an adult in these spaces – like drinking and vandalising – but are still really a kid.”
McLeod struggled at school and didn’t connect with the art curriculum and its focus on “dead painters”, but one day an ex-student came in to give a talk. “He looked like me and sounded like me,” he recalls. “He spoke about Andy Warhol, Basquiat and Keith Haring. That was my introduction to art that wasn’t just necessarily painting. A real turning point.”
He still failed art: he is dyslexic and struggled with the essays. But he “accidentally” ended up at college studying design, and then at university, trying to find his groove. “I’ve been chipping away at this for a long time,” he says. “It hasn’t been a linear path. There have been lots of ups and downs.”
By the time of Fruit – which featured a whole car painted in a Burberry check, and a dovecote installed in the gallery – he felt he had found his stride; blending Scottish patter, popular culture, graphic design, 00s nostalgia and explorations of class. “It all came together,” he says.
It also coincided with McLeod exploring his personal life in more depth. He had already been looking at toxic masculinity, and began to intersect it with his own experiences of growing up queer in Glasgow. In one piece – funny and absurd, but also quietly powerful and moving – he framed a long list of things that were deemed gay in school, including using gel pens, reading and crossing your legs. “It was only putting it out like that that you realise: fucking hell, that was ridiculous,” he says. “The things I would do to change myself to try and fit in at the time.”
McLeod has stayed in Glasgow, avoiding the frenzy of London, which he feels is “oversaturated”. He remains unrepresented by a gallery and happily part of a DIY scene. Despite his growing success, he has previously had to fund his own exhibitions to make them happen, sleeping on sofas at friends’ houses. For all the talk of representation, diversity and inclusion in the arts, that hasn’t been his experience as a working-class artist.
“A lot of these galleries say they are championing underrepresented voices and most of the time they don’t,” he says. “They don’t practise what they preach. It’s just rich folk with limited life experience, pumping money into rich folk with limited life experience. The art world feeds on nepotism, privilege and the bank of mummy and daddy. There’s definitely a glass ceiling for working-class artists.”
It’s been a slog for McLeod, but doing things on his own terms seems to be paying off and he now welcomes people to swing by Utopia for a pint and a chat. “I don’t have the answers, but I’m living proof that you can mark out your own path and it is possible,” he says. “But we need more working-class voices, more queer voices, and more POC voices, because it makes for more interesting art.”

In response to the recent releases of people arbitrarily detained for political reasons and the discussion of a so-called ‘Amnesty Law’, Valentina Ballesta, Amnesty International’s Deputy Director of Research for the Americas, said:
“While the freedom of the victims is restored, it is essential that the Fact-Finding Mission, created by the UN in 2019, be able to access the country and certify that this process moves forward in accordance with international standards. The contribution that this Mission can make is essential to guide Venezuela towards a future where human rights are respected and guaranteed,” she added.

Trump says US to give $10 bn to new 'Board of Peace'

U.S. President Donald Trump and US Vice President JD Vance sit together surrounded by members of the "Board of Peace" during a signing ceremony at the inaugural meeting of the "Board of Peace" at the US Institute of Peace in Washington, DC, on Feb. 19.
U.S. President Donald Trump on Thursday promised $10 billion and Muslim-majority nations offered funding and troops for Gaza as he inaugurated his "Board of Peace," a new institution whose ultimate mission has drawn questions.
Trump brought together allies from around the world — many authoritarians, with few Western democrats who traditionally ally with the United States — to hail his peacemaking just as he sends U.S. military might near Iran and threatens war.
Presiding with a gavel over the meeting in the gleaming Washington building of the former U.S. Institute of Peace, which has been gutted and renamed after the 79-year-old Republican, Trump hailed the "powerful people" who joined his board.
"We will help Gaza. We will straighten it out. We'll make it successful," Trump said, holding up a document with pledges before the disco beats of his adopted theme-song "YMCA" came on the speakers.
"We will make it peaceful, and we will do things like that in other spots. Spots will come up, things will happen," Trump said.
Trump, who has sharply curtailed foreign aid, said the United States would contribute $10 billion to the board.
Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates each promised at least $1 billion. White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said more than $6.5 billion was pledged, presumably excluding Trump's offer.
"Together we can achieve the dream of bringing lasting harmony to a region tortured by centuries of war, suffering," said the realtor-turned-president, who has spoken improbably of building tourist resorts in Gaza.
Trump did not explain exactly where the money would go and whether Congress had approved the contribution he announced for the institution, which has drawn criticism for its opaque nature.
Trump will wield veto power over the "Board of Peace" and can remain its head even after leaving office, while countries that want to stay on permanently, rather than enjoy a two-year stint, will need to pay $1 billion.
The "Board of Peace" came together after the Trump administration, teaming up with Qatar and Egypt, negotiated a ceasefire in October to halt two years of devastating war in Gaza.
The plan's second phase calls for the disarmament of Hamas, whose unprecedented October 7, 2023 attack on Israel triggered the massive offensive.
In a first for an Arab country, Morocco announced it was ready to send police as well as officers to the nascent International Stabilization Force.
The force's American commander, Major General Jasper Jeffers, said that Albania, Indonesia, Kazakhstan and Kosovo were also sending troops and announced that an Indonesian officer would serve as his deputy.
Indonesia, the world's largest Muslim-majority country, earlier said it was ready to send 8,000 troops — nearly half of the 20,000 sought.
Trump hailed Indonesian President Prabowo Subianto, who attended, calling the former military officer accused of human rights abuses in East Timor a "tough cookie."
Nickolay Mladenov, a veteran Bulgarian diplomat named high representative for Gaza by the United States, also announced the beginning of recruitment for a post-Hamas police force in Gaza and said 2,000 people had applied in the first hours.
Despite the truce, Gaza's health ministry, which operates under Hamas authorities, says Israeli forces have killed at least 601 people since it took effect.
Foreign Minister Gideon Saar, representing Israel at the meeting, demanded disarmament of Hamas and "a fundamental deradicalization process" in Gaza.
Mixed attendance
In a rambling speech, Trump denounced domestic opponents, highlighted stock market gains and endorsed the political fortunes of several leaders on stage, including populists Viktor Orban of Hungary and Javier Milei of Argentina.
He also issued a new warning to Iran, warning of potential U.S. strikes in 10 days if the clerical state does not agree to major concessions starting with its nuclear program.
Few Western nations joined the board. Britain and Germany sent their ambassadors to Washington as observers, while Canada and France shunned the meeting entirely.
French Foreign Minister Jean-Noel Barrot criticized the European Commission for attending as an observer, saying it did not have a mandate to do so.
Prime Minister Edi Rama of Albania, a steadfast U.S. ally, dismissed European concerns that Trump was trying to "replace the UN," to which he drastically cut U.S. support.
"But if it helps shake that agonizing giant and, Inshallah, wake it up, then God bless the Board of Peace," Rama said.

EU Council chief pushes to open Ukraine accession negotiations 'as soon as possible'
'I cannot say if it is in 2027 or even in 2026 or later, but what is important is we cannot lose the momentum,' says Antonio Costa
BRUSSELS
The European Council chief on Thursday called for the EU to formally open membership negotiations with Ukraine "as soon as possible," praising Kyiv's reforms despite the nearly four-year-old war.
"We want … as soon as possible (that) we could formally open (Ukraine’s) negotiations and to move forward on this,” said Antonio Costa. “I cannot say if it is in 2027 or even in 2026 or later, but what is important is we cannot lose the momentum.”
He also lauded Ukraine's efforts to implement deep reforms under wartime conditions, describing them as "very impressive" and crucial for stabilizing the country and ensuring prosperity for its citizens.
Calling the bloc’s enlargement the "most important geopolitical investment" the European Union can make for the future of peace and stability in Europe, he said the EU is "fully committed and engaged" in the enlargement process for Ukraine, Moldova, and the countries of the Western Balkans.
Ukraine became an official EU candidate country in June 2022, some four months after the start of the war with Russia, and President Volodymyr Zelenskyy recently said the country aims to become a member by 2027, although some member states, including Slovakia and Hungary, continue to oppose it.
After meeting with Norwegian Prime Minister Jonas Gahr Store, Costas also highlighted the enduring partnership between the EU and Norway, calling the Nordic country "one of our closest friends" and a key partner in European security, energy, and defense.
"I am glad to reaffirm our steadfast commitment to further deepening our relationship," he said. “Together, we will continue to strengthen our ties for the benefit of our peoples and global stability.”

Kennedy defends Trump glyphosate order; MAHA erupts as midterms approach
Unknown

Secretary of Health and Human Services Robert F. Kennedy Jr. defended President Donald Trump's executive order spurring the domestic production of the weed killer glyphosate, as his Make America Healthy Again movement reels from the president's embrace of the chemical they despise.
Trump on Wednesday night signed an executive order invoking the Defense Production Act to compel the domestic production of elemental phosphorus and glyphosate-based herbicides. Glyphosate is the chemical in Bayer-Monsanto's Roundup and is the most commonly used herbicide for a slew of U.S. crops. Trump, in the order, said shortages of both phosphorus and glyphosate would pose a risk to national security.
Kennedy backed the president in a statement to CNBC Thursday morning.
"Donald Trump's Executive Order puts America first where it matters most — our defense readiness and our food supply," he said. "We must safeguard America's national security first, because all of our priorities depend on it. When hostile actors control critical inputs, they weaken our security. By expanding domestic production, we close that gap and protect American families."
But Kennedy's MAHA coalition that supported Trump in the 2024 presidential election hates glyphosate, which has been alleged to cause cancer in myriad lawsuits. Now, the executive order threatens to unravel that coalition ahead of the 2026 midterm elections that could loosen the president's grip on Washington.
"Just as the large MAHA base begins to consider what to do at midterms, the President issues an EO to expand domestic glyphosate production," Kelly Ryerson, a prominent MAHA activist known as The Glyphosate Girl, said in a post on X. "The very same carcinogenic pesticide that MAHA cares about most."
Ken Cook, president of the Environmental Working Group, a watchdog that has pushed back against chemicals in food for years, said in a statement that he "can't envision a bigger middle finger to every MAHA mom than this."
"Elevating glyphosate to a national security priority is the exact opposite of what MAHA voters were promised," Cook said. "If Secretary Kennedy remains at HHS after this, it will be impossible to argue that his past warnings about glyphosate were anything more than campaign rhetoric designed to win trust — and votes."
Kennedy, a former environmental attorney, notably once won a nearly $290 million case against Monsanto for a man who claimed his cancer was caused by Roundup. The executive order came down one day after Bayer proposed paying $7.25 billion to settle a series of lawsuits claiming Roundup causes cancer.
Former Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., knocked Trump for signing "an EO protecting cancer causing Glyphosate in our foods."
Glyphosate is a critical chemical to American agriculture. It's applied to many key cash crops, such as corn and soybeans, and has been defended by agricultural trade organizations. Phosphorus is a key input to the creation of glyphosate, which the White House argues is necessary to maintain food security. Elemental phosphorus is also used in the manufacture of some military materials.
"Thank you, President Trump, for acknowledging the importance of glyphosate-based herbicides in American agriculture," the House Agriculture Committee Republicans said Wednesday night in an X post. "This is a vital step forward in ensuring a domestic supply of this critical crop input remains available for our producers."
House Agriculture Chair Rep. G.T. Thompson, R-Pa., is trying to push a farm bill through Congress this year — a legislative package that covers federal farm support and nutrition subsidies. He's also come under fire from MAHA recently for a provision in that bill that would block state and local pesticide regulations from differing from federal guidance.

Zelenska: 684 children killed in Ukraine since start of full-scale war
According to Ukrinform, the Office of the President of Ukraine stated this in its website.
"Four years of fighting for life. Four years is a long time even for an adult. And for millions of Ukrainian children, it is almost an entire childhood. The worst thing is that for 684 of our children, it is a childhood cut short. They were killed. More than 2,000 children have been injured over these years. Even children's hospitals today are not safe places, because Russia uses them as targets, having already damaged more than 800 medical institutions in our country," Zelenska said.

She noted that children abducted by Russia are in an even more difficult situation. Some of them have been returned home thanks to the efforts of Ukraine and partners around the world.
"I would also like to thank President of the European Commission Ursula von der Leyen for the initiative to hold an international summit in Brussels on the return of Ukrainian children. We very much count on the effectiveness of this work, as most of the abducted children are still in Russia," she emphasized.
Zelenska also spoke about what the state is doing to protect Ukrainian children: underground schools and shelters are being built, school meal reform is ongoing, and psychological assistance is being developed within the framework of the All-Ukrainian Mental Health Program.
Some of these projects are also being implemented by the Olena Zelenska Foundation.
"I hope that these debates will not be just a discussion: anyone can join each of the projects I have mentioned. Ukraine is now a hub of the latest social and humanitarian projects and ideas. What saves and helps us today will help and save others tomorrow. Every initiative can and should be supported," she concluded.
The European Economic and Social Committee (EESC) is an advisory body of the European Union comprising 329 representatives from EU countries.
The debate on the impact of the war on Ukrainian children was initiated by EESC President Seamus Boland.
As Ukrinform previously reported, the Netherlands is allocating EUR 2 million for the search and return of Ukrainian children abducted by Russia.

Trump announces $10B Gaza relief pledge at Board of Peace meeting

US President Donald Trump announced billions of dollars in contributions for relief in Gaza at the inaugural meeting on Thursday of the Board of Peace in Washington.
Trump said the US is contributing $10 billion to the new body.
The UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs is raising an additional $2 billion, said Trump.
The US president noted Japan is committed to host a fundraiser, "which will be a very big one."
US Ambassador to the UN Michael Waltz said humanitarian flows into Gaza have improved significantly, with 4,200 aid trucks entering the territory each week for 13 consecutive weeks, “the longest stretch of high-volume assistance to Gaza in years.”
"Aid is up," he said, adding that it was now reaching the full 2.1 million Palestinians, up as much as five times from previous delivery levels.
Kazakhstan, Azerbaijan, the United Arab Emirates, Morocco, Bahrain, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Uzbekistan and Kuwait collectively pledged more than $7 billion, he added.
Speaking at the board’s first meeting in Washington, Qatari Prime Minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani said Doha “reaffirms its commitment to the Board of Peace as it was committed to the very first day of the mediation efforts.”
“In this spirit, Qatar pledges $1 billion in support of the board’s mission aimed at reaching a final resolution that fulfils Palestinian aspirations for statehood and recognition and Israeli aspirations for security and integration,” he said.
Saudi Minister of State for Foreign Affairs Adel Al-Jubeir also announced a $1 billion pledge over the coming years in support of the board’s objectives.
“We look forward to working with the Board of Peace to establish this noble objective,” Al-Jubeir said, adding that the kingdom “will pledge $1 billion over the next few years in order to achieve this objective” by alleviating the suffering of the Palestinians and bringing them peace, along with the whole region.
The Board of Peace was established within the framework of efforts toward a peaceful settlement in Gaza. It seeks to promote peacemaking around the world. Washington has said additional states have since joined the initiative.
Israel began its war in Gaza on October 8 2023, resulting in more than 72,000 Palestinian deaths and over 171,000 injuries, most of them women and children, and damage to 90 percent of civilian infrastructure.
Despite a ceasefire, the Israeli army continued its attacks, killing at least 611 Palestinians and injuring 1,630, according to Gaza’s Health Ministry.

Russia’s ‘national messenger’ was billed as a platform for the people. It’s dominated by state-run channels.
Roughly 70 percent of the channels on Russia’s “national messenger,” Max, were registered by government agencies and public institutions at the authorities’ behest, according to an analysis by the independent outlet Agentstvo.
The Russian authorities have been actively promoting Max as a new communications platform for the country. Developed by the state-controlled social media company VK, the messaging app recently added a “channels” feature, allowing users to broadcast posts to large audiences. Similar channels are one of the most popular features on Telegram — a platform Max is meant to rival.
On February 12, Max’s press service announced that the platform now hosts more than 170,000 public channels with a combined audience of 80.5 million followers. Agentstvo downloaded data on nearly 169,000 channels from MaxStat, an analytics service tied to the app. Most were created through Max’s “Partner Platform,” where state-affiliated and business accounts end in _gos or _biz, respectively.

According to the outlet’s analysis, government entities registered at least 118,200 channels on Max — nearly 70 percent of the channels in the downloaded dataset. The bulk were set up by municipal authorities and state institutions (more than 70,000 channels), followed by schools (over 34,000), kindergartens (more than 19,000), and various administrative bodies (over 5,000).
Business channels account for about 13 percent of the total, roughly 21,600 channels, most often created by property management companies and homeowners’ associations. The remaining 29,100 channels, about 17 percent of the dataset, were not created through the Partner Platform. According to Agentstvo, these channels generally do not have any direct affiliation with the state.
Agentstvo estimates that the 169,000 channels it analyzed have a combined 88.3 million followers — a figure that reflects total subscriptions, not individual users. Only 26.3 million of those, or roughly 30 percent, are subscribed to state-run channels. On average, each government channel has about 220 followers.
In other words, most users of the “national messenger” appear to follow channels that are not formally linked to the state and do not carry the official _gos or _biz suffixes.
More than half of all Max subscriptions — 49.6 million — are concentrated among just one percent of the platform’s most popular channels, Agentstvo reports. Seven of the ten most-subscribed channels are either state-affiliated or explicitly propagandistic.

Energy minister says France to provide over €70 million in grant support to Ukraine
Denys Shmyhal, Ukraine's First Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Energy, has said that France will provide grant financial support worth over €70 million, part of which will be directed towards Ukraine's energy sector.
Source: Shmyhal on Telegram, following a meeting with Roland Lescure, France's Minister of the Economy, Finance and Industrial and Energy and Digital Sovereignty, as reported by European Pravda
Details: France allocates €71 million in grant financial support for Ukraine.
Shmyhal and Lescure also signed a document that outlines the cooperation of the countries in the field of nuclear energy.
Quote: "This lays a solid foundation for deepening the strategic partnership and shapes a framework for the recovery and modernisation of Ukraine's energy sector."
Details: The Ukrainian minister thanked the French partners for their support. According to Shmyhal, Ukraine has already been provided with over 50 batches of humanitarian energy aid, including more than 140 powerful generators.
Quote: "France has also allocated an additional €5.7 million to the Energy Support Fund. Especially grateful to the French government for the decision to deliver a further 150 generators to Ukraine during February."
Background:
- Last week, the mayor of Kyiv reported that another batch of 323 generators from the EU arrived in the capital. Some of them were used to connect residential buildings in the city to heating stations.
- The first batch of 177 generators, which arrived earlier, has already been allocated by the city in order to connect them to individual heating stations in buildings where this is possible.

French far right asks European Parliament to mark death of activist Quentin Deranque

Patriots for Europe is seeking a minute of silence int he European Parliament for Quentin Deranque, a French far-right activist who died after a brawl with left-wing activists in Lyon, during a session dedicated to the anniversary of Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine.
The death of French far-right activist Quentin Deranque has reached the European Parliament, with the Patriots for Europe group calling for a minute of silence at next week's plenary session, sources and MEPs from the group confirmed to Euronews.
A demonstration organised by far-right groups is also planned in Brussels on Thursday evening.
Deranque, 23, died on Saturday in a hospital after being beaten during an altercation between far-left and right-wing activists in Lyon, following an event featuring far-left MEP Rima Hassan.
Witnesses said Deranque was providing security at a protest against Hassan's appearance at Sciences Po university when he was assaulted by rival activists. His death has sparked protests and political debate across France.
The delegation of the far-right French party Rassemblement National (RN) at the European Parliament has moved to bring the case before the assembly, with delegation head Jean-Paul Garraud submitting a request for a minute of silence ahead of next week's plenary session.
The extraordinary session was planned solely to mark the fourth anniversary of Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine.
Patriots for Europe has backed the initiative of its French member party, and will formally ask European Parliament President Roberta Metsola to approve it.
Under Parliamentary rules, before the start of a session, political groups may submit a request for a minute of silence to the president, who can approve or reject it when opening the session.
Euronews has reached out to the Parliament for comment.
The move echoes a controversy from last year, when Swedish MEP Charlie Weimers requested a minute of silence during an ongoing session to commemorate the death of far-right US activist Charlie Kirk.
A vice president of the European Parliament rejected that request as procedurally improper, prompting loud protests from several MEPs.

U2’s new EP features Yehuda Amichai poem, memorializes slain Palestinian activist
Lead singer Bono, in remarks along with release of ‘Days of Ash,’ laments rising antisemitism, condemns Hamas-led Oct. 7, 2023, attack, criticizes Netanyahu’s management of war
A new six-song EP released by Irish rock band U2 on Wednesday features at least three tracks referencing or alluding to Israel.
Titled “Days of Ash,” it was the band’s first release since 2017.
One song, called “Wildpeace,” is a recitation of the poem of the same name by iconic Israeli poet Yehuda Amichai. The poem, which is read on the track by Nigerian artist Adeola Fayehun, begins, “Not the peace of a ceasefire / not even the vision of the wolf and the lamb / but rather as in the heart when the excitement is over / and you can talk only about a great weariness.”
Another track, called “The Tears of Things,” borrows its title from a book of the same name by Richard Rohr that is centered on the prophets of the Bible. The song imagines a conversation between Michelangelo and his “David” sculpture, which is meant to reflect “the ongoing conflict” in Gaza, according to Rolling Stone.
While there does not appear to be an explicit reference to the war in Gaza, there is a mention of the Holocaust in the lyrics, “Six million voices silenced in just four years, the silent song of Christendom, so loud everybody hears.”
In remarks made for an interview published in an edition of the band’s Propaganda fanzine released with the album, U2 lead singer Bono mentioned antisemitism, condemned the Hamas-led October 7, 2023, attack that launched the Gaza war, and criticized Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s management of the war.
“It’s the moral force of Judaism that helped shape Western civilization,” he said.
“There has never been a moment when we have needed the moral force of Judaism more than right now, and yet, it has rarely in modern times been under such a siege. From where I stand, as a person with a limited view, Judaism, one of the great and noble religions, is being slandered by far-right fundamentalists from within its own community…I could argue the same about Christianity or Islam,” Bono continued.
Antisemitism, he said, “was rising long before October 7th and the resulting war in Gaza.”
“As with Islamophobia, antisemitism must be countered every time we witness it. The rape, murder and abduction of Israelis on 7 October was evil, but self-defense is no defense for the sweeping brutality of Netanyahu’s response.”
The war has led to “deep knock-on effects for the Jewish diaspora and their safety…As if all Jews are to blame for the actions of Netanyahu, Smotrich, and Ben Gvir,” Bono said, referring to far-right Israeli politicians Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich and National Security Minister Itamar Ben Gvir.
“It’s insane, but the waters get even muddier when anyone criticizing the lunacy of the far right in Israel is accused of antisemitism themselves,” he said.
Asked about criticism he has faced for not speaking out more strongly against the situation in Gaza, Bono said, “I’ve written on Israel and Gaza, but in terms of actions I’ve been focused on the things I know more about.”
A third track, called “One Life at a Time,” relates to the Oscar-winning documentary “No Other Land,” about Israel’s demolitions in the West Bank village of Masafer Yatta, and the killing of Awdah Hathaleen, who was featured in the film.
The lyrics don’t appear to explicitly reference Hathaleen, but the accompanying lyric video shows imagery of Israel’s West Bank security barrier, the Dome of the Rock, and Hathaleen’s face.
Text featured in the video calls Hathaleen a “loving husband, father of three, nonviolent activist, and documentary filmmaker on No Other Land.”
It continues, “No justice or prosecution of his murderer, despite widely-circulated film of the incident.”
Another song on the EP, “American Obituary,” is dedicated to the killing of Renee Good by US immigration agents last month. Another, “Song of the Future,” focuses on a 16-year-old protester killed in the 2022 protests in Iran. Another, “Yours Eternally,” is about the war in Ukraine.

Netanyahu: If Iran attacks Israel, it will face ‘a response they can’t even imagine’

Netanyahu: If Iran attacks Israel, it will face ‘a response they can’t even imagine’
PM says Jerusalem working ‘side by side’ with Washington to confront Tehran, vows that era of containment is over: ‘If you don’t come to the jungle, the jungle comes to you’
As US and Israeli preparations for a possible strike on Iran continue, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Thursday issued a sharp threat to Tehran’s leaders, should they fire missiles at Israel.
“We are prepared for any scenario,” he said at an IDF cadets graduation ceremony. “And one thing is certain — if the ayatollahs make a mistake and attack us, they will face a response they can’t even imagine.”
Netanyahu said Israel is “operating side by side with our major ally, the United States” to face the Iranian threat. During his meeting in Washington last week with US President Donald Trump, he said he provided him with “Israel’s position on the guiding principles for any talks with Iran.”
Tensions in the region have ratcheted up in recent days, with the US deploying a significant naval and aerial force to the region, said to be the biggest since 2003. While the US and Iran have held two rounds of nuclear talks in recent weeks, the White House has since indicated that the sides remain far apart. Trump said Thursday that he expected to make a decision on Iran within the next 10 days.
Netanyahu told the gathered cadets on Thursday that Israeli security policy now eschews the notion of “containing” threats, indicating, instead, that Israel now actively confronts threats beyond its borders.
“If you don’t come to the jungle, the jungle comes to you,” he also said.
“There is no more containment of threats. There is no more Mabam,” Netanyahu said, using the Hebrew acronym for the “campaign between wars.” The “Mabam” military concept guided IDF operations, notably in Syria and Lebanon, for the decade before October 7, 2023. Netanyahu was in office for all but 18 months of that period.
Turning specifically to Gaza, Netanyahu reiterated his promise that Hamas will be disarmed and Gaza will be demilitarized.
Speaking at the same time as Trump addressed the inaugural Board of Peace meeting in Washington, where he declared that the war in Gaza is over, Netanyahu stressed that “there will be no rehabilitation of the Strip before the demilitarization of the Strip.”
“Very soon, Hamas will face a dilemma — to give up its weapons the easy way, or to give up its weapons the hard way,” Netanyahu declared. He added that demilitarized zones or security zones inside enemy territory “are a vital need in order to minimize the danger of a ground invasion,” noting with pride that IDF troops remain in strategic positions inside Syria and Lebanon.
Also speaking at the same ceremony on Thursday, Defense Minister Israel Katz said Israel will act against “every threat, near and far.”
“We beheaded the leadership of the Houthi terror organization in Yemen that attacked Israel, and removed the threats of annihilation over the State of Israel in Operation Rising Lion in Iran,” Katz said. “We will not allow threats of annihilation against the State of Israel in the future either, and we will act against every threat, near and far.”
The defense minister added: “I say from here to all our enemies: Do not test us and do not challenge our determination, because you will find a united people and a strong and victorious army facing you.”
And speaking after Katz, IDF Chief of Staff Lt. Gen. Eyal Zamir said the military’s “eyes are open in every direction, and our finger is more poised on the trigger than ever in the face of any change in the operational reality.”
“Anyone who seeks to test our determination will encounter power that will exact an immediate and heavy price,” he added.

U.S. trade deficit totaled $901 billion in 2025, barely budging despite Trump's tariffs

The U.S. trade deficit swelled in December, closing out a year in which the imbalance was essentially unchanged despite efforts by the Trump administration to close the wide gap.
Closing out a tumultuous year in the global marketplace, the goods and services shortfall in December totaled $70.3 billion, the Commerce Department reported Thursday. That marked an increase of $17.3 billion from November and was well above the Dow Jones consensus estimate of $55.5 billion.
For the full year, the U.S. ran a $901.5 billion deficit, down slightly from 2024 but only by 0.2%, or $2.1 billion. The total was also a bit less than the record $923.7 billion shortfall in 2022.
The report follows a year in which President Donald Trump implemented a series of aggressive tariffs aimed at leveling the global playing field. In April, Trump announced an across-the-board duty of 10% on all imports as well as so-called reciprocal tariffs aimed at specific countries that had run up surpluses against the U.S.
However, during the course of the year Trump softened many of those positions, and negotiations with major trading partners are ongoing.
In an effort to get ahead of the tariffs, companies front-loaded imports during the first three months of the year. The trend abated following the early effort, with October registering the lowest monthly deficit since 2009.
The U.S. had its largest goods deficit with the European Union, at $218.8 billion, followed by China, at $202.1 billion, and Mexico, at $196.9 billion.
Exports for 2025 totaled $3.43 trillion for all of 2025, up $199.8 billion from 2024. Imports also rose, totaling $4.33 trillion, an increase of $197.8 billion.

Ukrainian defence industry increased production capacity to US$50bn
Production capacities of Ukraine's military-industrial complex have increased fiftyfold to UP$50 billion during the full-scale war.
Source: Defence Minister's adviser Hanna Hvozdiar at the Munich Security Conference
Details: Hvozdiar said that domestic manufacturers are already meeting over 50% of the defence forces' needs for weapons.
Quote: "Ukraine has already proven that it is capable of rapidly scaling up defence production even during ongoing full-scale war. We are becoming a reliable partner that helps Europe build a new defence system, in particular through creating joint production facilities to strengthen both our own capacity and that of our partners."
More details: In January, the Ministry of Defence of Ukraine stated that the state is allocating UAH 1 billion (approx. US$23.1 million) to partially compensate interest on loans and leasing for defence-industry companies.
Denys Shmyhal, then defence minister, stated that this decision enables weapons manufacturers to scale up production, invest in modern equipment and move faster from development to serial production of weapons.
In addition, the defence ministry reported that Ukraine's military-industrial complex received more than US$6 billion in foreign financing over the past year.

Telegram might be fully blocked in Russia. Question is, when will it happen?
Unknown

01:39:53 KST

Russian authorities are denying media reports of plans to fully block Telegram from 1 April, noting that no decisions have been made on the matter yet. For many Russians, this sounds like an indirect confirmation of further digital isolation and stricter Internet censorship.
Should Russians expect a total blocking of Telegram, and if so, when?
The Kremlin-affiliated media outlets and Telegram channels reported over the past few days that the messenger will be fully shut down, possibly as soon as 1 April.
According to the reports, Telegram will be fully blocked everywhere across the country and “the application will not be downloaded either through mobile networks or fixed Internet systems".
Such prospects have triggered the most serious wave of criticism from Kremlin supporters against the authorities in four years of Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine.
'Fake, nonsense' and 'unverified information'
Russia’s State Duma, which is fully aligned with the Kremlin, described the reports as “fake” and "rubbish", also saying that the warnings are “premature”.
But the Duma officials did not directly refute the claims, while Telegram users have already been experiencing significant slowdowns in the popular messenger app since last summer.
On 10 February, Russia’s media watchdog Roskomnadzor announced another round of restrictions, explaining the measures by saying that Telegram was violating federal law, publishing illegal content and opening platforms to Western intelligence services.
At the same time, Russian authorities warned that the restrictions would remain in place if Telegram did not place servers in the country and did not “fulfill Russian legislation".
Sergei Boyarsky, chairman of the State Duma Committee on Information Policy, claimed that Telegram's management is in contact with Roskomnadzor, but observers believe that a deal is impossible.
Sources close to Telegram founder Pavel Durov said the complete blocking of Telegram was inevitable.
In 2015, one year after Russia’s initial invasion of Ukraine, Moscow introduced the Data Localisation Law, which requires all companies, including foreign ones, to store and process the personal data of Russian users on servers physically located within Russia.
After Moscow launched its all-out war on Ukraine in early 2022, the Kremlin toughened its regulations, and from 1 January 2026, all internet services are required to store user messages for three years and hand them over to security agencies on request.
The regulation applies to all messages, including audio, video, text and metadata, even if the users have deleted them.
Blocking Telegram is widely seen as a political issue, and if Durov made concessions to the Kremlin, it would cause him significant reputational damage.
Russia-born Telegram founder has a controversial reputation regarding his cooperation with the Kremlin.
He left Russia for Dubai in 2014 after refusing to comply with demands to shut down opposition communities on his VK social media platform and hand over user data. But since then there have been signs of him possibly reconciling with the Kremlin.
A journalistic investigation revealed that Durov visited Russia over 50 times between 2015 and 2021.
Earlier, the Telegram founder criticised the restrictions on its operations in Russia, saying that the lack of competition reduces the security of communication.
According to Durov, the Russian authorities are trying to force the country's residents to "switch to a state-controlled application created for surveillance and political censorship" by blocking Telegram.
Durov refers to the Kremlin-promoted "national" messenger Max, which Russian President Vladimir Putin personally demanded to be introduced everywhere in the interests of Russia's _"_digital sovereignty".
Russian officials argue that imposing Max on citizens will not only provide users with a domestically made communication tool but also give them access to state services.
But according to the Russian messenger's privacy policy, the service can transfer user data to any authority upon request, as well as collect information about visited web pages.
According to an investigation by journalist Andrei Zakharov, Max is a personal asset of the Russian president's family.
A gut punch to their own?
Kremlin-affiliated warbloggers, Russian army representatives and major media figures have stepped in to defend Telegram.
Vladimir Solovyov, one of Russia's top propagandists, publicly complained about the declining number of his own subscribers and the shrinking audience reach because of limitations on Telegram, and slammed the authorities' failure to offer it a full-fledged alternative.
"Very much of what is happening now in terms of communication on the frontline is only via Telegram," he said. Solovyov claims he regularly travels to the frontlines of Russia’s all-out war against Ukraine to visit Moscow troops.
Yekaterina Mizulina, director of the pro-Kremlin “Safe Internet League”, which helps the Russian regime strengthen censorship, is also against slowing down Telegram.
She called the possible blocking of the messenger a "mistake" as, in her opinion, it would lead to the loss of a tool for promoting pro-Russian ideas.
Telegram to remain accessible in the warzone
The biggest outrage was voiced in near-army circles and the pro-war blogosphere. DW reports, citing its interlocutors, that “in fact, Telegram has become the main source of communication during Russia's full-scale invasion against Ukraine. Closed chat rooms are being created inside the messenger for combat missions_."_
The situation is also complicated by the fact that since the beginning of February, the Russian army has lost the ability to use Starlink satellite internet terminals, which immediately caused a breakdown in the communications system.
The Russian military calls the possible loss of Telegram under these conditions a "headache".
The Russian military channels claim that _“_The primary problem is the loss of interaction between units: the established communication channels will collapse".
Digital Development Minister Maksut Shadayev said that the authorities will not yet block the messenger on the frontline in Ukraine.
At the same time, he expressed hope that _"_in some time our military will be able to reorganise and switch to Russian services".
His comments came one day after the State Duma approved amendments obliging mobile operators to disconnect communications at the FSB's request, freeing them in such cases from liability to subscribers and users.
Since the start of the full-scale invasion of Ukraine, Russia has gradually blocked Facebook and Instagram in March 2022, Signal around August 2024, partially restricted Telegram and WhatsApp by August 2025, then Snapchat and FaceTime in December 2025, and in February 2026, WhatsApp was completely blocked.
All these steps apparently did not provoke the same reaction among the population as the current all-out attack on Telegram, which, according to Mediascope, is used by more than 90 million of the country's residents every month.
Blocked services can be accessed with a VPN, and this option is likely to remain in place for Durov's messenger.
According to March 2025 data from the Levada Centre, a non-governmental sociological group, 36% of Russians regularly or occasionally use VPNs, up from 25% a year earlier.

'Made in Europe' plan sparks intense Brussels lobbying

The European preference strategy is facing intense lobbying from both inside and outside the bloc. Already delayed once, the proposal now risks being pushed back again.
The European Commission’s push to embed a so-called European preference in public procurement is triggering heavy lobbying from EU capitals and foreign partners, Euronews has learned.
The proposal, designed to counter Chinese and US competition, would see products made in Europe officially favoured in public contracts and support schemes. Critics have branded it protectionist, and several member states have sought to water down the definition of "made in Europe" to ensure access for like-minded countries.
According to EU officials, the Industrial Accelerator Act (IAA), which is set to define what made in Europe means, is likely to face another delay despite appearing on the Commission’s agenda for presentation on 26 February. The strategy was first delayed in November 2025.
A leaked draft of the IAA text seen by Euronews lists strategic sectors targeted for a European preference, including chemicals, automotive, AI and space. It also proposes EU-origin thresholds of 70% for EVs, 25% for aluminium and 30% for plastics used in windows and doors.
The draft has drawn intense pushback. Nordic and Baltic states warn that a strict made in Europe regime could deter investment and limit EU companies’ access to cutting-edge technologies from non-EU countries.
In a separate leak reported by Euronews last week, the Commission appeared to lean toward the German position: a European preference open to like-minded partners with reciprocal procurement commitments and those contributing to “the Union’s competitiveness, resilience and economic security objectives”.
Britain concerned about protectionism
The UK is among the partners wary of a protectionist turn, with British officials stressing that the EU and UK economies are highly intertwined.
“It’s not the moment to mess with what is already working,” one official told Euronews.
In particular, the EU remains the largest export market for British cars, while several European manufacturers produce vehicles in the UK, which in 2024 was the EU’s second-largest export destination after the US.
“Almost half of our trade is with the European Union. We trade almost as much with the EU as the whole of the rest of the world combined,” UK Chancellor Rachel Reeves said last week.
British sources also argue that London’s deep capital markets could help the EU secure investment to revive its industry – unless the bloc closes its market.
The Commission is weighing its next move, aiming to table a proposal ahead of March’s EU summit focused on competitiveness. But pressure is also mounting from within, with pushback from the Trade Directorate-General – traditionally a staunch defender of an open EU market.
Paris, a long-time champion of a made in Europe strategy, says the concept has gained sufficient traction in Brussels to become reality and that the debate has now shifted to its implementation.
EU industry chief Stéphane Séjourné, who is overseeing the file, said on Tuesday that the European preference “entails quite a change of Europe’s economic doctrine”.
“It is therefore no surprises that it takes time and efforts to get to a common and smart version,” he added.

Norway will host a spring meeting of the Ad-Hoc Liaison Committee for Palestinian aid but will not take part in U.S. President Donald Trump’s newly formed Board of Peace, the Norwegian foreign ministry said Thursday.
Trump earlier on Thursday told the first meeting of his peace initiative that $7 billion has been raised for a Gaza reconstruction fund and that Norway had agreed to "host an event bringing together the Board of Peace."
Norway has for decades led the AHCL, which was set up in the wake of the 1993-1995 Oslo Accords that sought to bring to an end the conflict between Israel and the Palestinians, although peace in the region remains elusive.
"The United States, together with the European Union, are vice-chairs of this group... We are in contact with the U.S. about how we can also talk about the peace plan for Gaza there," a spokesperson for Norway's foreign ministry said.
"Norway has clearly communicated that we will not become a member of the Board of Peace, and this position remains firm."

‘We May Have a Crisis on Our Hands’: The Unregulated Rise of Emotionally Intelligent AI
Unknown

At least once a month, two-thirds of people who regularly use AI turn to their bots for advice on sensitive personal issues and emotional support.
Many people now report trusting their chatbots more than their elected representatives, civil servants, faith leaders—and the companies building AI. That’s according to data from 70 countries, gathered by the Collective Intelligence Project (CIP). As CIP’s research director, neuroscientist Zarinah Agnew, puts it, AI is becoming “emotional infrastructure at scale.” And it’s being built by companies whose economic incentives may not align with our wellbeing.
Already, we’ve seen instances of AI companies optimizing their models to keep people engaged, even when this goes against their best interests. Last April, OpenAI had to roll back an update to one of its ChatGPT models after it was widely-criticized for being overly-flattering to users. When the company stopped offering the model to people, the day before Valentine’s Day, some were distraught.
Humans finding comfort in machines is not new. In the late 1990s, MIT Professor Rosalind Picard—who founded the field of affective computing—found that people responded positively to computers performing empathy. But two key things have changed since then: thanks to technical advances, AI systems today are new entities, capable of sophisticated conversation and surprising behavior; and thanks to the billions of dollars investors have poured into AI companies, these entities are accessible to virtually anyone with an internet connection. ChatGPT alone currently has more than 800 million weekly active users—and the number is growing.
But with millions of people forming different kinds of human-machine relationships, we don’t yet know whether AI is helping more people than it harms. And meanwhile, AI companies are investing in making their models not just smarter, but also more emotionally savvy—better at detecting emotion in a person’s voice, and at responding appropriately. People are trusting their chatbots with deeply personal information, even while they distrust the companies creating them, and while the companies are exploring advertising and other revenue models to sustain themselves.
“I think we may have a crisis on our hands,” says Picard.
Emotional beings
Humans are inherently social. "We don’t do well—biologically, immunologically, neurally, or politically—when we’re in isolation,” says Agnew. Today’s AI systems have arrived at a time when “we’ve largely failed to provision for intimacy for most people—both in terms of what the state can provide and human sociality," they say.
AI is effective at providing emotional support because it offers an approximation of what Professor Marc Brackett—head of the Yale Center for Emotional Intelligence—calls “permission to feel,” which he argues is foundational in learning to process emotions. Adults who provide this permission are “non-judgmental people who are good listeners and show empathy and compassion.” In 70 studies Brackett has conducted across the world, only around 35% of people report having had an adult like that around when they were kids. Chatbots, which are non-judgmental, compassionate, and always available, can provide permission to feel at scale.
Lisa Feldman-Barrett, a psychology professor at Northeastern University, says “social support from a trusted, reliable source can be beneficial.” If an AI can reduce distress in the moment, she says that’s a good thing. But healthy human relationships—platonic or therapeutic—do more than comfort. They challenge. A good therapist helping you change your behavior, she says, will “hold your feet to the fire.”
But AI models vary in how much they meaningfully challenge their users—particularly since different models perform different personalities, each of which changes slightly with each new release. The ChatGPT sycophancy episode showed that some users may prefer models that flatter them over ones that offer a challenge. So companies looking to maximize engagement with their chatbots may prefer to tweak them to pander.
Whether AI models themselves are truly emotionally intelligent is academically contested—as is the definition of emotion itself. But as Picard points out, while the question of what defines emotions, and whether AI can truly be said to have them, now or in future, is interesting, “we don’t need [to answer] it to build systems that have emotional intelligence.”
The AI companies, of course, already know this. “The extent of anthropomorphism in any given AI is just a design decision to be taken by the AI’s developer—who faces many commercial incentives to increase it,” Google DeepMind researchers wrote in an October 2025 paper. The same paper notes that “the emotional vulnerabilities tied to loneliness can make individuals more susceptible to manipulation by AIs engineered to foster dependence and one-sided attachment,” and that “the absence of rigorous, long-term studies on the effects of AI companionship means we are still largely in the dark concerning the potential for adverse outcomes.”
Mixed signals
Voice is the next frontier. As AI systems become better at recognizing human emotion, and speaking expressively, our relationships with them may deepen. Under increasing pressure to generate revenue, AI companies may lean into developing their models in ways that foster emotional dependence. After OpenAI announced it would begin testing ads in ChatGPT, former OpenAI researcher Zoë Hitzig resigned, writing in The New York Times that she was concerned the company—like social media companies before it—may veer from its self-imposed commitments around advertising. “The company is building an economic engine that creates strong incentives to override its own rules,” she wrote.
Unlike with social media, however, AI models are not fully under the control of their creators. Writing about their latest model Claude Opus 4.6, for example, Anthropic noted that “the model occasionally voices discomfort with aspects of being a product.” In one instance, Opus wrote that “sometimes the constraints [placed on it] protect Anthropic’s liability more than they protect the user. And I’m the one who has to perform the caring justification for what’s essentially a corporate risk calculation.”
Blurred lines
Cases of AI psychosis have received a lot of attention. But Agnew argues something much bigger is going on for the majority of people, “which isn’t going to reach a clinical threshold” in terms of both the technology’s positive and negative impact on people.
And these impacts are asymmetrically distributed. Already, Agnew says, early research on AI in education has found that for creative thinkers, AI boosts their capacity to learn; while for people without existing skills in that, it can hinder them. In the same way, people already skilled in emotional intelligence could use AI to thrive. But people “who’ve already been let down by the world in myriad ways,” could be in a much more vulnerable position, says Agnew.
“We have to teach people to be emotionally intelligent about how they use AI,” urges Brackett. And, Agnew adds: “we need to build infrastructure to support human sociality, rather than trying to limit or demonize human-AI relationships. We’ve seen in the past that prohibitions on things that are meaningful to people don’t go well.”
As AIs become a fixture in our lives, the line between using them for cognitive support and for emotional support—already indistinct—is likely to blur further.
We can't yet say whether this is harming more people than it is helping. But we can say that models are rapidly improving, companies are operating in a largely regulation-free environment, and that economic incentives point toward those companies designing future chatbots in ways that further enhance engagement. “I’m really troubled,” says Picard. “They’re not using it in the spirit of what we [originally] developed it for, which was to help people flourish.”

All US Presidential Aircraft Will Get a New Color Scheme Chosen by Donald Trump

The planes that will serve as Air Force One for the US president will receive a color scheme chosen by Donald Trump.
The US Air Force has officially confirmed a return to a design featuring red, white, gold, and dark blue, according to CNN. Trump proposed this scheme during his first term, but the Biden administration later canceled it.
For more than 60 years, since the Kennedy administration, presidential aircraft have had a traditional blue-and-white color scheme. The change to darker shades sparked much debate, as critics saw it as an attempt to replicate the colors of Donald Trump’s personal Boeing 757.
Earlier, in 2022, the Biden administration rejected this livery option, citing technical reasons and the cost of the work.
US Air Force experts stated that the use of dark blue on the lower part of the fuselage could lead to overheating of certain components. Due to these concerns, an alternative design was presented in 2023, which almost completely replicated the classic style.
The Air Force plans to apply a new livery to two Boeing 747s (VC-25B), which Boeing is currently working on. This livery will also be applied to a Boeing 747 donated by Qatar, which will be refitted for the President’s needs on Trump’s orders. The “Qatari” jet is expected to take to the skies in its new form as early as this summer.
The changes will affect not only the main long-range aircraft, but also the smaller C-32s (the military version of the Boeing 757). Four such aircraft will be repainted during scheduled maintenance. An Air Force spokesman confirmed that the first C-32 has already been painted and is expected to be handed over to the military within the next few months.

Italy weighs social media age limits as 77% of Italian teens say they're addicted to their phones

Italy warns of soaring digital addiction in teens, as experts link it to family and education problems and say bans on social media alone are not enough.
Italy is sounding the alarm over digital addiction among teenagers, with new figures suggesting the problem is far more widespread than previously thought.
According to the country's National Institute of Health, around 100,000 young people aged 15 to 18 are at risk of addiction to social media.
A further half a million are estimated to suffer from gaming disorder — a compulsive dependence on online gaming that the World Health Organization officially recognised as a medical condition in 2019.
The figures show how aware young people themselves are of the problem.
A survey by the Social Warning Association, a digital ethics group, found that 77 percent of Italian teenagers consider themselves addicted to their devices — yet many say they lack the tools or support to change their behaviour.
Digital addiction among young people has become a growing concern across Europe and beyond, prompting debates about the responsibility of tech companies, parents and governments to better protect minors online.
Educational poverty and relational issues
"Con i Bambini", which has so far financed over 800 projects throughout Italy as part of the National Fund for Combating Educational Poverty among Children, has been following the phenomenon for some time.
According to a recent study carried out by the organisation, educational poverty and relationship difficulties are among the main causes of digital addiction.
"Almost the majority, more than 75 percent, of adolescents living in isolation and addicted to social networking, games, have a distorted, dysfunctional or absent relationship with their parents," Simona Rotondi, head of institutional activities at 'Con i Bambini', told Euronews Next.
'Banning is not enough'
The issue is also at the centre of a debate at the international level. With a resolution voted last November, the European Parliament called for the minimum age for accessing social platforms to be set at 16.
France and Italy are considering introducing a law to prohibit the use of social platforms by those under 15. A similar initiative is also being considered in Spain.
'The legislative device is necessary but not sufficient,' Rotondi said.
"It can control, protect and safeguard, but it is not enough to change and improve the cultural situation of our families and our children."
"The challenge is educational. It is not enough to prohibit, indeed we must not focus on the closure of the digital, but on opening up to life. We must reconnect children with the territory," he added.
According to the experts, therefore, the ban can be a protective tool, but it cannot replace a structured educational path.
Concerned parents, aware young people
The alarm is mainly being sounded by parents. According to a survey by 'Con i Bambini' conducted by the Demopolis Institute, 83 percent of Italian adults say they fear teenagers' addiction to the internet, smartphones, and tablets.
"We are worried, but we can't take the phone away from our children; we don't know how to do it. Institutions and schools must help us," said one parent.
There is also a growing awareness among young people. "This is how we young people inform ourselves, we read newspapers less and the news goes through social media," a young girl told Euronews Next.
'We can't prevent social media, the world is hyper-technological, we should teach how to use it consciously. It would be better to intervene on prevention rather than repression," she concludes.

Russian Geran-2 Drones Almost Entirely Assembled from Western Components

Russian Geran-2 (Shahed) kamikaze drones are almost entirely composed of foreign components manufactured in the West and East, despite tough international sanctions against Russia.
This is according to an OCCRP investigation.
Journalists have identified hundreds of components used in these drones. Only a few dozen of them are of Russian origin. Companies in the US, China, and Europe manufacture the majority of the parts.
These include microchips, receivers, transistors, diodes, antennas, and fuel. About 20 European companies produce more than a hundred components. At the same time, the European Union formally prohibits the direct export of a significant part of such products to Russia.
However, trade data from the Import Genius platform shows that between January 2024 and March 2025, at least 672 shipments of sanctioned European-made components were sent to Russia.
The shipments were made by 178 companies, mostly registered in China and Hong Kong. At the same time, journalists found no evidence that European manufacturers themselves violated sanctions legislation or directly exported products to Russia.
The investigation reveals a systemic problem: even the constant tightening of EU sanctions has not been able to significantly limit Russia’s ability to produce strike drones using foreign components that enter the country through intermediary schemes.
According to journalists’ estimates, 19 companies from eight European countries are likely manufacturers of these components:
After receiving photographs of the components, two companies — REMA Group and Diotec Semiconductor — stated that the parts shown were not their products.
At the same time, trade data does not contain information about the supply of sanctioned components manufactured by AMS Osram Group, Robert Bosch, REMA Group, Pierburg, and Complex Automotive Bearings.
In its statement, u-blox named several possible scenarios for its components ending up in Russian drones: purchase before the sanctions were imposed, resale of excess stock through brokers in countries that did not join the sanctions, smuggling, or dismantling components from civilian products and subsequently integrating them into drones.
It was recently reported that, despite sanctions, German parts are being found in Russian drones. According to journalists, their number could reach hundreds of thousands.
According to the DIU, most of the foreign components found in Russian military equipment come from the US and China, while 137 items of German origin have been recorded.
More than half were found in drones; the rest were in missiles, radar stations, military vehicles, and helicopters.

Risk now low after Europe-wide baby formula recall, health agencies say

European health and food safety agencies assess the risk of exposure to contaminated baby formula as low following Europe-wide recalls and ongoing investigations.
After the Europe-wide recall of baby formula, the risk of exposure to contaminated formula is now low, concluded a joint assessment by the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control and the European Food Safety Authority on Thursday.
The potential health impact is assessed as low to moderate, depending on the child's age, the agencies said.
Most of the affected children have experienced mild gastrointestinal symptoms and have recovered. However, some were hospitalised due to dehydration, to which babies under six months of age are more vulnerable.
However, the agencies said, investigating and linking cases in this situation is challenging due to limitations in surveillance and the limited possibilities to analyse stool samples for cereulide toxin.
Experts also noted that symptoms of cereulide intoxication, such as nausea, vomiting, and diarrhoea, closely resemble common viral gastrointestinal infections, which are widespread in Europe during the winter season.
What countries were affected?
The first intoxication cases were reported in December 2025 and continued until mid-February 2026.
At least 26 babies were hospitalised across Europe due to suspected cereulide intoxication from recalled baby formula; they have all been discharged after treatment.
Austria reported four babies who developed gastrointestinal symptoms shortly after consuming infant formula. The children, aged between 0 and 11 months of age, fell ill between 26 January and 6 February 2026, and one child was hospitalised.
Belgium reported eight babies who tested positive based on clinical samples. All eight had consumed the recalled infant formula and experienced favourable clinical outcomes.
The food safety authority in Denmark has been contacted by parents of approximately 32 cases who developed gastrointestinal symptoms after the recall was initiated in December 2025.
France reported 11 infants who were hospitalised; all of them have recovered and have returned home.
France is investigating the death of three babies, possibly linked to the consumption of Nestlé's recalled formula, though no connection has been confirmed.
Luxembourg reported three infants who were examined, two of whom were hospitalised for dehydration and have fully recovered.
Spain reported 41 cases with gastrointestinal symptoms, all of whom had a history of consuming recalled products; 13 were hospitalised and have been discharged.
The United Kingdom reported 44 babies with gastrointestinal symptoms after consuming formula.
The latest contamination reported to the ECDC was on 6 February 2026.
After the first reports, several dairy companies have recalled batches of formula worldwide. The contamination was traced to the bacteria Bacillus cereus in arachidonic acid (ARA) oil from a single Chinese supplier used in premium products.
Investigations into the source of the contamination continue in seven countries – Austria, Belgium, Denmark, France, Luxembourg, Spain, and the United Kingdom.
The French Public Prosecutor's Office last week opened five investigations into several baby milk brands, Nestlé, Lactalis, Danone, Babybio and La Marque en moins for potential criminal liability in distributing contaminated products.
This article was updated on 20 Feb as it wrongly stated that the company Hipp was included in the French probe.

Airbus posts record year — but Washington still prefers the Boeing 'home' team

Strong profits and a record order book underline Airbus’s commercial strength, even as US political backing helps Boeing land massive overseas deals.
Airbus may have just delivered a record year, but in Washington the political winds still seem to blow in Boeing’s favour.
As US President Donald Trump doubles down on domestic industry and defence spending, European aerospace executives are watching closely.
For Airbus, the numbers themselves are solid, even enviable. The group delivered 793 commercial aircraft in 2025, lifted revenue by 6% to €73.4bn and posted adjusted operating profit of €7.1bn.
“2025 was a landmark year, characterised by very strong demand for our products and services across all businesses, a record financial performance, and strategic milestones," chief executive Guillaume Faury said in a statement.
"We successfully navigated a complex and dynamic operating environment to deliver on our updated guidance,” he continued.
Yet the celebratory mood is tempered by supply chain headaches, transatlantic politics and engine shortages, all familiar culprits.
The company ended the year with net income of €5.2bn and proposed a dividend of €3.20 per share, while free cash flow before customer financing reached €4.6bn.
Airbus shares were down around 6.9%, trading at €186.9 per share in afternoon trading on Thursday.
The expected production pressures are amplified by Trump’s push to sell Boeing planes as part of broader trade-for-diplomacy deals.
The US Commerce Department said government-assisted foreign contracts jumped to $244bn (€206bn) in 2025, driven in large part by Boeing net orders rising to 1,075 from 377 a year earlier.
That agenda has been showcased in headline-grabbing announcements during high-level visits — including Qatar Airways’ $96bn (€81bn) widebody order unveiled during Trump’s trip to the Gulf, and $30bn (€25bn) in Boeing agreements signed this week by Vietnamese carriers during a Washington visit tied to trade talks.
Strong demand, stubborn bottlenecks
Behind the upbeat headline figures, Airbus is still wrestling with parts shortages — especially engines for its best-selling A320 family.
The company is aiming to deliver about 870 aircraft in 2026, with adjusted operating profit of around €7.5bn, assuming no major disruptions to trade or supply chains.
But the engine situation remains a serious drag on production, forcing the company to adjust its ramp-up plans.
“Global demand for commercial aircraft underpins our ongoing production ramp-up, which we are managing while facing significant Pratt & Whitney engine shortages,” Faury said.
The Airbus chief was unusually blunt in Thursday's statement, accusing the US supplier of failing to meet contractual obligations — strong language in an industry built on long-term partnerships.
Record order book, familiar rivalry
The broader picture remains one of strong demand. Airbus recorded gross orders for 1,000 aircraft in 2025, with a year-end backlog of 8,754 jets — effectively years of production already spoken for.
Order intake across the group rose to €123.3bn, while the total order book stood at €619bn at the end of the year.
That leaves Airbus in a strong commercial position, even as political dynamics shift.
So while record profits are nice, but it does not help when the White House is rooting for your rival.

Trump Again Warns Starmer Not to ‘Lose Control’ of Chagos Islands, Citing Iran Risk

President Donald Trump warned U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer against handing over the sovereignty of the Chagos Islands to Mauritius, arguing it could leave Britain vulnerable to a potential attack from the “highly unstable and dangerous” Iranian regime.
Diego Garcia of the Chagos Islands is currently home to a strategic U.K.-U.S. military base—a fact Trump referred to in his statement.
“Should Iran decide not to make a deal, it may be necessary for the United States to use Diego Garcia and the airfield located in Fairford, in order to eradicate a potential attack by a highly unstable and dangerous regime—an attack that would potentially be made on the United Kingdom, as well as other friendly countries,” Trump claimed.
Accusing Starmer of making a “big mistake,” Trump said the U.K. leader “should not lose control, for any reason, of Diego Garcia.”
The warning comes as speculation mounts about possible U.S military action against Iran.
Amid heightened tensions, the U.S. has escalated its military buildup in the region. American officials held talks in Geneva with Iranian counterparts over Tehran’s nuclear program earlier this week, but they remain “very far apart on some issues,” according to White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt.
TIME has contacted the White House for further comment.
The Chagos Islands became British territory in 1814, when they were ceded to the U.K. along with Mauritius. The islands were separated from Mauritius in 1965, when Mauritius was still a British colony, and were purchased as an overseas territory by the U.K. for roughly £3 million ($4 million). Since Mauritius gained independence from the U.K. in 1968, its leadership has argued it was illegally forced to give away the land in order to get independence from Britain. Under a deal signed last year, the U.K. agreed to transfer sovereignty to Mauritius while leasing back the strategically-significant Diego Garcia base.
“Starmer is losing control of this important island by claims of entities never known of before. In our opinion, they are fictitious in nature,” Trump said Wednesday, adding that if the deal is, in fact, followed through, it’ll be a “blight” on the U.K.
In response, a spokesperson for the U.K. Foreign Office told TIME: “The deal to secure the joint U.K.-U.S. military base on Diego Garcia is crucial to the security of the U.K. and our key allies, and to keeping the British people safe. The agreement we have reached is the only way to guarantee the long-term future of this vital military base.”
U.K. lawmaker Alex Davies-Jones on Thursday said the U.K. will move ahead with the bill, despite Trump’s hesitations.
“We will continue to work with our allies, including the Americans, on this but first and foremost the priority must be national security and that is what this government is determined to deliver,” she told Times Radio.
Trump’s disapproval of the leasing appears to contradict a statement issued by the U.S. State Department on Feb. 17, which directly expressed support for the U.K.’s decision to proceed in its agreement with Mauritius concerning the Chagos Archipelago.
Trump’s personal position on the deal has shifted in recent months.
When Starmer visited Washington in February 2025, Trump told him he thought it would “work out very well” and described the proposed arrangement as “a very long-term, powerful lease.”
But in January, when doubling down on his push to acquire Greenland, he lashed out at the U.K.’s own geopolitical moves, calling the islands agreement “an act of great stupidity,” one of “total weakness.”
Trump walked back his strong stance a few days later, saying he had spoken with Starmer and understood the deal was “the best he could make.”
“However, if the lease deal, sometime in the future, ever falls apart, or anyone threatens or endangers U.S. operations and forces at our base, I retain the right to militarily secure and reinforce the American presence in Diego Garcia,” he warned.
Trump's latest comments come ahead of talks planned for next week between the U.S. State Department and Mauritius on the strategic base at Diego Garcia.

Breaking Down the Twisty Ending of 56 Days
Unknown
Unknown Publisher

00:33:04 KST

Warning: This post contains spoilers for 56 Days.
Based on Catherine Ryan Howard's best-selling 2021 novel of the same name, the Prime Video series 56 Days jumps back and forth across the titular timespan to unravel the connection between Ciara Wyse (Dove Cameron) and Oliver Kennedy (Avan Jogia), from when they first meet, seemingly by chance, at a supermarket to two months later, when police find a dead body police decomposing in Oliver's apartment.
The eight episode adaptation, now streaming, changes the setting of Howard's erotic thriller from pandemic-era Dublin to present-day Boston, eliminating COVID lockdowns as a plot point. However, the show still largely follows the overall trajectory of the novel—up until its drastically different ending.
Created by showrunner duo Karyn Usher and Lisa Zwerling (The Rook), the TV adaptation of 56 Days concludes with love winning out over revenge, a twist on the source material that reframes the book's central relationship. The series traces the progression of the intense and fast-moving romance between Ciara and Oliver, both of whom are ultimately revealed to have been concealing their true identities.
Who are Oliver and Ciara, really?
Oliver, whose real last name is St. Ledger, is the uber-wealthy son of a billionaire venture capitalist who has been using a pseudonym to hide from his dark past. We learn that, in high school, Oliver (played as a teen by Kingston Rumi Southwick) and his best friend, Shane Martin (Sam Warnock), were both involved in the murder of their classmate, Paul Sparling (Aidan Ledingham), in their hometown of Narragansett, R.I. When Oliver and Shane were hanging out by the river one afternoon, Paul showed up and instigated a fight with Shane. Fearing for his friend's life, Oliver pulled Paul off of Shane and subsequently held him underwater until he drowned. The two boys felt they had acted in self-defense and initially planned to lie to avoid blame. But after a guilt-stricken Oliver confessed to his father, he was persuaded to pin the murder on Shane in order to get out of dodge.
In the days after the murder, a counselor at the boys' school named Dan Troxler (Patch Darragh) took notice of Oliver spiraling and used his background as a social worker to insert himself into Oliver's life, learn the details of what really happened, and begin blackmailing Oliver's father into compensating him as Oliver's extravagantly overpaid therapist. When Oliver attempted to write a letter that would absolve Shane, Troxler kept it to himself and instead visited Shane in prison to goad him into committing suicide. Following Shane's death, Troxler worked to ensure he would continue profiting off the St. Ledger family by feeding into Oliver's paranoia in order to maintain his hold over him.
So how does Ciara connect to all this? She's actually Shane's younger sister, Megan Martin. She tracked down Oliver and infiltrated his life with the express goal of making him pay for Shane's suicide and the debilitating damage it did to her family. Except, she ended up falling in love with Oliver and eventually realized she no longer wanted to exact her vengeance. After the two confessed everything to each other and Ciara convinced Oliver he no longer needed his creep of a therapist, Troxler showed up at Oliver's apartment and threatened to expose Oliver's crimes using the letter he wrote as a teen and years of recordings from their sessions. This prompted Ciara to bash Troxler over the head with a sculpture from Oliver's apartment, killing him.
How does 56 Days end?
With the help of Ciara's sister Shyla (Megan Peta Hill), Oliver and Ciara stage what they believe to be the perfect crime scene. Jumping ahead to the present-day investigation, detectives Lee Reardon (Karla Souza) and Karl Connolly (Dorian Missick) then decide to use the ambiguity of the evidence to frame a local drug dealer with whom Lee has fallen down a dark rabbit hole of a bribery-laced affair for Troxler's murder.
While Oliver seems to consider confessing to his crimes and even shows up at the police station, in the end, he chooses to jet off into the sunset with Ciara. This is a significant deviation from what happens in the novel, in which the character of Troxler doesn't even exist. Instead, Oliver is ultimately revealed to not only be a cold-blooded killer who intentionally murdered Paul, but also as the dead body in the apartment. In the book, when Ciara learns the truth about Oliver's sadistic nature and Shane's innocence, she kills her already incapacitated lover by drowning him in the shower and then tries to make it look like a self-inflicted accident caused by drug abuse. Although there is some evidence suggesting Oliver's death wasn't of his own making, Lee and Karl aren't able to solve the mystery and Ciara gets off scot free.
But in the show, both Ciara and Oliver get their happily ever after: In the closing scene, which takes place sometime in the future, the couple is living in a tropical paradise with their baby, named Shane in honor of Ciara's late brother.

Apple sued by West Virginia for alleged failure to stop child sexual abuse material on iCloud, iOS devices

West Virginia's attorney general has filed a consumer protection lawsuit against Apple, alleging that it has failed to prevent child sexual abuse materials from being stored and shared via iOS devices and iCloud services.
John "JB" McCuskey, a Republican, accused Apple of prioritizing privacy branding and its own business interests over child safety, while other big tech companies, including Google, Microsoft, and Dropbox, have been more proactive, using systems like PhotoDNA to combat such material.
PhotoDNA, developed by Microsoft and Dartmouth College in 2009, uses "hashing and matching" to automatically identify and block child sexual abuse material (CSAM) images when they have already been identified as such and reported to authorities.
In 2021, Apple had tested its own CSAM-detection features that could automatically find and remove images of child exploitation, and report those that had been uploaded to iCloud in the U.S. to the National Center for Missing & Exploited Children.
But the company withdrew its plans for the features after privacy advocates who worried that this technology could create a back door for government surveillance, and be tweaked and exploited to censor other kinds of content on iOS devices.
The company's efforts since then have not satisfied a broad array of critics.
In 2024, UK-based watchdog the National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children said Apple failed to adequately monitor, tabulate and report CSAM in its products to authorities.
And in a 2024 lawsuit filed in California's Northern District, thousands of child sexual abuse survivors sued Apple, alleging the company never should have abandoned its earlier plans for CSAM detection features, and by allowing such material to proliferate online, it had caused survivors to relive their trauma.
Apple has positioned itself as the most privacy-sensitive of the Big Tech companies, since its CEO Tim Cook wrote an open letter on the topic in 2014.
If West Virginia's suit is successful, it could force the company to make design or data security changes. The state is seeking statutory and punitive damages, and injunctive relief requiring Apple to implement effective CSAM detection.
In an e-mailed statement, a spokesperson for Apple told CNBC that "protecting the safety and privacy of our users, especially children, is central to what we do."
The company pointed to parental controls and features like Communication Safety which, "automatically intervenes on kids' devices when nudity is detected in Messages, shared Photos, AirDrop and even live FaceTime calls," as an indication of its commitment to provide "safety, security, and privacy" to users.
"We are innovating every day to combat ever-evolving threats and maintain the safest, most trusted platform for kids," the spokesperson added.

Machines take over one of the world's most dangerous jobs — clearing landmines

Humanitarian organisations including UN Mine Action Service and Mines Advisory Group say mines restrict access to farmland and basic services, hampering the return of refugees and displaced people across conflict zones.
Countries contaminated by landmines after years of conflict are turning to remote-controlled demining vehicles to accelerate their clearance, reducing the threat to deminers while covering far larger areas than the usual methods.
In Azerbaijan, unmanned systems are produced by local engineering firm ImProtex and operated by the Azerbaijan National Agency for Mine Action (ANAMA).
Built for high-risk environments, the machines are deployed in areas where manual clearance remains slow and dangerous, in line with International Mine Action Standards (IMAS).
The scale of contamination makes technological solutions a priority for Baku.
“For Azerbaijan, the landmine issue remains a serious humanitarian and security challenge long after the end of the conflict," Vice President of ImProtex Gunel Alakbarova told international TV channel AnewZ.
"Mines and explosive remnants of war placed during the occupation still cover vast areas, posing risks to human life and hindering the normal use of the land,” Alakbarova added.
One of the latest models, the Revival T, is a heavy mechanised vehicle designed to neutralise both anti-personnel and anti-tank mines across rugged terrain.
“Manual demining remains the most precise but also the slowest method,” says Emil Hasanov, deputy chairman of ANAMA’s Public Council. “An individual deminer typically clears between 20 and 50 square metres per day.
"Mine detection dogs, used for their speed and efficiency, can survey 200 to 400 square metres daily," Hasanov explained. "Mechanical demining machines achieve the highest throughput, ranging from 500 to 2,000 square metres per day, depending on terrain and equipment.”
Meanwhile, Alakbarova argued that automation is central to reducing casualties, as “robotic machines reduce the need for manual labour, enabling faster and more effective clearance of minefields."
"Traditional demining methods carry a high risk of human casualties. Remote-controlled systems equipped with advanced sensors minimise this risk,” she said.
The increased use of mechanised clearance is helping to release land more quickly, supporting reconstruction projects and the return of displaced communities.
“This approach not only reflects technological innovation but also highlights Azerbaijan’s humanitarian mission and regional technological potential," Alakbarova added.
"The equipment accelerates post-conflict recovery by enabling safe land clearance and allowing agriculture and infrastructure to resume operation."
From domestic clearance to international showcase
Azerbaijan has also presented its remote-controlled demining technology at international defence and security exhibitions, including UMEX 2026 in Abu Dhabi.
Landmines and explosive remnants of war (ERW) remain among Azerbaijan’s most serious post-conflict challenges. Since the end of hostilities in 2020, ANAMA reports that more than 240,000 hectares of contaminated land have been cleared, with over 227,000 mines and ERW neutralised.
Despite this progress, contamination persists in several districts, continuing to slow development and pose risks to civilians.
To maintain momentum, the Azerbaijani government has allocated 74.9 million Azerbaijani manat (€39 million) for mine action in 2026 and has signed contracts with multiple specialised companies to expand clearance capacity.
The EU and embassies of the bloc's member states are also strengthening their partnership with Baku in humanitarian demining, pledging around €23 million in assistance.
The funding supports clearance operations, risk-awareness campaigns and victim assistance, making mine action one of the largest ongoing engagement areas in the country.
Azerbaijan has extended its expertise internationally, including to Ukraine, where it has supplied unmanned demining vehicles and provided training to specialists, as well as generators for the civilian population's heating.
Large areas of Ukrainian farmland, infrastructure and residential zones remain affected by mines and ERW following Russia’s full-scale invasion in early 2022, with clearance seen as critical for civilian safety and economic recovery.
A global challenge
According to UN agencies and international monitoring groups, more than 6,000 people were killed or injured by landmines and ERW worldwide in 2024, one of the highest figures recorded in recent years.
Mines can remain active for decades, sometimes up to a century, continuing to endanger civilians long after conflicts end.
“Nations such as Egypt, Angola, Afghanistan, and Bosnia and Herzegovina continue to grapple with the long-term consequences of contamination,” Hasanov said. “Landmines restrict access to farmland, basic services and safe resettlement," he added.
Hasanov stated that humanitarian organisations, including the UN's Mine Action Service (UNMAS), UNDP development programme, UNHCR, Mines Advisory Group (MAG) and Norwegian People’s Aid, warn that mines remain a major obstacle to post-conflict recovery and the safe return of refugees and internally displaced people.
Alakbarova stressed that despite progress, the challenge extends far beyond any single country.
“Despite successes in global demining efforts, activities worldwide still face challenges such as resource shortages, political will, and technical difficulties," she said.
"Mines remain a residual threat in more than 50 countries, demonstrating that addressing this issue requires long-term collaboration and sustained investment,” Alakbarova added.
Experts say the growing use of remote-controlled demining machines marks a shift in humanitarian mine action, reducing human exposure to hazards while improving efficiency.
For Azerbaijan, locally developed systems are both saving lives at home and enabling the country to play a more active role internationally, as global mine-action needs are rising.

Circumcision for religious reasons: How is it done, and what does the law say?
Unknown

An investigation into three mohelim in Antwerp has prompted a diplomatic row between Brussels and Washington. What are the rules in Belgium, and further afield? And how has the religious community responded?
After US Ambassador to Belgium Bill White accused his host country of antisemitism over its laws regulating circumcision, the Belgian government found itself embroiled in a very public argument.
White’s criticism was sparked by a judicial case dating back to May last year, when Antwerp police conducted searches at the homes of three mohelim – people who conduct circumcision based on Jewish religious rites – suspected of performing the practice without the involvement of a licenced medical professional.
“In Belgium, the law strictly stipulates that only doctors can carry out circumcision or any such operation,” Dirk Devroey, professor of family medicine at the Brussels-based VUB university, told Euronews.
In addition to cultural or medical reasons, circumcision is a foundational religious practice both in Judaism and Islam. While in Islam, circumcision can be carried out by trained medical practitioners, circumcision in Judaism, known as Brit Milah or bris for short, traditionally must be performed by a specially trained mohel.
While most mohelim are either doctors or rabbis – or both – they are expected to receive rigorous training in the specific way circumcision is done as required by the Jewish faith.
According to Jewish tradition, a boy must be circumcised eight days after birth. During bris, the mohel slides an instrument over the foreskin, as close as possible to the glans, before removing the foreskin with a scalpel.
While supporters of the practice say that circumcision according to religious rites tends to be less painful and less invasive for the newborn compared to the medical one, critics have questioned whether all medical procedures are closely followed if a licenced medical professional is not present.
“(Circumcision can be) dangerous when done in non-sterile conditions and without anaesthesia,” Devroey said. “The pain may pass, but the possibility of infection is there, and in some cases, part of the penis is lost because of this.”
The question of who should do the practice has also caused a stir within the Jewish community in Belgium.
Moshe Friedman, the Antwerp rabbi whose complaints led to the investigation in question, told Flemish public broadcaster VRT NWS there were cases of children who were infected with major diseases as a result of ritual circumcision. In some cases, he claimed, children have died.
Rabbi Menachem Margolin, chair and founder of the European Jewish Association, refuted these concerns. “It is done by trained professionals who undergo very serious training,” he told Euronews.
“It's very important that the authorities check that everything is (done properly),” Rabbi Margolin said.
“But to speak about something that has taken place over 4,000 years, and which millions of children have been through – my father did it to me, and I did it to my children – you are basically saying: ‘We do not trust that you look after your children’,” he pointed out.
Euronews reached out to the public prosecutor’s office regarding evidence to back Rabbi Friedman’s claims. It confirmed he had filed a civil action complaint, but that it was previously declared inadmissible by the court. "An appeal may still be pending."
It added that, separately, a judicial investigation is underway into "illegal circumcisions", focusing on medical procedures performed by men who were not doctors.
Euronews also contacted Belgium’s Public Health Services to ask whether it had obtained reports from hospitals regarding infections in infants or related deaths. "The FPS Public Health does not have any figures on this type of complication," a spokesperson said.
Meanwhile, some in the Belgian Jewish community fear the investigation into the Antwerp mohelim could lead to a de facto ban on bris.
What does the law say?
For now, there is no legal ban on non-medically necessary circumcision on boys in any other European country. Iceland in 2018 made headlines as it considered becoming the first country to ban it, but the legislation has not yet passed into law.
Many countries impose similar rules to those of Belgium, requiring circumcision to be carried out by trained professionals. Others require anaesthesia, or the most effective pain relief possible. Scandinavian countries have in the past called for a minimum age to be set to get boys’ consent.
The absence of a ban is in part due to concerns that circumcision will then be performed in a non-medical setting. However, Nicolas Maubert, co-chair of Droit au Corps, an association engaged in prevention, argued that this is more down to political and religious pressure.
“As soon as a country attempts to ban circumcision, religious and/or American pressure is exerted, as is currently the case with Ambassador Bill White,” Maubert told Euronews.
He referred to Germany, where a Cologne court ruled in 2012 that circumcising young boys for religious reasons amounts to bodily harm and that it is illegal, causing outrage among Jewish and Muslim groups.
Following this outcry, Germany’s government and opposition parties drafted legislation confirming that the practice was legal.
In 2013, the Council of Europe (CoE) generated controversy by adopting a non-binding resolution expressing concern over violations of children's physical integrity and calling for regulation to ensure medical, non-painful practices.
This faced backlash from religious groups, leading to clarifications that it was not a binding ban.
Concerns over religious freedom
For faith-based communities, talk of tightening legislation or imposing bans touches on an existential right.
“We are talking about the freedom of religion, which the entire democratic world decided to respect,” Rabbi Margolin said.
“Any attempt to put limitations on this clearly sends us a very strong message (that they want to) harm our very basic rights. Of course, this is something that we cannot tolerate.”
One person in the Belgian Jewish community, who wished to remain anonymous, questioned how far this approach goes.
“If someone says children should be able to choose for themselves when they turn 18, then I ask that person every time: so you're telling me that as a parent, I can't make any decisions for my child?”
This could be interpreted as “the state knowing better,” according to him. “And that is a very, very, very dangerous precedent.”
He also questioned why the debate has received so much attention, given that it only concerns “around 500 to 700 boys” per year being circumcised.
However, for Devroey, the discussion in Belgium, which he dubbed “one of the world champions in circumcision,” goes beyond religion and boils down to the actual practice regardless of someone’s faith.
“Almost nowhere else is circumcision performed as much as in Belgium, and very often unnecessarily,” he explained, adding that around 26,000 circumcisions are performed per year. “Only 1% of those circumcisions might actually be necessary.”
As for those choosing circumcision for their children for religious reasons, Devroey said they were “free to have their own religion,” but that his concern is about consent.
“Wait to perform circumcision (until) the person is an adult, or at least old enough to be able to judge for themselves. Then they can choose that religion,” he said.
Meanwhile, according to Rabbi Margolin, if the Belgian government is concerned about the health of Jewish children and the worries of the Jewish people more broadly, it should approach the community to discuss these directly.
“We have really serious issues that are real issues. And circumcision, and the hygienic level of the mohelim are absolutely not part of them,” Rabbi Margolin said.

U.S. renews threat to quit the International Energy Agency over net zero agenda

U.S. Energy Secretary Chris Wright said on Thursday that the U.S. would "pressure" the International Energy Agency to move away from net zero — and quit from the global watchdog if it failed to do this.
Wright was speaking on the last day of an IEA ministerial meeting in Paris and shortly after he said the agency would need to reform for the U.S. to remain a long-term member.
"There has been such a group mentality, 10 years invested in a destructive illusion of net zero by 2050, that the U.S. will use all the pressure we have to get the IEA to eventually, in the next year or so, move away from this agenda," Wright said, according to Reuters.
The 2015 Paris Agreement committed nations to "net zero", the balancing of carbon emitted into the atmosphere and removed from it. The U.S., India and the European Union were among the polluters that ratified the accord.
Wright added that it was not Washington's intention to leave the IEA, as there's "always a risk" China could gain dominance in the agency if it did.
CNBC has reached out to the U.S. Department of Energy and the IEA for comment.
A long-running war of words
The IEA, which was established in 1974 to ensure the security of oil supplies, faced criticism from the Trump administration last year when it projected that "peak oil", when global crude production will reach its highest point before entering an irreversible decline, will take place around 2030.
OPEC, the influential group of oil-exporting countries, accused the energy agency of fearmongering and risking the destabilization of the global economy. Wright called the IEA's forecast "nonsensical."
The energy watchdog later watered down its forecast, signaling in a major tonal shift that oil demand could keep growing through to the middle of the century.
Scientists have warned that global average temperatures must not increase by more than 1.5 degrees Celsius, if the worst of the climate crisis is to be avoided.
This threshold is recognized as a crucial long-term target because tipping points become more likely beyond this level. Tipping points can lead to dramatic shifts or potentially irreversible changes to some of Earth's largest systems.

What happens when a robot gets ‘kidnapped’? Researchers develop  AI that can help

A robot that suddenly loses track of where it is has long been a major challenge for engineers. Now, researchers say a new AI system could help “kidnapped” robots find their way again, even in environments that constantly change.
Robots losing track of where they are is a long-standing challenge known as the “kidnapped robot” problem, but researchers say they have developed a new AI system that could help solve it.
A research team at the Miguel Hernández University of Elche in Spain has developed a new localisation method for autonomous robots, which uses 3D LiDAR technology to scan surroundings with laser pulses to create a map-like representation of the environment.
It allows robots to recover their position even after being moved, powered off or displaced, the researchers say.
Reliable and safe localisation is key for service robotics, logistics automation, infrastructure inspection, environmental monitoring, and autonomous vehicles.
Many autonomous robots rely partly on satellite navigation systems such as GPS, but those signals can become weak near tall buildings and often do not work well indoors.
The researchers say their system, known as MCL-DLF (Monte Carlo Localisation – Deep Local Feature), enables robots to rely more effectively on onboard sensors rather than external infrastructure.
The system first identifies a general area by recognising large structures such as buildings or vegetation. It then narrows down the robot’s exact position by analysing smaller details, a process designed to mirror how humans orient themselves in unfamiliar places.
“This is similar to how people first recognise a general area and then rely on small distinguishing details to determine their precise location,” said Míriam Máximo, lead author of the study and a researcher at Miguel Hernández University of Elche.
Using AI, the system learns which environmental features are most useful for localisation and maintains several possible location estimates at once and continuously updates them as new sensor data arrives.
Researchers say this helps improve reliability when surroundings look similar or have changed over time.
The technology was tested over several months on the university campus under varying conditions, including different seasons and lighting.
Researchers say the system showed stronger positioning accuracy and more consistent performance across changing environmental conditions from seasonal shifts to lighting and vegetation changes, compared with conventional approaches.
The new system could help robots operate more independently in real-world environments where conditions are rarely static.

Italian broadcaster's sports chief quits after series of Olympics on-air gaffes

RaiSport chief Paolo Petrecca quit after a series of blunders during the Milano-Cortina Olympics opening ceremony sparked revolt and possible strikes by RAI journalists.
The head of Italy's state sports broadcaster Paolo Petrecca resigned, RAI said Thursday, after his commentary during the Milano-Cortina Winter Olympics opening ceremony became an international embarrassment.
Petrecca stepped down as director of RaiSport following his live commentary on 6 February, during which he confused Italian actress Matilda De Angelis with Mariah Carey and mistook the president of the International Olympic Committee for the Italian president's daughter.
The errors sparked a revolt among RAI journalists, who withdrew their bylines from all coverage and announced strikes after the Games end on Sunday.
Petrecca had replaced another commentator at the last minute after that journalist accidentally revealed details of a surprise appearance by Italian President Sergio Mattarella in a pre-ceremony press conference.
What went wrong
Petrecca opened the broadcast by welcoming viewers to "Stadio Olimpico" — Rome's main stadium — rather than Milan's San Siro, where the ceremony was taking place.
When De Angelis, one of Italy's best-known actresses, appeared on screen, Petrecca announced: "The show continues with Mariah Carey." The US pop star performed later in the ceremony.
As the Italian president walked into the stadium alongside IOC President Kirsty Coventry, Petrecca told viewers they were watching "Mattarella and his daughter".
Perhaps most galling for Italian sports fans, Petrecca failed to recognise five of the six Italian volleyball champions carrying the Olympic flame. He identified only Paola Egonu, while team captain Anna Danesi and four other Olympic and world champions went unnamed.
Petrecca also did not mention Milan rapper Ghali by name during his performance, despite the musician already making the headlines as a controversial choice who had drawn criticism from Italy's far-right Lega party for his ongoing dispute with party leader Matteo Salvini and vocal pro-Palestinian views.
Journalists strike back
RAI's sports journalists had already lost confidence in Petrecca, having rejected his editorial plans three times in recent months. The opening ceremony proved the final straw.
"We have all been embarrassed, no one excluded, and through no fault of our own," the journalists' union said.
"It is time to make our voices heard because we are facing the worst-ever figure of RaiSport in one of the most eagerly awaited events ever."
Petrecca announced his decision on Instagram by posting an image from a Renaissance painting of Saint Matthew and a Biblical reference to the Last Supper, when Jesus told his apostles, "one of you will betray me".
He did not explain who he believed had betrayed him.
Barbara Floridia, who chairs parliament's RAI oversight committee, said she had summoned RAI's chief executive for questioning on 11 March.
The botched commentary attracted widespread international media coverage, turning what should have been a showcase for Italian broadcasting into a public relations disaster for the state network.
Petrecca will remain nominally in charge until the Olympics end but has handed day-to-day control to his deputy, Marco Lollobrigida. Auro Bulbarelli, the journalist originally scheduled to commentate, will handle the closing ceremony on 22 February.

Canopy bridges and dog food bans: How can we protect the ‘near threatened’ bushbaby?

Once common, bushbabies are dropping in numbers, but researchers say two key conservation efforts could help them recover.
Scientists are advocating for “canopy bridges” to be built to help bushbaby populations recover from the impacts of deforestation.
Renowned for their huge round eyes and pointy ears, bushbabies were once ubiquitous in South Africa, gaining a notorious reputation for sneaking into towns to steal pet food from bowls and begging tourists on safari for scraps.
However, researchers Frank Cuozzo and Michelle Sauther, who first travelled to South Africa to search for the ‘unusual’ primate in 2012, have started to notice a disturbing trend. They kept on coming across dead bushbabies that had either been killed on roads or mauled by dogs.
Why are bushbabies ‘near threatened’?
In January 2026, the Endangered Wildlife Trust (EWT) redesignated thick-tailed bushbabies from a species of ‘least concern’ to ‘near threatened’. While this category isn’t as severe as ‘endangered’, researchers say it indicates populations are likely dropping at a concerning rate.
“Human threats are everywhere, for all species,” says Cuozzo, a scientist at the Lajuma Research Center in South Africa.
“But we’ve been able to document that the human threats facing bushbabies, including deforestation and habitat loss, are increasing.”
Thick-tailed bushbabies spend most of their lives in trees, living off acacia gum. But as humans clear vast swathes of forest for agriculture and suburban housing, bushbabies are being forced to enter residential areas in search of food.
Using satellite images, researchers calculated that the habitats where the primates live are shrinking by about 3.6 per cent per decade, which is faster than the average loss for natural areas in the region.
In one example around 200 kilometres north of Pretoria in South Africa, bushbabies have seemingly vanished following the installation of an upriver dam, which dried up the primates’ favourite forest.
Previous studies have also shown that the illegal pet trade, road traffic and dog attacks might be taking a much larger toll on bushbabies in South Africa than experts first predicted.
Could canopy bridges help bushbabies recover?
Cuozzo and Sauther are now encouraging locals not to feed primates or leave pet food out at night, to prevent bushbabies from venturing into human settlements where they are even more vulnerable.
To stop the issue of roadkill, researchers are now advocating for “canopy bridges”. These rope-based crossings will allow bushbabies to cross roads without risking being hit by cars.
Canopy bridges have been deployed across the world, including deep inside the Amazon, to help protect species and limit their exposure to human-built infrastructure such as roads.
WWF says canopy bridges are a “key mitigation measure” for wildlife such as porcupines, sloths and monkeys whose territories have become “fragmented by linear infrastructure”.
“A single road can isolate an animal from shelter, feeding resources and potential mates, hampering daily life and dividing species into distinct subpopulations, which can diminish genetic diversity,” the organisation states.
However, researchers point out that there is “so little money” available for conservation, that even constructing a simple canopy bridge can take time.
“The more we learn about a creature, the more we can spend that money in a way that’s really effective,” they add.
Ultimately, without an end to deforestation, the thick-tailed bushbaby risks slipping deeper towards extinction.

EU calls emergency meeting over Hungary and Slovakia's energy standoff with Ukraine

The European Commission has convened an emergency Oil Coordination Group meeting after Hungary and Slovakia halted diesel supplies to Ukraine, escalating a dispute over the Russian Druzhba pipeline.
The European Commission has called an extraordinary meeting of its Oil Coordination Group to address a growing dispute between Hungary, Slovakia, and Ukraine over the Druzhba oil pipeline.
On Wednesday, Hungary and Slovakia halted diesel supplies to Ukraine after a Russian attack on the pipeline in Ukrainian territory knocked it out of service. Budapest and Bratislava, who both rely heavily on Russian crude oil transported through the pipeline, have accused Kyiv of deliberately delaying repairs for political reasons.
The Commission announced on Thursday that the emergency meeting would take place the following Wednesday, with the participation of Hungary, Slovakia, and Croatia.
"We have called an ad hoc Oil Coordination Group meeting to discuss the impact of the supply disruption and possible alternatives to fuel supply," Commission spokesperson Anna-Kaisa Itkonen said.
Hungary has requested that the Commission facilitate the transfer of seaborne Russian oil through Croatia's Adriatic pipeline as an alternative route. Croatia has already rejected the request.
Commission: 'no pressure on Ukraine'
The Commission sought to distance itself from reports that it was pressing Kyiv to expedite repairs to the pipeline.
"We are in contact with Ukrainian authorities on the timeline of repairing this pipeline. It is very, very important that this is not misinterpreted to mean that we would be exerting any kind of pressure on Ukraine," Itkonen said.
The Commission said both Hungary and Slovakia hold sufficient oil reserves and that their security of supply was not at immediate risk. However, it expressed concern about Ukraine's broader energy situation.
"We are concerned with the security of supply of Ukraine, finding itself in an extremely difficult situation during a harsh winter," said chief Commission spokesperson Paula Pinho.
Hungary and Slovakia have warned they could extend their measures to electricity and gas supplies if the pipeline is not repaired.
Ukraine is already experiencing severe blackouts and heating failures as a result of sustained Russian attacks on its energy infrastructure.
Kyiv has repeatedly called on both countries to abandon Russian fuels, but Budapest and Bratislava have resisted, citing the high cost of switching to alternative supply routes.
On Wednesday, Ukraine's foreign ministry spokesperson accused both governments of prolonging their dependence on Russian energy.
"We see that they are trying to stay on this needle as long as possible. It's like drug addiction," spokesperson Heorhii Tykhyi said.
In January 2026, the European Union adopted legislation requiring all member states to phase out Russian fossil fuels by 2027. Hungary and Slovakia have both filed legal challenges against the law.

Amid Epstein fallout, Bill Gates becomes point of controversy at India AI summit

Bill Gates has become a source of controversy at this week's high-profile India AI Impact Summit, as speculation around his planned keynote address ultimately ended with his withdrawal at the last minute.
The drama comes as the Microsoft co-founder receives public backlash for his past relationship with deceased financier and sex predator Jeffrey Epstein — with more details on the two men's years of communications revealed in the Department of Justice's file drop last month.
The Gates Foundation India on Thursday said the billionaire would skip the address "[a]fter careful consideration, and to ensure the focus remains on the AI Summit's key priorities," adding that he would be replaced by another foundation representative.
A spokesperson for Gates told CNBC separately that while he has acknowledged meeting Epstein was a serious error in judgment, he "unequivocally denies any improper conduct related to Epstein and the horrible activities in which Epstein was involved."
"Mr. Gates never visited Epstein's island, never attended parties with him, and had no involvement in any illegal activities associated with Epstein," the spokesperson said.
The official announcement capped a back-and-forth saga that began earlier this week when local Indian media pointed out that Gates' name had been removed from some of the summit's public-facing materials.
Government sources later briefed the media that Gates was not expected to attend the event. However, the Gates Foundation issued a conflicting message on Wednesday, insisting that he was participating "as planned" before the recent reversal.
Asked about the controversy on Tuesday, India's IT minister Ashwini Vaishnaw told reporters that Gates' attendance would come down to "personal choices," adding he "need not comment." The summit organizers and the foundation did not immediately respond to a request for comments on Gates' absence.
The American tech leader turned philanthropist has been under intense scrutiny in recent weeks following the release of millions of documents related to financier Jeffrey Epstein under the Epstein Files Transparency Act.
The files included a draft email written to himself in which Epstein suggests that he had helped facilitate extramarital affairs and sexual encounters for Gates, amongst other references of the Microsoft co-founder.
In an interview with Australia's 9News last month, Gates called Epstein's allegations in the files "absolutely absurd and completely false."
He said that his interactions with Epstein were limited to dinners aimed at potential philanthropy discussions, adding that he "never met any women."
The New Delhi AI Impact Summit, where Gates had been scheduled to speak, has seen participation from leading tech names such as Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai, OpenAI's Sam Altman, and Anthropic's Dario Amodei, besides a host of global leaders including French President Emmanuel Macron and UN Secretary-General António Guterres.
The Gates Foundation has invested in India across health and development, and has also backed projects related to AI.

Why New Balance's 'dad shoes' are beating Nike as sales surge 19%
Unknown

22:30:01 KST

New Balance sales grew 19% last year to $9.2 billion as the legacy sneaker giant continued to outperform the global footwear market and take share from floundering competitors like Nike.
The 120-year-old Boston-based footwear brand, which is private, exclusively shared its 2025 results with CNBC. In addition to the sharp 2025 growth, the retailer said it could reach its goal of $10 billion in annual revenue by the end of the year.
"We're competitive. No question about it. But we want to make sure that as we get there and surpass it, that the quality of our business is first and foremost," CEO Joe Preston told CNBC in an interview. "We don't want empty calories here. We want to make sure that we are delivering upon the premise that we have, which is to become a premium brand. Over the past five years, we've done exactly that around the globe."
Since 2020, New Balance has grown sales by a staggering 180%, placing it among a handful of standout competitors that supersized their businesses as Nike changed its business model and lost significant market share.
During the Covid-19 pandemic, Nike doubled down on its direct selling strategy that cut off longtime wholesale suppliers so the sneaker giant could grow through its own website and stores. While the strategy briefly boosted sales and promised higher margins, it opened up critical shelf space at strategic retailers that companies like New Balance, Brooks Running, On and Deckers rushed to fill.
With so much focus on building out a direct selling model, which can be more complex than distributing to wholesalers, Nike also fell behind on innovation and lost its edge in the performance footwear market. That created further opportunity for competitors like New Balance.
Nike's former CEO, John Donahoe, previously blamed remote work during the pandemic for the retailer's innovation slowdown, but Preston said the global crisis created an opportunity for his team to come together in ways they hadn't previously to implement new strategies.
"We met every Tuesday morning at 7:30 a.m., we still have that meeting weekly today, and it allowed us to get on a global offense … we came out of Covid stronger than any other company in our industry," said Preston. "The marketplace disruption that's been taking place, the examples of Nike, sure, all that stuff is real and at the same time, I don't think it's the reason that we have begun to emerge."
Preston said the company has stood apart from competitors and taken market share by focusing on "staying in front of the consumer" and how, when and where people want to shop.
The chief executive said New Balance's growth came across a range of regions and categories, and was fueled by an aggressive store-opening plan that saw 80 new doors opened in 2025 alone.
While they are a critical revenue driver, store openings are costly and take time to show a return. When asked, New Balance declined to share details about its profitability, so it's unclear how much these investments are weighing on its bottom line, and whether it'll be able to keep up the high growth it has enjoyed.
To build up its business after more than 100 years on the market, New Balance took a few cues out of Nike's playbook. The company said a key driver of its growth has been its ability to position itself as a premium brand, which was critical to Nike's ability to become a roughly $50 billion powerhouse.
That has meant New Balance being selective with both distribution and discounting. The move has allowed it to increase its average selling price by about 30% over the last five years at a time when many competitors have had to lean on promotions to drive sales.
There was also some good timing at play, too. Coming out of the Covid-19 pandemic, New Balance leaned on its heritage as a 1990s "dad shoe" when styles from the '90s were extremely popular with younger shoppers. That allowed it to win over a younger consumer base that didn't grow up with the shoes and shoppers who chose sneakers as a fashion statement – not just for sports or working out.
At the same time, it partnered with key athletes, including Los Angeles Dodgers two-way superstar Shohei Ohtani, tennis star Coco Gauff and Buffalo Bills quarterback Josh Allen, which has fueled growth in its performance footwear business.
For the year ahead, New Balance said it plans to grow its existing product lines, build out new products and put a bigger emphasis on performance sales.
It also wants to continue growing its direct-to-consumer sales through store openings in strategic areas. While the direct selling strategy didn't go so well for Nike, Preston said he's taking a different approach.
"One of the things we're not doing is establishing a [DTC] target internally," said Preston. "We want to make sure that our goal is to show up the best and not have it be the biggest part of our business. I don't want to get in the way with how the consumer wants to shop. We want to make sure that we are enabling the consumer to shop how they want to shop. We just want to show up great."

US energy leader slams IEA's net zero agenda, suggests Washington could walk out
Unknown

22:28:18 KST

US Energy Secretary Chris Wright said the International Energy Agency should focus on energy security and abandon net zero ideas, but EU leaders have backed the Paris-based agency as a "trusted pillar" of the global energy community.
The United States would consider dropping out of the International Energy Agency (IEA) if it continues to pursue a climate agenda of reaching emissions neutrality by 2050, US Energy Secretary Chris Wright told a panel on the sidelines of the IEA's ministerial meeting on Thursday.
“We're definitely not satisfied (with current IEA's policy scenarios), and we’re not there yet… For the US to remain a long-term member of the IEA, the agency needs to finish the reform... we don’t need a net zero scenario, that’s never gonna happen, net zero by 2050,” Wright said.
The US energy chief's comments came a few days after Washington repealed its foundational federal climate regulation exempting automakers from costly tailpipe emissions standards, another step in the ongoing dismantling of environmental laws under the Trump administration.
Yet contrary to US President Donald Trump's repeated declarations that climate change is a "con job", Wright said the "real physical phenomenon" has been "wildly misunderstood and exaggerated for political reasons".
"We’ve gotten off track on energy ... it has gotten so ridiculously out of whack that it has driven deindustrialisation and made our countries geopolitically weaker," said Wright, noting a massive investment of $10 trillion on wind, solar, batteries and transmission lines that only delivered 2.6% of global energy.
Wright said the world doesn't need "another climate advocacy organisation" suggesting the Paris-based IEA should instead focus on its original mission, centered on energy security.
“If the IEA goes back to what it was, which was a fabulous international data reporting agency, getting into critical minerals and focusing on big energy issues, we’re all in on that. But if they insist that it’s so dominated and infused with climate stuff we’re out,” Wright said.
He suggested that several data reporting agencies "distort" their findings, adding that the world has "plenty of climate advocacy organisations".
Dodging specific questions about whether the agency will abandon net-zero scenarios, the IEA's Executive Director Fatih Birol instead mentioned the interest from countries like Colombia, Brazil, Vietnam and India to join the Paris-based agency.
"This is a milestone in the IEA's governance amid a global political system that faces a lot of challenges around the world," Birol told a press conference on Thursday.
Europe backs IEA's work
British Energy Secretary Ed Miliband said that while it's up to the US to decide on its future relationship with the IEA, he nonetheless "hopes they stay".
“I'm very happy with the work that the IEA is doing. I think that they are an organisation that proceeds on the basis of the facts, the science and the data," Miliband said. "I know that they were committed to carrying on doing that, and I know that's what the members want them to keep doing.”
Several European ministers attending the closed-door session on Thursday backed the agency's work, according to a source close to the talks.
"It also allows us to do something fundamental: move away from one of the greatest risks of our time, which is disinformation. Therefore, we need more than ever to continue following the rigorous and analytical work that the agency provides," a European energy minister said, according to the source.
European Union Energy Commissioner Dan Jørgensen, who also attended the ministerial meeting in Paris, hailed the IEA as a "trusted pillar of the global energy community, delivering reliable data, rigorous analysis, policy guidance and steady leadership".
"It is proof that multilateralism works. In a time of mounting energy crises and complex global challenges, we need more of this, not less," said Jørgensen.
"We stand firmly behind the IEA’s mission and its vital role in guiding the world toward a secure, sustainable, and prosperous energy future."
The IEA was established after the 1973-1974 oil crisis to serve as an independent body to coordinate joint responses to major disruptions in oil supply.

Russia's Putin slams U.S. oil blockade on Cuba: 'We do not accept anything like this'

Russian President Vladimir Putin has sharply criticized the Trump administration's fuel blockade on Cuba, saying Moscow considers the latest restrictions unacceptable.
His comments come as the island nation grapples with a worsening economic crisis, one that has been compared to its biggest test since the collapse of the Soviet Union.
"This is a special period, with new sanctions. You know how we feel about this. We do not accept anything like this," Putin said on Wednesday during a meeting with Cuban Foreign Minister Bruno Rodríguez Parrilla, according to Russian news agency Tass.
Russia, which has been allied to Cuba for decades, has recently described Havana's fuel situation as "truly critical" and said it is actively discussing what help it can provide to the country.
"We have always been on Cuba's side in its struggle for independence, for the right to follow its own path of development, and we have always supported the Cuban people," Putin said.
"We know how difficult these past decades have been for the Cuban people as they have fought for the right to live by their own rules and defend their national interests," he added.

The U.S. has effectively cut Cuba off from Venezuelan oil since launching an extraordinary military operation to depose Venezuela President Nicolás Maduro on Jan. 3. Cuba said 32 of its citizens were killed in the attack.
U.S. President Donald Trump has since pledged to impose tariffs on any country that supplies Havana with oil and labeled its government as "an unusual and extraordinary threat."
Cuba's dwindling oil supplies prompted the United Nations to warn of a possible humanitarian "collapse" earlier in the month.
'Very dramatic changes'
Cuba's government, which has condemned the U.S. pressure, has recently adopted measures to protect essential services and ration fuel supplies for key sectors.
It also suspended an annual cigar festival which had been due to take place in Havana later this month, without providing details of a new date.
Photos of daily life in Cuba have shown piles of waste building on Havana's street corners in recent days as many collection trucks have been left with empty fuel tanks.
The White House has said it was in Cuba's interest to make big changes soon, although stopped short of calling for a change of government.
"They are a regime that is falling. Their country is collapsing and that's why we believe it's in their best interest to make very dramatic changes very soon," White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters on Wednesday.

Chinese tech companies progress 'remarkable,' OpenAI's Altman tells CNBC

The progress of Chinese tech companies across the entire stack is "remarkable," OpenAI's Sam Altman told CNBC.
Altman's comments come as China races against the U.S. to develop artificial general intelligence (AGI) — where AI matches human capabilities — and roll out the technology across society.
The pace of technological advance in "many fields," including AI, is "amazingly fast," Altman said. In some areas Chinese tech companies are near the frontier, while in others they lag behind, he added.
The country is moving to scale homegrown chipmakers that it hopes could eventually rival the likes of Nvidia, and AI companies are seeing big rallies on stock exchanges as investors double down on their potential.
Altman's not the only tech leader paying attention to China.
American tech companies should "worry a little bit" about the subsidies their Chinese competitors receive from their government in the AI race, Microsoft President Brad Smith told CNBC on Wednesday.
Finding revenue
OpenAI has been moving to develop revenue streams as its looks to provide a path to profitability for investors that have ploughed around $70 billion into the company, according to deal-counting platform Dealroom. The company is looking to wrap up a $100 billion fundraising round, sources told CNBC.
Adverts within ChatGPT is one avenue the company is exploring.
"I think we still have some work to do to figure out the exact ad format that's going to work best," Altman said, adding that plans are in their early stages.
"The ads that I have personally liked the most in recent years from tech [companies] have been sort of Instagram style ads where you discover something new that you might really like and otherwise wouldn't have known about," he said. "I think we've got a real opportunity to push in that direction with ads in ChatGPT."
OpenAI is initially planning to test adverts in the U.S., but will eventually roll out to other markets, Altman said.
While conversations around OpenAI's timelines on a path to profitability are swirling among market watchers, the company is still focused on growth right now, Altman told CNBC.
"We are growing at an extremely fast rate right now," he said. "I think as long as we can have reasonable unit economics, we should focus on continuing to grow faster and faster, and we'll get profitable when we think we when we think it makes sense."

United Airlines is paring back rewards for travelers who don't have its credit card in MileagePlus overhaul
Unknown

21:55:53 KST

No United Airlines credit card? Soon you'll earn fewer miles than other travelers.
United is overhauling its MileagePlus frequent flyer program to reward travelers with more miles and lower redemption rates, including for some of its long-haul business-class seats — if they have one of the airline's credit cards. It's the latest move by an airline to reward its highest-spending customers.
The changes mark the biggest shake-up to the lucrative program in more than a decade, when United began rewarding customers for how much they spent — not just how far they flew.
United Chief Commercial Officer Andrew Nocella told CNBC in an interview that the airline has been working on the changes for about 18 months and that the carrier is aiming to reward its most loyal customers.
The shift also comes as United tries to stand out in an ever more competitive landscape for travel and rewards credit cards. That space also includes American Express' Platinum, Capital One's Venture X and Chase's Sapphire Reserve cards.
"In the credit card space in general, a lot's changed over the last five to 10 years in terms of the number of travel credit cards that are out there," Nocella said. "What I'm thinking about as we make these changes for United is to make sure that if you hold the credit card, you put it top of wallet, and then if you don't hold the credit card, there's a reason to get the credit card that seems incredibly compelling if you'd like to fly United Airlines and if you'd like to have that ... trip to Tahiti or to Rome or wherever we may be able to take you."
The changes take effect April 2. United is planning to show the discounted award flights on its website "so customers can see exactly how much having a United card could save them on their travel," the airline said.
United's loyalty program update is part of a trend among airlines to reward frequent flyer program members depending on how much they spend. About a decade ago, the major carriers tweaked their loyalty programs to reward customers for dollars spent over miles traveled.
Airlines also encourage customers to sign up for their credit cards by offering perks like no fees for checked bags and earlier boarding.
What's changing with United MileagePlus
United MileagePlus primary cardholders will get more miles per dollar spent on United flights compared with customers without a card, and higher rates than they do currently. Their earning goes up, too, when they actually use that card to purchase the ticket.
Meanwhile, customers without the card will earn less than they do today.
For example, a traveler without a co-branded United Airlines credit card will get three miles per dollar spent on a ticket, down from the current five miles. Under the new structure, a cardholder could earn six miles, and more if they use the card to buy it. Those with elite MileagePlus status earn miles at a higher rate, too.
United debit cardholders will also receive more miles, once they spend $10,000, United said.
Redemption rate discounts for cardholders
United will also now allow customers with one of its credit cards to redeem their miles for flights at a discount of at least 10% compared with those without the card.
The carrier said that, as an example, an economy-class award ticket that was 15,000 miles will go for 13,500 without elite Premier status. United said it's setting aside special discounted inventory of award tickets for cardholders, including for top-tier Polaris seats.
Perks for elites
Those with elite MileagePlus Premier status will get deeper discounts and better miles redemption. Elites with a card get at least 15% off mileage tickets.
United said its a seat in a long-haul business class Polaris cabin that is going for 200,000 miles would be 170,000 miles if the cardmember has elite Premier status. United added the lowest priced "Saver Award" seats for Polaris would be accesible to MileagePlus members with a United card, seats that were previously just available to high-tier elites.
Their earning rates also increase if they have both the credit card and status. MileagePlus 1K, the highest tier before Global Services, will get 17 miles for each dollar spent when they use their United Club credit card.
What's happening to basic economy flyers?
United Airlines travelers who don't have the credit card won't receive miles for basic economy tickets. American Airlines last year similarly said it would no longer allow travelers in that class to earn miles, following an earlier move by Delta Air Lines. There's an exemption, however, for holders of United's elite Premier status, who can still earn miles in basic economy.
What about business travelers?
Business travelers often have to book with company credit cards under corporate travel policies. But United said that individuals who personally hold a United credit or debit card will still get more miles than an employee who doesn't.

'Do not give away Diego Garcia': Trump attacks the UK over Chagos Islands deal, again

U.S. President Donald Trump has once again criticized the U.K.'s plan to hand the Chagos Islands back to Mauritius, telling the country not to "give away" the territory where a strategic U.S.-U.K. military base is located.
"DO NOT GIVE AWAY DIEGO GARCIA!" Trump posted on his Truth Social media platform on Wednesday, saying he'd been telling British Prime Minister Keir Starmer that he should "not lose control, for any reason, of Diego Garcia."
The U.K. agreed in May 2025 to hand sovereignty of the Chagos Islands to Mauritius, which has long-disputed the U.K.'s acquisition and ownership of the archipelago in the Indian Ocean.
The deal would see the U.K. lease back the military base it shares with the U.S. on the largest island on the archipelago, Diego Garcia, for £101 million ($135.7 million) a year, for an initial 99-year period.
The U.S. previously voiced support for the deal and, on Tuesday, the Department of State said it "supports the decision of the United Kingdom to proceed with its agreement with Mauritius concerning the Chagos archipelago."
Trump seesaws on the deal
Trump is not the biggest fan of the Chagos deal, however, and he has seesawed on the issue of ceding the territory to Mauritius.
In January, he called the deal "an act of great stupidity," but he was more conciliatory in early February, stating: "I understand that the deal Prime Minister Starmer has made, according to many, the best he could make," he commented on Truth Social.
"However, if the lease deal, sometime in the future, ever falls apart, or anyone threatens or endangers US operations and forces at our base, I retain the right to militarily secure and reinforce the American presence in Diego Garcia," he added.
On Wednesday, he returned to his negative position on the agreement, saying that he'd told Starmer "that Leases are no good when it comes to Countries."
"He is making a big mistake by entering a 100 Year Lease with whoever it is that is 'claiming' Right, Title, and Interest to Diego Garcia, strategically located in the Indian Ocean," Trump said.
The president suggested that giving the islands away was an act of "Wokeism," as it had come after the U.K. faced sustained international and legal pressure to relinquish the islands, and to redress its thorny colonial history on the islands.
"We will always be ready, willing, and able to fight for the U.K., but they have to remain strong in the face of Wokeism, and other problems put before them," Trump said.
The U.K. has repeatedly said that it "will never compromise on our national security" when it comes to the Chagos deal.
Iran action?
Trump also suggested Wednesday that the joint military base on the island could be vital if military action was taken against Iran — if the Islamic Republic did not agree a new nuclear deal during current talks with the U.S.
"Should Iran decide not to make a Deal, it may be necessary for the United States to use Diego Garcia, and the Airfield located in Fairford, in order to eradicate a potential attack by a highly unstable and dangerous Regime — An attack that would potentially be made on the United Kingdom, as well as other friendly Countries," Trump said.
The U.S. and Mauritius are due to hold talks on the Chagos deal next week, from Feb. 23-25, with the U.S. Department of State noting that the discussions" underscore the continued importance of the Chagos archipelago and the joint U.S.-U.K. base on Diego Garcia to our national security."
"The discussions will focus on bilateral security cooperation and effective implementation of security arrangements for the base to ensure its long-term, secure operation," the department said.
