Finnish border authorities have detained a Swedish national on suspicion that he stole a car, drove it while under the influence of alcohol, and then attempted to illegally cross the border into Russia.
Investigators believe the saga began when the man stole a food courier’s vehicle in Rovaniemi last Sunday. The courier's bank card was in the car, which it is understood the man used to make small purchases at a local gas station.
On Monday, the suspect arrived at a temporarily closed border crossing near the town of Salla, on the Finnish-Russian border, and attempted to climb over a gate into the restricted access zone between the two border checkpoints.
He was apprehended by a border patrol while trying to scale the fence.
The border guard then performed a breathalyzer test, which showed the man had a blood alcohol level exceeding the limit for aggravated drunk driving. He was handed over to Finnish police, and he underwent a blood test to more accurately determine his fitness to drive.
The man also informed the border guards that his intention was to enter Russia.
He now faces a slew of potential charges, including a border violation, aggravated drunk driving, unauthorised use of a motor vehicle, and payment fraud. The case is being investigated by the Lapland Police Department and the Lapland Border Guard.

European leaders called Friday for a reset in relations with the United States as they met at a top security conference where US President Donald Trump’s potshots at traditional transatlantic ties loomed large.
German Chancellor Friedrich Merz urged “a new transatlantic partnership” and French President Emmanuel Macron called for “a strong Europe” as more than 60 leaders gathered for the annual Munich Security Conference.

British Prime Minister Keir Starmer will meanwhile tell the conference Saturday that Europe is “a sleeping giant” and must rely less on the United States for its defence, his office said in a preview of his remarks.
This year’s conference comes at a time of strained ties between Europe and the United States, after Trump threatened to take over Greenland and criticised “decaying” and “weak” European nations.
Russia’s war against Ukraine, set to enter its fifth year this month, is high on the agenda, alongside efforts by European NATO members to raise their defence budgets, in line with Trump’s demands, out of concern that Moscow could seek to expand into their territory.
European leaders at the gathering defended their security commitments and the NATO alliance, which Trump’s rhetoric has rattled.
“Being a part of NATO is not only Europe’s competitive advantage. It’s also the United States’ competitive advantage. So let’s repair and revive transatlantic trust together,” Merz said.

“In the era of great-power rivalry, even the United States will not be powerful enough to go it alone.”
- ‘Greater European autonomy’ -
The gathering comes a year after US Vice President JD Vance used the conference’s stage to attack European policies on immigration and free speech, shocking allies on the continent.
Macron emphatically defended Europe in his speech, saying “everyone should take their cue from us, instead of criticising us”.
Starmer’s office said his speech would call for “a vision of European security and greater European autonomy that does not herald US withdrawal but answers the call for more burden sharing in full and remakes the ties that have served us so well”.
US Secretary of State Marco Rubio, who arrived on Friday, is also due to speak at the gathering on Saturday, as is Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, organisers said.
A German government source said Merz and Rubio had met at the conference and discussed “Ukraine, the status of negotiations with Russia and further support for the country, particularly in terms of military aid”.
They also discussed Iran and NATO, and “Rubio praised Germany’s steps to strengthen the alliance,” the source added.
Rubio also met his Chinese counterpart Wang Yi on the sidelines of the conference, at a time of heightened Washington-Beijing tensions.
They agreed to strengthen cooperation, and Wang told Rubio that “dialogue is better than confrontation, cooperation is better than conflict, and win-win outcomes are better than zero-sum games”, according to Chinese state news agency Xinhua.
Rubio held a 15-minute meeting with the prime ministers of Denmark and Greenland about the future sovereignty of the Arctic island. Denmark’s Mette Frederiksen called the talks “constructive”.
Ties plunged last month when Trump stepped up threats to annex Greenland, an autonomous territory of NATO ally Denmark, forcing European nations to stand firm in protest.
- Ukraine discussions -
Merz, Macron and the leaders of the European Union, Canada and NATO met with Zelensky on Friday for talks on Ukraine.
A US official said Rubio did not attend those talks due to a packed schedule, but was “engaging on Russia-Ukraine in many of his meetings” in Munich.
Ukrainian Foreign Minister Andriy Sybiga said he discussed ending the Russian invasion with Wang, whose country is a close partner of Moscow.
Wang told Sybiga that Beijing was “willing to provide Ukraine with new humanitarian aid”, according to a Chinese foreign ministry readout.
Macron, meanwhile, said a new framework was needed to deal with “an aggressive Russia” once the fighting in Ukraine ends.
“If it makes sense to talk, we are willing to talk,” said Merz. “But as you can see with the American side, Russia is not yet willing to talk seriously.”
Zelensky, urged by Trump to “get moving” on a deal to end the war, visited a drone factory near Munich with German Defence Minister Boris Pistorius before meeting with European leaders.
“It’s good to have strong partnership with Americans... but I think that Europe... needs (an) independent defence industry, very strong,” he said.
NATO’s Secretary General Mark Rutte said on the sidelines of the conference that Europe was “stepping up... taking more of a leadership role within NATO” and “taking more care of its own defence”.
“A strong Europe in a strong NATO means that the transatlantic bond will be stronger than ever,” Rutte said.

An overnight Russian drone strike on Odesa set a residential building on fire and killed a woman inside, the governor of the southern Ukrainian region said on Saturday morning.
Russian forces attacked the area with strike drones, hitting a one-story private home in the city. The impact damaged the roof and sparked a fire, which emergency crews quickly extinguished. During search and rescue operations, responders later discovered the body of a woman beneath the rubble.

Odesa Regional Military Administration head Oleh Kiper confirmed the fatality, saying the victim was killed as a result of the drone strike. Odesa Military Administration chief Serhii Lysak added that the woman was born in 1950 and was found trapped under the debris of the destroyed house.
Beyond the completely ruined home, the blast wave shattered windows in neighboring buildings and damaged nearby outbuildings and private residences, authorities said.
Ukraine’s State Emergency Service reported that a psychologist was deployed at the scene to provide support to residents who found themselves at the epicenter of the attack and to those who lost a loved one.
Northeast of the Black Sea port region, a barrage on Zaporizhzhia region in the past 24 hours killed at least one person and wounded three others, regional military chief Ivan Fedorov said.
“Over the last 24 hours, the invaders carried out 655 strikes on 41 settlements in the Zaporizhzhia region,” he said.

Maxim Krippa, owner of the Parus business center and the Ukraine hotel in Kyiv city center, is acquiring Graal LLC through his investment fund Ars Capital. The company holds development rights for a strategic land plot near Khreshchatyk Street in the heart of the city center.
According to Forbes, Graal LLC was previously owned by Kyiv developer Igor Nikonov (founder of KAN Development). KAN Development’s press service confirmed its exit from the project, while City Capital Group declined to comment.

On Feb. 12, the Antimonopoly Committee of Ukraine (AMCU) granted the fund permission to gain sole control over the developer Graal LLC.
As reported by Forbes, the project involves building a multifunctional complex named “Stolychnyi” on six land plots totaling 0.86 hectares (2.1 acres). The complex will feature a total area of over 44,140 square meters (475,120 sq ft), including 219 apartments, offices, and retail premises. The building also includes a multi-level underground parking facility.
In a written response to Forbes, the Ars Capital press service stated that the goal of the acquisition is to transform a long-frozen development site into a modern and functional space, and to “align the area with a unified aesthetic standard for European Square.” The location is next to the Dnipro Hotel, which was officially purchased in 2020 by Alexander Kokhanovsky, founder of the NAVI esports team – the key asset owned by Krippa.

US Department of Homeland Security loses funding amid government shutdown

WASHINGTON, February 14. /TASS/. Agencies within the US Department of Homeland Security have been left without funding due to a partial government shutdown and are formally required to cease operations.
On Thursday, a funding bill for the department failed to secure the necessary votes in the US Senate. As a result, the department partially suspended operations at midnight Friday into Saturday local time. This is the third shutdown in the United States in recent months, but this time it affects only one department.
Most employees are expected to continue working, but without pay. This concerns several agencies, including the Transportation Security Administration (TSA), the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), the US Coast Guard, the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), and the US Secret Service.
At the same time, the Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and US Customs and Border Protection (CBP) agencies, whose operations were largely central to the shutdown, can continue working with minimal changes through funding from other bills.

London’s West End lights up for Muslim holy month Ramadan as mayor calls for unity
Over 30,000 LED lights illuminate central London for 4th year, with Mayor Sadiq Khan urging communities to stand together against division, Islamophobia
ISTANBUL
London’s West End was illuminated this week as Mayor Sadiq Khan switched on the city’s Ramadan lights on Friday evening, marking the fourth consecutive year the display has celebrated the Muslim holy month in central London.
More than 30,000 LED lights inspired by Islamic geometric patterns now shine across Leicester Square and nearby streets, displaying “Happy Ramadan” before changing to “Happy Eid” on March 18.
The initiative is funded and organized by the Aziz Foundation.
Speaking at the ceremony, Khan urged unity amid rising political tensions and growing Islamophobia, saying: “Let’s show the best of London, let’s show the best of Britain, and let’s show the best of Islam.”
“I call on Muslims, Christians, Jews, Buddhists, Sikhs, those of organized religions, and those that aren’t, come together during this month of Ramadan,” he added.
Addressing wider global conflicts, the mayor encouraged worshippers to remember those suffering in places, including Sudan, Gaza, and Ukraine, through prayer and charity, while warning against those “sowing the seeds of division, hatred, and fear.”
“One of the jobs we have during this month of Ramadan, whether you are Muslim or non-Muslim, is to show that London is the antidote to that hatred. We are the antithesis of everything they believe in,” he said.
Khan later said through US social media company X that switching on the lights at Piccadilly Circus was “a pleasure,” describing London as “a beacon of hope, unity, and inclusivity,” where “diversity is a strength, and where everyone is loved and wanted.”

Indian national admits role in plot to assassinate US Sikh leader
Prosecutors say plot to kill Sikh leader Gurpatwant Singh Pannun was linked to India government employee, an allegation New Delhi denies.
An Indian national has admitted in a United States court that he took part in a 2023 scheme to hire a hitman to assassinate a prominent Sikh separatist leader living in New York, federal prosecutors said.
Nikhil Gupta, 54, pleaded guilty on Friday over his alleged role in attempting to make contact with a hitman to kill Gurpatwant Singh Pannun, a Sikh separatist who holds dual US and Canadian citizenship.

Pannun is affiliated with a New York-based group called Sikhs for Justice that advocates for the secession of Punjab, a northern Indian state with a large Sikh population.
In court, Gupta told Magistrate Judge Sarah Netburn that while in India in 2023, he transferred $15,000 online to someone he believed would carry out the assassination.
The individual that Gupta contacted was, in fact, a confidential source working with the US Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA).
FBI Assistant Director Roman Rozhavsky said Pannun “became a target of transnational repression solely for exercising their freedom of speech”.
Gupta, who was detained at Prague airport in the Czech Republic in June 2023 and extradited to the US, pleaded guilty to “murder-for-hire, conspiracy to commit murder-for-hire, and conspiracy to commit money laundering”, the US attorney’s office for the southern district of New York said in a statement.
Under federal sentencing guidelines, Gupta could face between 20 and 24 years in prison. A plea agreement calls for him to serve at least two decades.
He is scheduled to be sentenced on May 29.
US and Canadian authorities say the plot forms part of a wider campaign to target Indian dissidents abroad, allegations that have strained ties between Washington, Ottawa and New Delhi.
‘The Sikh state of Khalistan is my life’s mission’
James C Barnacle Jr, head of the FBI’s New York office, said Gupta worked with an Indian government employee who directed him to arrange the killing.
Prosecutors allege that Indian intelligence officer Vikash Yadav, who remains at large, directed the plot and recruited Gupta in May 2023 to hire a hitman to carry out the murder.
Indian officials have denied involvement, saying any such operation would be contrary to government policy.
The case has drawn attention from Sikh activists in the US and Canada.
About two dozen Sikh supporters of Pannun attended Friday’s hearing, some chanting a victory slogan afterwards and holding a prayer service outside the court, waving yellow “Khalistan” flags – the name which they hope one day will replace Punjab.
Pannun, who is designated a “terrorist” by New Delhi, said in a telephone interview after the hearing that he would continue his activism “even if I have to face a bullet”.
“I’m not a terrorist”, he told The Associated Press news agency.
He described himself as a Sikh who, as a human rights lawyer, is campaigning to turn Punjab into a place where “all religions will have equal rights”.
Describing Gupta as “just a foot soldier”, Pannun called on US authorities to pursue those in India who he says authorised the plot.
“The Indian government cannot shield itself behind this operational foot soldier because the command, the direction and the funds are authorised by the Indian government,” he alleged.
“I am ready to take India’s bullet rather than take a step back and live like a slave. Working towards the independence of the Sikh state of Khalistan is my life’s mission, until either I am killed or Punjab becomes an independent country,” Pannun said.

China’s top court rules drivers responsible in assisted driving cases
Unknown

16:21:10 KST

China's top court has issued a ruling confirming humans in cars with assisted driving technology are responsible for their vehicle, setting a nationwide benchmark as Beijing positions itself as a standards-setter in the auto market.
Drivers are still responsible for ensuring road safety after activating assisted driving functions, China's top court said in a "guiding case" issued on Friday.
"The on-board assisted driving system cannot replace the driver as the primary driving subject," the Supreme People's Court said in the Friday ruling.
The driver "is still the one who actually performs the driving tasks and bears the responsibility to ensure driving safety", it added.
Chinese tech companies and carmakers have poured billions of dollars into autonomous driving technology in the race to outperform each other, as well as rivals in the US and Europe.
However, Beijing has moved to tighten safety rules after a high-profile crash last March.
Establishing legal standard
In its ruling, the court referred to a case in which a man relied on the technology while drunk and asleep at the wheel.
The reference case is a September ruling in southern Zhejiang province, in which a driver surnamed Wang was jailed and fined for fully relying on the assisted driving system while drunk.
Wang installed a device to mimic hand grip on the steering wheel, set the car to drive, then fell asleep in the passenger seat, the court said.
Police found Wang after the car stopped in the middle of a road.
While most such systems currently used on the road specify that the driver is ultimately in control of the car, the court's ruling now makes that a legal standard nationwide.
Lower courts are to reference the judgement when deciding on similar cases.
Tightening safety rules
Beijing had already warned leading automakers that safety rules would be more tightly enforced after a crash that killed three college students last March raised concerns over the advertising of cars as being capable of autonomous driving.
Friday's guidance comes after China announced it will ban hidden door handles on cars, a minimalist design popularised by Tesla, from next year, also over safety concerns.
Folding into the body of the car, such door handles help reduce drag while in motion but are prone to losing operability in the event of a crash.
One high-profile incident occurred in October, when rescuers were shown failing to open the doors of a burning electric vehicle in the southwestern city of Chengdu.

USU: Finns losing confidence in Nato security guarantees

Fewer than half of Finns say they have faith in the Nato military alliance, according to the results of a survey commissioned by the Uutissuomalainen (USU) news group.
Some 46 percent of respondents to the poll said they trust the alliance, while 32 percent said they do not. One in five meanwhile preferred not to give their opinion.
The survey also found that men were more likely to have faith in Nato, with 55 percent expressing that view, compared to just 37 percent for women.
In addition, supporters of the Finnish coalition government's two biggest parties — National Coalition Party and the Finns Party — also placed far more trust in the alliance, polling around 70 percent for both groups.
The least amount of trust was found to be among Left Alliance voters, at just 18 percent, with 63 percent of that cohort saying they did not believe that Nato would guarantee the security of Finland and Europe.
Iro Särkkä, a Senior Research Fellow at the Finnish Institute of International Affairs, told USU that distrust of the current US administration has undermined Finns' overall confidence in Nato.
The survey was conducted by Iro Research on behalf of USU between 20 and 28 January 20. A total of 1,000 people responded to the poll and the margin of error is 3.1 percentage points in either direction.

Investigator seize 12.5 million illegal cigarettes in three ops

Finance ministry investigators have seized 12.5 million illegal cigarettes in three separate criminal investigations over the past two weeks. Had all 12.5 million cigarettes reached the market, the Dutch state would have missed out on an estimated €4.2 million in excise duty, the Fiod said.
The tobacco was found during operations by a specialist team made up of finance ministry and customs officials at several locations across the Netherlands.
The first haul, more than 3.5 million cigarettes, was confiscated on 28 January in Rotterdam. The shipment was hidden in a container filled with plastic crates, with cartons of cigarettes concealed between them.
The container was found following a tip-off and the Netherlands was not the final destination, officials said.
Just over a week later, another consignment was intercepted on the motorway near Nieuw-Amsterdam in Drenthe. The cigarettes were traced after a customs check in the port of Rotterdam.
They were packed in wooden crates labelled as saunas. The crates did contain sauna components, but cartons of cigarettes had been hidden inside the wooden frames. Around 6.5 million cigarettes were seized in that operation.
Five days later, a further batch of illegal tobacco was discovered in a business premises in Vlijmen, Brabant. A follow-up raid led to the seizure of more cigarettes in a warehouse in Den Bosch.
In total, more than 2.5 million cigarettes were found in the Brabant operations, which the Fiod said were intended for illegal sale in the Netherlands.
One suspect has been arrested in connection with the seizures in Drenthe and Brabant. The Fiod has not ruled out further arrests.

Flower sales in Hong Kong bloom as Valentine’s Day shoppers splash out on gifts
Some vendors at flower market in Mong Kok say sales up 20 per cent as shoppers pack area
Some lovebirds in Hong Kong are expressing their affection this Valentine’s Day by spending hundreds of dollars on bouquets and gifts, while several vendors have recorded growth in sales of about 20 per cent.
At the bustling Flower Market in Mong Kok, many men were among the crowds picking rose bouquets, while others browsed for flowers to celebrate the coming Lunar New Year. The high number of shoppers on Tung Choi Street even prompted police to put in place crowd control measures.
Stalls were lined with bouquets of all sizes from a handful of red roses to 99, ranging from about HK$200 (US$25.60) to HK$3,000.
Edison Fung, an engineer in his 30s, spent HK$380 on a bunch of roses for his girlfriend, whom he has dated for four years.
Throughout the day, he planned to spend around HK$1,000 on flowers, lunch and gifts, a level similar to last year.
“Last year I bought a Jellycat doll, and this year I don’t want to be repetitive,” he said.

At least 645 Dutch nationals have been serving in Israeli army
At least 645 Dutch nationals were serving in the Israeli army in March last year, according to documents released by the Israeli military following a freedom of information request by campaign group Hatzlacha.
Of those listed, 559 soldiers held both Israeli and Dutch nationality. A further 86 had three or more passports, including a Dutch one, according to British investigative collective Declassified UK, which published the figures.
The list shows that most foreign nationals in the Israeli army also have US citizenship, followed by French, Russian and German nationals.
It is not illegal under Dutch law to serve in a foreign army although Dutch nationals can be prosecuted if it can be proven that they were involved in war crimes.

NEW YORK, February 14. /TASS/. Europe has lost trust in the United States, and Washington is attempting to reduce tensions in relations with European countries at the Munich Security Conference, The New York Times (NYT) writes.
"European trust in America’s commitment to shared values, European security and even territorial integrity was already damaged, but after Davos (World Economic Forum - TASS) many of Europe’s leaders gave up hope for a return to the old trans-Atlantic relationship," the op-ed states.
According to the publication, at the conference that kicked off on February 13 in Munich, the US has been making efforts at de-escalation. American officials are reportedly guided by the so-called "pragmatic realism," and do not make insults toward Europe.
"But there is little evidence that American policy has changed," the NYT adds, noting that Europeans remain skeptical and wary of the United States.

ChatGPT’s AI caricature social media trend could be a gift to fraudsters, experts  warn

Images uploaded to AI chatbots could be retained for an unknown amount of time and, if in the wrong hands, could lead to impersonation, scams, and fake social media accounts.
The artificial intelligence (AI) created caricature trend that showcases everything a chatbot knows about someone in a colourful picture, can pose serious security risks, according to cybersecurity experts.
Users upload a photo of themselves with a company logo or details about their role and ask OpenAI’s ChatGPT to create a caricature of them and their job using what the chatbot knows about them.
Cybersecurity experts told Euronews Next that social media challenges, such as AI caricatures, can provide fraudsters with a treasure trove of valuable information. A single image, paired with personal details, can be more revealing than users realise.
“You are doing fraudsters’ work for them - giving them a visual representation of who you are,” according to Bob Long, vice-president at age authentication company Daon.
The wording of itself should raise red flags, he argued, because it “sounds like it was intentionally started by a fraudster looking to make the job easy.”
What happens to images once they’re uploaded?
When a user uploads an image to an AI chatbot, the system processes the image to extract data, such as the person’s emotion, environment, or information that could disclose their location, according to cybersecurity consultant Jake Moore. That information may then be stored for an unknown period of time.
Long said the images collected from users can be used and retained to train AI image generators as part of their datasets.
A data breach at a company like OpenAI could mean sensitive data, such as uploaded images and personal information gathered by the chatbot, could fall into the hands of bad actors who could exploit it.
In the wrong hands, a single, high-resolution image could be used to create fake social media accounts or realistic AI deepfakes that could be used to run a scam, according to Charlotte Wilson, head of enterprise at Check Point, an Israeli cybersecurity company.
“Selfies help criminals move from generic scams to personalised, high-conviction impersonation,” she said.
OpenAI’s privacy settings state that uploaded images may be used to improve the model, which can include training it. When asked about the model’s privacy settings, ChatGPT clarified that this does not mean every photo is placed in a public database.
Instead, the chatbot said it uses patterns from user content to refine how the system generates images.
What to do if you want to participate in AI trends
For those who still want to follow the trend, experts recommend limiting what you share.
Wilson said users should avoid uploading images that reveal any identifying information.
“Crop tightly, keep the background plain, and do not include badges, uniforms, work lanyards, location clues or anything that ties you to an employer or a routine,” she said.
Wilson cautioned against oversharing personal information in the prompts, such as their job title, city or employer.
Meanwhile, Moore recommended reviewing privacy settings before participating, including the option to remove data from AI training.
OpenAI has a privacy portal which lets users opt out of AI data training by clicking on “do not train on my content.”
Users can also opt out of training from their text conversations with ChatGPT by turning off an “improve the model for everyone” setting.
Under EU law, users can request the deletion of personal data collected by the company. However, OpenAI notes it may retain some information even after deletion to address fraud, abuse and security concerns.

Pension annuity sales hit record as average pot exceeds £80,000

The government’s “inheritance tax raid” on pensions has helped drive sales of retirement annuities to new highs.
Industry data this week revealed they enjoyed a “record-breaking” 2025, with sales growing by 4% to £7.4bn and the average amount invested in an annuity surpassing £80,000 for the first time.
Some of this enthusiasm for what many people traditionally viewed as a dull, poor value product, has been put down to people who are keen to ensure that no more of their cash than is necessary ends up in the hands of HM Revenue and Customs. In addition, many are seeking some certainty in turbulent times.
An annuity is a product that converts an individual’s pension pot into a regular, guaranteed income for the rest of their life (or for a fixed term). They pay a life insurance company a lump sum, and, in exchange, it guarantees a regular payout.
Demand plummeted after the “pension freedoms” introduced in 2015 meant people no longer had to take one out. But changes to inheritance tax (IHT) on pensions announced by Rachel Reeves in her October 2024 budget helped give them a new lease of life.
She said money left in a defined contribution (AKA money purchase) pension after someone’s death will be pulled into the IHT net from April 2027. All private pensions, and most workplace schemes, are defined contribution.
The changes mean “unused” pension savings could be taxed as part of someone’s estate if they exceed the IHT threshold. Unused funds are money in a pension pot that has not been used to claim an income – such as buying an annuity.
Commenting on the data issued by the Association of British Insurers, Clare Moffat at the insurer Royal London said: “With changes next year to inheritance tax and pensions, there has been an increased interest in using annuities for IHT planning.”
Annuities now also offer better value than they used to. Marianna Hunt at the investment firm Fidelity International said its recent data showed that a 66-year-old in good health with a £300,000 pension pot could buy a single-life annuity paying £22,440 a year – a rate of about 7.5%.
“Five years ago, rates were closer to 4%to 5%, delivering roughly £13,500 from the same pot. That’s a substantial uplift in guaranteed income,” she added.

Andrew aide advised Epstein to omit conviction on China visa form, files suggest

An aide to Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor advised Jeffrey Epstein to illegally hide his child sexual abuse conviction to obtain a visa to China, according to the latest Epstein files release.
David Stern, who was a close associate of both Epstein and the then prince, was asked for his help after the disgraced financier’s initial application for a visa was rejected.
Stern advised Epstein’s assistant to make the application at the Chinese embassy in Paris and “in addition it will be better not to tick the boxes re being denied previously or criminal charges”.
Stern added in the email chain of 2012: “Whether or not to do this should be J’s decision of course and not mine.”
Epstein was given an 18-month jail sentence in the US in 2008 after pleading guilty to soliciting girls as young as 14.
There is no suggestion that Mountbatten-Windsor knew of Stern’s advice and it does not appear that Epstein made the planned visit to Beijing.
Stern, 48, was a fixer to Mountbatten-Windsor from about 2010 and a director of his Pitch@Palace business between 2016 and 2019. He was also close to Epstein, describing him as his mentor.
Stern had proposed a year earlier that he and Epstein set up an investment office in Beijing for “high net worth individuals” and “very discreetly make PA part of it and use his ‘aura and access’”.
PA is the abbreviation regularly used by Stern and Epstein in correspondence contained within the 3m documents released by the US Department of Justice relating to the disgraced American financier, who killed himself in his cell in 2019.
It is unclear whether the idea for a Beijing office was developed but an email from the 23 June 2012 suggests the three men did conspire further about working together in Asia. Stern, a German national now believed to be living in the United Arab Emirates, wrote to Epstein that there were two options open to them.
The first would be to launch a company called the Serpentine group, which would be a “new company for this purpose only”. The second was to use Stern’s company Asia Gateway, which “has history and accounts and prove (sic) of clients in the past and can be used”.
Stern said he had “informed PA that you are thinking about the company set up and I will wait for your feedback before taking action … He replied that I should at least send the letter so we can proceed … I will wait for your instruction.”
Epstein responded: “Send asia gateway.”
Stern wrote back: “Understood and confirmed: it will be done as Asia Gateway. PA agrees to your decision. Letter will be send (sic) as below.”
In the letter to Mountbatten-Windsor of which the royal was seemingly already aware, Stern wrote that Asia Gateway was an advisory firm based in South Kensington that focuses on “developing, structuring and investing in a wide range of projects, specifically connected to the United Kingdom”.
It says: “My deep admiration for your relentless work as the UK’s special representative for international trade and investment serves as inspiration to the AG business model. Knowing your commitment to the UK and its trade and businesses I wonder if there is not more that could be done to establish a business network of unrivalled comparison.
“Additionally and based on my thirteen years of business experience with China, AG aims to attract Chinese investors and companies to the UK market and relevant opportunities. I know this is an area of opportunity for the UK as a whole and is a priority for the UK government. I would be most honoured to discuss this approach with you personally and to understand, if it were possible, how AG can support your crucial work.”
Stern and Mountbatten-Windsor have been approached for comment.
Thames Valley police are liaising with prosecutors and examining material in the Epstein files in relation to allegations related to “misconduct in public office” by Mountbatten-Windsor.
The former prince is alleged to have leaked confidential information to Epstein, including official reports of trips to Singapore, Hong Kong and Vietnam in 2010 and 2011 when he was a government trade envoy. Trade envoys have a duty of confidentiality.
According to the police, officers are seeking “to determine whether a criminal offence is suspected and whether a full investigation is required”.
The former British ambassador to the US Peter Mandelson faces an investigation relating to the same alleged offence, which carries a maximum penalty of life imprisonment.
Both men have denied any wrongdoing.

‘My husband burned down our house – then the bank threatened repossession’
Unknown

Family life ended for Francesca Onody on a late summer evening in 2022 when her abusive husband doused their cottage with petrol as police arrived to arrest him. She and her children escaped seconds before the building exploded. Her husband Malcolm Baker died in the blaze.
That night, Onody lost her husband, her home, her pets and her possessions.
She also lost all her money. Shortly before he died, Baker had emptied their joint bank accounts and cancelled her mortgage protection and buildings insurance.
Three years later, she faced losing the little she had left. The mortgage lender, Halifax, announced that it planned to repossess the property to pay off the £35,000 of mortgage arrears and other charges that had accrued since Baker’s death. That included the land around the ruins of her home, where she and her children have been living in a caravan ever since the fire.
“It feels like my world has once again imploded,” she said when she first contacted Guardian Money in June last year. “I saw my home razed to the ground. I’ve scraped together to put a very basic roof over mine and my kids’ heads, and now the Halifax want to literally pull the ground out from under our feet.”
This month, three-and-a-half years after the explosion, Onody, 53, was able to pay off the mortgage and take possession of the land. Halifax halted proceedings after Guardian Money intervened. It also cancelled the interest and fees that had accrued on the mortgage during Onody’s long legal battles to secure probate.
Her ordeal exposes the legal and financial obstacles faced by domestic abuse victims long after a relationship has ended.
In the years since Baker’s death, she has had to challenge his will, which left her with nothing, battle banks and insurers, and fund a barrister to represent her at his inquest.
Meanwhile, red tape at the Probate Office and the Land Registry left her in legal limbo for months.
Worst of all, at one point she faced potential blame for Baker’s death when the Home Office commissioned a domestic homicide review to establish whether he was the abuse victim. The Home Office later apologised to her. It acknowledged in a letter that Baker was the perpetrator and that the investigation had “continued the dynamics of abuse” that Onody had suffered during the 18-year marriage.
“My husband’s campaign of financial and domestic abuse was strategically planned to continue after his death, and the subsequent lack of recognition and support from organisations has inflicted further years of fear on me,” she says.
Onody’s nightmare began years before the explosion. Baker, a Metropolitan police superintendent, had become mentally unstable after retiring from the Met in 2011, his inquest was told. He was also a heavy drinker. Onody says matters escalated when she demanded a divorce.
“He became more vindictive, threatening to ruin mine and my kids’ lives,” she says. “On one occasion he left a dead rabbit in my bed. We lived in a constant state of anxiety, wondering whether in a drunken stupor or one of his rages he might destroy our house around us while we slept.”
Baker began stockpiling canisters of petrol in the family home, Onody says, and she made frequent calls to the police as his behaviour became more threatening.
On his final night, she had dialled 999 after a confrontation. Baker barricaded himself in an upstairs bedroom when officers arrived. Onody and her children were downstairs when petrol began streaming through the sitting room ceiling. Police evacuated the house, which caught fire seconds later and exploded. Baker, still barricaded upstairs, could not be saved.
Onody and her children moved into a caravan alongside the ruin without heating or piped water. Since the deeds to the property and the mortgage were in Baker’s sole name, she was unable to sell the land or apply to rebuild the cottage.
It took her 28 months to successfully contest his will under the Inheritance (Provision for Family and Dependants) Act and to be appointed as personal representative of the estate.
During that time, she was not authorised to discuss the mortgage with the Halifax since she was not named in probate.
She took over the administration of the estate in February 2025 and discovered that in the interim, £34,700 of mortgage arrears and legal fees had built up, and a repossession order had been issued by the Halifax.
Halifax, she claims, initially agreed to allow her to remortgage the estate in her own name so she could sell the land, but last June it withdrew the offer and warned her that the property would be repossessed unless she paid off the debt within two months.
It is at that point that Onody first contacted the Guardian for help.
“I am being punished for my husband’s actions, with the Halifax now acting in his place as financial controller and abuser,” she said in an impact statement. “If I had a mortgage in my name and lodged with Land Registry, I would be able to move forward with my plan to sell the land, pay off all debts and build us a home and a secure, fear-free future.”
Halifax suspended the repossession order after Guardian Money questioned its handling of the case. It agreed to transfer the mortgage into her name once the deeds to the property had been amended to show her as the owner. It also admitted that a staff member had erroneously worked on a mortgage application for her last February and paid her £500 as an apology.
A spokesperson for Halifax said: “We truly sympathise with Ms Onody and understand how incredibly difficult this has been for her and her family. Since she wasn’t the mortgage holder and wasn’t named in probate, we faced some legal limitations early on. Despite this, we tried to be as flexible as possible.”
The spokesperson said the bank paused legal action several times while court matters were ongoing, and also provided thousands of pounds in financial support, including removing all interest and charges since Baker’s death.
The bank spokesperson added: “When it came to transferring the mortgage into her name, we asked her to meet with us to review affordability and explore ways to reduce her monthly payments. However, she decided to pay off the outstanding mortgage balance in full before this meeting could happen.”
The Land Registry agreed to expedite the application for the transfer of deeds when we got in touch.
Onody became legal owner of the land in November, and this month she paid off the mortgage.
She now hopes to sell the land and buy a property elsewhere to rebuild a life with her children.
“It’s been a really tough time for years,” she says, “but I’m ever-optimistic that there can be some degree of happy ending.”
The Financial Conduct Authority introduced new rules in 2023 to force financial firms to improve support for vulnerable customers. The Consumer Duty requires companies to act flexibly to protect customers in vulnerable situations but, according to the charity Surviving Economic Abuse, victims like Onody are still being failed.
“This story is a heartbreaking but sadly all-too-common reflection of the devastating harm caused by economic abusers,” says its chief executive Sam Smethers.
“Perpetrators will use any tool at their disposal – from insurance products to joint mortgages – to maintain control and cause earth-shattering harm to victim-survivors. Financial services [companies] have made significant progress in the support they offer victim-survivors of economic abuse, but there’s still a long way to go.”

In upcoming elections, Republicans have a Texas problem — and so do Democrats

With less than nine months until the midterm elections, Donald Trump's party is in trouble. The president's policies and actions are unpopular, Republicans keep losing special elections, and now even have to defend once-solid seats in Congress. One state has become a focal point: Texas.
“Don’t mess with Texas”: visitors to the second biggest US state have no doubt seen this phrase on everything from T-shirts to belt buckles.
Politically, it has become the unofficial slogan of conservatives whose message is two-fold: Texas is a class of its own — the only state that was an independent republic before joining the United States — and it is solid Republican territory.
The multi-million-dollar question that pundits in Austin and Washington are asking is whether this will end in this year’s midterm elections.
After scoring a sensational win in a state Senate special election in late January, Democrats are brimming with excitement.
Driven by US President Donald Trump’s growing unpopularity, they believe they have a shot at cracking historic Republican dominance and winning what Time Magazine has called “the wildest Senate race in the country."
“A Democratic victory in Texas in November would be an earth-shattering event that would signal a massive shift of political power and mean a major step towards Democrats controlling the US Senate,” Mark Jones, political scientist at Rice University in Houston Mark Jones told Euronews.
“It would end the longest losing streak anywhere in the country for Democrats,” added Jones, whose research focuses on electoral laws and voting patterns.
The longest losing streak, indeed. The last time a Democrat won a presidential election in Texas was Jimmy Carter in 1976, and the last statewide office a Democrat won was in 1994.
What gives Democrats hope is not just that they flipped a state Senate seat in the latest special election in Texas, but also the sheer size of their victory.
This was a district that Trump won by more than 17 points two years ago, and that the Republican candidate lost by 14 points – an eye-popping swing of more than 30 points towards the Democrats.
“This was remarkable and highly unusual,” said Cal Jillson, who wrote nine books on US and Texas politics and teaches at Southern Methodist University in Dallas.
“There was a massive shift of disaffected Republicans and independents who voted for the Democratic candidate,” Jillson added.
“People are no longer excited about Trump, which should be a warning sign for Republicans across the country.”
This is setting the stage for a potentially epic and, with a price tag of more than $300 million, most expensive Senate race in Texas history.
The money surge is being driven largely by Republicans in an unusually competitive and nasty matchup.
In the 3 March primary, long-time incumbent Senator John Cornyn, who is seeking a fifth consecutive term, is facing the toughest reelection campaign of his career, challenged by MAGA hothead Attorney General Ken Paxton and US Representative Wesley Hunt of Houston, another right winger.
Texas is one of a handful of states that require a candidate to get a majority of the votes in a primary to advance to the general election, not just a plurality.
This means a candidate must get 50% plus one vote to win an election, otherwise the top two vote-getters in each primary advance to a runoff.
Latest polling from the University of Houston suggests the Republican race could head to a runoff in May between Paxton (38%) and Cornyn (31%).
Such an outcome would delight state Democrats, as the controversial Paxton is considered an easier target in the general election.
Sounding the alarm, top Republican senators in Washington are trying a last-ditch push to get Trump to endorse Cornyn to keep the Texas seat safely in Republican hands.
But Trump, who normally relishes being the kingmaker among Republican candidates, has been ominously silent so far.
"I don’t expect him to weigh in," said Bill Miller, an Austin-based political consultant who has worked with both Republicans and Democrats.
"He’s very close to Ken Paxton, and John Cornyn is a sitting senator and has professed his love for Trump now. Trump's getting the best of all possible worlds."
Fearing for their majority, Republicans in the Senate beg to differ.
“It’s a very difficult race, and one that’s going to be a lot more expensive to hold the seat,” Senate Majority Leader John Thune told CNN about the impact of Trump remaining neutral.
Asked why Trump is ignoring the pleas, Thune said: “I’m probably not the right person to answer that question.”
Polls suggest that if Paxton beats Cornyn in the primary, it could open the door to another stunning Democratic victory.
If Democrats nominate the right candidate, that is.
The prospect of a Paxton candidacy has galvanised Democrats, but they are facing a tough primary choice between two rising stars who represent two opposite strategies for the future direction of the party.
On one side is US Representative Yasmine Crockett, a left-wing firebrand who has made a name in Washington as a make-no-prisoners nemesis of the Trump administration.
On the other is James Talarico, a moderate Texas state representative and Presbyterian seminarian whose faith-based approach to politics has brought him the support of the largest Latino group – not a small feat in Texas.
Republicans fear Talarico the most because he is more culturally attuned to the conservative state. Crockett may be entertaining, but she'd be the weaker candidate, Professor Jillson said citing polling of possible match-ups.
Yet, the Democrats winning the Texas Senate race is still a long shot.
“But the simple fact that we’re talking about the possibility tells you a lot about how things have been moving in Democrats’ direction,” Jillson said.
Whereas a possible Democratic takeover of the Senate, where Republicans currently hold a 53-47 majority, was on nobody’s radar just a few months ago, Democratic control of the House of Representatives is now almost a foregone conclusion.
Or can it still go wrong?
"Democrats still have a lot of homework to do and tell voters what exactly their party stands for," Jackson Janes, resident senior fellow at the German Marshall Fund of the United States in Washington, told Euronews.
"If they still make it all about Trump, they will lose in '26 and they will lose in '28," he added.
"Trump is no longer on the ballot and Democrats have a big opportunity to fill the vacuum with a positive message. If they don't do that, they might blow it."
The good news for Democrats is that history is on their side.
“One of the ‘laws’ of American politics is that midterm House elections rarely deliver good news to the president’s party,” writes James Lindsay, senior fellow at the US-based Council on Foreign Relations.
“The midterms in many ways function as a referendum on how presidents are doing, and voters are tough graders," Lindsay pointed out in a research paper.
In the last five midterm elections, the president’s party has lost an average of 31 House seats — as of this article's publication, the Republicans hold a 218-214 lead with three vacancies.
Sensing an electoral rout, Trump has pushed Republicans in solid red states to redraw district lines to create more Republican-leaning districts – and that push started in Texas.
The result has been the creation of five districts expected to swing from Democrats to Republicans.
But this only triggered a backlash from California, where voters in a referendum approved a Democrat-led redistricting that would net the party also five potential new seats.
An obvious risk with such partisan manipulation is that it may backfire.
The redistricting rests on the assumption that the party can shift enough of its voters to change the outcome in a new district without jeopardising its chances of winning in the old district, according to Lindsay.
If voter preferences change, as in the Texas state Senate race, redistricting may inadvertently put a once-solid seat for either party into play. And that can result in a classic political own goal.

It’s Valentine’s Day, and affection in Denmark is often expressed through a small, quiet gesture: the Danish blink.
Forget the Italian fingers kissing the lips. Forget the American smile that refuses to leave. Here, when people show warmth, they blink at you. With both eyes at once. Slowly. Deliberately. If you are not paying attention, you will miss it entirely.
At first, I didn’t even realise it was a thing. I just felt it.
That subtle moment of acknowledgment is a brief, deliberate closing of the eyes, sometimes paired with a nod, that quietly says: I see you.
Think of it as a tiny, secret stamp of approval.
Why the Blink Matters
To understand why this matters, it helps to know what normal blinking looks like. A regular blink lasts between a tenth and four tenths of a second. You barely notice it. It is just biological housekeeping.
The Danish blink, however, lingers just long enough for your brain to register social interaction.
I have come to love it. It is like a secret handshake for the emotionally restrained.
In other cultures, connection comes in smiles, handshakes, bows, or cheek kisses. In Denmark, all you need is a blink.
It reminds me of something I learned from cats. A slow blink from a cat signals trust. It says I come in peace. Blink back and many cats return the gesture. It is sometimes called a cat kiss. Danes, it turns out, are not entirely different.
Of course, this may be regional. In northern Jutland, a short nod can speak louder than a sentence. A blink and a nod is practically intimacy.
How to Respond
Step 1: Notice it.
The blink is subtle, almost shy. If a stranger gives you one and you are a beginner, a small smile is enough.
Step 2: Gain confidence.
A longer, intentional blink takes practice. Once you are feeling bold, try returning a gentle blink of your own.
Step 3: Optional advanced move.
With someone you know or recognise, add a tiny nod. This is optional and absolutely not a substitute for saying hello.
Practice tip: Try it in the mirror at home. Smile, blink, maybe nod, and let the moment pass naturally. The key is effortlessness.
Master this quiet art and you will be fully immersed in Denmark’s understated language of acknowledgment. Now that I notice it, I see it everywhere. In the street. In shops. On the bike path.
Blink received. Blink returned. Connection complete.
Behind the Blink
Not every Dane is blinking at you, so do not get carried away. The opposite of a blink is a scowl, and that ain’t pretty.
Most blinks are simple acknowledgment, usually following a small, positive interaction. Picking up a dropped glove, holding the lift, letting someone merge on the bike path. You earn it.
If a blink comes with a big smile and a playful head turn afterwards, it might carry a flirtatious hint. Respond too enthusiastically and you break the spell. Miss it entirely and you may wonder if the moment happened at all.
Blink language is real. No declarations, no fuss, just mutual acknowledgment. Catch it and you have shared a small, wonderfully Danish moment.
So, this Valentine’s Day weekend, if no one brings you roses or writes you a card, do not despair. Look around. A warm, affectionate blink might be waiting for you. Just be careful not to miss it.

US ends temporary protected status for Yemeni refugees, asylum seekers
Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem has determined it is safe for Yemenis to return to their country, despite ongoing conflict.
The United States government has ended the Temporary Protected Status (TPS) designation for Yemen, ordering the more than 1,000 Yemeni refugees and asylum seekers living in the country to leave within 60 days or face arrest and deportation.
The action on Friday came as part of US President Donald Trump’s broad immigration crackdown, which is impacting those who fled perilous lives in war-torn countries.

It will terminate TPS for roughly 1,400 Yemeni nationals who have had access to the legal status since September 2015 because of armed conflict in their country, Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem announced on Friday.
“After reviewing conditions in the country and consulting with appropriate US government agencies, I determined that Yemen no longer meets the law’s requirements to be designated for Temporary Protected Status,” Noem said in a statement.
“Allowing TPS Yemen beneficiaries to remain temporarily in the United States is contrary to our national interest,” she said, describing the revocation as an act of “putting America first.”
Contrary to Noem’s determination, Yemen continues to be riven by years-long conflict in one of the world’s poorest nations.
The State Department currently advises against travel to Yemen, citing “terrorism, unrest, crime, health risks, kidnapping, and landmines”.
TPS allows narrow groups of people in the US to live and work in the country if they’re deemed to be in danger if they return to their home nations, because of war, natural disaster or other extraordinary circumstances.
While the protections are technically temporary, historically, presidents have continued to renew TPS statuses for refugees and asylum seekers rather than revoking them and rendering them undocumented.
The TPS for Yemen was last extended in 2024 and was set to expire on March 3 of this year.
Yemeni beneficiaries with no other lawful basis for remaining in the US have 60 days to voluntarily depart the country or face arrest, the statement said, offering a complimentary plane ticket and a $2,600 “exit bonus” for those who “self-deport”.
Since coming to office last year, Trump has ended the status for Venezuelans, Hondurans, Haitians, Nicaraguans, Somalis, Ukrainians and thousands of others.
The Trump administration has also expanded its travel restrictions since returning to power, imposing a total ban on citizens of 19 countries from entering the US, primarily targeting Muslim-majority and African nations, including Yemen, Somalia and South Sudan.
Citizens from a further 29 countries, including Nigeria and Senegal, are subject to partial bans.

Merz Opens Munich Security Conference Urging Europe to ‘Switch the Mental Gear’

German Chancellor Friedrich Merz opened the Munich Security Conference (MSC) on Friday with a warning that Europe has entered a new era shaped by overt great-power politics; furthermore, that it must respond by strengthening its own military, political and economic capacity while keeping its security policy firmly anchored with allies.
Merz said the international order “based on rights and rules” no longer exists “in this form,” arguing that Europe must adjust to a world in which influence, dependencies and coercion are increasingly used as tools of statecraft.

“Our freedom with our neighbors”
Merz framed Russia’s full-scale war against Ukraine as the clearest marker of the shift, describing it as violent revisionism and a direct assault on Europe’s political order. He said Europe’s “first task” is to recognize the new reality and make preparations “for the new time,” stressing that Germany’s foreign and security policy would remain European in its foundations.
“Our freedom we defend with our neighbors,” Merz said, rejecting any notion of Germany acting alone and calling instead for what he described as a “program of freedom.” That program rests on four pillars: i) strengthening Europe’s military, political, economic and technological power; ii) building a more sovereign Europe as a stronger pillar within NATO; iii) renewing transatlantic ties; and iv) expanding partnerships beyond the West.

The German chancellor also argued that democracies face a double risk: too much state power can erode freedom, but too little state capacity can produce the same outcome through vulnerability and paralysis. Germany, he said, must close what he described as a gap between ambitious rhetoric and the practical means to enforce policy.
NATO anchor, European pillar
Merz emphasized that he does not see “great-power politics in Europe” as an option for Germany, but said Europe must become stronger inside NATO. He portrayed the alliance as a “competitive advantage” for both Europe and the US, even as he acknowledged a widening political and cultural distance across the Atlantic.
He also pointed to Germany’s stepped-up defense posture, including the goal of making the “Bundeswehr” (Germany’s armed forces) the strongest conventional military in Europe as quickly as possible. Additionally, he highlighted efforts to deepen European industrial and technological capacity in areas such as air defense, long-range strike capabilities and satellites.
Macron: Europe must stop underselling itself
French President Emmanuel Macron, speaking at the conference in the evening, urged Europe to project confidence rather than accept caricatures of the continent as slow, bureaucratic or weak.
Macron argued that the European project – which he described as “a political construction of sovereign states” – has institutionalized peace and created mutual economic dependence, and that Europe should treat these achievements as strengths rather than liabilities. He also said that Europe should not concede to Russia’s demands, but increase pressure, while continuing to back Ukraine.
High-stakes weekend in Munich
Friday’s opening set the tone for a weekend of high-level diplomacy. US Secretary of State Marco Rubio met with Merz on the sidelines of the conference, ahead of a closely watched speech he is due to deliver on Saturday.
As the first day of the Munich Security Conference came to a close, President Volodymyr Zelensky said Europe must be able to act independently, while remaining a strong and reliable partner of the US – arguing that only a confident, self-reliant Europe can credibly defend its security and support Ukraine.
Zelensky is also expected to accept the Ewald von Kleist Award 2026 – traditionally honoring those who make an outstanding contribution to peace and conflict resolution – at the Bavarian State Chancellery on Saturday. In its citation, the Munich Security Conference said this year’s award honors the “brave Ukrainian people” in deep appreciation of their courage, sacrifice and unwavering resolve to defend their freedom, as well as “the freedom of all of Europe,” and commemorates those who have been killed or injured during Russia’s full-scale invasion. Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk is scheduled to deliver the laudatory address, while Zelensky is expected to give brief remarks.

Europe should overcome reliance on US in defense — British PM

LONDON, February 14. /TASS/. European nations must end their dependence on American military support by strengthening cooperation among themselves, British Prime Minister Keir Starmer argues in a speech he is due to make at the Munich Security Conference.
"We are not the Britain of the Brexit years anymore. Because we know that, in dangerous times, we would not take control by turning inward - we would surrender it. And I won’t let that happen," excerpts of his speech provided by his office read.
"There is no British security without Europe, and no European security without Britain. That is the lesson of history - and it is today’s reality too," Starmer is expected to say, calling for "a more European NATO."
The British prime minister believes Europe should replace excessive dependence on its transatlantic partner with greater regional cooperation. "I’m talking about a vision of European security and greater European autonomy that does not herald US withdrawal but answers the call for more burden sharing in full and remakes the ties that have served us so well," Starmer’s address reads.
Starmer also describes Europe as a "sleeping giant," arguing that its economy exceeds Russia’s "10 times over."
At the same time, he notes that making such important decisions requires achieving broad public consensus, so that far-right and far-left movements do not gain strength by offering simplistic solutions.

Trump administration sued for attempted overhaul of public golf course in Washington

WASHINGTON - A non-profit organisation and two residents in Washington sued US President Donald Trump’s administration on Feb 13 seeking to stop its attempted overhaul of a more than a century-old public golf course, a court filing showed.
Since taking office in January 2025,
In late 2025, the Trump administration cancelled a lease held by the National Links Trust (NLT) to oversee three public golf courses in Washington, DC, giving a fresh opportunity for Mr Trump to put his stamp on a part of city life.
Mr Trump’s Interior Department said it was terminating the 50-year-lease the group received in 2020 to run the golf courses. The agency accused NLT of failing to make required investments in the properties and to pay rent.
NLT disputed the allegations that it defaulted on its lease or had not paid what was required. It said the Interior Department provided little information about the issue.
The lawsuit filed on Feb 13 in the US District Court for the District of Columbia said the Trump administration’s reconstruction of East Potomac Park that includes the East Potomac Golf Course violated a congressional act from 1897 which said it should be “forever held and used as a park for the recreation and pleasure of the people”.
The US Interior Department was quoted by local media as saying it does not comment on pending litigation but added it would “ensure these courses are safe, beautiful, open, affordable, enjoyable and accessible for people visiting” Washington.
The Interior Department and the National Park Service, which is a part of the department, were named as defendants in the lawsuit. The plaintiffs included non-profit group DC Preservation League and Washington residents Dave Roberts and Alex Dickson.
The lawsuit alleged the Trump administration’s actions violated environmental laws and would pollute a park on the National Register of Historic Places. REUTERS

Belgian scientist uses AI to unravel mysteries of an 1,800-year-old Roman board game

A mysterious stone that has been gathering dust in a Dutch museum for many years now may be an ancient Roman board game, if research undertaken by Belgian scientists is correct. Using a specialised AI model and an extensive database of historical board games, researchers have even unravelled how the 1,800-year-old board game was played possibly only two centuries after Julius Caesar waded through the Flemish marshes fighting the Belgae in our climes.
Belgian scientist uses AI to unravel mysteries of an 1,800-year-old Roman board game
For decades, the Roman Museum in Heerlen (The Netherlands) has held a remarkable object in its collection: an ancient stone found near the Villa Coriovallum, a Roman site in the neighbourhood. Due to the striking stripes on the stone, the museum had long suspected that it was an ancient playing board, but conclusive evidence was lacking.
Eric Piette of the Francophone university of Louvain-la-Neuve (UCLouvain) and his research team changed that all that. Piette is an AI scientist with a unique specialisation: unravelling historical board games using artificial intelligence. ‘I worked at Maastricht University in the Netherlands for several years, and during that time, my colleagues and I came across the stone in the Roman Museum,’ he tells VRT NEWS.
Together with his team, Piette decided to re-examine the stone using modern AI technology. ‘During an initial analysis of the surface, we saw signs of wear that indicated repeated movements across the stone,’ he explains. ‘That could mean that it was indeed a playing board.’
To confirm this assumption, the researchers used specialised AI software. This software was able to compare the wear patterns on the stone with thousands of games from an extensive historical database. And that ultimately yielded results: after countless analyses and simulations, Piette and his team now believe that they know what kind of game it was.
Blocking game
While working in Maastricht, Piette and a number of colleagues had already started the so-called Ludii project. This project aims to map all board and card games from the past to the present. And then train a large AI model on this data.
‘The real power of this research lies in that enormous game database,’ says Piette. ‘We can include both modern and ancient board games, from Egypt to America, and from a wide variety of playing styles’. All games are collected on a world map on the Ludii website.
Ludii not only keeps track of these games, but also contains software that allows you to play them. This came in handy in the search for more information on the Roman game from Heerlen. Initial analysis of the traces of use revealed six possible pawn arrangements, but the team still had to figure out how the game was actually played.
‘We used various AI-controlled players to test thousands of game variations on the Dutch stone.’
However, a problem arose.
‘The game seemed to be designed for two players, but one AI player kept winning over and over again, while the other player always lost,’ Piette explains.
‘Ultimately, it turned out that only one fairly simple type of game could have been played: a blocking game. In such a game, both players have a different goal, and one player's main objective is to block the other player from achieving that goal.’
Given the stone's location near Villa Coriovallum, the researchers named the game “Ludus Coriovalli” (“Game from Coriovallum”).
Link with Scandinavia
According to Piette, the find is particularly interesting from a historical perspective. He attempted to date the stone and concluded that it originated from a period between approximately 200 and 400 CE, around the end of the (Western) Roman Empire.
'What is remarkable is that the patterns and possible rules of the game correspond remarkably well with games whose rules were only discovered much later, in the 18th and 19th centuries in Scandinavia'.
This suggests that cultural influence between the two regions may have existed much earlier than initially thought. It is possible that certain gaming traditions or ideas spread over long distances and persisted for centuries. ‘This also fits in with the image of the Roman Empire in its final phase: an empire that became increasingly hybrid through its contacts with other peoples and cultures.’
Next target is in Brussels
Piette and his Ludii team hope to be able to carry out more research of this kind in the future. ‘The database is the result of more than five years of work in Maastricht, but the project is far from complete. That is why we are now also collaborating internationally’.
And the scientist already has a new target in mind, this time closer to home, in Brussels. ‘The Royal Museum of Art and History has a striking clay game table from Ancient Egypt,’ he notes.
‘Possibly it is the oldest playing board known to humankind. We would very much like to conduct research on it, for example by using 3D simulations to reconstruct how it was originally intended to be used.’

Eternal City eternally damp as Rome suffers record rainfall
Sign up now: Get ST's newsletters delivered to your inbox
ROME - It is carnival time in Rome, which traditionally means piazzas filled with excitable children in costumes, gorging on fried treats – but record rains are ruining the party.
Persistent bad weather has dogged the whole of Italy since the start of the year, with storms causing huge damage and disruption.
Rome itself has seen near-daily downpours in February after a record amount of rain last month.
“January 2026 ranked as one of the three wettest Januarys (in Rome) since 1782,” meteorologist Lorenzo Tedici told AFP.
With its lush parks and outdoor social scene, the Eternal City is known for its long summers and temperate winters.
But Italy is a so-called “hotspot” for climate change in Europe, and in recent years the whole country has been experiencing extreme weather events,
The storms sweeping through in recent week have at least “ended the drought in several southern regions – particularly Sicily and Sardinia,” Mr Tedici said.
Yet the “exceptionally rainy period” is now “causing problems due to excess water in central and southern Italy”, he said.
Nearly 58 per cent more rainfall than average fell across Italy last month, he said.
Coastal areas took a pummelling in January, with one town in Sicily, Niscemi, left teetering on the brink of a cliff after a massive landslide triggered by Storm Harry.
‘English climate in Italy’
With the bad weather expected to last until Feb 20, according to Mr Tedici, mayors in storm-hit towns have been cancelling or postponing carnival celebrations.
The festivities are a last hurrah before Lent, a period of abstinence in the Christian calendar leading up to Easter – and can last for days.
But at the Antico Forno Roscioli in Rome, where carnival delicacies including crispy pastries and custard-filled donut balls are piled high, many customers are not in the mood.
“The rains are definitely putting a downer on festivities and slowing sales,” manager Paolo Martinucci told AFP.
Mr Davide Faranda, research director at the Climate and Environment Sciences Laboratory in Paris, said Italy was currently being drenched by Storm Nils.
The storm, which has already lashed parts of France, Portugal, and Spain, has brought stronger than usual winds and rain.
Climate change is increasing the intensity of heavy rainfall events across Europe, by warming the atmosphere and allowing it to hold and release more moisture.
The Mediterranean region as a whole is also warming faster than the rest of the globe.
That means “changes in temperature and the hydrological cycle tend to be stronger there than the global average, which can exacerbate heavy rainfall”, Mr Faranda told AFP.
What is more, Italy has specific geographical characteristics “that can amplify impacts”, he said.
“Its location between the Mediterranean Sea and the Alps, combined with complex topography and long coastlines, makes it particularly sensitive to moisture transport, orographic rainfall (caused by air flowing over mountains), and slow-moving storm systems,” he said.
Mr Tedici said the “endless rain” was caused by the polar jet stream – a ring of fast-moving air around the Arctic – being “further south than normal”.
It is “essentially bringing the English climate to Italy”, he said.
And while Storm Nils is passing over, Anbi Water Resources Observatory warned Italy Friday to batten down the hatches for the incoming “St Valentine’s Cyclone”. AFP

Trump says Iran regime change 'best thing that could happen' as second carrier heads to region
US President Donald Trump said Friday that a change in power in Iran "would be the best thing that could happen" as he confirmed the deployment of a second aircraft carrier group to the Middle East. The US president is hoping to strike a deal with Iran to curb its nuclear programme, but has warned of severe consequences if one does not come through.
US President Donald Trump on Friday embraced potential regime change in Iran and declared that "tremendous power" will soon be in the Middle East, as the Pentagon sent a second aircraft carrier to the region.
Trump's military moves and tough talk comes even as Washington and Tehran seek to revive diplomacy over Tehran's long-running nuclear dispute with the West.
Asource briefed on the matter told Reuters that US envoys Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner will hold negotiations with Iran on Tuesday in Geneva, with representatives from Oman acting as mediators. The source said Witkoff and Kushner will also meet officials from Russia and Ukraine on Tuesday in Geneva in the US drive to bring an end to the war in Ukraine.
Asked if he wanted regime change in Iran, Trump responded that it "seems like that would be the best thing that could happen." He declined to share who he wanted to take over Iran, but said "there are people."
"For 47 years, they've been talking and talking and talking," Trump said after a military event at Fort Bragg, North Carolina. "In the meantime, we've lost a lot of lives while they talk. Legs blown off, arms blown off, faces blown off. We've been going on for a long time."
Washington wants nuclear talks with Iran to also cover the country's ballistic missiles, support for armed groups around the region and the treatment of the Iranian people. Iran has said it is prepared to discuss curbs on its nuclear program in exchange for lifting sanctions, but has ruled out linking the issue to missiles.

Trump has threatened strikes on Iran if no agreement is reached, while Tehran has vowed to retaliate, stoking fears of a wider war as the US amasses forces in the Middle East. The US targeted Iran's nuclear facilities in strikes last year.
When asked what was left to be targeted at the nuclear sites, Trump said the "dust." He added: "If we do it, that would be the least of the mission, but we probably grab whatever is left."
Long deployments
US officials described the complex process of moving military assets. The carrier Gerald R. Ford will join the carrier Abraham Lincoln, several guided-missile destroyers, fighter jets and surveillance aircraft that have been moved to the Middle East in recent weeks.
The Gerald R. Ford, the United States' newest and the world's largest carrier, has been operating in the Caribbean with its escort ships and took part in operations in Venezuela earlier this year.
Asked earlier on Friday why a second aircraft carrier was headed to the Middle East, Trump said: "In case we don't make a deal, we'll need it ... if we need it, we'll have it ready."
One of the officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the carrier would take at least a week to reach the Middle East.

The United States most recently had two aircraft carriers in the area last year, when it carried out strikes against Iranian nuclear sites in June.
With only 11 aircraft carriers in the US military's arsenal, they are a scarce resource and their schedules are usually set well in advance.
In a statement, US Southern Command, which oversees US military operations in Latin America, said it would continue to stay focused on countering "illicit activities and malign actors in the Western Hemisphere."
The Ford has essentially been at sea since June 2025. It was supposed to be operating in Europe before it was abruptly moved to the Caribbean in November.
While deployments for carriers usually last nine months, it is not uncommon for them to be extended during periods of increased US military activity.
Navy officials have long warned that long deployments at sea can damage morale on ships.
Officials said the administration had looked at sending a separate carrier, the Bush, to the Middle East, but it was undergoing certification and would take over a month to reach the Middle East.
The Ford, which has a nuclear reactor on board, can hold more than 75 military aircraft, including fighter aircraft like the F-18 Super Hornet jet and the E-2 Hawkeye, which can act as an early warning system.
The Ford also has sophisticated radar that can help control air traffic and navigation.
The supporting ships, such as the Ticonderoga-class guided missile cruiser Normandy, Arleigh Burke-class guided missile destroyers Thomas Hudner, Ramage, Carney, and Roosevelt, include surface-to-air, surface-to-surface and anti-submarine warfare capabilities.

Former Prime Minister of Norway, Thorbjorn Jagland, has been charged with "gross corruption" due to his connections with convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, according to a report by the New York Times (NYT).
Last week, economic crime investigators launched an inquiry into the relationships between Epstein and several individuals, including Jagland.
The charges against Jagland were filed a day after the Council of Europe decided to waive his diplomatic immunity, which had been granted due to his previous leadership role in the organization.
The NYT also reported that Norwegian police have searched several of Jagland's properties, and his lawyer publicly stated that Jagland is cooperating with the authorities.
Files released by the US Justice Department reportedly indicate substantial communications between Jagland and Epstein, including messages discussing meetings and stays at Epstein's properties.
Investigators are reportedly examining whether Jagland received any gifts, travel benefits, or loans from Epstein that were linked to his official positions, according to the NYT.
Russian ties?
The inquiry has also raised concerns about potential Russian connections involving individuals mentioned in the Epstein files.
According to the NYT, in a 2018 correspondence, Epstein reportedly wrote to Jagland, who was then the head of the Council of Europe, regarding President Vladimir Putin of Russia and his foreign minister, Sergey V. Lavrov.
In the exchange, Epstein suggested that Jagland might recommend that Lavrov speak with him for insights.
Although there is currently no evidence that Epstein confirmed any meeting with Lavrov, these communications have raised significant concerns.
Other senior figures in Norway named in the NYT report who are also under scrutiny following the release of the Epstein files include Crown Princess Mette-Marit and former Foreign Minister Borge Brende.

Indonesia’s Mount Semeru erupts sending hot clouds nearly 4 miles
Authorities warn residents to avoid riverbank near volcano
ISTANBUL
Indonesia’s Mount Semeru volcano in East Java erupted early Saturday, sending scorching clouds and ash 6 kilometers (3.7 miles) from its crater, according to state-run media.
The eruption occurred at 5.54 am (2254GMT Friday), with hot clouds traveling southeast toward the Besuk Kobokan river area, Antara News reported, citing a Semeru Observation Post official.
Ash drifted toward the north and northeast, forming a thick gray column rising 2,000 meters (6.561 feet) above the summit.
A second eruption followed at 7.25 am, producing an ash plume 1,500 meters above the peak. Seismic monitoring recorded significant volcanic tremors during both events.
Located along the border of Lumajang and Malang regencies in East Java province, Semeru remains at Level III Alert status, Indonesia’s second-highest warning level.
The Center for Volcanology and Geological Hazard Mitigation has urged residents and visitors to avoid activities within 13 kilometers (8 miles) of the crater in the southeast sector, particularly along the Besuk Kobokan river.
Authorities also warned against approaching riverbanks within 500 meters, citing the risk of lava flows and expanding hot clouds that could reach 17 kilometers from the summit.
Indonesia sits on the Pacific “Ring of Fire,” a zone of frequent seismic activity, and has more than 120 active volcanoes.
No immediate reports of major damage followed the eruptions.

Fire at oil refinery contained amid worsening fuel shortage in Cuba
No injuries, disruption reported, says Energy Ministry
ISTANBUL
A blaze at an oil refinery in Cuba was swiftly contained as the island grapples with a worsening fuel shortage, the Energy Ministry said Friday.
Black smoke was seen billowing from the Nico Lopez Refinery in Havana.
“The workday at the Nico Lopez Refinery continues with complete normalcy,” the ministry wrote on US social media company X.
It added that the fire was quickly brought under control, did not spread and was confined only to a warehouse containing disused products.
There were no injuries, and an investigation continues to determine the cause, it added.
Cuba’s fuel crisis has worsened after the US cut off oil supplies from longtime ally Venezuela, which had been shipping tens of thousands of barrels daily to the island.
The disruption followed a US operation that captured former Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro and the seizure of oil tankers, effectively halting key fuel deliveries.

Bangladesh's Tarique Rahman poised to become PM as Islamists concede defeat
Bangladesh's largest Islamist party conceded defeat in elections on Saturday, despite earlier alleging problems with the vote count, clearing the way for Bangladesh Nationalist Party leader Tarique Rahman to become prime minister after 17 years in self-imposed exile.

Bangladesh's largest Islamist party Jamaat-e-Islami said Saturday it had accepted the "overall outcome" of the election won by the rival nationalist party, despite earlier having alleged problems with the vote count.
The move clears the way for Tarique Rahman, the once exiled leader of the Bangladesh Nationalist Party, to become prime minister.
Election Commission figures showed Rahman's BNP had won a landslide victory in the elections on Thursday, the first since a deadly 2024 uprising ousted the iron-fisted rule of Sheikh Hasina.
The success of BNP chief Rahman, 60, marks a remarkable turnaround for a man who only returned to Bangladesh in December after 17 years in Britain, far from Dhaka's political storms.

Rahman, the scion of one of Bangladesh's most powerful political dynasties, is expected to make a victory speech later on Saturday.
His father, president Ziaur Rahman, was assassinated in 1981, while his mother, Khaleda Zia, served three terms as prime minister and dominated national politics for decades.

Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus, who has led the country of 170 million as interim leader since the uprising, said Rahman "would help guide the country toward stability, inclusiveness, and development".
The BNP alliance won 212 seats compared with 77 for the Jamaat-e-Islami-led alliance, according to the Electoral Commission.
'Verdict of the people'
Jamaat chief Shafiqur Rahman, 67, had said on Friday he would "seek redress" from the commission, with his party alleging "inconsistencies and fabrications".
But a day later, he conceded defeat.
"In any genuine democratic journey, the true test of leadership is not only how we campaign, but how we respond to the verdict of the people," the Jamaat leader said in a statement.
"We recognise the overall outcome, and we respect the rule of law."
Hasina's Awami League party was barred from taking part. Hasina, 78, who was sentenced to death in absentia for crimes against humanity, issued a statement from hiding in India decrying an "illegal and unconstitutional election".
The US embassy congratulated Rahman and the BNP for a "historic victory", while neighbouring India praised Rahman's "decisive win", a notable shift after deeply strained ties.
China and Pakistan, which both grew closer to Bangladesh since the 2024 uprising and the souring of ties with India, where Hasina has sheltered since her ouster, also congratulated the BNP.
International election observers said the polls had been a success, with the European Union saying Saturday they had been "credible".
The International Republican Institute noted that while "election administration was technically sound, the broader political environment remains fragile".
'Successful'
Jamaat's Rahman said his party "will serve as a vigilant, principled, and peaceful opposition, holding the government to account".
Election Commissioner Md Anwarul Islam Sarker told AFP that the vote had been a success.
"It was by far the best election," he said, noting that voting was cancelled at only one of the more than 42,000 polling centres.
"People had doubts about whether a successful election could be held under these circumstances, but we have done it," he said Saturday. "If anyone still has any issues, they can go to court."
The Election Commission said turnout was 59 percent across 299 constituencies out of 300 in which voting took place.
Only seven women were elected, although a further 50 seats in parliament reserved for women will be named from party lists.
Shafiqur Rahman stressed the significant gains his Islamist party had made compared with past elections, after years of being crushed under Hasina.
"With 77 seats, we have nearly quadrupled our parliamentary presence and become one of the strongest opposition blocs in modern Bangladeshi politics," he said. That is not a setback. That is a foundation."
Voters on Thursday also endorsed proposals in a referendum for a sweeping democratic reform charter backed by Yunus, to overhaul what he called a "completely broken" system of government and to prevent a return to one-party rule.
Those include prime ministerial term limits, a new upper house of parliament, stronger presidential powers and greater judicial independence.
Crisis Group analyst Thomas Kean warned that the incoming government now faced "daunting challenges", including "boosting the economy, ensuring security and continuing the reform process".

Nigerian rock artist wants people to pause and feel loved in the hustle and bustle of Lagos
In Nigeria's capital, a rock musician is taking to the streets with roses and a guitar to remind people to slow down and feel the love ahead of Valentine's Day
- Bookmark
Valentine's Day can be a secondary consideration for some in Lagos.
The Nigerian city of more than 20 million people is renowned for its hustle and bustle, its restless energy and commercial drive — a place where honks from signature yellow passenger buses fill the air.
But Lagos-based rock musician Bianca Okorocha, known as “Clayrocksu," wants people to pause and feel loved as Valentine's Day approaches.
She is taking her music offstage and onto the streets of the city, crooning love songs to random commuters and handing them single-stem roses.
Their faces, first shocked at the encounter, give way to a broad smile as she pulls the strings of her guitar, twanging to James Blunt’s “You are Beautiful.”
“I am a musician, and we just thought it was a special and nice thing to do for people,” Clayrocksu told The Associated Press. “Especially in this time and climate where everything is kind of difficult and all you hear on the news is bad news.”
Since Nigerian President Bola Tinubu came to power in 2023, he has undertaken major economic reforms, including the removal of a decades-old fuel subsidy program. The government said the changes would save costs and boost investment, but they have resulted in one of the West African nation’s worst cost of living crises in a generation.
The country’s deadly security crisis has also worsened the fate of millions, limiting access to farmland in the conflict-battered north, which in turn resulted in a surge in the prices of goods elsewhere, including in the economic hub of Lagos.
But amid the tough times, people like Clayrocksu are bringing joy and color to many across the vibrant city in this season of love.
Barbara Lulu, a Lagos resident, who got serenaded by Clayrocksu and her partner, was going about her day stressed until the rock team showed up.
“First off, this was a very shocking moment for me, because I never expected it. It just kind of happened, and all I can say is yay!” she said.
In a city where Valentine’s Day is usually focused on lovers, Clayrocksu said that she wants to change that perception and bring roses to many others.
“People think that Valentine’s Day is only about romantic gestures, only boyfriend and girlfriend, husband and wife,” she said. “But Valentine is really just about sharing love.”

A street in Ecuador’s largest city has been named after Mustafa Kemal Atatürk, founder of the Republic of Türkiye, following an initiative by the Turkish Embassy in Quito.
The inauguration ceremony in Guayaquil highlighted the bonds of friendship and cooperation between the two countries as officials formally opened the street bearing Atatürk’s name.
The event was attended by senior municipal officials, consular staff, members of the Ecuador–Türkiye Business Council, representatives of the energy company Karpowership, which operates three vessels in Ecuador and members of the Turkish community.
Türkiye’s Ambassador to Quito, Makbule Başak Yalçın, underlined the symbolic value of the Guayaquil Municipality’s decision, noting that it not only reflects the friendship between the two peoples but also honors the memory of Atatürk, an exceptional leader respected worldwide.
Yalçın thanked Türkiye’s Honorary Consul General in Guayaquil, Alvaro Dassum, for his efforts in completing the process, which lasted more than two years and expressed her appreciation to Karpowership for its financial support.
She added that Atatürk Street in Guayaquil reinforces the Turkish presence in the city, alongside symbolic locations in the capital such as Türkiye and Ankara streets and a Türkiye park, further strengthening ties between the two countries.
Drawing a comparison between Guayaquil, Ecuador’s commercial and cultural hub, and Istanbul, Yalçın said the newly inaugurated street would serve as a new bridge of friendship between the two nations united by shared values.

AI challenges authenticity of works by Flemish master Jan van Eyck
Unknown

15:29:00 KST

An Artificial Intelligence analysis of two paintings by the world-famous Flemish artist Jan van Eyck has raised an important question. Are the paintings really his work? Experts say they may be studio works that originated in Van Eyck's studio but were not painted by him. 'That could mean that there is a lost original somewhere that should be seen as more Van Eyck's work than these examples. The two paintings in question were once owned by the Bruges nobleman Anselm Adornes.
“Saint Francis Receiving the Stigmata” is the title of two almost identical, unsigned paintings attributed to Jan van Eyck, one of the greatest painters the Low Countries has ever produced. Worldwide, he is renowned for his keen eye for detail, his use of light and his oil painting technique. Only about 20 works from his oeuvre have survived.
Stigmata refers to the spontaneous appearance of bodily wounds, scars, or pain in locations corresponding to the crucifixion wounds of Jesus Christ. Primarily associated with Roman Catholicism, these marks are considered a mystical phenomenon, representing a physical union with the suffering of Christ.
One version of “Saint Francis Receiving the Stigmata” hangs in the Musei Reali in Turin, Italy, the other in the Philadelphia Museum of Art in the United States. Art lovers flock to admire them as happened when the works were on display at the major Van Eyck exhibition at the MSK Fine Arts Museum in Ghent in 2020.
But what if neither of these works is really a Van Eyck? That is a question that has arisen following a scientific analysis using artificial intelligence (AI) conducted by the Swiss company Art Recognition.
Art Recognition uses AI to verify the authenticity of paintings and drawings. The company works for auction houses, collectors, galleries and art dealers, and also carries out research projects, for seats of learning like Tilburg University in the Netherlands.
Art Recognition compares digital photographs of a work with a huge database of known, authentic works by the artist. In the case of “Saint Francis Receiving the Stigmata”, Art Recognition says that the version in Philadelphia was “91 per cent negative” and the version in Turin was “86 per cent negative”.
This would suggest that there is little certainty that Van Eyck actually painted these works himself.
So are they studio paintings?
A few weeks ago the analysis of Van Eyck's work was discussed on the podcast “Is it? The Art Mystery Podcast” with American art historian Noah Charney. He is also an author and is regularly asked to act as an expert in cases of suspected art forgery or crime.
In each episode, he asks whether a specific painting was really created by the famous master. Charney was surprised when he saw the analysis of “Saint Francis Receiving the Stigmata”. “The negative result for both works was so astonishing that in-depth tests were carried out to confirm the results,” he says.
Charney spoke with Till-Holger Borchert, former director of Bruges Museums Musea Brugge and one of the foremost Van Eyck experts. According to Borchert, the analysis supports earlier suggestions by experts that both versions of “Saint Francis Receiving the Stigmata” are studio paintings. This means that they were made in the artist's studio, but not necessarily by the artist himself.
Borchert also felt the high negative score was pretty surprising but says that the AI analysis of the artworks mainly raises questions that need to be investigated further.
Is there a lost original out there somewhere?
Charney himself thought that the painting in Turin would be confirmed as an original, and the version in Philadelphia as a copy, originating from Van Eyck's studio or from a later period. ‘The negative results suggest that the two versions are studio works,’ says Charney.
‘If a work comes from Van Eyck's studio, that does not necessarily mean that he actually painted all aspects of it himself,’ he explains. ‘That's a misconception that people have retained from the 19th-century image of the lonely artist in an attic room in Paris drinking absinthe, smoking cigarettes, wearing a beret and doing every aspect of the work himself.’
‘All this could mean that there is a lost original somewhere that is much more Van Eyck's work than these copies.’
Once belonged to Bruges aristocrat Anselm Adornes
Both Francis paintings also have an additional link with Flanders. In 1470 the Bruges nobleman and businessman Anselm Adornes mentions the works in his will. He was about to embark on a pilgrimage to the Holy Land, feared for his life, and bequeathed a painting of Saint Francis by Van Eyck to each of his two daughters. His daughters Margriet and Louise were both nuns; it is not clear whether they ever received the paintings. Anselm Adornes returned safely from his pilgrimage, as evidenced by the Jerusalem Chapel and the Adornes estate in Bruges.
Rubens's “Samson and Delilah” and fake masterpieces on eBay
Art Recognition has built up quite a reputation since it was established in 2018. In 2021, with the help of AI, the company concluded that Peter Paul Rubens's masterpiece “Samson and Delilah” was 91 per cent likely not to have been painted by the Flemish baroque master. There had long been doubts about the work, which is on display at the National Gallery in London.
In 2024, Art Recognition was able to identify dozens of suspected fakes that were being touted as authentic on the auction site eBay. These included works by Claude Monet and Pierre-Auguste Renoir. The Monet was offered for $600,000, the Renoir for $165,000, but were 95 per cent likely to be fake.
This was a boost for Carina Popovici, co-founder and director of Art Recognition, who wants to use AI analyses to detect forgeries in the art world with greater accuracy and protect buyers. At the same time, AI should help museums, collectors and auction houses to make the verification process of artworks more objective, accurate and faster.
The high negative results for “Saint Francis Receiving the Stigmata” also surprised her. She had thought that if one painting was negative, the other would be positive. ‘But no, they were both negative,’ she told UK daily The Guardian.
‘I don't think the museums in Philadelphia and Turin will be happy with this. It's not good news for them.’
The Guardian contacted both museums for comment but has not yet received a response.
Art Recognition previously conducted an analysis of “The Portrait of Giovanni Arnolfini and his Wife”, another famous work by Jan van Eyck. That analysis yielded an 89 per cent probability that it was authentic.

'Virgin' frescoes emerge from Pompeii suburb

Tourists visit the 1st century BC luxurious residence of Poppaea Sabina (Poppea), second wife of the Emperor Nero, in Pompeii on Febuary 12, 2026.
Amid the remains of a sumptuous villa near Pompeii, the hard-hatted conservationist scraped away centuries-old ash to reveal a vibrant red fresco.
For the first time on Feb. 12, visitors were allowed in to see the renovations underway at Villa Poppaea, a pleasure palace of Ancient Rome destroyed by the eruption of Vesuvius in 79 A.D.
"It's important, now that we're almost finished, to start reopening the villa and allowing everyone to visit it," said Arianna Spinosa, the director of the archaeological site near Naples, southern Italy.
The villa was the home of the Emperor Nero's second wife, Poppaea Sabina, whom some believe he later killed, and was being renovated at the time of the volcanic eruption.
The latest discoveries were found in its oldest section, which date back to the middle of the first century B.C.
"Each excavation is a surprise," Spinosa told AFP during a visit to the ruins, which on a wet February morning resembled a building site.
"We certainly expected to find some of the frescoes that could be seen on the other wall, but the surprises were, of course, far more numerous.
"First of all, because of the colors that appeared, so vivid in their authenticity."
Among the discoveries were the legs of a graceful bird set against the backdrop of a yellow frieze emerging out of the mud, a peacock missing only its head.
It was found in the villa's most impressive room, the main salon, which has a mirrored wall.
The peacock, a sacred animal associated with the goddess Juno, is "one of the decorative motifs that recurs very frequently in the decoration of the villa", noted Giuseppe Scarpati, the site's chief archaeologist.
'Virgin surfaces'
Depicting birds, fish and fruit, the newly-discovered frescoes are breathtaking in their intricacy, but it is their colours that really stand out.
"This vibrant red panel bears original, untreated pigments," Spinosa explained.
Such "virgin surfaces" are hugely valuable to those studying the villa and its former occupants, she said.
The villa is part of Oplontis, an archaeological site of Roman-era buildings between Pompeii and Herculaneum, in the modern town of Torre Annunziata.
The Villa Poppaea, a grand residential complex also known as Villa A, was discovered by chance during the construction of a canal at the end of the 16th century.
Excavations began in the 18th century.
In 1974, archaeologists found the remains of a second building, so-called Villa B, during the construction of a school sports hall.
Unlike the first building, Villa B, which was used for the processing of wine and oil, is closed to the public.
Elena Gravina, the chief conservator of the Villa Poppaea, said it was a site of "exceptional quality, both in design and quality".
Archaeologists had identified bright red cinnabar and Egyptian blue pigments, which "were very expensive and difficult to obtain at the time", she told the first visitors Thursday.
"They testify to the commercial connections and the wealth of the patrons, as well as the skill and expertise of the artisans."
From now on, groups of up to ten people will be able to visit the site each Thursday morning, obtaining a glimpse of the frescoes but also the experts at work, in the dirt and under scaffolding.
Only 50 to 60 percent of the overall area of the villa has been excavated so far, so there is still work to be done.
"We don't know its boundaries to the north, east, or west. Potentially, the villa could still hold many surprises for us," Scarpati told AFP.

US Secretary of State Marco Rubio is set to address the Munich Security Conference on Saturday at a time of strained ties between Europe and the United States, a day after German Chancellor Friedrich Merz opened the annual gathering with a plea to "repair and revive transatlantic trust together". Follow our blog for the latest developments and watch Rubio's speech live on FRANCE 24 at 9am local time (GMT+1).
Rattled by Trump, European leaders call for a 'strong Europe'
Bruised by Trump's designs on Greenland and his often hostile comments about America's traditional bedrock allies, European leaders in Munich have pledged to shoulder more of the burden of shared NATO defences.
Key leaders have pushed the message that this is essential for Europe to counter a hostile Russia, with NATO chief Mark Rutte saying that "a strong Europe in a strong NATO means that the transatlantic bond will be stronger than ever".
"This is the right time for a strong Europe," said French President Emmanuel Macron, who stressed on Friday that the continent was "clear in the support of Ukraine" and "building its own architecture of security".

Russian strike kills Odesa woman, Zelensky to address Munich conference
An overnight Russian drone strike on Odesa set a residential building on fire and killed a woman inside, the governor of the southern Ukrainian region has said.
Northeast of the Black Sea port region, a barrage on Zaporizhzhia region in the past 24 hours killed at least one person and wounded three others, regional military chief Ivan Fedorov said.
The latest deadly attacks come as US and European leaders gather in Munich, with how to end the war in Ukraine high on the agenda.
A German government source said Chancellor Friedrich Merz and US Secretary of State Marco Rubio discussed "Ukraine, the status of negotiations with Russia and further support for the country, particularly in terms of military aid".
Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky, who has been in Munich since Friday and meeting multiple allies, is expected to address the meeting later today.
UK's Starmer urges 'sleeping giant' Europe to curb dependence on US
British leader Keir Starmer is expected to describe Europe as "a sleeping giant" that must rely less on the US for its defence when he addresses the Munich gathering later today.
Starmer's office said the UK prime minister will argue that the continent must shift from overdependence on the United States towards a more European NATO.
"I'm talking about a vision of European security and greater European autonomy that does not herald US withdrawal but answers the call for more burden sharing in full and remakes the ties that have served us so well," Starmer is expected to say.
When will Rubio speak?
Washington's top diplomat is set to address the Munich conference at 9am local time (GMT+1). That's 3am Eastern Standard Time.

Even the US 'cannot go it alone', says Germany's Merz
In his opening address on Friday, German Chancellor Friedrich Merz called for the United States and Europe to "repair and revive trans-Atlantic trust together", warning that even the US isn't powerful enough to go it alone in an world whose old order has withered.
Merz called for a "new trans-Atlantic partnership", acknowledging that "a divide, a deep rift" has opened up across the Atlantic.
The German host said that the post-World War II world order, "as imperfect as it was at its best times, no longer exists" today.
Welcome to our live blog
US Secretary of State Marco Rubio is set to address European leaders in Munich as they try to step up their autonomy in defence while salvaging transatlantic ties badly strained under President Donald Trump.

Koan: Where identity is written on plate

In Copenhagen, two-Michelin-starred Koan transforms Kristian Baumann’s Korean-Danish heritage into a layered gastronomic narrative where memory, migration and technique meet, turning each plate into a dialogue between East and West
Koan in Copenhagen constructs a culinary language shaped not only by technical mastery but by narrative identity. Emerging from Kristian Baumann’s personal story, this language becomes a stage where not only flavors but also knowledge and memory are exchanged between East and West.
In recent years, Copenhagen’s gastronomic scene has been read not solely through the lens of technical excellence, but increasingly through narratives of identity. The New Nordic movement, once centered firmly on locality, has entered a new phase: Kitchens articulated through origin, memory and experiences of migration are coming to the forefront. Kristian Baumann’s Koan stands among the most striking examples of this transformation.
Baumann’s story forms the foundation of his cuisine. Born in South Korea, raised in Denmark, and professionally shaped at the center of Scandinavian gastronomy, his narrative is reflected in the restaurant’s approach. What we encounter at Koan is not an attempt at technical fusion; rather, it is the gastronomic outcome of confronting one’s own biography. The menu investigates not merely how ingredients from two geographies can be combined, but how two cultural memories might converse. Even the restaurant’s name — referencing the Zen concept of paradoxical questions known as “koans” — openly reflects this perspective. This cuisine does not seek to provide answers; it asks questions: Where does belonging begin and where does culture end?
To understand Koan’s two-Michelin-starred kitchen, it would be reductive to view it simply as a merging of Korean and Nordic techniques. A more precise reading emerges through the encounter of two distinct systems of culinary knowledge. Western gastronomy has historically advanced through measurability and methodology, whereas in Eastern culinary traditions, knowledge often evolves through intuitive transmission and memory. On Koan’s plates, these approaches do not clash; they intertwine. Nordic discipline in product sourcing speaks with Korea’s fermented memory and the plate becomes less a conclusion than a vehicle through which intercultural knowledge circulates.
While the menu changes, the restaurant’s gastronomic language can be read through certain structural constants and during the evening I experienced, this approach was clearly perceptible. One of the most striking examples was the white kimchi dish. Its layered structure, unfolding toward a floral form and marked by visual clarity, signaled a deliberate distancing from the expected sharpness of fermented cuisines. Upon tasting, crisp texture, gentle acidity, and quiet depth progressed together — and as the inherent clarity of this chili-free kimchi met Nordic minimalism, the dish positioned itself at the center of the narrative unfolding here.
This same trajectory continued in the menu’s reference to sundae. The allusion to the Korean blood sausage tradition reflected not literal reproduction, but an interpretive engagement with cultural memory. Rather than offering a directly identifiable reference, the dish created an emotional terrain that felt familiar yet difficult to classify — one of the defining effects of diaspora cuisine. On the seafood side, the use of langoustine clearly expressed Nordic product focus, while its integration with Korean flavor architecture materialized the bridge between the two geographies. Plates centered on tofu and rice — particularly gamasot rice — pointed toward a culinary mentality focused less on technical spectacle and more on the potential of fundamental ingredients. The texture of the rice and its quiet confidence in presentation conveyed a sense that the meal was oriented toward narrative construction rather than performance.
Taken together, these dishes transform the Koan experience from a sum of individual courses into a holistic gastronomic narrative in which identity, fermented memory and product discipline unfold in layered dialogue over the time spent at the table.
Koan’s rapid rise to international visibility demonstrates how narrative power has become as decisive as technical performance in the fine dining world. Today, gastronomy is no longer solely a matter of ingredient selection or technical mastery; it is an arena for expressing identity, an architecture of memory and a circulation of intercultural knowledge. For this reason, understanding Koan requires more than looking at the plate — it requires reading the story.

Crowds flock to Istanbul's Museum of Innocence before TV adaptation

Visitors look at the display cases in The Museum of Innocence in Istanbul.
On a cobbled street in Çukurcuma, a district known for its antiques shops on Istanbul's European side, the story penned by Nobel laureate Orhan Pamuk in his bestselling novel "The Museum of Innocence" has been brought to life.
Inside a red-painted house, visitors are confronted by a wall of 4,213 cigarette butts, many of them lipstick-stained, others angrily stubbed out, all obsessively kept by the book's protagonist, Kemal Basmacı.
The museum, opened by Pamuk in 2012, mirrors the novel’s 83 chapters with 83 display cases filled with jewelry, photographs, cinema tickets and bottles of Meltem soda, evoking 1970s Istanbul and a love story spiraling into fixation.
Interest has surged ahead of the nine-part Netflix adaptation, released on Feb. 13. Since trailers began airing, daily visitors have risen from around 200 to 500, according to museum staff.
The series, produced by Istanbul-based Ay Yapım, stars Selahattin Paşalı as Kemal and Eylül Kandemir as Füsun, and was directed by Zeynep Günay.
Set in the 1970s, it follows a wealthy young man devastated by the loss of his distant cousin and lover, prompting him to collect objects tied to her memory over eight years.
Pamuk details fight for creative control
In an interview with the New York Times, published before the premiere, Pamuk described a years-long struggle to bring the novel to screen on his own terms.
He said he had previously signed with an unnamed Hollywood company but was “horrified” by a script that strayed far from the 500-page narrative, adding a new plotline he felt distorted the story. After a legal battle, he regained the rights in 2022.
Pamuk partnered with Ay Yapım, remaining closely involved in a four-year script process he described as exacting.
He declined advance payments and refused to sign contracts until the screenplay was complete, insisting the museum be credited alongside the book and that no second season be produced, regardless of success.
The digital premiere marks a late career first for Türkiye’s most internationally recognized novelist.
With the book translated into more than 60 languages, the adaptation is expected to expand its global reach further — and offers another showcase for Türkiye’s booming television industry, now the world’s third-largest exporter of TV series after the United States and the United Kingdom.

Turkish interest in Greek residency soars via Golden Visa scheme

Turkish nationals securing Greek residence permits through the Golden Visa program have seen a dramatic surge recently, with a particularly sharp increase last year, Greek media has reported.
Data cited by the Greek daily Kathimerini show that applications from Turkish citizens jumped by 160 percent last year compared with the previous year, reaching 3,291 successful applicants.
This placed Turks second only to Chinese nationals among Golden Visa beneficiaries.
The report notes that this surge is primarily driven by wealthy Turkish investors seeking to protect their savings from high inflation at home.
Beyond wealth preservation, Greek real estate is increasingly viewed as a dual-benefit asset, offering both robust rental yields and long-term capital appreciation.
According to Greek media, financial returns are not the sole motivation.
For many Turkish applicants, the ability to travel freely within Schengen, along with political concerns and family security considerations, plays a significant role.
Greece introduced its Golden Visa scheme in July 2013, granting renewable residency permits to non-EU nationals who make a qualifying investment — most commonly through real estate.
In addition to legal residence in Greece, holders gain visa-free travel within the Schengen Area, making the program especially attractive to international investors.
Last year, the majority of approved Golden Visa holders in Greece came from Türkiye, Israel, China, Iran and the United States.

Rubio at Munich security meet to address Europeans rattled by Trump

U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio was set to address European leaders on Saturday as they try to step up their autonomy in defense while salvaging transatlantic ties badly strained under President Donald Trump.
Bruised by Trump's designs on Greenland and his often hostile comments about America's traditional bedrock allies, European leaders gathered at the Munich Security Conference have pledged to shoulder more of the burden of shared NATO defenses.
Key leaders have pushed the message that this is essential for Europe to counter a hostile Russia, with NATO chief Mark Rutte saying that "a strong Europe in a strong NATO means that the transatlantic bond will be stronger than ever".
"This is the right time for a strong Europe," said French President Emmanuel Macron, who stressed on Friday that the continent was "clear in the support of Ukraine" and "building its own architecture of security".
"This Europe will be a good ally and partner for the United States of America."
British leader Keir Starmer was expected to tell the conference that Europe is "a sleeping giant" and must rely less on the United States for its defense.
"I'm talking about a vision of European security and greater European autonomy that does not herald U.S. withdrawal but answers the call for more burden sharing in full and remakes the ties that have served us so well," he will say, according to his office.
Rubio is seen as a more conciliatory choice of U.S. envoy, a year after Vice President JD Vance used the same stage to attack European policies on immigration and free speech, shocking European allies.
The Trump administration's new National Security Strategy similarly launched an unprecedented attack against Europeans, charging that the continent is threatened with "civilisational decline".
Ties plunged further last month when Trump stepped up threats to annex Greenland, an autonomous territory of NATO ally Denmark, forcing European nations to stand firm in protest.
Ukraine war in focus
German Chancellor Friedrich Merz acknowledged a "rift" had opened up between Europe and the United States, fuelled by culture wars, but issued an appeal to Washington: "Let's repair and revive transatlantic trust together."
"In the era of great power rivalry, even the United States will not be powerful enough to go it alone," said the conservative leader, who has ramped up defense spending in the top EU economy.
The high-powered Munich meeting of government leaders, diplomats, defense and intelligence chiefs comes shortly before Russia's full-scale war on Ukraine is set to enter its fifth gruelling year.
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, who has been in Munich since Friday and meeting multiple allies, was expected to address the meeting on Saturday. No Russian officials have been invited.
At the White House on Friday, Trump urged him to "get moving" to end the war. "Russia wants to make a deal... He has to move," the U.S. leader said.
A German government source said Merz and Rubio met at the conference Friday and discussed "Ukraine, the status of negotiations with Russia and further support for the country, particularly in terms of military aid".
They also discussed Europe's role in NATO and "Rubio praised Germany's steps to strengthen the alliance", the source added.
Macron said a new framework was needed to deal with "an aggressive Russia" once the fighting in Ukraine ends.
Kremlin critic Mikhail Khodorkovsky said he feared "a new cold war" between Europe and Russia in the coming decade, making reopening dialogue with Moscow essential.
"If it makes sense to talk, we are willing to talk," said Merz, but he also charged that "Russia is not yet willing to talk seriously".

Trump says change of power in Iran would be 'best thing'

U.S. President Donald Trump said Friday that a change of government in Iran would be the "best thing that could happen," as he sent a second aircraft carrier to the Middle East to ratchet up military pressure on the Islamic republic.
Trump's comments were his most overt call yet for the toppling of Iran's clerical establishment, and came as he pushes on Washington's arch-foe Tehran to make a deal to limit its nuclear program.
At the same time, the exiled son of the Iranian shah toppled in the 1979 Islamic revolution renewed his calls for international intervention following a bloody crackdown on protests by Tehran.
"Seems like that would be the best thing that could happen," Trump told reporters at the Fort Bragg military base in North Carolina when a journalist asked if he wanted "regime change" in Iran.
Trump declined to say who he would want to take over in Iran from supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, but he added that "there are people."
He has previously backed off full-throated calls for a change of government in Iran, warning that it could cause chaos, although he has made threats towards Khamenei in the past.
Speaking earlier at the White House, Trump said that the USS Gerald R. Ford — the world's largest warship — would be "leaving very soon" for the Middle East to up the pressure on Iran.
"In case we don't make a deal, we'll need it," Trump said.
The giant vessel is currently in the Caribbean following the U.S. overthrow of Venezuela's Nicolas Maduro. Another carrier, the USS Abraham Lincoln, is one of 12 U.S. ships already in the Middle East.
'Terribly difficult'
When Iran began its crackdown on protests last month — which rights groups say killed thousands — Trump initially said that the United States was "locked and loaded" to help demonstrators.
But he has recently focused his military threats on Tehran's nuclear program, which U.S. forces struck last July during Israel's unprecedented 12-day war with Iran.
The protests have subsided for now but U.S.-based Reza Pahlavi, the son of Iran's last shah, urged international intervention to support the Iranian people.
"We are asking for a humanitarian intervention to prevent more innocent lives being killed in the process," he told the Munich Security Conference.
It followed a call by the opposition leader, who has not returned to his country since before the revolution, for Iranians at home and abroad to continue demonstrations this weekend.
Videos verified by AFP showed people in Iran this week chanting anti-government slogans as the clerical leadership celebrated the anniversary of the Islamic revolution.
Iran and the United States, who have had no diplomatic relations since shortly after the revolution, held talks on the nuclear issue last week in Oman. No dates have been set for new talks yet.
The West fears the program is aimed at making a bomb, which Tehran denies.
The head of the U.N. nuclear watchdog, Rafael Grossi, said Friday that reaching an accord with Iran on inspections of its processing facilities was possible but "terribly difficult."
Reformists released
Trump said after talks with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu earlier this week that he wanted to continue talks with Iran, defying pressure from his key ally for a tougher stance.
The Israeli prime minister himself expressed skepticism at the quality of any agreement if it didn't also cover Iran's ballistic missiles and support for regional proxies.
According to the U.S.-based Human Rights Activists News Agency, 7,008 people, mostly protesters, were killed in the recent crackdown, although rights groups warn the toll is likely far higher.
More than 53,000 people have also been arrested, it added.
The Norway-based Iran Human Rights (IHR) NGO said "hundreds" of people were facing charges linked to the protests that could see them sentenced to death.
Figures working within the Iranian system have also been arrested, with three politicians detained this week from the so-called reformist wing of Iranian politics supportive of President Masoud Pezeshkian.
The three — Azar Mansouri, Javad Emam and Ebrahim Asgharzadeh — were released on bail Thursday and Friday, their lawyer Hojjat Kermani told the ISNA news agency.

What it means to live without security as an Arab citizen in Israel - opinion
Unknown
Unknown Publisher

15:13:52 KST

I was on my way to pick up my daughters from school when it happened.
In the middle of the main street, in broad daylight, a young man on a motorcycle pulled out a gun and fired into the air. I froze. Around me were parents just like me, walking to collect their children. People were shocked and frightened, but not surprised.
This is Nazareth, the northern Israeli city where I live. Guns are everywhere. Crime and violence are all-pervasive. I am not being dramatic: People from Palestinian communities inside Israel go to the hospital for gunshot wounds at a rate that is six times higher than their Jewish neighbors. In just the first six weeks of 2026, 42 people have been murdered; that’s nearly one a day.
This is not because Arab communities are more “violent” by nature or because we are poor. It is a symptom of a political reality in which Palestinian citizens of Israel, more than 20% of the country’s population, have been abandoned by their government, left to the mercy of illegal weapons, extortion, drugs, and organized crime. Personal security ought not be a radical demand. It is the most basic condition of citizenship.
The crisis stems from long years of Arab citizens being denied opportunities offered to their Israeli fellow citizens. Arab men face far higher unemployment so that our youth, especially young men, are often left without prospects. There is no social safety net to catch them. And so their hopelessness, at ever making money, getting married, building a life for themselves, leaves them vulnerable to criminal recruitment.
For our community, there is, at long last, some momentum around breaking our own internal silences, strengthening our sense of agency, and building our own power and resilience in the face of our sense of abandonment and despair.
Palestinian citizens left to fend for themselves
For Americans, Israel is usually discussed through the lens of Israeli occupation of the West Bank and the war in Gaza, and indeed, these are the great nightmares of our time. Far less visible is what happens inside Israel’s own borders, where Palestinian citizens are being left to fend for themselves with no functioning police force against criminal networks armed with military-grade weapons.
In other words, on top of policies enabling settler violence and annexation of new West Bank territories, and on top of continuing to bomb Gaza intermittently despite the ceasefire, there appears to be a deliberate policy to weaken, exhaust, and kill the Palestinian community inside of Israel itself.
Yes, we are at the mercy of a racist minister of national security, Itamar Ben Gvir, the Israeli lawmaker convicted on counts of incitement to (Jewish) racism and support for a (Jewish) terrorist group, who has told the police force to deprioritize our community’s safety. But it goes so much deeper than that.
Jewish and Palestinian citizens standing together
In the face of all of this, less than two weeks ago, tens of thousands of Jews and Arabs filled the streets of Tel Aviv in a protest that should not have been necessary. Not because it wasn’t justified, but because in a functioning state, citizens should not have to demonstrate to demand protection for their lives.
When Jewish and Palestinian citizens stood together to remind the government, loudly and peacefully, that enforcing the law is its responsibility, I felt something I hadn’t felt in a long time: hope. If the Jewish community truly stands with the Arab one, we might finally build the pressure necessary for real, much more significant change, not just for one protest, but for a shared future.
The scale of the crisis is staggering. In 2025 alone, 252 Palestinian citizens of Israel were killed. It was the deadliest year on record. This, as homicide rates among the Jewish population remain far, far lower. In 2024, the Arab population saw 220 homicides; the Jewish community, which is roughly four times the size of the Arab one, saw just 58. The rate is obscene; there are 14 Arab murders for every 1 Jewish one. This gap cannot be explained away as cultural or inherent; it reflects disparities in policing, investment, and pure attention.
In towns and cities like mine, everyone already knows what the police claim is impossible to track. People know who was murdered, why, who threatened whom, and where the weapons are. The information is open, shared, and visible. The only actor choosing not to act is the state, through a police force weakened, politicized, and, too often, indifferent to Palestinian lives.
Arab murders are simply not investigated with the same rigor as Jewish murders. In 2025, fewer than 10% of cases were solved, compared with roughly 65% for murders of Jewish Israelis.
The violence in Arab communities is not limited to deaths. Hundreds are wounded every year by shootings, car bombs, and assassination attempts. Last year, this violence turned 231 children into orphans. And thousands live under constant threat: business owners, teenagers, teachers, municipal workers, and elected officials. Arab mayors warn they cannot govern without basic protection. Some are extorted. Some are threatened. Entire towns have seen criminal networks fill the enforcement void while the state stands by.
Take the case of Ali Zbeidat, a grocery store owner in Sakhnin, who helped ignite the current wave of protests. After criminals riddled his shop with bullets and sent him repeated death threats and demands for “protection” money, he made an extremely courageous choice: He publicly shut down his business and called for a general strike of Arab workers. He told the Israeli press something that I believe: “People’s safety is more important than money.” And his call took off. Shops, schools, and institutions closed in solidarity, and tens of thousands marched demanding action.
A deadly feedback loop
The result is a deadly feedback loop: Violence grows, trust in authorities collapses, and citizens are told, implicitly and explicitly, that their safety matters less.
For Americans who see Israel as a democracy committed to equality, this should be deeply unsettling. Citizenship is not real if protection is selective. Democracy cannot survive if a fifth of the population is treated as a security problem rather than as people entitled to security.
What makes this moment different is that the silence is breaking. The question now is whether Israel’s government will listen, and whether Israel’s friends abroad, especially in the United States, will notice that this struggle is not peripheral, but central to what it means for Israel to call itself a democracy.
A country ought to be judged, first and foremost, by how it treats those who live under its own flag. Abandoning Palestinian citizens to organized crime is a moral, civic, and democratic failure at the heart of the state. This is not the shared future for Jews and Arabs that I work for; it is the present that Itamar Ben-Gvir has given us.
The gunshots I saw and heard on my way to pick up my daughters were not random. They were political. They were the sound of a government withdrawing from its responsibility to protect all its people.
This needs to change. And if Arabs and Jews, and all those around the world who care about Israel, work together, it will.

Israeli shark diving community pushes to reopen Hadera beach after fatal attack
Unknown

15:12:23 KST

For nearly a year now, Eliran Ovadia has struggled to reunite with his favorite marine apex predators.
Since last April, following the fatal shark attack in which diver Barak Tzach, 40, was killed near the Hadera stream outlet, the city’s diving zone has been closed. The site, located near the Orot Rabin power plant, had long served as a magnet for sharks and the divers who came to observe them.
Despite the tragedy, Ovadia, a diving instructor for 27 years and owner of the “Middle East Divers” school, insists sharks are not inherently dangerous animals. In his view, their fearsome reputation is largely a public relations failure.
“It’s an injustice that Steven Spielberg did to them in ‘Jaws,’” he said. “Most of the population, here and worldwide, is afraid of this animal. Why? Because of the movies. People see sharp teeth and panic. The fear is not justified in relation to reality. For me, it’s a fish. Yes, a top predator, but still a fish.”
A big fish, and one that can be dangerous in certain circumstances.
“The gap between what people imagine and what actually happens is enormous,” Ovadia said. “Of course you have to learn about it, and I’m not recommending anyone go to a beach marked ‘Danger: Sharks’ and jump in freely. Absolutely not. Like anything in life, before you do it, you need to study it and train with professionals.”
Ovadia, 49, who lives in Moshav Ganei Yohanan, began diving at 21, shortly after completing his military service. His first encounter with a shark came while working at a fish farm in Ashdod.
“We were a few guys there and didn’t really understand what was happening or how to behave, but it was fascinating. It just swam around us and disappeared. That day I realized it’s not such a big deal to dive with sharks. Everyone stays in their own world, even when you meet by chance in the depths.”
An apex predator with an ecological role
According to Ovadia, sharks play a critical ecological role that many people overlook.
“The shark sits at the top of the food chain and has a role in ecological balance,” he said. “If there are no sharks, we could see invasive species here, like lionfish from the Red Sea or sea urchins that start multiplying. The shark eats them. If there’s no predator for those just below it, they multiply and multiply.”
Hadera became Israel’s unofficial shark capital largely because of the Orot Rabin power plant. Warm water discharged as part of the electricity production process creates a relatively comfortable winter habitat. Schools of fish gather in the heated currents, providing a steady food source.
“Because of the warm water, fish are there all year, so prey is available,” Ovadia explained. “The artificial current also allows sharks to live there more easily. A shark needs movement to survive. If you catch a shark and stop it from moving, it can die. Around the world, sharks live in areas with strong currents that keep them active.”
Most shark activity in Israel is concentrated off Hadera, Ashkelon and Ashdod, but Hadera has the largest aggregation. “Just recently I counted about 100 sharks there using drone footage,” he said. “We’ve been living this for 13 years as divers.”
The dominant species are the dusky shark and the sandbar shark, which arrive with the cold, typically from November and December through April, when water temperatures range between 20 and 24 degrees Celsius. In summer, when temperatures climb to around 30 degrees, they migrate onward.
From curiosity to catastrophe
For years, the site drew divers and curious onlookers. In November 2018, the Hadera municipality even issued a public call to regulate boat tours that would allow people to view sharks in a controlled and safe manner. The initiative eventually stalled.
Everything changed after Tzach’s death. He entered the water near the stream outlet, where crowds had gathered to observe the sharks, and was fatally attacked. Since then, authorities have prohibited shark enthusiasts from entering the beach. Inspectors patrol the area and issue warnings to divers who attempt to go in.
The diving community refuses to give up. If they are blocked from shore, some reach the area by motorboat. Recently, enthusiasts organized, launched a petition and are considering a future class-action lawsuit to challenge what they call a sweeping and unjustified ban.
“There is no law that forbids seeing sharks, so why block us?” Ovadia asked. “We have regulated diving clubs under large international organizations. We teach shark history, species, physiology, reproduction, ecology and risk awareness. And yes, also about danger, even though most shark species today are not dangerous.”
He acknowledges that sharks are opportunistic animals and can become more active under certain conditions, such as before storms, when marine life enters a feeding mode. “But for us as scuba divers, I don’t want to say incidents don’t exist, but they are almost nonexistent. In nearly 100 percent of encounters, nothing happens.”
Still, as the fatal attack showed, it takes only one exception to cause tragedy.
“In Hadera, the dusky and sandbar sharks simply pass by you,” he said. “They have no interest in us. When we’re face to face, the shark sees our size, the bubbles, something unfamiliar. Through its senses, it understands we are not food and just swims on.”
‘A rare natural spectacle’
Israel’s shark enthusiasts number in the thousands. Among them is Dafna Blum-Zeira, 57, a divorced mother of three, two of them certified divers, who only caught the diving bug last year.
“When people ask why dive with sharks, I answer: Why do you go to Jerusalem? Because it’s beautiful and impressive,” she said. “It’s the same thing. This is a rare spectacle that happens under specific conditions. We have to be part of it.”
She describes diving in general as overwhelming. “You descend into deep water and suddenly see natural and archaeological treasures, and beautiful sharks. It gives you chills, not because of fear or cold water. When you come up after 40 minutes, you realize how little we know about the depths.”
Adir Magen, 47, a professional diver from Tel Aviv who often dives with his 17-year-old son, emphasized that enthusiasts are not encouraging the public to jump into shark waters freely.
“The sea is the sharks’ home, and we teach people how to protect them and nature,” he said. “There is risk, just like driving a car is risky, but we operate under strict safety rules. We go down with one instructor for every two divers and conduct proper briefings before every dive. Statistically, shark attacks on humans represent a tiny fraction. It’s not supposed to happen.”
Michal Nigkar, 40, from Ashkelon, encountered her first shark while diving in Sinai. “It was frightening for a moment,” she admitted. “I had a terrible fear of water as a child, but 11 years ago I decided to fight it. It’s about inner work and calmness. This isn’t about flirting with danger. Everything is supervised. Like birdwatching, we observe sharks.”
Waiting for next winter
As the shark season nears its end, enthusiasts know they have already lost this year. Soon the sharks will raise their fins and continue on, away from Hadera’s smokestacks.
The divers hope that next winter they will once again be allowed into the water — not from balconies or video screens, but face to face with what they see as a misunderstood marvel of nature.
“The death of the diver created trauma,” said Shay Gispan, 51, a diver and partner in a local diving club. “But it doesn’t justify an indefinite blanket ban. Diving should be allowed through clubs and professionals, not freely without supervision. With guidance and oversight, it becomes a completely different experience.”

Award-winning Indian writer Arundhati Roy has said she is withdrawing from the Berlin Film Festival over jury president Wim Wenders’ comments that cinema should “stay out of politics” when asked about Gaza.
Roy said in a statement on Friday that she was “shocked and disgusted” by responses from Wenders and other jury members to a question about the Palestinian territory at a press conference the day before.
Roy, whose novel The God of Small Things won the 1997 Booker Prize, had been announced as a festival guest to present a restored version of the 1989 film In Which Annie Gives It Those Ones, in which she starred and wrote the screenplay.

However, she said that the “unconscionable” statements by Wenders and other jury members had led her to reconsider, “with deep regret”.
When asked about Germany’s support for Israel at Thursday’s press conference, Wenders said: “We cannot really enter the field of politics”, describing filmmakers as “the counterweight to politics”.
Fellow jury member Ewa Puszczynska said it was a “little bit unfair” to expect the jury to take a direct stance on the issue.

China FM tells EU diplomats not to blame Beijing for bloc's problems

China's foreign minister told his French and German counterparts that Beijing was not to blame for Europe's economic and security problems as he pushed for more cooperation at a summit in Munich, a foreign ministry statement said Saturday.
Wang Yi made the comments at a meeting with France's Jean-Noel Barrot and Germany's Johann Wadephul on the sidelines of the Munich Security Conference on Friday.
He sought to promote China as a reliable partner of the European Union at a time when the bloc is trying to reduce its dependence on both Beijing and an increasingly unpredictable Washington.
"China's development is an opportunity for Europe, and Europe's challenges do not come from China," Wang said, according to the statement.
Warning that "unilateralism, protectionism, and power politics" were on the rise globally, he said he hoped Europe would "pursue a rational and pragmatic policy towards China".
"The two sides are partners, not adversaries; interdependence is not a risk; intertwined interests are not a threat; and open cooperation will not harm security."
The meeting came against the backdrop of trade tensions between the two giant economies and disputes over what the EU sees as China's support for Russia's war in Ukraine.
The EU is seeking to cut its reliance on China for strategic goods like rare earths while also rebalancing a trade relationship that sees it run a large deficit with the world's second-largest economy.
In recent years, the two sides have clashed over Chinese electric-vehicle exports, which threaten Europe's car industry and which Brussels argues are based on unfair subsidies, and Chinese tariffs on EU goods ranging from cheese to cognac.
Wang urged Germany and France to help "give a clear direction for the development of China-Europe relations".
In a separate meeting with Wadephul -- also on Friday -- Wang touted economic and trade cooperation as "the cornerstone of China-Germany ties", according to a foreign ministry readout.
Wang also met Britain's foreign minister Yvette Cooper, telling her that Beijing and London should "explore more potential for cooperation", while the two sides also discussed Ukraine and Iran.

Key Takeaways from the ISW:
- Western reporting suggests that the United States has accepted Russia’s demanded sequence of having Ukraine cede territory to Russia before receiving formal US or European security guarantee commitments.
- Meaningful security guarantees are crucial to any peace agreement that allows Russia to occupy parts of Ukraine, especially if Ukraine withdraws from territory it currently holds.
- Putin’s rejection of meaningful Western security guarantees for Ukraine is a greater impediment to a prospective peace deal than Ukraine’s position on ceding its territories.
- The Kremlin likely sees an opportunity to manipulate the US-led negotiations process into another means through which Russia can achieve its unchanging military and political objectives, which it has failed to achieve in nearly four years of war.
- Russian President Vladimir Putin’s unwavering determination to conquer more Ukrainian territory and gain full political control over Ukraine is severely degrading Russia’s military and economy at the cost of the Russian population, and Russia will increasingly have to reckon with this degradation in the coming year.
- The Russian Central Bank lowered its key interest rate for the first time in 2026 and fifth time in the last 12 months, likely in an attempt to increase capital available for the Russian defense industrial base (DIB) and maintain the facade of domestic economic stability.
- Ukraine’s European allies continue to provide military aid to Ukraine through the Ramstein format, including via the purchase of US-produced weapons.
- Ukrainian forces recently advanced near Oleksandrivka and Hulyaipole. Russian forces recently advanced near Slovyansk.

New prototypes of the homegrown combat aircraft KAAN, which will undergo testing during the development process led by Turkish Aerospace Industries (TAI), have made their debut.
The head of Türkiye's Secretariat of Defense Industries, Haluk Görgün, visited the KAAN hangar on Friday to receive information regarding the latest developments.
Görgün noted that the rollout of the aircraft intended for full-size static testing, alongside the first and second flight prototypes, represents a significant technical milestone.
The official emphasized that KAAN stands beyond a mere aircraft as a symbol of Türkiye’s engineering prowess and independent defense capabilities.
The primary objective of the project centers on indigenously developing a next-generation combat aircraft that will serve the Turkish Air Force for many years.
KAAN will feature advanced capabilities such as low observability, internal weapon bays, enhanced situational awareness and sensor fusion for superior performance in both air-to-air and air-to-ground missions.
Following the first flight of the initial prototype in 2024, development and production processes continue uninterrupted while simultaneously advancing operational capabilities for manned and unmanned fighter jets.
Görgün explained that KAAN continuously enhances the country's defense and aviation infrastructure, elevating Türkiye into an elite league of global players, particularly through the ongoing development of a domestic engine.
The strategic program also serves as a catalyst that simultaneously strengthens the country's infrastructure, human resources and technological accumulation, he noted.
Authorities are rapidly carrying out preparations for mass production in parallel with the current testing phases as part of this critical technology initiative.
The domestic supply chain for KAAN currently consists of more than 5,000 employees working across over 300 companies in more than 20 cities, Görgün said.

‘Unforgivable’: police chief slams lawyer, doctors linked to crash-for-cash scams
‘Knowledgeable professionals should not do such immoral and unethical things,’ Commissioner of Police Joe Chow says
Hong Kong’s police chief has slammed the alleged involvement of a lawyer and doctors in a spate of so-called crash-for-cash scams as “unforgivable and unacceptable”.
Commissioner of Police Joe Chow Yat-ming said on Saturday that the force would speed up its investigation into such cases and expected a fresh wave of arrests.
He noted police previously arrested a couple and two doctors for their alleged roles in more than 20 crash-for-cash scams, adding that officers were investigating more than 100 other suspicious cases.
Authorities earlier said they had received reports of drivers facing sudden massive civil claims, months after police had closed the related traffic cases, with some involving minor or no collisions.
The claims typically covered legal fees, medical expenses, loss of income, vehicle repairs and other miscellaneous costs.
Chow noted officers had also raided the office of a lawyer in Mong Kok that had filed most of the claims linked to the couple.

This Valentine’s Day, chocolate comes with new risks
Cocoa prices have eased since last year’s spike, but climate shocks and forest loss are making volatility the new normal. Agroforestry offers a way to protect supply and forests alike.
This Valentine’s Day, chocolate prices are no longer at last year’s peak, but cheap chocolate has not made a comeback, and it probably never will. Last year’s cocoa price crisis, driven by a combination of extreme heat, drought and disease in key producing regions, may have eased. But the aftertaste remains: A market that no longer behaves the way it used to, because the landscapes that grow cocoa are no longer the same. And the world’s unwitting appetite for cheap chocolate at the expense of biodiversity is part of the reason.
Cocoa is one of the most rainfall-dependent crops in the tropics, grown mainly by smallholders with few safety nets. Because cocoa production is concentrated in a handful of regions, a bad season in one place can quickly ripple across global supply. That fragility was laid bare in 2024, when the Ivory Coast and Ghana, which produce nearly 60 percent of the world’s cocoa, were hit by climate extremes that slashed harvests. Prices surged by more than 300 percent, squeezing some farmers, enriching others, and leaving consumers paying for the uncertainty.
The problem is not simply that cocoa is vulnerable. It is that we have built a cocoa economy that magnifies the vulnerability. For decades, the world has chased low prices and high output, and too often that has meant converting forest landscapes into farmland, from West Africa to parts of Latin America and Southeast Asia.
But forests are not optional. They regulate rainfall, protect soils, and create the microclimates on which cocoa depends. Full-sun cocoa farms can produce higher yields in the short term, but the sugar rush is followed by a costly crash: Depleted soils, limited protection from heat and drought that is on the increase, and little for farmers to fall back on when the monocrops fail. Yields fall, farms expand deeper into forests to compensate, and the cycle repeats.
This is why cocoa’s price volatility is not a temporary blip. It is a warning sign: We are weakening the natural systems cocoa depends on at the same moment that climate change is making harvests less reliable.
Research by the United Nations’ Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) shows how extreme heat undermines agriculture, reducing both the quantity and quality of crop yields and increasing pest and disease pressure. A recent study modelling cocoa under mid-century climate change finds that warming could wipe out as much as a third to half of today’s suitable cocoa area in some core producing zones, while shifting production towards new regions. Without safeguards, that transition risks trading climate stress in one place for forest loss in another. The details will vary across regions, but the implication is global: As climate change alters weather patterns, the geography of cocoa production will shift, and a stable supply will become harder to take for granted.
Unless we build resilience now, future Valentine’s Days may come with less chocolate and higher prices.
But we can eat our chocolate and keep forests too, by changing how cocoa is grown. It starts with bringing trees back to cocoa farms, reversing the damaging practices that are ultimately undermining production. Change can be made through climate-resilient agroforestry practices that rebuild shade cover, improve soil health and moisture retention, and reduce cocoa’s exposure to heat and drought. Cocoa grown under shade trees can stabilise farm conditions and support biodiversity, while producing higher-quality beans that meet premium market standards, giving farmers stronger incentives to maintain tree cover rather than clear more land.
Sceptics argue that growing cocoa with trees means accepting lower yields. But when it comes to unsustainable practices, high productivity today comes with a high cost tomorrow. A farm that exhausts its soil, loses shade, is exposed to drought, and needs ever more chemical inputs to maintain production is not a success story. It is a trap.
In a changing climate, the point is not how much cocoa a farm can produce in a year, but how reliably it can produce year after year. That requires resilience built into the landscape, now more than ever: More tree cover, healthier soils, and diversified farm systems that protect livelihoods when climate extremes hit.
This is not theoretical. It is already happening.
In Ecuador’s Amazon province of Napo, a project financed by the Global Environment Facility (GEF) and supported with technical assistance from the FAO has helped strengthen a sustainable cocoa value chain built around the traditional Chakra agroforestry system used by Kichwa communities. Put simply, it is cocoa grown as part of a forest garden: Kichwa women known as Chakramamas help steward these farms, cultivating cocoa under shade trees alongside a diverse mix of other crops and native plants, rather than clearing land for a single crop. Recognised by FAO as a Globally Important Agricultural Heritage System, the model is still expanding more than a decade on, helping Indigenous producer families earn more from premium cocoa through stronger processing, marketing, and partnerships with high-value buyers. High-end chocolatiers continue to source from Chakra producers, showing that cocoa grown alongside trees can deliver world-class quality while keeping forests standing for biodiversity, climate and land benefits.
There are more examples. In the Ivory Coast, FAO-backed efforts supported by the Green Climate Fund are already delivering results, restoring 1,084 hectares (2,679 acres) of degraded land and converting 3,527 hectares (8,715 acres) of conventional cocoa into improved agroforestry systems while reducing pressure on forests. Meanwhile, 234 farmers now have access to cocoa cooperatives, ensuring access to international fair-trade and organic certifications and a better price for their products. In Sao Tome and Principe, FAO has supported cocoa agroforestry through the GEF-funded Restoration Initiative, helping restore nearly 10,000 hectares (about 25,000 acres) of forest and improve land management across a further 23,000 hectares (about 57,000 acres). These are not boutique experiments. They are working models for stabilising supply, supporting farmer incomes, and reducing the forest loss that fuels cocoa’s growing volatility.
But projects alone will not be enough. Scaling them will take serious investment: From governments, companies, and consumers. It will also require rules that shift incentives across the entire cocoa economy, such as a new European Union law that requires cocoa and chocolate entering the EU market to be deforestation-free. By tying market access to how cocoa is grown, these rules are pushing governments, producers, and companies to rethink production models, improve traceability, and strengthen zero-deforestation cocoa systems.
Governments will also need to invest in farmer adaptation and long-term productivity, not just short-term output. That means accessible finance, practical support on farms, and policies that reward sustainable production instead of expansion into forests.
And chocolate companies need to promote resilience across their supply chains, not just chase volume. In a world of climate disruption, the cheapest cocoa is not necessarily the best bargain if it comes at the expense of farmers’ livelihoods or the ecosystems that keep cocoa viable in the years to come.
Paying farmers for chocolate that keeps forests standing is not a luxury. It is part of what makes cocoa more available and keeps farmers in business in a warming world. Chocolate is sold as a simple pleasure, but cocoa is no longer a simple crop: Its future depends on whether we treat forests and biodiversity as essential infrastructure for stable and resilient agrifood systems.

WASHINGTON, February 14. /TASS/. The United States will produce and deliver roughly $15 billion worth of military equipment to Ukraine in 2026 under a NATO program financed by European countries, NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte told PBS.
He noted that the US has not halted arms deliveries to Ukraine. "The US has said ‘We are willing to deliver’, and they are doing it. <...> No pauses, no blocks, nothing," Rutte said.
"They’re delivering to the tune of a billion euros a month. So that will be about 15 billion for this year in dollars, and 12 billion in euros. Critical lethal and non-lethal [equipment], including the [missile] interceptors," the NATO chief added.

Türkiye on Friday rejected resolutions adopted by the European Parliament that it said contained “baseless allegations” against the country.
In a statement, the Turkish Foreign Ministry said it “categorically” rejected claims made in resolutions passed Thursday concerning the situation in northeast Syria and alleged targeted expulsions of foreign journalists and foreign Christians in Türkiye.
The ministry said the resolution on the situation in northeast Syria disregarded “Türkiye’s role in Syria’s recovery and stabilization.”
It urged the European Parliament to make greater efforts to understand “realities on the ground and the aspirations of Syria and the Syrian people,” rather than adopting what it described as misguided and ill-intentioned measures.
The statement also dismissed allegations related to freedom of expression and religion, saying claims in the resolution titled, “Targeted expulsions of foreign journalists and foreign Christians in Türkiye,” contradicted the facts.
“No foreign institution, including the European Parliament, can interfere in judicial proceedings conducted in our country,” it underlined.
The ministry urged the European Parliament to "take constructive steps" for Türkiye-EU relations rather than "being instrumentalized for efforts against our country and attempting to interfere in our internal affairs."

Japan, Qatar sign 27-year LNG deal for 3M tons annually
Agreement signed between Jera Co., Doha's state-run QatarEnergy
ISTANBUL
Japanese and Qatari companies signed a 27-year agreement for 3 million tons of liquefied natural gas per year beginning in 2028, media reports said Saturday.
The agreement was signed between the major Japanese energy company Jera Co. and Doha's state-run QatarEnergy.
"Jera remains committed to building a resilient, well-balanced LNG procurement portfolio by sourcing from the Middle East, Asia-Pacific, the United States, and other regions," said the company.
Jera is one of the world's largest LNG buyers.
LNG-fired thermal power remains a key part of Japan’s energy mix, even as Tokyo expands nuclear and renewable sources.
Thermal power’s share is expected to decline to 30% - 40% by fiscal 2040, down from 68.6% in fiscal 2023 under the latest energy plan
Japan imported 66.15 million tons of LNG in 2023, with 4.4% from Qatar. Australia was the largest supplier at 41.6%, followed by Malaysia at 15.6%.
Separately, Japan’s Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry signed a memorandum of understanding with JERA and QatarEnergy, allowing Tokyo to request additional LNG supplies during natural disasters or other energy security emergencies.

Syrian President Ahmad al-Sharaa issued a presidential decree appointing a governor for Hasakah province.
The Syrian Arab News Agency (SANA) said Nour al-Din Ahmad Issa was appointed governor of the northeastern province.
His appointment comes under a Jan. 18 comprehensive ceasefire and full integration agreement between the Syrian government and the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), outlining sweeping measures to restore state authority in the northeast.
The deal also stipulates the naming of a governor for Hasakah by presidential decree to guarantee political participation and local representation.
Syrian security forces and administrative bodies have entered areas previously controlled by the SDF, including Hasakah, Qamishli and Ayn al-Arab (Kobani), as well as strategic facilities such as airports, oil fields and border crossings.
The agreement provides for the gradual handover of security responsibilities, the deployment of state institutions and the integration of SDF forces into official government structures.
On Jan. 16, Sharaa issued a decree affirming that Syrian Kurds are an integral part of the Syrian people, and their cultural and linguistic identity forms a core component of the country’s unified national identity.
The Syrian Army launched an operation against the SDF on Jan. 16 in areas west of the Euphrates River. The operation later expanded east of the river with the participation of tribal forces, leading to all of the territories previously occupied by the group coming under government control.
Damascus, Washington stress Syria’s sovereignty, territorial integrity
On another development, Syrian and U.S. officials stressed Syria’s sovereignty and territorial integrity during talks on the sidelines of the Munich Security Conference, according to a statement Friday by the Syrian Foreign Ministry.
The Syrian delegation, headed by Foreign Minister Asaad al-Shaibani, met U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio to discuss key local and regional developments.
Both sides emphasized the unity of Syria, its sovereignty and the integrity of its territory. The U.S. reaffirmed its support for the Syrian government.
Washington also expressed support for the recent integration agreement between the government and the YPG/SDF terror organization, as well as Syria’s efforts to combat the ISIL terror group.
Syria formally joined the anti-ISIL coalition last November. The coalition was formed in 2014 and has carried out military operations against the terror group in Syria and Iraq, though Damascus was not previously a member.
The talks also addressed relations between Syria and the U.S. and ways to develop cooperation in various fields.
On Jan. 18, the Syrian government and the SDF reached a comprehensive ceasefire and full integration agreement, outlining sweeping measures to restore state authority in the northeast.

BUSINESS & ECONOMY
- US tech giants expect to spend $670B primarily in artificial intelligence, data centers
US-based tech giants like Meta, Amazon, Microsoft and Alphabet are projected to spend $670 billion on capital investments this year, primarily funding their artificial intelligence (AI) and data center efforts.
Analysts said the massive influx of capital resembles the rapid railroad expansion of the Gilded Age, covering the late 1870s to the late 1990s, when the world’s first billionaires emerged with industrialization.
The rise of railroads and the further advancement of port and mining activities held a key place in the US economy at the time, while agriculture began to lose its former glory.
The large investments may have a long payback period, and the cash flow and profitability may come under pressure in the short term, analysts warned.
- Türkiye secured $13.1B in foreign direct investments in 2025, defying global slowdown
Türkiye defied global economic slowdowns last year and received $13.1 billion in foreign direct investments (FDIs), a surge of 12.2% year-on-year, according to the country’s Investment and Finance Office.
The wholesale and retail trade sector attracted the most investments with a 32% share totaling $3.052 billion, driven primarily by the rise of e-commerce platforms in the country.
The manufacturing sector followed with a 31% share, reaching $3.02 billion, while the information and communications sector received $1.308 billion, or a 14% share.
- Partial government shutdown looms over US Homeland Security Department
The US Department of Homeland Security (DHS) faces a partial government shutdown after Congress failed to approve funding for the agency by a deadline Friday.
DHS is now the only federal agency without funding for the remainder of fiscal year 2026, which continues through Sept. 30, while lawmakers have already approved spending bills covering the rest of the government since a record-long shutdown ended in November.
The latest funding measure, passed at the end of January, provided DHS with a two-week extension to allow Congress additional time to negotiate changes to the agency’s immigration enforcement practices -- a stipulation pushed by Senate Democrats following the killing of two Americans by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents in the state of Minnesota in January.

China’s foreign minister, US’ Rubio agree to boost dialogue on sidelines of Munich Security Conference
Wang Yi, Marco Rubio discuss stabilizing ties, implementing leaders’ consensus amid improving relations between world’s 2 top economies
ISTANBUL
Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi and US Secretary of State Marco Rubio met Friday on the sidelines of the Munich Security Conference in Germany, Xinhua News reported.
The two agreed to strengthen dialogue and cooperation in various fields and promote the stable development of China-US relations.
Wang said Chinese President Xi Jinping and US President Donald Trump have provided strategic guidance for the development of relations.
He stressed that both sides should jointly implement the key consensus reached by the two leaders and work to make 2026 a year in which China and the US advance toward mutual respect, peaceful coexistence and win-win cooperation.
Dialogue is better than confrontation, cooperation is better than conflict, and win-win outcomes are better than zero-sum games, said Wang.
The meeting comes as Trump is expected to make his first trip to China in his second term at the White House in April.
The world’s top two economies have seen ties stabilize since November, after momentary tensions about Trump’s steep tariffs on countries around the world.
Early this month, Trump spoke to Xi, after the two met face-to-face in South Korea in October, during which the two discussed ties, with the Chinese leader issuing a warning on arms supplies to Taiwan.

1. If you are reading this it is because I’m dead: here’s what I want to tell you about how to live
This powerful posthumous column by the Spanish journalist Carlos Hernández, who died on 3 February, reflected on the luck that shaped his life compared to those born in regions of the world ravaged by hunger, poverty and war. “Even in this difficult moment I’m going through, I don’t think I have the right to complain or to moan about my lot. How can I play the victim knowing these historical inequalities and injustices? How can I lament my fate when we see what is happening even now, in Africa, Afghanistan, Ukraine, Yemen, Iran or in Palestine?”

Meet the Inuit scientist kayaking around Greenland to highlight just how far microplastics travel
Unknown
Unknown Publisher

06:00:48 UTC
15:00:48 KST

One scientist is on a mission to reveal the far-reaching spread of microplastics after kayaking around a remote glacier in Greenland.
Armed with just a kayak and a self-built microplastic filter, Kristian Louis Jensen has spent the last decade paddling through the most “pristine places” on our planet.
During his Master’s degree in environmental protection, the Inuit scientist developed ‘The Plastaq’. This citizen-science tool allows kayakers and local communities to collect surface water samples containing debris from items such as abandoned bottles and packaging.
“But that work led me to ask a deeper question about the invisible footprint of humanity,” he tells Euronews Green. It is this that inspired his most recent trip, over to a remote glacier in eastern Greenland.
‘Fossil fuels in motion’
Jensen kayaked to one of the most “isolated corners of the Arctic”, located hundreds of kilometres from any kind of road. He expected to find fibres and general plastic debris - which he did - but Jensen also stumbled across traces of car tire particles in his samples.
“Finding them on a pristine glacier in eastern Greenland was a shock because it validated a terrifying thesis: these particles are no longer just an urban issue,” Jensen says.
“They have become dust, airborne, and have travelled thousands of kilometres to the Arctic. This is ‘fossil fuels in motion’. It tells us that the Arctic is a ‘sink’ for the world’s pollution.”
With more than five billion tyres on the road globally, each loses around 10-30 per cent of its mass during its lifespan.
“That mass doesn’t disappear,” Jensen says. “It breaks down into toxic dust that settles at the very start of our food chain.”
The impact of Greenland’s microplastic pollution
Jensen’s work has highlighted the far-reaching extent of microplastics, which are starting to cause a trifecta of problems for local communities in Greenland.
“Ecologically, we’re seeing early evidence that tire toxicity is high for Arctic species,” he explains. “For instance, chemicals like 6PPF are lethal to Coho salmon.”
Car tire pollution can also cause deformities in Atlantic cod eggs, threatening the very foundation of the nation’s fishing industry.
For Indigenous communities, Greenland’s polluted waters have become a matter of environmental justice that poses a serious health risk.
In urban areas, chronic exposure to these kinds of particles has already been linked to a slew of health issues such as worsening asthma and cardiac problems.
“In the Arctic, that threat is now settling on our food sources, turning a pristine environment into a repository for global waste,” Jensen adds. “The higher latitudes and the people living in them are disproportionately being adversely affected by global pollution and climate change.”
‘A critical blind spot’: What pollution regulations miss
Scientists have long warned of Greenland’s growing microplastic issue - with multiple studies finding higher concentrations of tiny particles in sea ice in these remote areas compared to infamous ocean garbage patches.
But Jensen argues that there is a “critical blind spot” in climate policy that aims to tackle this pervasive problem.
“Currently, we regulate what comes out of the tailpipe, but we ignore what wears off the tire,” he warns.
“This is dangerous, given that tire particles are now recognised as a leading source of microplastics entering ecosystems globally.”
Are fossil fuels to blame for Greenland’s microplastic pollution?
Momentum to transition away from fossil fuels rapidly gained traction at last year’s COP30 summit in Belém - with more than 90 countries including Germany, the Netherlands and the UK backing the idea of a roadmap.
However, following pushback from petrostates, all mentions of a phaseout were scrubbed from the final deal. Hope for a fossil fuel-free future now lies outside of the UN’s remit. In April, more than 85 countries will meet at Colombia’s Global Fossil Fuel Phaseout conference, which will be co-hosted with the Netherlands.
However, Jensen says the transition away from fossil fuels mainly focuses on ‘black carbon’. These are emissions that are generated from burning fuel.
“We need to broaden this to include ‘carbon black’, the fossil fuel-derived filler that makes up a massive portion of every tire,” he explains.
“We cannot claim to be tackling the fossil fuel crisis if we ignore the solid petrochemicals rolling beneath our vehicles.”
There is also growing support for more transparency among manufacturers. Jensen is therefore calling for a “collaborative ecosystem” where ecotoxicologists have full insight into the chemical cocktails that make up modern tires.
The Black Carbon coalition
Taking down fossil fuel giants and huge corporations is no easy task - one that Jensen can’t manage on his own. It’s why he’s launching the Black Carbon scientific coalition at the Arctic Frontiers conference this month.
“The core of this campaign is the formation of a cross-sector science coalition to monitor black carbon and carbon black in the Arctic, and its effect on the health of the Arctic,” Jensen says.
The coalition will bring together toxicologists, Indigenous leaders and policymakers to investigate the specific impacts of tire particles on Arctic health. It hopes to take this evidence to the EU Parliament, and to COP31 later this year.
“Our ultimate goal is to secure national and international commitments to reduce and mitigate black carbon and tire particle emissions,” Jensen says.
Jensen’s work will soon be shown on the big screen, in a documentary with award-winning German filmmaker Steffen Krones. Black Carbon aims to expose the devastating impacts of microplastics on the Arctic and communities living in harmony with these fragile ecosystems.
The film is currently in production following Jensen, his investigation and his advocacy work.

‘Police need to investigate’: will Andrew be questioned over his relationship with Epstein?

Gordon Brown is a man who gets into the detail.
In office, and since then, he has applied his forensic mind to the matters that concern him. Lately, he has been focused on the Epstein files.
What he discovered shocked him. There was the immediate anger about the “extent of betrayal” by his former business secretary, Peter Mandelson, during the global financial crisis.
But it was the “the abuse of women by male predators and their enablers – and Britain’s as yet unacknowledged role” that has left the deepest mark.
He looked at flight records, examined the evidence and came to a conclusion: Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor should face police questioning over Jeffrey Epstein.
He’s not on his own in that conviction.
This week, voices around Westminster and beyond have insisted the role of UK institutions in this most horrifying of scandals must be now examined. And that includes the monarchy.
On Thursday, cabinet secretary Chris Ward was cornered about the former prince by Sarah Owen, chair of the Commons women and equalities committee.
Mountbatten-Windsor was trade envoy to critical countries, including China and Hong Kong, between 2001 and 2011.
Wasn’t it time for him “to answer both to the police and parliament”, she asked.
MPs can no longer afford to be deferential when it comes to the royals, Owen told the Guardian.
“We have to do this to put faith back into systems where people have lost it,” she said. “If we don’t it weakens people’s belief in democracy, their trust in politics as a force for good. That risks us going down to a really dark path.”
Writing in the New Statesman, Brown referenced a BBC investigation which found many of Epstein’s private planes had travelled through Stansted and other UK airports, where women “were transferred from one Epstein plane to another”.
But Brown had been “told privately” that previous Metropolitan police inquiries “related to the former Prince Andrew did not properly check vital evidence of flights”.
“The Stansted revelations alone require them to interview Andrew,” he argued.
Former Victim’s Commissioner Vera Baird told the Guardian that she had spoken to the police about Mountbatten-Windsor before the Covid pandemic struck, but was assured the issue was being investigated thoroughly in the US.
“Clearly, [Mountbatten-Windsor] is not going to do anything himself. Clearly, there’s a limit to what the royal family can do,” she said. “So the police need to investigate.”
Even from his bolthole in Sandringham, Norfolk, to where he is exiled by his brother, King Charles, can Mountbatten-Windsor, despite his vociferous denials of any wrongdoing, still ignore the deafening roars for him to cooperate with any police investigations, and to testify to the US Congress on what he himself knew about Epstein?
Thames Valley police is assessing whether to investigate the apparent sharing of some documents by Mountbatten-Windsor to Epstein during his time as trade envoy, and is engaged in discussions with specialist crown prosecutors from the CPS. The same force is assessing claims a woman was sent to the UK by Epstein for a sexual encounter with the then prince, which allegedly occurred at his former Royal Lodge residence in 2010. The woman, who is not British, was in her 20s at the time. The allegation is separate to the one made by Virginia Giuffre.
As Mountbatten-Windsor’s past answers over his relationship with Epstein are apparently blown apart, there has been no response from him.
When, with titles still intact, the then Prince Andrew told interviewer Emily Maitlis and 1.7 million BBC Newsnight viewers in 2019 of his Pizza Express in Woking alibi, and revealed a temporary medical inability to sweat, he would have expected to be believed, especially as the queen’s son.
Not any more.
There was also the matter of that March 2001 photograph, with Mountbatten-Windsor’s hand seemingly around the bare waist of a 17-year-old Virginia Giuffre, who would later claim she was forced to have sex with the royal, a claim he has always denied, and said to have been taken in Ghislaine Maxwell’s London Belgravia mews home.
Asked about it, he had stared at Maitlis, earnestly. It was difficult, he insisted, to “prove” it was “faked”, because it was a photograph of a photograph.
“Whether that’s my hand, or whether that’s the position …” he went on, before concluding: “I’m afraid to say that I don’t believe that photograph was taken in the way that has been suggested.”
Was it taken by Epstein? The then prince said that he had never seen Epstein “with a camera in my life”.
Yet Epstein appears to have kept many photographs of people, presumably to utilise for some purpose at a future date.
Mountbatten-Windsor’s explanation of that photograph is now robustly questioned by a July 2011 email from Epstein to his publicist, which states: “yes she was on my plane and yes she had her picture taken with Andrew”, in an apparent reference to Giuffre.
Maxwell further strengthens the argument for its authenticity in an email to Epstein in 2015, headed “draft statement”. She appears to write: “In 2001 I was in London when [redacted] met a number of friends of mine including Prince Andrew. A photograph was taken as I imagine she wanted to show it to friends and family.”
Another reason to doubt the photo, Mountbatten-Windsor insisted to Maitlis, was he was “not one to, as it were, hug and public displays of affection”. Yet, a photograph recently disclosed of him crouching on all fours, barefoot and smiling, over an unidentified woman lying on the floor, also casts doubt on this claim.
What of another photograph, pivotal to his downfall, and taken in early December 2010, five months after the financier’s release from prison for soliciting sex with a minor, showing the two men strolling in New York’s Central Park?
Wielded as proof of his ongoing relationship with Epstein that conviction, Mountbatten-Windsor would brush it aside as the final moment of their friendship.
He had to show “leadership”, he told Maitlis, and tell Epstein: “That’s it.” It was the “honourable and right thing to do” face-to-face. Crucially, he insisted, “from that day forth, I was never in contact with him”.
But a thank-you email he appears to have written to Epstein on 22 December 2010 reads: “It was great to spend time with my US family. Looking forward to joining you all again soon.”
Then with imminent publication by the Mail on Sunday of an article about Andrew, Epstein and Maxwell, “The Duke” writes to Epstein in February 2011: “It would seem we are in this together and we will have to rise above it.” Another, in March 2011 reads: “Please make sure that every statement or legal letter states clearly that I am NOT involved and that I knew and know NOTHING about any of these allegations. I can’t take any more of this my end.”
These emails may raise serious questions about the personal integrity of a public figure, but what of professional integrity.
Emails between Andrew and Epstein show the former prince sharing information about potential investments for his friend – all while he was on the government payroll as UK trade envoy.
When the anti-monarchy campaign group Republic this week reported Mountbatten-Windsor to Thames Valley police, its CEO Graham Smith said: “I cannot see any significant difference between these allegations and those against Peter Mandelson.”
Christmas Eve 2010, after he has insisted he had no contact, the former duke appears to forward to Epstein a document including information on investment opportunities in gold and uranium in Afghanistan.
The document, specifically prepared by government officials for him, according to the BBC, references “significant high value mineral deposits” and the “potential for low cost extraction”, including valuable natural resources such as marble, gold, iridium, uranium, thorium and possible deposits of oil and gas. All sent, apparently to Epstein.
Another email indicates that on 7 October 2010, he sent Epstein details of his official upcoming trips as trade envoy to Singapore, Vietnam, Shenzhen in China and Hong Kong, where he was accompanied by business associates of the child sex offender. After the trip, on 30 November, he appears to have forwarded official reports of those visits sent by his then special assistant, Amit Patel, to Epstein, five minutes after receiving them.
Buckingham Palace may have said in October, when Charles stripped his brother of all vestiges of royalty, and booted him and his ex-wife out of his 30-room Windsor residence, Royal Lodge, that such “censures are deemed necessary, notwithstanding the fact that he continues to deny the allegations against him”.
As the drip-drip of disclosures continues, Buckingham Palace has stressed this week that Charles has “profound concern” at the allegations and is ready to support any police investigation. Though “specific claims in question are for Mr Mountbatten-Windsor to address”, it said, “if we are approached by Thames Valley police we stand ready to support them as you would expect”. The Prince and Princess of Wales, were also said by their spokesperson to be “deeply concerned” by the continuing revelations.
Will that palace support translate into access to any royal email addresses Mountbatten-Windsor used? One Epstein survivor has called on Buckingham Palace to proactively search files and emails relating to the then Prince Andrew. Juliette Bryant, who told the BBC at her Cape Town home she had never met Andrew and has made no allegations against him, said of the Palace: “It’s great that they’ve made a statement, finally. But the thing is, are they going to actually act on it?” Referring to the palace, as well as the police and other authorities, she added: “They need to go through all Prince Andrew’s files and emails.”
It’s difficult for the family whose dysfunction has been brutally exposed in the public domain, for politicians who like to praise the royal family and for a public with a profound respect for this most revered of public institutions, says Bolsolver MP Natalie Fleet, a survivor of teenage grooming.
Fleet said: “I definitely have [the royal family] on a pedestal, and I want to keep them there, they are such an important part of our country and I think most people feel like that.”
“But that is why there’s even more need for them to be seen to be doing the right thing at times like this. Women are sick of hearing the right thing. We’re always grateful for it, but it has to be followed up by action, deeds, not words.”
Mountbatten-Windsor has been approached for comment.

‘Seasons have become confused’: the people struggling in UK’s relentless rain

With 76 flood warnings still in force across the UK and further downpours forecast this week and next, parts of the country have endured rain almost without pause since the start of the year.
The prolonged wet weather is disrupting livelihoods as well as daily life, particularly in rural areas, where flooded roads, waterlogged ground and repeated storms are making it harder to keep businesses afloat, protect crops and maintain steady work.
Here, people share how the relentless rain and bad weather is affecting them and their businesses.
‘You’re sitting in your truck doing nothing while the rain pours’
In north Devon, Mark Harrington, a master thatcher, has been inundated with calls from customers with leaking roofs in recent months. “This is silly season for us thatchers,” he says.
Harrington, 61, has been fixing thatched roofs for 30 years. “I do understand that you’re going to get some rain in winter, but it has definitely got worse. Even if you do manage to work for a day, it’s punctuated by periods of an hour and a half of rain where you’re sitting in your truck doing nothing. Before, I used to think, a day off, that’s great. But now you think, oh, jeez, not another day off!”
The delays have financial consequences for Harrington. “I am haemorrhaging money at the moment just trying to cope with the delays,” he says. “Jobs are taking longer, customers are unwilling to pay for extra scaffolding to over-roof their property, and the lads who work with me – who I have spent time and money on over the years training – are grumbling that they need to find work indoors. I’m earning a minimal wage myself.”
Harrington used to be able to pay his employees half a day’s wages when their work was rained off, but not any more. “I’d run out of money.”
The weather’s impact on his materials, such as wheat, adds further pressure. “If wheat seeds lay on wet ground for an extended period of time, they don’t germinate and this will affect availability. We had a disastrous crop two years ago and are still suffering from the after-effects of the shortage.” Shortages mean the crop becomes more expensive, leading to higher costs for customers.
“If a skilled tradesman such as myself is unable to maintain a team or even work as much as is required, then I fear for the future,” he says.
‘I’m concerned that what we’ve seen so far is only the beginning of a long drawn out disaster’
On a hill near Helston in Cornwall, John, 83, says it is the relentlessness of the rain that is doing the damage. This year alone he and his wife, Vicki, 73, have lost 15 trees – many of them pines they planted nearly 40 years ago to provide shelter for their plant nursery as well as for “sheer beauty”.
“What I see is a combination of results from the increased numbers of storms and continuous rainfall,” he says. “The ground gets very soggy, and the trees hold less well in it,” he says. “It’s such a shame to see a tree you planted lying on its side.”
Living on a hill offers some protection from flooding, but the surrounding lanes have been submerged, at times with water three-quarters of the way up car wheels. Heavy rain has also worsened potholes, turning what was once a straightforward seven-mile drive into Helston into an obstacle course. “The time I take to do that same drive is pretty well doubled, because I’m dodging potholes and having to keep my speed right down,” he says.
The worsening weather has caused other problems. Vicki, who runs the plant nursery, says the increasingly unstable weather has made small-scale growing far more difficult.
Even on a south-facing slope high on a hill, the ground is “totally soggy and waterlogged”, with standing water lingering after heavy rain. “Flood water is really irritating – slopping around in mud everywhere and trying to keep drains clear,” she says. But it is the combination of saturated ground and increasingly violent winds that has proved most damaging.
Vicki, who specialises in old-fashioned fragrant and historic roses, along with culinary and aromatic herbs, has decided to scale back operations. The latest bad weather brought three storms in quick succession. “Storm Goretti,” she says, “blew my last remaining polytunnel cover off.” Looking across the site, she adds: “It’s very hard to come back from that. It takes a lot of work to build up stock.”
“Thirty or 40 years ago, it was fine. There’s no way I would contemplate polytunnels on top of a hill now. The climate has changed so much.”
John predicts the worst is yet to come. “As global heating progresses there is a likelihood that we will have structural damage to buildings as well as trees. I’m concerned that what we’ve seen so far is only the beginning of a long drawn out disaster,” he says. “Some mornings we wake up and because it’s so misty and dank, it feels like the start of a third-rate historian novel.”
The relentless rain hasn’t just affected those working in rural areas.
‘I worked in gardens where half the plants were dying last summer, and now they’re all soaked’
“It’s been hard to work with this much rain,” says Connor Law, a gardener in London. “I don’t mind working through a shower or two but when it’s so consistently wet, you can end up accidentally disturbing plants. So jobs get pushed further and further back. I’m self-employed, so it’s going to start making money a bit tight if it carries on for too long.”
Law, 33, has worked outdoors for the past 10 years and has noticed changes in the weather becoming increasingly extreme. “I worked in gardens where half the plants were dying last summer, and now they’re all soaked. Especially here in London, seasons have become confused. I saw spring bulbs flowering in December,” he says.
“Working as a gardener, you see it first-hand every day. [Parts of the UK] only recently came out of an official drought due to how dry last year was. It wasn’t really that noticeable unless you’re working in the gardens. [But] droughts followed by flooding are becoming increasingly common.”
Law says people will have to change their approach to their gardens. “We can’t do what we’ve traditionally done for the last couple of hundred years. They’re going to have to look a bit different. I’ve always told people to grow wetland plants; if you’ve got an area garden that keeps flooding, try and embrace it and encourage frogs and insects to move in.
Conditions in London may be milder than other parts of the country at the moment, but the climate is still a concern, Law says. “The rain isn’t causing danger to people’s lives like in other parts of the country – I have family in Wales and the south-west where it’s more hairy.
“But in terms of the health of the natural environment, people’s gardens are really important for biodiversity, insects and carbon capture. And if things in your garden are constantly dying because the conditions have changed, we’re going to lose that resource.”

Rain, rain, go away: the peculiar British stoicism of ‘celebrating’ awful weather

May it fall as a blessing, not as a curse. So goes the ancient prayer inviting us to embrace days of rain.
It is a prayer that would not be welcomed by anyone on the floodplains the UK persists in filling with houses. It would be met with outright hostility by any farmers who are now unable to do any of the things they need to do in February because their land has had literally 40 days and nights of rain.
For most, though, weather affects mood, not home or livelihood. The recent wet spell has been so abundant that residents of these islands may feel they are running out of ways to express stoical acceptance of the inevitability of rainfall: “the garden needed it”, “lovely weather for ducks” and the rest.
Like Wales’s “raining old women and sticks” and the Midlands’ “black over the back of Bill’s mother’s”, these phrases defy all efforts to find their origins. The origin – and the content – is beside the point.
A conversation about whether it looks wettish out or whether they say it’s going to last at least until the end of the week comes across, to people who are unused to the British climate, as an obsession with weather in general and rain in particular. Really, this is nothing like weather-report-as-conversation. It is a ritual, its participants offering the phrases often without being aware they’re doing so.
The only other place where this happens – where there can be four distinct rains in one day – is Japan. Similarly positioned between a vast landmass and a vaster ocean, Japan too receives weather systems from places cold and warm, fighting for dominance on arrival. Elsewhere, weather follows more predictable cycles, so discussing it seems daft. Brittany comes close to Britain: there, like in the Lake District and the west of Ireland, you can buy tea towels and fridge magnets “celebrating” the certainty of showers.
Another phrase with no known origin is: there’s no such thing as bad weather, only the wrong clothing. Certainly, if an inhabitant of Britain’s rainy islands decides that there is no point waiting for it to stop – for when will it stop? – and makes it their choice to go out while rain is still falling, they’re accepting that it will do what it will do. Their only option is sartorial: denim is bad; wool is much worse; worst of all by far is the precise suit Rishi Sunak wore to call a general election at a sodden lectern in May 2024.
Once you’ve given in to rain, the next step is to enjoy it. In Four Weddings and a Funeral, when Carrie finishes kissing Charles and announces that she hadn’t noticed the weather, the point is not that the embrace was passionate despite the rain. The rain is more romantic, just like with Helen and James in Sliding Doors, just like Raleigh and his cloak for Elizabeth I and all the other rains of national legend. The greatest romantic scenes are in rain, not in parching heat.
This is why chummy forecasters who use expressions such as “I’m afraid it’s going to be another wet one” hit a bum note. The British relationship with rain is not one of simple regret; it’s better summarised in a phlegmatic Manchester remark. “If you can see the Pennines from town, it’ll be raining soon. If you can’t see them, that’s because it’s already raining.” Archetypal Lancashire humour … except that the same quip is heard in Devon (“If you can see Dartmoor …”), Edinburgh (“the Fife coast”), Swanage (“the Isle of Wight”) – and everywhere else.

Given the toxicity of social media, a moral question now faces all of us: is it still ethical to use it? | Frances Ryan

In a week during which Keir Starmer has been under pressure to resign, cabinet ministers took to X to show their support. “We’ve all been made to tweet,” one Labour figure told a political journalist. The irony is hard to escape: as the prime minister is embroiled in the scandal of Peter Mandelson’s relationship with Jeffrey Epstein, and now his former aide’s links to a sex offender, MPs are defending him on a platform that has in the past month allowed users to create sexualised images of women and girls.
This says something about the unprecedented way in which X has been tied to modern politics since it was still known as Twitter, as well as how widespread the culture of indifference is to the violation of female bodies, both online and off. But it also points to a growing dilemma facing not just politicians, but all of us: is it possible to post ethically on social media any more? And when is it time to log off?
It seems as though every major social-media platform has been contaminated to some degree. Since Elon Musk bought X, on top of deepfakes of sexually explicit images, the site’s algorithm has ramped up its boosting of rightwing content, with Musk himself posting about how the white race was “rapidly dying” and other extreme views on race almost every day of January. Facebook, long accused of mass data collection and involvement in Russia-backed election interference, dumped fact-checkers weeks before Donald Trump’s second term. Instagram, also owned by Meta’s Mark Zuckerberg, was found to knowingly be making teenage girls’ body images worse. And TikTok has been criticised for “exploiting” children, with under-13s exposed to self-harm content alongside dance crazes.
The Guardian’s revelation this week that Substack – the publishing forum some progressives fled to after other sites shifted rightwards – is making money from hosting Nazi newsletters sums up the no-win situation social-media users find themselves in. Substack, which has up to 50 million users worldwide, was found to be platforming writers espousing white supremacy, Holocaust denial and antisemitism, including an activist who described Adolf Hitler as “one of the greatest men of all time”. It’s all very 2026, isn’t it? Or 1936.
Still, none of this would be as disturbing if the disgust wasn’t accompanied by a pull to keep posting. There are very real reasons so many of us have failed to delete the apps, and not just because our dopamine-hungry brains have been trained to reach for our phones every five seconds. Over the past 15 years, for good or ill, social media has become a key way of connecting with others that – if we’re honest – many of us would struggle to fully break. That’s even more the case for marginalised groups, such as disabled people, who are more likely to rely on online networks for socialising and practical help. Just as it’s simpler to take the moral stand to cancel Prime if you can get to the shops with ease, it’s much easier to “get off socials” if you can walk up the stairs to your friend’s flat, feel safe in an LGBT+ bar or afford a round at the pub.
Social media can also be a literal lifeline for oppressed people, from Palestinians using Bluesky to crowdfund for food and medicine, to the lawyer of a protester in Iran notifying the world of their imprisonment. That is the absurdity of social media now: the same platforms that let some users scroll mindlessly to see what colour Stacey Solomon is painting her kitchen enable others to track and escape Israeli bombing. Often, we are in the surreal state of witnessing both through our screens at once.
There is a deep irony in the fact the platforms we seek escapism in are increasingly the most glaring demonstrations of the very darkness we wish to avoid. On the rare occasions I check my X account, I am usually greeted within seconds by (in no particular order): racism, pro-Trump posts, anti-benefit/eugenist rhetoric, Islamophobia, AI images and/or naked women. Perhaps as damaging as the content itself is the (quite false) feeling that this small corner of the internet is somehow representative of the country or humanity at large. There are few more successful ways for bad actors to keep resistance low than exhausting good people into thinking the battle is already lost.
There will be those in politics and public bodies who genuinely believe platforms such as X and Facebook help them reach the electorate, not least in an era when many older and disenfranchised people get their news – and plenty of fake news – from social media. There is certainly some truth in that. And yet the Mandelson and Downing Street aide scandals, much like the government using X to defend them, are a reminder of how the very worst behaviour quickly becomes normalised when it is, at minimum, being tacitly condoned by those in power. If Starmer wishes to show his government’s disdain for sexual abuse or the far right, logging off X would be a good start. Public opinion of politicians – and the current Labour party – is in the gutter. It seems unlikely that it will improve by them tweeting from it.
Personally, I’d just like to post a photo of my dog without coming into contact with a Nazi. I’m not sure that’s the snowflake demand Musk and co want us to think it is.

How a Soviet-era heating system exposes Ukraine to Russian attack – a visual guide
Unknown

Many Ukrainians are without heating in sub-zero temperatures as a result of relentless Russian strikes on energy infrastructure, while the country suffers through its coldest winter of the war so far.
Ukraine is especially vulnerable to such attacks, as Moscow can exploit a widespread Soviet-era heat system in which multiple apartment blocks rely on communal central heating.
Under this system, water is heated at a huge main power plant and then is pumped via pipes to residential blocks, where it is distributed into radiators and taps. That means that with a single strike on a heating plant, Moscow can wipe out heating for whole neighbourhoods.
Ukraine says that all such power stations have now been hit during the course of the full-scale war. These thermal power plants often also produce electricity, leaving people cold and in the dark.
Kyiv has been the main target of such attacks this year, with heavy bombardment of thermal power plants and sub-stations that pump the hot water.
People in the capital live in 20th-century Soviet Union apartment blocks that were mass-produced out of concrete panels and are called panelki. Cities across the former USSR are dotted with these multi-storey residential buildings, which were built during a postwar housing shortage in the 1950s and 1960s.
The heating system was considered efficient, and can serve tens of thousands of people across entire neighbourhoods.
But a centralised infrastructure is inherently vulnerable to attack. Russian bombardment this year has left about 3,500 apartment buildings in Kyiv without heating, according to mayor Vital Klitschko.
There are frequent capital-wide blackouts restricting electricity to three or four hours a day. Authorities in Kyiv have set up tents where local residents can go for warmth.
The intense bombardment has coincided with bitterly cold conditions. The lowest temperature recorded this year at a weather station in Kyiv was -20.7C on 2 February. Average daily temperatures have not risen above freezing this year.
Several people have frozen to death, and some residents have started to dig cesspits as the water system fails.
Other cities have also been badly hit. Nearly 300,000 people were left without power and water supply in the southern city of Odesa after a Russian attack, the deputy prime minister, Oleksiy Kuleba, said this week. More than 10,000 consumers were also left without heating in the south-eastern city of Dnipro.
The European Commission last month said it would deploy 447 emergency generators.
“The EU will not let Russia freeze Ukraine into submission and will continue helping Ukrainians get through this winter,” the commission has said.
Russian attacks have also disrupted electricity infrastructure, meaning backup generators or battery packs can fail, leaving people with very few options to keep warm.
The Facebook account of the Kyiv city state administration posted an image of candles held underneath bricks, which it said was used as a rudimentary but dangerous source of heat. It cautioned that the temperature would only rise by 1 or 2C.

Race to find source of carcinogenic Pfas in Cumbria and Lancashire waters

A string of toxic pollution hotspots has been uncovered across Cumbria and Lancashire, with high levels of the banned cancer-causing “forever chemical” Pfos detected in rivers and groundwater at 25 sites.
The contamination, spread across a large area, was uncovered by Watershed Investigations and the Guardian after a freedom of information request revealed high concentrations of Pfos in Environment Agency samples taken in January 2025.
Pfos is a type of per- and polyfluoroalkyl substance (Pfas), known as “forever chemicals” because they take hundreds or thousands of years to degrade. They are widely used in consumer products and some have been linked to a range of serious health problems.
At one site, groundwater contained Pfos at 3,840ng/l, alongside elevated levels of other banned Pfas compounds. Twenty-five sites recorded Pfos concentrations well above drinking water guideline limits of 100ng/l for the combined total of 48 Pfas compounds.
The contamination spans an area of outstanding natural beauty with multiple protections for wildlife and habitats.
A resident whose business’s private well is polluted said they found out in November 2021 after being “unofficially” informed by an individual at the Environment Agency, and stopped drinking the water immediately. According to the resident, the agency had been testing the well for about 35 years because of concerns about “chemical drift” in the groundwater.
“When I contacted the agency, they offered no help,” the resident said, adding that they were directed to Westmorland and Furness council, which “said they wished I had not been told, as they could not even test for Pfas … there was no help, no advice, no support of any kind”.
“I tried to get the council to look for the source of the pollution but no one seemed interested,” the resident said. “They said it looked like we were an outlier … nearly five years later I am still no wiser.”
Westmorland and Furness council said it was informed by the Environment Agency about the contaminated supply in late 2021 and that the business switched over to the mains water supply.
“The council has continued to support the business to ensure compliance in line with statutory requirements and the provision of a safe water supply. These arrangements remain in place and are being managed to ensure there is no risk to public safety,” said a spokesperson.
The Environment Agency said it identified elevated levels of Pfas in the area in 2022 through its national surveillance monitoring programme, but stressed that responsibility for protecting users of private water supplies lies with local authorities.
The agency said it alerted the private borehole owner after detecting Pfas above drinking water guidelines and advised them to contact the local council. It added that councils, the UK Health Security Agency, the Food Standards Agency and the Drinking Water Inspectorate (DWI) were informed in 2025.
Possible sources of Pfos contamination identified in the Environment Agency’s March 2025 report include a paper mill in Beetham, where Pfas are known to have been used. Sites where Pfas-contaminated paper pulp may have been spread on land are also flagged as potential hotspots where Pfas could contaminate soils and enter the food chain.
The mill’s operator went into administration and its assets were sold to a new operator in June 2025. Responsibility for earlier operations now sits with the former company’s administrators.
“The mill is now operated by a new legal entity,” said Robyn Khan, director of the new operator Pelta Medical Papers. “Since this acquisition, there has been no use of Pfas-based chemicals on site, and the mill does not manufacture paper containing Pfas.
“Any manufacture of Pfas-containing paper products occurred under the previous legal entity and ownership, in line with regulatory guidance and permit conditions in force at the time. We take our environmental responsibilities seriously and will continue to engage appropriately with the relevant regulatory authorities.”
The mill’s administrators, Kroll Advisory, did not respond to requests for comment.
The Environment Agency report also identified five historical landfills and one operational landfill as possible sources of Pfas, alongside sewage treatment works, fire stations and discharges from caravan parks.
The government’s new Pfas action plan, published on Tuesday, sets out proposals to tighten controls on the chemicals, including new guidance on contaminated land, a consultation on statutory limits on Pfas levels in drinking water, and potentially tougher rules for industrial sites.
But Water UK wants Pfas banned altogether. It said: “We risk falling further behind other European nations, which are increasingly banning these substances and demanding manufacturers pay for clean up.”
Chloe Alexander, the chemicals policy lead at Wildlife and Countryside Link, said the government’s plan was “a roadmap to nowhere”, warning it contained no binding phaseouts, no clear timetable, and no commitment to match the EU’s proposed Pfas ban.
There are about 33,000 private water supplies in England and “it is becoming ever clearer how vulnerable some private water supplies are as the climate changes”, a DWI report said, with more running dry during droughts and others increasingly hit by environmental pollution.
Hannah Evans from the environmental charity Fidra said: “This is yet another case demonstrating just how prevalent Pfas pollution is and the real-world consequences. Persistent chemicals should not be in our drinking water, our food, or our bodies. We urgently need to turn off the tap and transition the UK towards Pfas-free alternatives, many of which are already widely available.”

UAE ‘surpassing Hong Kong’, challenging Singapore for global trade crown
With non-oil trade nearly doubling, analysts say the UAE has secured a first-mover advantage that leaves regional rivals trailing behind
Defying global headwinds from war and instability across its own region, the UAE’s non-oil trade almost doubled between 2021 and 2025 to reach 3.8 trillion dirhams (US$1.03 trillion), Prime Minister Mohammed bin Rashid al-Maktoum announced on January 31.
That surge – powered by an aggressive outreach to emerging markets and strategic investment in logistics – has already fulfilled 95 per cent of targets once set for 2031, according to Maktoum, who is also the UAE’s vice-president and ruler of Dubai, the most populous emirate.
“Our investment environment is complete, our international partnerships have doubled, our partnerships with the private sector have been strengthened, and global confidence in the UAE has been firmly established,” he said in a statement.

Watch: 'I am a survivor' Gisèle Pelicot tells BBC Newsnight in an in-depth interview
Gisèle Pelicot has told BBC Newsnight's Victoria Derbyshire that her strength comes from her "DNA".
Ms Pelicot was at the centre of the largest rape trial in French history. For almost a decade, she had been drugged unconscious by her husband Dominique Pelicot and raped by dozens of men he had recruited on internet chat rooms.
She made the remarkable decision to let the world know who she was, waiving her legal right to anonymity, before the trial began.
In this interview, she reveals she found it "inconceivable" that the man she shared her life with "could have committed these horrors" and how she is now rebuilding her life.

Taiwanese leader William Lai Ching-te has appealed for public support amid a dispute about a special military budget, warning that the deadlock could delay key weapons deliveries and send the island down the US arms supply priority list.
The NT$1.25 trillion (US$40 billion) special budget has been repeatedly blocked by opposition parties, even as Taipei has come under increasing US pressure to prove its commitment to its own defence.
Analysts warn that continued delays could weaken perceptions of Taiwan’s defence resolve in Washington and regional capitals as the US reassesses its security priorities amid intensifying competition with Beijing.

Lai said this week that strengthening defence spending was “not an act of provocation” but a “necessary step to safeguard security and maintain regional stability”.
At a news conference on Wednesday, he also urged lawmakers on all sides to begin a substantive review of the special budget bill when the legislature reopened on February 24 after the Lunar New Year holiday.

Admiral Mei Chia-shu, the chief of the general staff, said at the same press briefing that Taiwan had already finished coordinating its plans with the US over pricing, delivery and supply schedules.

One in five Lithuanians lives in poverty, among worst rates in EU

About one in five residents in Lithuania lives in poverty, the State Data Agency (VDA) reported, with the most affected groups including people struggling to enter the labour market, pensioners and those with disabilities.
Alekas, 30, has a passion for cooking but has been unable to find work as a chef for over a year.
“I see ads for assistant cooks. But when you call – thank you, we already have someone. You know how it goes. Still, hope dies last,” he said.
He lost his home a year ago and now stays in a shelter, visiting a charity soup kitchen almost every day. In the afternoons, the centre is full, serving hundreds of people, including seniors, the disabled, recently released prisoners, and the homeless.
Ingrida Radzevičė, director of the Betanija Social Centre, said younger people are increasingly seeking help.
“There are very young people, 20 or a little older, as well as young mothers with children. Some have returned from working abroad, where they were cheated and not paid. Here, they have lost their homes and sometimes broken ties with family. The stories are very diverse,” Radzevičė said.
Aistė Adomavičienė, director of the National Poverty Reduction Network, said young adults aged 18–24 are at the highest risk of poverty because they are often just entering the workforce.
Children and people with disabilities make up a significant portion of those in poverty, she said, while public misconceptions persist that poor people are lazy or living solely on state aid.
“In Lithuania, only about 4% of welfare recipients could potentially work but do not. Children make up a quarter of those in poverty, and people with disabilities are another portion. About 15,000 could potentially work,” Adomavičienė said.
Poverty is unevenly distributed, she added, with rates in Vilnius and surrounding areas roughly half of those in other parts of the country.
Daiva Skučienė, a professor at Vilnius University’s Faculty of Philosophy, said structural issues contribute to the problem, including lack of jobs, inconvenient transport, and limited options for young mothers balancing childcare and work schedules.
“People may lack motivation, and some grow up in families where skills are not developed. Various structural factors play a role, which is why social welfare systems focus on early support, because it’s much harder to recover later,” Skučienė said.
She added that shifts in the labour market also affect poverty: people with skills can become unemployed if they do not adapt to changing demands.
Eurostat data show Lithuania’s poverty rates have remained among the highest in the European Union for many years.

Ministry of Internal Affairs helps evacuate more than 6,300 people from frontline areas since start of year
According to Ukrinform, Interior Minister Ihor Klymenko stated this on Telegram.
"This is difficult but extremely important work. Evacuation crews, including White Angel and Phoenix, operate under shelling, often literally a step away from the enemy. Each operation requires careful planning: identifying safer routes, preparing transport, and coordinating with local authorities and military administrations," Klymenko said.
According to him, for many people the decision to leave is difficult, so the work of rescuers and police officers is not only about logistics. It also involves communication, explanations, an individual approach, support for families with children, and assistance for people with limited mobility.
All members of the evacuation crews are certified paramedics, meaning they not only organize departures quickly but also provide medical assistance when necessary.
"Recently, the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine adopted a law regulating the procedure for mandatory evacuation of the population. This important decision will allow us to act faster, more clearly, and more effectively when it comes to the safety of vulnerable categories of citizens. Work in frontline regions continues without interruption. And its most important achievement is saved lives," Klymenko emphasized.
As Ukrinform previously reported, in Kherson the zone of mandatory evacuation for families with children was expanded in the Dniprovskyi district due to the increased intensity of Russian shelling.

US ends decade-long temporary protected status for Yemenis

The US government has said it is ending a protected status for migrants from Yemen, which had been in place for the past decade.
Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem announced on Friday that Temporary Protected Status, or TPS, first designated for the Middle Eastern nation in September 2015 because of armed conflict there, would be terminated in 60 days' time.
It applied to roughly 1,400 Yemeni nationals in the United States.
"After reviewing conditions in the country and consulting with appropriate US government agencies, I determined that Yemen no longer meets the law's requirements to be designated for Temporary Protected Status," Noem said in a statement.
"Allowing TPS Yemen beneficiaries to remain temporarily in the United States is contrary to our national interest," she said, describing the revocation as an act of "putting America first."
Yemeni beneficiaries with no other lawful basis for remaining in the US have 60 days to voluntarily depart the United States or face arrest, the statement said, offering a complimentary plane ticket and a $2,600 "exit bonus" for those who "self-deport."
Immigration policy shift
The Trump administration has rolled back TPS protections for many nations, mostly in the developing world, as part of a drive to scale back immigration.
TPS allows narrow groups of people in the United States to live and work in the country if they're deemed to be in danger if they return to their home nations, because of war, natural disaster, or other extraordinary circumstances.
While the protections are technically temporary, historically presidents have continued to renew TPS status for migrants rather than revoking it and rendering them undocumented.
Yemen, one of the world's poorest countries, has been riven by civil war since 2014.
The State Department currently advises against travel to Yemen, citing "terrorism, unrest, crime, health risks, kidnapping, and landmines."
Since coming to office last year Trump has ended or sought to end TPS for nationals of Haiti, Somalia, Honduras, Nicaragua, Nepal, Ethiopia, and Venezuela, among others.

Why the BNP won Bangladesh’s post-uprising election

Why the BNP won Bangladesh’s post-uprising election
Jamaat recorded historic gains and voters punished the old order, but first-past-the-post maths, patronage networks and political familiarity ultimately returned the BNP to power.
In the end, the 13th parliamentary election in Bangladesh was not a revolution. It was a reckoning.
When the ballots were counted, the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) had secured a decisive victory, returning to power after years in the political wilderness under Sheikh Hasina’s 15-year rule.
Most headlines framed it as a dramatic comeback, and rightfully so. But beneath the surface, this was less a tidal wave of voter choice than a carefully navigated current. This was a contest shaped by frustration and the arithmetic of first-past-the-post (FPTP).
To understand why BNP prevailed, one must first dispense with the lazy narrative that this was a Jamaat moment squandered. When the results became clear, Bangladesh Jamaat-e-Islami (JI) secured 68 seats, while the Jamaat-led bloc secured 77 seats in parliament. That is no small feat for a party whose previous best parliamentary showing was just 18 seats in 1991. Many analysts had suggested Jamaat’s support had grown in the run-up to the poll, and the data vindicated that claim. But in an FPTP system, a swelling vote share does not automatically translate into 151 seats out of 300 elected constituencies.
This election was not driven by any momentous revolution, even though it came on the back of a mass uprising that toppled Hasina’s autocracy in August 2024. But there was no deep ideological rupture, and no permanent reordering of voter loyalties, at least not on a scale that would rupture the very fabric of the country’s electoral mindset.
And of course, it was not a national wave election, in which a single mood sweeps towards a particular party across class, gender and region. What unfolded was a hybrid: Largely a normal election with significant deviations, but a predictable outcome.
Party loyalists mostly stayed home. Swing voters mattered. And in pockets of the country, frustration with BNP’s local leadership triggered temporary defections – many of them to Jamaat or NCP.
The anger was real. After August 5, BNP’s grassroots machinery performed abysmally. Petty leaders across districts were accused of corruption and extortion. In rural market towns and urban peripheries, resentment simmered.
Voters were not merely disappointed; they were, to use the language heard in tea stalls and union parishad courtyards, “really, really pissed off”. That fury explains Jamaat’s surge. A portion of BNP loyalists and a significant share of swing voters drifted towards the promise of an “honest alternative”.
But drift is not destiny.
BNP’s base, historically broader and organisationally deeper than Jamaat’s, did not collapse. Even after defections, it remained numerically larger. BNP’s nomination strategy proved unexpectedly shrewd.
Where Jamaat fielded relatively unknown but ideologically trusted figures, BNP leaned on its old guard – candidates with entrenched name recognition and dense informal networks.
That mattered, particularly in rural Bangladesh. Urban, educated voters may be thrilled by the rhetoric of ethical governance. For them, the idea of an incorruptible, ideologically disciplined candidate resonates as a moral reset.
But rural voters are pragmatic actors. They operate within intricate patronage webs. An MP is not an abstraction; he (and it is usually he) is a broker of safety nets, jobs, stability and dispute resolution. Honesty, in isolation, does not guarantee access. Familiarity does.
Thus emerged the central voter dilemma. Disgusted with BNP’s excesses, many considered a switch. In constituencies where Jamaat fielded a well-known leader, some made it. But elsewhere, voters encountered candidates they did not know, whose “honesty” they could not verify, and whose party offered little beyond moral branding.
Faced with uncertainty, they chose the “devil” they knew.
Jamaat compounded its structural limitations with strategic missteps. Its awkward posture on women’s issues – oscillating between reassurance and dog whistles – failed to convince large segments of female voters who have, over decades, carved out expanding public roles.
Bangladesh’s social transformation is not cosmetic, and women are central to its labour force, education system and microcredit economy. A party that cannot articulate a credible vision for gender equality cannot win a national wave.
More damaging was Jamaat’s revisionist flirtation with the memory of 1971. The Liberation War is the country’s moral founding document. Attempts to soften or reinterpret Jamaat’s historical role alienated voters far beyond the secular-liberal elite.
Even conservative families drew red lines around 1971. The prevailing mode of public sentiment was probably blunt: One may forgive; one does not forget.
Yet Jamaat’s performance was still historic. Jamaat-e-Islami and its allied coalition secured 77 seats, a testament not only to its disciplined cadre but also to BNP’s own misdeeds. Extortion scandals and local arrogance pushed voters into Jamaat’s arms.
In a tightly contested FPTP landscape, even a few percentage points can flip dozens of seats. Jamaat capitalised on that anger with precision in Rajshahi, Khulna and Rangpur divisions, where its organisational muscle is strongest.
But precision is not the same as breadth. Jamaat’s surge remained regionally concentrated. Its support varied sharply by class, gender, education and age. That is the opposite of a wave election. Without uniform national momentum, being a victor in FPTP is not an easy task.
Then there was the ghost in the machine: The Awami League (AL). Much commentary underestimated its residual vote. Surveys suggested a hardcore 5 to 7 percent would never defect, but beyond that lay a larger bloc – perhaps 20 to 25 percent – either undecided or unwilling to disclose preferences. In this election, that particular bloc mattered a lot.
Pre-election field research and multiple polls indicated that many non-hardcore AL voters were breaking towards the BNP – probably not out of ideological alignment but out of instrumental rationality. They believed BNP would form the government and wanted access to services through the winning MP.
In areas where BNP’s old guard had harassed AL supporters, some abstained or flirted with Jamaat. But nationally, the gravitational pull favoured BNP. Voters wanted to be on the side of the winner. Perception became a self-fulfilling prophecy.
The four plausible scenarios before election day clarified the stakes. Without significant AL turnout, BNP would likely secure a plurality in a tight race. With moderate AL support, it would win a comfortable majority. With overwhelming AL backing, even a two-thirds majority was conceivable. Only a full-blown Jamaat wave – a cross-class, cross-gender national embrace – could have reversed the equation.
That wave never materialised.
BNP’s victory, then, is a product of structural advantage, strategic candidate selection and the rational calculations of the country’s traditional voters. It was aided by Jamaat’s self-inflicted wounds on women’s rights and historical memory. It was enabled, paradoxically, by BNP’s own local misconduct, which inflated Jamaat’s vote share but not enough to overcome FPTP mathematics.
One more footnote of this election deserves attention: The emergence of the National Citizen Party (NCP), which captured five seats. For a new party born out of an uprising, in the highly polarised political environment of the South Asian nation, that is no small accomplishment.
It signals a hunger, however modest, for alternatives outside the new binary of BNP and Jamaat. Under proportional representation, such a party might flourish. Under FPTP, five seats is both a breakthrough and a ceiling.
Bangladesh’s 13th parliamentary election was, in the end, a story of limits: The limits of anger, the limits of moral branding, the limits of revisionism, and the enduring power of organisational depth in a winner-take-all system.
BNP won not because it inspired a nation, but because it understood it.

US pressures Vanuatu at UN over ICJ’s landmark climate change ruling
Cable seen by Al Jazeera says the US ‘strongly objects’ to the island nation seeking support for ICJ’s landmark climate ruling.
The United States is urging governments to pressure Vanuatu to withdraw a United Nations draft resolution supporting a landmark International Court of Justice (ICJ) ruling that countries have a legal obligation to act on climate change.
A US State Department cable seen by Al Jazeera on Saturday says that the Trump administration “strongly objects” to the proposed resolution being circulated by the Pacific island nation of Vanuatu in support of last year’s ruling by the ICJ – the UN’s top court.

The Associated Press news agency, which also reported on the cable, said that it was circulated to all US embassies and consulates this week, shortly after Vanuatu announced it was putting forward the draft UN resolution for consideration.
“We are strongly urging Vanuatu to immediately withdraw its draft resolution and cease attempting to wield the Court’s Advisory Opinion as a basis for creating an avenue to pursue any misguided claims of international legal obligations,” a copy of the cable seen by Al Jazeera states.
The ICJ’s 15 judges considered tens of thousands of pages of written submissions and two weeks of oral arguments during the court’s biggest-ever case, before delivering their verdict last year that states have a legal obligation to act on the “existential threat” of climate change.
The ICJ case took place after Vanuatu won the support of 132 countries in the UN General Assembly, which can request opinions from The Hague-based court.
It also came as the Trump administration has sought to undo US action on climate change, both at home and at the UN.
The US cable claims that Vanuatu’s proposed UN resolution in support of the ICJ opinion was based on “speculative climate models to fabricate purported legal obligations that seek to assign blame and encourage baseless claims”.
Louis Charbonneau, Human Rights Watch’s director at the UN, urged support for Vanuatu’s draft resolution on Friday, saying “governments should live up to their obligation” to protect human rights around the world by protecting the environment.
“Responsible governments shouldn’t allow themselves to be bullied by those that reject the global scientific consensus and continue to support reliance on harmful fossil fuels,” he said.
Vanuatu’s UN Ambassador Odo Tevi, who said his country wants a vote on the resolution by the end of March, has stressed that it would ensure that the clarity in the ICJ ruling “strengthens global climate action and multilateral cooperation”.
An article in Vanuatu’s Daily Post newspaper said that the draft resolution has been endorsed by countries including Barbados, Burkina Faso, Colombia, Jamaica, Kenya, the Marshall Islands, Micronesia, the Netherlands, Palau, the Philippines, Singapore and Sierra Leone.
Many of these countries are already experiencing the worsening effects of climate change, including increasingly severe storms.
Trump, who has promised to “drill, baby drill” for oil in his second term, has withdrawn the US from UN climate bodies, including the UN’s top climate change treaty body, the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC).
Trump has also threatened to impose sanctions on diplomats who voted for a levy on polluting shipping fuels at the International Maritime Organization (IMO).

International Monetary Fund says Türkiye’s disinflation program delivering results, growth remains steady
Global organization notes inflation decline on tight policy mix, urges continued fiscal discipline, structural reforms to secure lasting stability
ISTANBUL
The International Monetary Fund (IMF) said Friday that Türkiye’s disinflation program has shown success, and the current policy mix “continues to balance disinflation with steady growth.”
The IMF Executive Board completed the 2025 Article IV consultation with Türkiye, it said in a statement.
“Since the 2024 Article IV, Türkiye’s disinflation program has shown successes,” said the fund. “Inflation fell from 49.4% (y/y) in September 2024 to 30.9% in December 2025 on the back of strong fiscal consolidation, prudent income policies, and a tight monetary policy stance.”
It noted that following a temporary deceleration in mid-2024, GDP growth has remained strong, with a forecast at 4.1% in 2025. “Turkish Lira demand has strengthened, bolstering international reserves, and the current account deficit remains adequately financed,” it added.
Tight monetary policy expected to support gradual disinflation
“Tight monetary policy, moderate wage growth, and broadly neutral fiscal policy are expected to support gradual disinflation,” it said, emphasizing that the current policy mix continues to balance disinflation with steady growth.
The statement said end-2026 inflation is expected at 23%, as domestic demand remains strong, and boosted by further policy rate cuts and rising confidence, growth is expected at 4.2% for 2026.
It also noted that the current account deficit would “remain adequately financed, while depositor confidence and strong gold prices would allow reserves to stay at around 80 percent of the IMF’s adequacy metric.”
While growth should remain solid and inflation will fall, the IMF said the approach bears risks and costs, noting that external risks remain elevated due to persistent global trade uncertainty and regional conflicts.
“The materialization of an adverse shock, like an increase of energy prices or a negative weather event, could further extend the period of still-high inflation. Moreover, the gradual approach to disinflation has weighed on the financial sector and slowed productivity growth,” the statement said.
Call for ambitious structural reforms
The statement included the executive board’s assessment, praising authorities for significant achievements under the disinflation program, which reduced macroeconomic imbalances, strengthened confidence and preserved strong growth.
Inflation remains well above the target and the economy is highly vulnerable to shocks, the IMF said, underscoring the need for a tighter macroeconomic policy mix and ambitious structural reforms to entrench disinflation, strengthen external buffers and support inclusive medium-term growth.
Authorities were commended for strong fiscal efforts last year, with the IMF urging continued fiscal tightening to reinforce disinflation.
“Directors emphasized the role of measures to broaden the tax base and improve compliance, together with further efforts to streamline expenditures through phasing out energy subsidies,” the statement said.
Directors also called for carefully sequenced and well communicated measures “to minimize second-round inflationary impacts while mitigating the impact on vulnerable households.”
“As fiscal space expands, additional resources could be redirected to social priorities. Directors also supported full alignment of wage policies with inflation targets, as well as stronger oversight of PPPs and SOEs,” the IMF said.
Financial sector remains robust
Directors stressed that the financial sector “remains robust,” supported by the authorities’ swift and effective response to market stress.
They generally urged tighter monetary policy to secure durable disinflation, while emphasizing the need for policy rate decisions should remain data-dependent and mindful of macro-financial effects.
“To bolster policy credibility and strengthen transmission, Directors emphasized the importance of a simplified monetary policy framework firmly centered on the policy rate, with enhanced central bank independence and communication,” the statement noted.
Directors also stressed that continued vigilance is warranted, particularly for still high FX liquidity risks, and supported ongoing efforts to strengthen the supervisory and resolution frameworks along with enhanced oversight, including of crypto assets.
The statement underlined that the directors urged structural reforms to foster productivity, resilience and medium-term growth, with top priorities including “improvements in labor, education, and governance and legal frameworks, support for SMEs, and raising the share of renewables in the energy mix.”
Economic indicators
According to IMF projections, Türkiye’s economy is expected to grow 4.1% in 2027 and 4% annually between 2028 and 2031.
The unemployment rate is forecast at 8.3% in 2026, 8.7% in 2027, and 9.1% during 2028-2031.
Inflation is projected to fall to 19% next year and then ease to 15% through 2031. The current account deficit is expected to equal 1.4% of GDP in 2026-2028 and 1.5% in 2029-2031.

Two dead after alleged car theft and police chase across Sydney
Updated ,first published
Two women are dead after a man who led police on an hour-long chase across Sydney’s south-west in a stolen vehicle crashed into their car, before being arrested at gunpoint.
Police said the pursuit began soon after a 31-year-old man allegedly punched a 25-year-old who was filling up his car with fuel at a petrol station on King Georges Road in South Hurstville, about 10.20 on Saturday morning.
The 25-year-old fell to the ground after being struck, before the man allegedly stole his car keys from his pocket as well as his mobile phone, and drove off in the stolen car.
Highway patrol officers in Beverly Hills spotted the allegedly stolen car a short time later, and attempted to get the driver to pull over. When the car did not stop, officers called in more support, including a police helicopter, to chase the car.
The vehicle pursuit was terminated when the car was on the M5 motorway around Bankstown about 10.30am.
NSW Police Assistant Commissioner Brett McFadden said the helicopter continued to track the sedan as officers considered different strategies to try and stop the car.
“I’ve watched the footage … He was driving in what I could describe as one of the most reckless and dangerous demonstrations of driving I’ve seen in a long time,” McFadden said. “He was overtaking vehicles at speed in the breakdown lanes, was crossing onto the incorrect side of the road.”
After evading police for 50 minutes, at the intersection of Remembrance Drive and the Old Hume Highway south of Camden, the car collided with an Alfa Romeo being driven by a 60-year-old woman and carrying an 84-year-old passenger.
“The offending driver has gone up the inside of those vehicles at speed, crossed into the intersection and impacted with another vehicle that had the lawful opportunity to turn right,” McFadden said.
The two people in the Alfa Romeo were treated by NSW Police and Ambulance paramedics, but both died at the scene.
The driver of the allegedly stolen sedan ran from the crash site but was arrested at gunpoint by police.
“This is a tragic set of circumstances. What we do know is that the 60-year-old driver and 84-year-old passenger, both who died at the scene, are part of an extended family … our hearts and thoughts are with that family at this devastating time,” McFadden said.
“The 31-year-old male that is in custody is well known to us, and he is directly responsible for the death of those two women.”
The driver was taken to Campbelltown Hospital for mandatory testing and was subsequently taken to Campbelltown Police Station for further questioning.
Police said they had set up several crime scenes. A critical incident team from Burwood Police Area Command would lead the investigation into the incidents, supported by the St George Police Area Command and the Crash Investigation Unit.
The investigation will be reviewed by the Professional Standards Command and overseen by the Law Enforcement Conduct Commission.
Police have asked anyone with dashcam footage to provide it to Crime Stoppers.

Investigators search second home in Nancy Guthrie kidnapping case

- Authorities served a search warrant at a Tucson home two miles from Nancy Guthrie’s residence and removed two people as the 13-day kidnapping investigation intensifies.
- Video footage shows an armed man in a balaclava tampering with her doorbell camera at 1:47 a.m. the night she vanished from her home.
- Investigators test gloves and DNA evidence while multiple ransom notes, including one from an alleged impostor, add confusion to the search.
Authorities served a search warrant at a home in Tucson on Friday night in connection with the disappearance of Nancy Guthrie, who investigators say was kidnapped from her nearby home 13 days ago.
A SWAT team converged on a house about two miles from Guthrie’s Arizona residence and removed two people from inside, law enforcement sources told The Times.
A man and a woman complied with orders to exit the home, News Nation reported.
It is unclear what role, if any, the people may have played in Guthrie’s disappearance, which has flummoxed investigators for almost two weeks.
A Pima County Sheriff’s Department spokesperson confirmed late Friday that there was “law enforcement activity underway” at a home near E Orange Grove Road and N. First Avenue related to the Guthrie case, but declined to share additional information.
The FBI did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Investigators got their first major break in the case Tuesday with the release of footage showing an armed man wearing a balaclava, gloves and a backpack approaching the front door of Guthrie’s home and tampering with a Nest camera at 1:47 a.m. the night she was abducted.
Later Tuesday, authorities detained a man at a traffic stop in Rio Rico, a semirural community about 12 miles north of the U.S.-Mexico border, in connection with the investigation. Deputies and FBI forensics experts and agents searched his family’s home overnight but did not locate Guthrie. The man was released hours later and has denied any involvement in her disappearance. The Times is not naming him because he has not been arrested or accused of a crime.
Nancy Guthrie, the 84-year-old mother of “Today” host Savannah Guthrie, was discovered missing Feb. 1 after she didn’t show up to a friend’s house to watch a church service. She was taken from her home without her heart medication, and it’s unclear how long she can survive without it.
A day after Guthrie disappeared, news outlets received identical ransom notes that investigators treated as legitimate. Days later, a note was sent directly to the Guthrie family, allegedly from a man living in Hawthorne, that authorities say was an impostor.
Another ransom note was sent to a television station in Arizona last week.
Sources told The Times that authorities have no proof the person who authored the ransom notes has Guthrie. But they also said the Feb. 2 note felt credible because it included details about a specific damaged piece of property and the placement of an accessory in the home that had not been made public.
On Friday, TMZ said it received a letter from someone claiming to know the identity of the person who abducted Guthrie and demanding the $100,000 FBI reward in bitcoin. The person wrote they don’t trust the FBI, which is why they’re sending the communication through TMZ, the website’s founder, Harvey Levin, told CNN.
“The manhunt of the main individual that can give you all the answers be prepared to go international,” the letter reads, according to Levin.
Authorities have released limited details about other evidence in the case.
However, the Pima County Sheriff’s Department said Friday that investigators located several gloves, including some found about two miles from Guthrie’s home, that are being tested.
Authorities also found DNA evidence that does not belong to Guthrie or members of her family at her home. Investigators are working to identify whom the DNA belongs to, according to the sheriff’s department.

University sparks free speech row with proposed ‘campus access’ policy

University sparks free speech row with proposed ‘campus access’ policy
La Trobe University is facing resistance to a proposed tough “campus access” policy that would give management veto powers over banners, flags and even gazebos.
Students are pledging to fight the policy, arguing that it is aimed at further curtailing pro-Palestinian protests and other activism but will also give the university’s management sweeping powers to shut down any form of expression it finds embarrassing or inconvenient.
The proposed rules would give security guards the right to demand identification from people on university property and march protesters off campus, with lengthy bans potentially imposed by university authorities.
The policy would also give university management veto power over any banners or flags attached to university property and impose an Australian Electoral Commission-style authorisation regime on posters, pamphlets, flyers and other material distributed on campus.
The consultation period for the policy ends on Monday, three weeks before the vast majority of students return to campus from their summer breaks for the start of semester 1.
La Trobe management told this masthead the policy was designed to provide for “reasonable and proportionate action” to be taken against activity that put campus users in danger, obstructed university operations or broke the law, and that much of the policy was not even new.
The university has endured months of bad publicity after one of its key sponsored events, the Bendigo Writers Festival, collapsed after La Trobe, urged on by pro-Israel activists, moved to impose a “code of conduct” on participants at the literary gathering.
University bosses are also embroiled in a bitter dispute with the La Trobe Student Union after trying to establish an alternative student representative council that gave university executives power to hire or fire council members or even bar people from standing for election.
Students for Palestine spokesman Xavier Dupe said the latest developments all pointed to an increasingly authoritarian regime at La Trobe, aimed at shutting down opposition and dissent on campus.
“Clearly, this is an attempt by the university to make it more difficult,” Dupe said. “They want to create an atmosphere where students feel afraid to speak out for fear of repercussions.”
The activist said that another aspect of the policy – mandating official permission for any sort of temporary structure on campus including tents and gazebos – would give management unprecedented control over more aspects of university life.
“Under this policy, you would need permission from the director to set up a table and hand out leaflets, the most basic campus activity,” Dupe said.
“What that means is, unless you get approval from the appropriate director, it would mean the student union could not set up a table to leaflet about students’ rental rights.
“It would mean the National Tertiary Education Union could not set up a table to try to recruit people to the union.
“Even for non-political clubs, it would place a massive burden. You would need permission to do something as simple as set up a table to ask people to join the Islamic Society or the Pakistani Society, or the arts and crafts club.”
The National Tertiary Education Union’s La Trobe representative did not respond to requests for comment.
A university spokesperson defended the proposed policy.
“The draft campus access, premises and facilities policy reflects La Trobe’s commitment to designing, building and maintaining premises that are fit for their intended purpose,” the spokesperson said.
“The draft policy sets out the university’s expectations associated with all those who enter or use our campus premises and facilities.
“The draft policy is intended to provide for reasonable and proportionate action to be taken where any activity or an individual presents an unacceptable health and safety risk, unreasonably disrupts operations or otherwise breaches the law or another university policy.”
The spokesperson said that comments from university staff and students would be considered as part of the consultation process.
“As with all policies, we have actively communicated about the consultation with staff and students and will carefully consider their feedback before the policy is finalised and approved,” the spokesperson said.
“The consultation period reflects that many of the proposed policy features align with existing regulations set out in university statute, as well as existing practice. ”

Law enforcement investigating the disappearance of “Today” show host Savannah Guthrie's mother sealed off a road near Nancy Guthrie's home in Arizona late Friday night.
A parade of sheriff’s and FBI vehicles, including forensics vehicles, passed through the roadblock that was set up about 2 miles (3.2 kilometers) from the house.
The Pima County Sheriff’s Department said the activity was part of the Guthrie investigation but declined to detail specifics.
Guthrie, 84, was reported missing on Feb. 1. Authorities say her blood was found on the front porch of her Tucson-area home. Purported ransom notes were sent to news outlets, but two deadlines for paying have passed.

NATO chief says drawing down American troops in Europe to take time

WASHINGTON, February 14. /TASS/. The process of reducing the number of the US army units stationed in Europe will not be quick, NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte said in an interview with PBS.
"This will take time because what for the US is crucially important, is that they see the seriousness [of European countries’ intentions to significantly increase defense spending]," he said. The NATO chief emphasized that under US pressure, many countries have already boosted their military budgets, including Germany.
"And yes, it is true the US wants to pivot more towards Asia," he added, explaining that Washington was concerned about a potential crisis in the Taiwan Strait.
In 2025, the Pentagon redeployed a brigade from the 101st Airborne Division of the US Army from Romania back to its home base. The troops returned to the state of Kentucky.
At the end of 2025, the US Congress approved a defense budget that explicitly barred the Pentagon from reducing the number of American troops stationed in Europe below 76,000 for more than 45 days.

Budget impasse shuts down US Department of Homeland Security

Budget impasse shuts down US Department of Homeland Security
Sign up now: Get ST's newsletters delivered to your inbox
WASHINGTON – The US Department of Homeland Security (DHS) entered a partial shutdown on Feb 14 as US lawmakers fight over funding the agency overseeing much of US President Donald Trump’s immigration crackdown.
Thousands of government workers, from airport security agents to disaster relief officials, will either be furloughed or forced to work without pay until funding is agreed upon by Congress.
At the centre of the budget dispute is the department’s Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), whose agents killed two US citizens
The Democrats oppose any new funding for DHS until major changes are implemented over how ICE conducts its operations.
In particular, they have demanded curtailed patrols, a ban on ICE agents wearing face masks during operations and the requirement that they obtain a judicial warrant to enter private property.
“Donald Trump and the Republicans have decided that they have zero interest in getting ICE under control,” House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries said on Feb 13.
“Dramatic changes are needed,” Mr Jeffries told a news conference. “Absent that, Republicans have decided to shut down parts of the federal government.”
White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt put the blame on the opposition, telling Fox News that “Democrats are barrelling our government towards another shutdown for political and partisan reasons”.
But while DHS faces a shutdown, ICE itself will remain operational, under funds approved in the 2025 government spending Bill.
Senator John Fetterman pushed against his fellow Democrats, saying: “This shutdown literally has zero impact on ICE.”
The primary impact would land on other agencies, including the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), which oversees emergency response to natural disasters.
The Transportation Security Administration, which runs airport safety, warned on X that a prolonged shutdown could result in longer wait times and cancelled flights.
Negotiations stalled
The shutdown would be the third of Mr Trump’s second term, including a record 43-day government closure in October 2025 and November 2025
The government just reopened from a smaller, four-day partial shutdown earlier in February
Even if all 53 Republican senators vote to fund DHS, Senate rules require support from 60 of the body’s 100 members to advance the budget Bill, meaning several Democrats would need to get on board.
In response to the Democrats’ demands, the White House said it was ready to negotiate over immigration enforcement policy.
Senate Majority Leader John Thune called it “an extremely serious offer”, but warned the Democrats are “never going to get their full wish list”.
Some concessions were made during the previous shutdown amid Democratic pressure and national outcry after federal agents shot and killed Ms Renee Good
Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said federal agents in the city would wear body cameras “effective immediately” in a move that would be later “expanded nationwide”.
The Senate went into recess for a week starting Feb 12, but senators could be called back to Washington in case of a rapid leap in negotiations.
For the moment, however, talks between the White House and Democrats appear to be at a standstill. AFP

Creating a culture of kindness in our schools

Creating a culture of kindness in our schools
Bullying in our schoolyards costs the country upwards of $500 million over 13 years of schooling and victims up to eight months of learning.
Today’s report by Emily Kowal on the NSW government’s landmark policy for handling bullying represents a significant shift in the way schools are required to respond to the age-old problem of abuses of power in the playground.
The state’s behaviour expert, Donna Cross, has found that “zero tolerance” policies involving suspension and expulsion are ineffective and harmful.
While the new policy, detailed in The Sun-Herald, takes a broad approach, the notion that a culture of kindness in schools and the rehabilitation of the bully are key to prevention makes sense. The question now is whether the implementation is achievable across the state’s schools, particularly given the training that will be required for already-stressed teachers.
We know that addressing bullying is vital; research has shown that children who are bullied are at much higher risk of developing depression and anxiety in adulthood.
We also know that schools struggle to manage bullying. Often there is a lack of evidence about a specific instance, or the context is not clear, or victims and witnesses are afraid to speak up for fear of being labelled a “snitch”. Too often victims and their families feel like their concerns have been dismissed, or that the bully has escaped with insufficient consequence.
Until now, this confused response has been due to the fact that many schools have lacked a framework to guide their response to difficult questions, such as what level of seriousness should trigger an investigation, who should do the investigating, and how the victim and bully should be managed before anything is proven?
As The Kidman Centre director Rachael Murrihy told the Herald in 2024: “Often there’s two points of trauma. There’s the bullying in the first place and there’s the handling of it by the school. It’s not something that’s intentional, but it’s a significant problem.”
The focus of the NSW government on addressing bullying promptly and in a more holistic fashion is welcome. That schools such as Heritage College, featured today, place as much emphasis on teaching good character as they do on academics is smart; as headmaster Simon Dodson says, not every child is academic, but each one can be a kind person.
Moreover, if less classroom time is spent on misbehaviour, more time can be spent on learning.
The new policy does not prevent bullies from being suspended or expelled – only that those measures will become a last resort. Combining consequences for bullies with behavioural interventions such as counselling and personalised support is in everyone’s interests.
Indeed, it seems superior to the well-trodden path from suspension to expulsion, to being another school’s problem. In the worst outcomes for the perpetrator, the bully falls behind, loses interest in their schooling and is disadvantaged further in life by their childhood behaviour. If their behaviour is not addressed constructively, they may well victimise others.
No policy tweaks, it should be remembered, excuse parents from encouraging kindness in their children. The removal of social media from the screens of under 16s will help with that.
For schools, with the carrot comes a stick. The Sun-Herald welcomes the NSW Education Standards Authority’s threat to remove a school’s accreditation should they not implement the new policy and respond promptly to instances of bullying.
While NESA must ensure its policies strike the right balance between rehabilitating the perpetrator and protecting the victim, the new policy is a welcome refresh. How it works in the real world is something that will be worth watching, for all of our children’s sake.

The United States and Iran are expected to hold a second round of nuclear talks in Geneva next Tuesday as both sides seek a diplomatic path to avert conflict, according to U.S. and other sources familiar with the planning.
President Donald Trump has expressed a preference for a negotiated solution but has simultaneously ordered a significant U.S. military buildup in the Middle East, including the deployment of a second aircraft carrier strike group.
The US delegation in Geneva will include senior adviser Jared Kushner and White House envoy Steve Witkoff, while Iran’s delegation is expected to be led by Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi. Oman’s foreign minister, who has been mediating between the parties, is also expected to attend.
Trump told reporters that any deal must include Iran’s commitment to zero uranium enrichment, a core demand that has so far complicated negotiations.
Behind the scenes, U.S. officials have been relaying messages through mediators to Tehran in the lead-up to the Geneva talks, an indication of intense diplomatic activity even as the threat of military action looms.

US’ Rubio, German chancellor discuss Ukraine, NATO, supply chains in Munich
Meeting comes on sidelines of Munich Security Conference, where Rubio, Merz discussed 'pressing global challenges,' says State Department
WASHINGTON
US Secretary of State Marco Rubio met Friday with German Chancellor Friedrich Merz in Munich, where they discussed efforts to end the Russia-Ukraine war and deepen the partnership between their countries, according to the US State Department.
The meeting took place on the sidelines of the Munich Security Conference.
Rubio and Merz discussed “pressing global challenges,” including securing supply chains, advancing efforts to end the Russia-Ukraine war and reinforcing the US-Europe partnership, according to the US State Department.
Rubio expressed appreciation for Germany’s support for Ukraine, noting that Berlin has provided more than $76 billion in assistance since 2022. The pair also discussed continued coordination on Ukraine’s reconstruction, said the State Department.
A German government source said the situation in Ukraine and the status of negotiations with Russia were central to the talks, along with continued military support for Kyiv, "particularly military aid."
The leaders also addressed NATO and Europe’s role within the alliance, with Rubio commending Germany’s efforts to strengthen it.
Merz and Rubio exchanged views on developments in the Middle East, particularly Iran, and discussed trade policy and the situation in East Asia ahead of the chancellor’s trip to China, the source added.

Partial government shutdown looms over US Homeland Security Department

Partial government shutdown looms over US Homeland Security Department
Lawmakers in House, Senate left Washington without funding deal
WASHINGTON
The US Department of Homeland Security (DHS) faces a partial government shutdown after Congress failed to approve funding for the agency by a deadline Friday.
DHS is now the only federal agency without funding for the remainder of fiscal year 2026, which continues through Sept. 30, while lawmakers have already approved spending bills covering the rest of the government since the record-long shutdown ended in November.
The latest funding measure, passed at the end of January, provided DHS with a two-week extension to allow Congress additional time to negotiate changes to the agency’s immigration enforcement practices -- a stipulation pushed by Senate Democrats following the killing of two Americans by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents in the state of Minnesota in January.
On Thursday, the upper chamber failed to advance a measure to fund the department and lawmakers in both chambers left Washington without any deal.
A total of 16 agencies fall under DHS, including the Coast Guard, FEMA and the US Secret Service. Two of the agencies that have stoked Democratic furor amid President Donald Trump's migrant crackdown -- ICE and Customs and Border Patrol (CBP) -- are unlikely to suffer any major operational effects from a partial shutdown.
House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries told reporters that "dramatic changes" are needed at the DHS in terms of ICE and CBP.
"ICE needs to be dramatically reformed. Period. Full stop," Jeffries stressed.
When asked if the Democrats want a direct meeting with Trump to try to close the deal, Jeffries said they have not called for a direct meeting "at this point."
"But again, we're ready to sit down with anyone, anytime, anyplace, if they are serious about the types of dramatic reforms that are necessary to get ICE under control," he said.
Democrats and Republicans have been discussing potential changes to ICE and CBP, but so far, the two parties have not reached a consensus.
Trump said Friday that negotiations with the Democrats are progressing on a funding agreement for the department.
“We’ll see what happens. We always have to protect our law enforcement. They have done a great job,” Trump told reporters.
Democrats have insisted on stronger oversight and tighter limits on immigration enforcement -- including banning the use of masks by officers, requiring body cameras to remain on, and mandating visible identification -- as a condition for supporting the funding bill.
"I know what they want; I know what they can live with," Trump said, adding that Democrats "have gone crazy. They're radical left lunatics. That's why their cities are so unsafe."

These examples of classic modernist architecture are where, exactly?
The enclave of classic Australian modernist architecture is so well hidden that some long-time residents might not even know it exists.
Yet, this is no ritzy Melbourne cul-de-sac or CBD development, but a quiet residential court in Wangaratta, north-east Victoria. Despite the understated location, these architectural gems reflect a crucial part of the town’s history.
After World War II, Wangaratta was experiencing an industrial boom driven partly by textile manufacturing.
One company driving that economic expansion was Bruck Mills, which built a factory for textile production as well as housing and accommodation for workers and visitors.
In the mid-1950s, the company commissioned the firm Grounds, Romberg & Boyd, in which acclaimed Australian architect Robin Boyd was a partner, to design three single-storey staff houses, a caretaker’s cottage and a double-storey accommodation and entertainment facility.
Robin Boyd’s designs have become synonymous with his distinctive Australian modernist style, which included “window walls”, integration with the natural environment and clever use of indoor space in both compact and large houses. The Wangaratta buildings were completed about 1954.
But now residents of Bruck Court and the Robin Boyd Foundation are aghast at plans to demolish the caretaker’s cottage as part of a residential development proposed by Australian Textile Mills, which owns the factory. Australian Textile Mills also owns the caretaker’s cottage and the double-storey building known as Bruck House.
The company argues the cottage is dilapidated and the proposed development will preserve the enclave’s historic purpose of providing worker accommodation.
In December, Wangaratta Council approved Australian Textile Mills’ application to demolish the cottage, build seven dwellings for worker accommodation and subdivide the land into two lots.
While the company owns the cottage and Bruck House, the neighbouring houses are now privately owned.
The Robin Boyd Foundation urged Heritage Council Victoria to intervene. It subsequently issued a 60-day interim protection order, which expires on March 1.
HCV will then make a recommendation on whether the buildings should be added to the Victorian Heritage Register. The buildings are currently only covered by Wangaratta Council’s heritage overlay.
Chris Spencer moved to Wangaratta 16 years ago to work for Bruck Textiles and moved into one of the homes designed by Boyd’s architecture firm. She bought the home from Bruck about three years later.
“I love the history of the place, and it’s a great little house,” she said.
Spencer wants the properties heritage listed even though that would ultimately place limits on what she could do with her house.
“I’m happy for that to happen,” she said. “I think it’s important to preserve something that’s done by renowned architect Robin Boyd.”
Spencer said the design worked well for her lifestyle.
“It’s a small house, but it’s compact. It’s got everything I need, and it just works.”
A report by heritage consultant Deborah Kemp described Boyd as Australia’s most influential mid-century voice within the architecture profession.
She said the Bruck Mill complex was an experiment in urban planning where Boyd sought to demonstrate how to develop a medium-density housing cluster in contrast with the standard freestanding house on a quarter-acre block.
“Boyd was clearly an innovator and, with this development at Bruck Court, was experimenting with a planned urban environment,” the report said.
The designs for the three single-storey staff houses and caretaker’s cottage reflected Boyd’s early modernist architectural ideals, the report observed.
“This includes largely modular buildings with the simple rectangular forms and flat roofs.”
Kemp’s report described the Wangaratta buildings as a rare surviving example of the modernist aesthetic Boyd developed during the 1950s.
Architect Steven Bishop, who represents property owner Philip Bart, said Australian Textile Mills was a major employer in Wangaratta. He argued the caretaker’s cottage was dilapidated and had been “significantly altered over the years”.
“Although the Bruck House is attributed to Boyd himself, we are fairly sure that the caretaker’s cottage, which came later, was done by his firm and not him,” Bishop said.
He said the proposed development would support the mill’s viability by providing accommodation for specialist workers.
If Heritage Council Victoria recommends retaining the caretaker’s cottage, Bishop said it would put the mill’s viability at risk: “Without consent, the project and the existing buildings on site will stall, and will likely fall further into disrepair.”
Wangaratta Council did not respond to The Age’s request for comment, but in a report to councillors noted there were conflicting opinions about the proposed demolition and development.
Robin Boyd Foundation chair Tony Isaacson lodged the application with Heritage Council Victoria hoping to gain protection for all the buildings designed by Boyd’s firm in Bruck Court.
Isaacson argued the houses in the court were excellent examples of Boyd design that should be protected both in their own right and as part of a cohesive group.
“This opportunity to bring the group together is what’s so special,” he said. “The individual buildings are as good as any in Australia of their type.”

The moment Claremont socialites almost came to blows in parking spot row

The moment Claremont socialites almost came to blows in parking spot row
The usually quiet streets of Claremont – an affluent and leafy suburb between the coast and the river in Perth’s west – were filled, if briefly, by an almighty yelling.
Two neighbours, both well-to-do professions, were close to blows outside their million-dollar strata complex in a row over a parking spot.
It was the culmination of a months-long argument that ended with one woman waving a knife, or a ruler – depending on who you asked – at the other.
West Australian architect Louise St John Kennedy, 74, was arrested and charged by police after the incident in May 2024 during which it was claimed she assaulted her 81-year-old neighbour, rheumatologist Dr Prudence Manners.
The protracted trial revealed a months-long dispute between the women that played out in text messages and ended in the driveway confrontation.
Now, with Kennedy found not guilty of being armed or pretending to be armed in a way that may cause fear and common assault, footage of the confrontation and heated messages between the pair were release by the court this week.
Shared driveway sparks strata stand-off
The saga began when Manners moved into the Chester Road property at the start of 2024 – a property that award-winning architect Kennedy had designed herself.
Kennedy later sold off four of the $2 million homes and kept one for herself and subsequently helped draw up the property’s strata by-laws.
One of them was about parking on a shared driveway and a sign was erected to the effect.
But Manners repeatedly parked in the no-go area, irking her neighbours – or at least, one neighbour in particular.
The first time Kennedy asked her politely to move the car was in February 2024.
During the following month, Manners had blocked the driveway five more times and messages showed that while it was clear Kennedy was becoming exasperated at being unable to use her car, she did try and strike up a friendship to smooth things over.
Still, the older lady kept parking in the no-go zone.
After one text exchange between the women, the doctor offered to show the architect how to back her vehicle out around her car.
Kennedy declined the driving lesson and told Manners she was missing the point before Manners went on to again park illegally, and then told Kennedy the car had a flat battery and couldn’t be moved until help arrived.
“Prue, after numerous polite requests for you to not park in the signed No Parking body corp area I’m again blocked in by your thoughtless parking,” Manners wrote in the days before the pair came to blows.
“Are you completely stupid or just incredibly thoughtless or both.
“Stop saying there’s room to get around a parked car and use your common sense and understand why that is both wrong and ignorant … and very f---ing frustrating.
“It is NO PARKING. This is my very last warning. Take this seriously. Louise.”
A vet trip sparks a confrontation that ends up in court
Days later, Kennedy needed to get her sick dog to the vet in an emergency but couldn’t get out of the driveway due to Manners’ parking.
What happened next was caught on camera by a neighbour.
Kennedy can be heard raging at the 81-year-old, saying: “Move your car you f---ing dumb bitch.”
She was also seen waving something around in her hand. Kennedy said it was an architect’s angle-finder ruler. Manners claimed it was a large kitchen knife.
Manners also alleged Kennedy grabbed her around the neck and pushed her, which was not caught on camera.
In response, Kennedy claims Manners shouted to her, “hope the dog dies, Louise”, which led her to “momentarily lose control”.
She admitted yelling profanities but was adamant she did not hit the woman and was never holding a knife.
Despite that she was charged with being armed or pretending to be armed in a way that may cause fear and common assault, which she pleaded not guilty to and represented herself in a drawn-out trial that began at the end of 2024 and ended last week in Perth Magistrates Court.
Kennedy was exonerated with a not guilty verdict.
Magistrate Lynette Dias called the doctor’s text messages “gaslighting” and said her 74-year-old neighbour momentarily lost self-control in a “final straw” event.
Dias said the architect had been “provoked” and that she saw no evidence of a knife being used in the argument.
She added that the doctor was “not a reliable witness”, as she had given contradictory evidence and at one point had to review courtroom footage as claims were made that she was being “coached” on the witness stand by her daughter.
After the not-guilty verdict, Kennedy said she would also be fighting a restraining order the older woman had placed on her.
“I was always confident of my side of the story and that justice would be done once that came out, and it was,” Kennedy told 9News Perth.
But Kennedy claims that, despite intervention from the police and the court, Manners continues to block the pair’s shared driveway.
“We’ve all been through a difficult process, Dr Manners, her family, and I hope we’ve got it in our hearts that we can live together peacefully now,” Kennedy said.

Bangladesh EC publishes official results showing BNP landslide
Interim leader Muhammad Yunus congratulates Rahman for ‘the landslide victory of his party’.
The Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) has won the country’s crucial parliamentary election with a thumping majority, with leader Tarique Rahman poised to become the prime minister, according to newly published official results.
Bangladesh Election Commission results, published by The Dhaka Tribune and Prothomalo English news website on Saturday, showed Rahman’s BNP overwhelmingly winning Thursday’s polls.

The commission has published the gazette of the members of parliament elected, a final official seal on the election process.
Initial results published on Friday by the Election Commission gave the BNP and its allies at least 212 out of 299 parliamentary seats, while the opposition Jamaat-e-Islami and its allies won 77 seats.
The National Citizen Party, led by youth activists who played a key role in toppling Hasina and part of a Jamaat-led alliance, won just six of the 30 seats it contested, highlighting the difficulty of converting protest momentum into electoral support.
In a statement, Bangladesh’s interim leader Muhammad Yunus congratulated Rahman for “the landslide victory of his party” as he prepares to step down and hand over power to an elected government.
The 85-year-old Nobel Peace Prize winner, who has led Bangladesh as its “chief adviser” since an August 2024 uprising, said that Rahman “would help guide the country toward stability, inclusiveness, and development”.
The opposition Jamaat-e-Islami party has also issued a statement saying it had accepted the “overall outcome” of the election won by the rival nationalist party, despite having alleged problems with the vote count.
“We recognise the overall outcome, and we respect the rule of law,” Jamaat chief Shafiqur Rahman said in a statement.
Tarique Rahman, 60, has not yet commented after trends in favour of his party became clear, though he had expressed confidence in securing victory ahead of the vote.
Rahman smiled and waved from his vehicle to journalists gathered outside his house in Dhaka as he left for a mosque, television footage showed.
Late on Friday, US Secretary of State Marco Rubio congratulated the BNP, Rahman and “the people of Bangladesh” following the polls.
“The United States looks forward to working with the newly elected government to advance prosperity and the security of the region,” he wrote on X.
The BNP had asked people to refrain from large celebrations and offer special prayers instead.
“Despite winning … by a large margin of votes, no celebratory procession or rally shall be organised,” the party said.

Havana refinery fire under control amid deepening Cuban fuel crisis

A fire broke out at a refinery at the port in Cuba's capital, but was soon brought under control, authorities have said, as the island nation struggles under what amounts to a US oil blockade.
A massive plume of smoke rose from the Nico Lopez refinery in Havana Bay on Friday, though it quickly subsided.
The ministry of energy and mines said the fire, which broke out in one of the refinery's warehouses, had been brought under control.
"The cause is under investigation," the ministry said in a post on X.
The fire occurred not far from where two oil tankers were moored. Two Mexican navy ships arrived at the same harbor on Thursday with more than 800 tonnes of much-needed humanitarian aid.
‘No more Venezuelan oil would go to Cuba’
Cuba has risked being plunged into darkness since US President Donald Trump vowed to starve the country of oil.
The Caribbean country of 9.6 million inhabitants lost its main oil supply line when Trump last month ordered the abduction of Nicolas Maduro, the long-term leader of Cuban ally Venezuela.
Trump said no more Venezuelan oil would go to Cuba, and also threatened tariffs for any other country stepping in with crude supplies.
The island, under a US trade embargo since 1962, has for years been mired in a severe economic crisis marked by extended power cuts and shortages of fuel, medicine and food.
Reducing school hours, working days
No foreign fuel or oil tanker has arrived in Cuba in weeks, experts in maritime transport tracking have said.
Emergency measures kicked in this week to conserve Cuba's fast-dwindling fuel stocks. The government shuttered universities, reduced school hours and the work week, and slashed public transport as it limited fuel sales.
Staffing at hospitals was also cut back.
The United Nations said on Friday it was deeply alarmed by the crisis unfolding in Cuba.

Officials urge rethinking Sahel strategy at Munich conference
US, European, West African officials want shift from security-first policies to political, economic engagement
BAMAKO, Mali
Western counterterrorism policy in the Sahel has failed and must shift toward governance and economic development, officials said Friday at a panel on reengagement with the region during the Munich Security Conference.
US Rep. Sara Jacobs said a security-first approach during the past 25 years had not worked. “What we are seeing is a real failure of the United States and the West counter terrorism policy,” she said, arguing that focusing narrowly on security had worsened governance and economic challenges.
EU Special Representative for the Sahel João Gomes Cravinho said the bloc’s foreign ministers had adopted a renewed strategy centered on political and diplomatic engagement, human security and socio-economic resilience. “We need to be a lot better at listening,” he said, stressing the need to rebuild trust and address community-based justice, basic services and employment.
Mauritania’s defense minister Ould Sidi Hanana described the Sahel crisis as primarily economic, with security, political and climate dimensions. Sierra Leone President Julius Maada Wonie Bio, chair of the West African ECOWAS bloc, called for regional dialogue and practical engagement with Sahel neighbors, warning against “the older way of doing things.”
Participants said rebuilding trust would require closer consultation with Sahel governments, amid tensions over security strategies, trafficking and political disagreements.

Trump pushes for voter ID mandate ahead of midterms
'There will be Voter I.D. for the Midterm Elections, whether approved by Congress or not!' president says
WASHINGTON
US President Donald Trump said Friday that voter identification rules will be in place for the November midterm elections regardless of whether Congress signs off on them.
"There will be Voter I.D. for the Midterm Elections, whether approved by Congress or not!" Trump wrote on Truth Social.
Trump also criticized congressional Democrats for election policy, accusing them of opposing voter identification and citizenship verification requirements.
"The reason is very simple — They want to continue to cheat in Elections," he said, without providing evidence.
The president added that he has explored new legal arguments to justify imposing voter identification requirements, even without congressional approval.
Trump also called for proof of US citizenship to vote and said mail-in ballots should be eliminated, with limited exceptions for military service members, voters with disabilities, illness or those traveling.
In a separate post, Trump signaled he may pursue executive action if Congress does not act.
"We cannot let the Democrats get away with no voter ID any longer ... If we can’t get it through Congress, there are Legal reasons why this scam is not permitted. I will be presenting them shortly, in the form of an Executive Order," he said.

Savvy Hongkongers book 9-day Lunar New Year break for festive trips across Asia
Immigration Department earlier forecast number of trips by residents and visitors alike would reach 11.38 million between February 14 and 23
Travellers, including families with children and elderly relatives, gathered at check-in counters in Hong Kong International Airport in the morning as the city marked Valentine’s Day and prepared to ring in the Year of the Horse.
In a facility-wide announcement, airport staff urged travellers to proceed to immigration counters as soon as possible after checking in, noting that “a large number” of passengers were expected to depart the city.
The Immigration Department earlier said that it expected the number of trips by residents and visitors alike would reach 11.38 million between February 14 and 23, an increase of 16 per cent from the previous Lunar New Year period.
It added that more than 117,220 residents had left Hong Kong by 10am on Saturday, with around 27,840 departing via the airport.

This Sydney school has eliminated bullying. Now there’s a plan for every classroom

This Sydney school has eliminated bullying. Now there’s a plan for every classroom
Bullied students would be given personalised safety plans that could include more supervision and their own “safe zone”, such as a library, under new bullying rules to be rolled out across all NSW schools next year.
Schools must prioritise student wellbeing, explicitly teach kindness, respect and inclusion, and counsel bullies rather than simply punishing them. Every incident must be recorded and responded to within two days, and all unkind behaviour must be addressed.
Schools will need a triage system that categorises bullying incidents into low, medium or high risk based on factors such as physical harm, emotional impact and recurrence. Each triggers a specific response, from counselling to external referrals.
The government-issued advice to public, private and Catholic schools is designed to help schools align their policies with an anti-bullying framework, with which every school must comply by 2027 or risk deregistration.
The new rules follow a 2024 directive from Education Minister Prue Car to the state’s school regulator to work with the education department, Catholic, and independent schools to develop an evidence-based, best-practice model to combat bullying.
A study of more than 20 countries found Australian students were among the most exposed to bullying, with nearly one in five saying others had made fun of them, and one in 10 saying they had been deliberately excluded.
The guidelines call for schools to use a range of techniques, including anonymously surveying students about their experiences, inviting children to help design anti-bullying campaigns, and classroom behaviour rules.
Teachers have been told to refrain from using labels such as “bully” or “victim” when dealing with incidents, and to teach students who bully others alternative ways to express emotions, resolve conflict and build relationships.
Teachers should “use guided discussions to help students who bully others to understand the impact of their actions and commit to change”, the guidelines say.
They recommend selecting students to become “cyber safety ambassadors” to promote respectful online behaviour, and they also suggest that teachers encourage students to “create videos, podcasts or social media content that showcase positive digital behaviour and promote anti-bullying messages”.
Students will be taught to support their classmates and alert staff when someone seems distressed or isolated; acts of kindness are to be publicly celebrated.
Teachers should be trained to explicitly teach skills such as empathy, emotional regulation, conflict resolution and responsible decision-making. They should also receive data analysis training to “interpret bullying data, recognise trends and understand how to respond strategically”.
The guidelines call for schools to develop personalised safety plans for victims, including additional supervision, safe zones and trusted adult contacts to ensure the children feel secure during and after school hours.
The framework is underpinned by research conducted by NSW behavioural expert Professor Donna Cross, who found “zero tolerance” policies that involve suspension and expulsion to be ineffective and potentially harmful.
Her research has also found that NSW public students who reported being bullied in the year before NAPLAN lost up to eight months of learning in literacy and numeracy.
“A zero tolerance policy as a blanket policy shows no care for children who engage in bullying,” she said. “If we don’t respond and teach them in a learning environment, which is what schools are, how to behave different, the evidence demonstrates that behaviour will continue.
“It will continue to the workforce, it will continue in their families. Those children as parents will have children who bully.”
Instead, Cross said that schools should work to rehabilitate bullies, offering them counselling and support to address the underlying motivation for their behaviour. Suspension and expulsion should be used only as a last resort.
“What the new guideline is doing is really helping the schools to be more bespoke and tailored in the way that they address bullying,” Cross said. “The anti‑bullying guidelines are really guardrails to say: here are the things that will make the most difference.”
At Lake Macquarie’s Heritage College, every day begins with a short assembly on a weekly virtue and college principal Simon Dodson says that teaching students how to be a good human must be a school’s primary objective.
“We put character education in the first order of importance,” Dodson said. “Not everyone’s going to succeed academically ... but everyone needs to become a good person.”
Dodson draws a line between bad behaviour – a one-off insult or cruel comment, which still requires correction – and bullying, which is a repeated abuse of power. “Bullying can be eradicated … if everyone has a place and everyone’s valued and belongs,” he said.
Hurstville Public School – which meets the new mandatory criteria – has invested in a wellbeing hub and sensory play space. There are three part-time youth workers who attend the school each day, acting as an on-call support worker.
Support worker Eman Roumieh said prevention has made the biggest difference. “We’ve never reached suspension, which is fantastic to hear, but because of the whole preventative work that we do.”

Denmark, Greenland prime ministers meet US secretary of state in Munich
Danish prime minister describes 'constructive' meeting with Rubio, says they will continue as agreed in high-level working group
ANKARA
Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen and Greenlandic Prime Minister Jens Frederik Nielsen met Friday with US Secretary of State Marco Rubio on the sidelines of the Munich Security Conference in Germany.
Copenhagen said Frederiksen and Nielsen held talks with Rubio as part of the annual gathering in Munich.
“Constructive talk with Secretary of State Marco Rubio together with Jens-Frederik Nielsen, Chairman of Naalakkersuisut, at the Munich Security Conference. Work will continue as agreed in the high-level working group,” Frederiksen wrote on the US social media company X.
The talks follow a Jan. 14 meeting in Washington between Danish Foreign Minister Lars Lokke Rasmussen, Greenland’s Foreign Minister Vivian Motzfeldt, US Vice President JD Vance, and Rubio.
During that meeting, officials discussed US President Donald Trump’s interest in Greenland because of its strategic Arctic location, rich mineral resources and concerns about increasing Russian and Chinese influence in the region.
Denmark and Greenland have rejected proposals to sell the territory, reaffirming Danish sovereignty over the island.
Critics said Trump’s drive to acquire Greenland threatens to tear apart NATO, which would be a boon for Russian and Chinese strategic interests. They added that the US could easily defend Greenland from outside threats by using existing treaties allowing numerous US bases and forces on the island.

Medals distributed in 6 disciplines on day 7 of 2026 Winter Olympics
Athletes medal in cross-country skiing, biathlon, speed skating, snowboard, skeleton, figure skating
ISTANBUL
Medals were claimed Friday in six disciplines at the 2026 Milano-Cortina Winter Olympics.
On the seventh day of the Games in Italy, seven medal events took place -- biathlon, cross-country skiing, figure skating, skeleton, snowboard and speed skating.
Norwegian Johannes Hoesflot Klaebo left his rivals behind in the men’s 10-kilometer freestyle cross-country race in a time of 20 minutes, 36.2 seconds, winning his third medal at the Games and his eighth Olympic gold.
Klaebo tied the record for the most Winter Olympic golds held by Norwegian skiers Marit Bjorgen, Ole Einar Bjorndalen and Bjorn Daehlie.
French athlete Mathis Desloges won silver and Norwegian Einar Hedegart took bronze.
In the men’s 10-kilometer sprint biathlon, gold went to Frenchman Quentin Fillon-Maillet. Norwegian athletes completed the podium, with Vetle Sjaastad Christiansen taking silver and Sturla Holm Laegreid winning bronze.
In the men’s 10,000 meters speed skating, Czech skater Metodej Jilek won gold. Polish athlete Vladimir Semirunniy earned silver, while Dutchman Jorrit Bergsma took bronze.
In women’s snowboard cross, Australian Josie Baff claimed her first Olympic title by finishing ahead of her rivals in the final. Czech Eva Adamczykova won silver and Italian Michela Moioli took bronze.
In the men’s snowboard halfpipe, Japan’s Yuto Totsuka scored 95 points to win gold. Australian Scotty James earned silver and fellow Japanese Ryusei Yamada took bronze.
Great Britain’s Matt Weston captured gold in the men’s skeleton. German athletes completed the podium, with Axel Jungk winning silver and Beijing 2022 champion Christopher Grotheer taking bronze.

Milan Cortina’s wide footprint reshapes the Olympic experience
The Milan Cortina Winter Olympics stretch across northern Italy, and the long travel times are reshaping the experience for athletes and fans
- Bookmark
The head of Haiti's ski federation, Thierry Montiller, spent over four hours driving mountain roads from Bormio, near the Swiss border, where his downhill skier is competing in the Milan Cortina Winter Olympics, to Tesero in Val di Fiemme for his cross-country skier’s 10-kilometer race on Friday.
And he's headed back to Bormio on Saturday, another 220 kilometers (140 miles), for the giant slalom race.
“Yes, it is a major difficulty to have such distances,’’ he said.
Winter Olympics have often had city and mountain clusters, but these Games spread the mountain clusters over a much wider area, and the distance to the city is considerably farther. In total, competitions are taking place in a 22,000 square kilometer (8,500 square mile) swath of northern Italy, making this the most spread-out in Winter Games history.
Reviews so far are mixed and, at very least, this model will take some getting used to. There are advantages: avoiding massive public investment in venues that get little use after the Games; easier access for locals; and distributing tourists' dollars across the region. Still, after the first week, it seems that not everyone is a fan.
Bob Grover came from Portland, Oregon, to stay in Cortina for two weeks. He remembers going to the 2010 Games, where all the Alpine events were in Whistler and ice events in Vancouver — less than two hours apart. Not so in the Alps, where downhill sports are at different locations.
"It’s like, why isn’t it all in Cortina?" said Grover, 64, who owns a landscaping business. “Maybe they split it up so more of Italy could get the benefit. I understand the economic impact of that, so I won’t complain. But I’d like to go to more events.”
His wife, Theresa Kirsch, 63, lamented that the tradition of male downhill skiers cheering on their female teammates, and vice versa, in these Games would entail an 8-hour round-trip drive.
U.S. snowboarder Red Gerard had 11 days between his first two days of Olympic competition and was eager for a change of scenery. His sister arranged a celebratory meal with a Michelin-starred chef for 55 people in his extended family and guests, but it meant driving 3 1/2 hours to Milan, where they spent a couple of days, before returning to Livigno “to put his game face on.”
“Sometimes, I wish I was in Milan,’’ said Gerard. “It’s just a little harder to get the full Olympic experience. … It just takes a little more work.’’
A chance to embrace the open road
The Olympic universe better get used to this model, because that’s the way it will be going forward.
The 2030 Winter Games will hold snow events in the Alps, the closing ceremony in Nice and speed-skating abroad. The 2034 Games will be in Utah, as opposed to Salt Lake City in 2002, when the medals plaza was held in the state capital each evening. The 2038 Winter Games will span the entire nation of Switzerland, without city anchors.
For some fans, the dispersion of venues has proven an opportunity to get on the road and see off-the-beaten-path locations in a country where, in many places, overtourism has become a problem. That's especially true if money or time (or both) are of little concern.
Tyler Thostenson, 36, and his mother expect to spend up to $20,000 for their 12-day itinerary from Milan to Livigno, stopping for lunch in St. Moritz, Switzerland, before winding their way to Cortina for curling. Next stop: Milan, for speed skating and U.S. men’s hockey.
This is their fourth Olympics. While the 2014 Sochi Games and 2018 PyeongChang Olympics provided single mountain clusters, they have embraced the Milan Cortina adventure.
“We’re lucky that we have a rental car, so we can actually stop in some of the smaller villages, and not just look out of a frosted-up bus window or train. It’s been nice to explore more of the countryside,’’ Thostenson said.
International Olympic Committee President Kirsty Coventry praised the model on Friday, after spending two days in Cortina d’Ampezzo, where she saw Italian standout Federica Brignone win a gold medal in the super-G.
“Yes, it’s a little spread out, but the feeling of the Games is for me very magical,’’ Coventry told reporters in Milan. She acknowledged that the 400-kilometer (250-mile) drive to the Dolomites “wasn’t the most comfortable, right? But it was fun."
An Olympic heart
Unlike in other games, there isn't a geographic emotional center to the 2026 Winter Games in either Cortina and Milan, since both serve as anchors to five other venues.
In Milan, where venues are spread along the city’s outskirts and suburbs, the Leonardo da Vinci-inspired Olympic cauldron is the closest thing to a heart for the 2026 Games. It has become a gathering place for sporting fans and curiosity-seeking locals alike; they gather each night not to see sports, but rather a sound-and-light show against the backdrop of a Napoleonic arch.
But there's been an unexpected benefit: in past Olympic Games, that center has been the plaza where medals were distributed at the end of the day. Since the distances make bringing everyone together impossible, instead, spectators have been granted instant emotional payoff: medal ceremonies immediately after each event.
Kathy McCabe saw the U.S. figure skating team receive its gold medals on Sunday after a thrilling competition at the Assago skating arena. At the 2006 Games, she saw Shaun White win gold in the halfpipe, but not the medal draped over his chest.
“There was a lot more emotion to see the medal ceremony just a few minutes after the Americans won, and to see that raw emotion,’’ said McCabe, producer of the PBS series Dream of Italy. “It was really close and there were some beautiful performances.”
That snow events are held in several mountain towns means athletes, including South African cross-country skier Matt Smith, are removed from the Olympic glitz and happy to have that peace. He appreciates the intimacy in the 1,000-person village of Predazzo.
“I have gained a pukka Olympic experience, and I’m very grateful for it,’’ said Smith, using British slang for “amazing.”

MOSCOW, February 14. /TASS/. Trade between BRICS member states is growing at a significantly higher rate than the overall pace of global trade, Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergey Ryabkov told TASS in an interview.
"Statistics show that trade growth among BRICS countries significantly exceeds both the overall growth rate of global trade and the trade growth between BRICS members and other partners," the diplomat noted.
According to Ryabkov, "this is simply an indication that BRICS - without being some kind of ‘magic wand’ - can truly help address challenges." "We need to expand this potential, and there is the political will to do so," he added.

Could BNP’s landslide win open a new geopolitical chapter for Bangladesh?
Tarique Rahman’s decisive victory may redraw regional alignments after years of pro-India policy under ousted PM Hasina.
Islamabad, Pakistan – The Bangladesh Nationalist Party’s (BNP) commanding victory in Bangladesh’s parliamentary election marks not only a political watershed for the South Asian nation, but also a potential recalibration of regional power dynamics across India, Pakistan and China.
The Election Commission has published the gazette of the members of parliament elected, a final official seal on the election process on Saturday.

Initial results published on Friday by the Election Commission gave the BNP and its allies at least 212 out of 299 parliamentary seats, while the opposition Jamaat-e-Islami and its allies won 77 seats.
Tarique Rahman’s party has delivered what observers described as Bangladesh’s first genuinely competitive election in nearly two decades.
The country marked a decisive break from the Sheikh Hasina era and signalled the beginning of what analysts call a “paradigm shift” in Dhaka’s foreign policy orientation.
Soon after the results were announced, the prime ministers of both India and Pakistan congratulated 60-year-old Rahman for a decisive win.
Delwar Hossain, professor of international relations at the University of Dhaka, described the election outcome as “a new turning point in crafting bilateral relations with India and Pakistan”.
“The new government may bring about a policy framework with clarity of purpose and effective implementation strategies,” Hossain told Al Jazeera. “The continuing India-Pakistan hostility and China-India rivalry may remain critical determinants of Bangladesh’s foreign policy moves in its neighbourhood.”
Will India ties be reset?
Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi posted his congratulations to Rahman on X on Friday, following it up with a phone call hours later.
“India will continue to stand in support of a democratic, progressive and inclusive Bangladesh,” Modi wrote, adding that Rahman’s win “shows the trust of the people of Bangladesh in your leadership.”
In another post, Modi said he spoke with Rahman over the phone to convey his wishes.
“As two close neighbours with deep-rooted historical and cultural ties, I reaffirmed India’s continued commitment to the peace, progress, and prosperity of both our peoples,” he said.
New Delhi had cultivated close ties with Hasina’s government, viewing Bangladesh as a crucial partner as regional powers India and China competed for influence in South Asia.
But since a mass uprising in 2024 toppled Hasina’s authoritarian government and forced her into exile in India, relations between New Delhi and Dhaka plunged to historic lows, marked by recriminations, trade restrictions and India’s refusal to extradite Hasina despite a death sentence handed down by Bangladesh’s International Crimes Tribunal over her handling of the deadly 2024 protests.
Yet, India began adjusting to a new political reality in post-Hasina Bangladesh. Earlier this year, Indian Foreign Minister S Jaishankar attended the funeral of former Prime Minister Khaleda Zia, whose son Rahman is set to be the next Bangladeshi prime minister.
“India has experience dealing with BNP-led political regimes in the past,” Hossain said. “India has demonstrated its eagerness to work with the future BNP government. Now that the elections are over, that has become a reality.”
Asif Bin Ali, a geopolitical analyst at Georgia State University, said an elected government in Bangladesh would have “strong incentives to move back to a working relationship with India, even if it cannot and should not reproduce the level of political closeness seen under Sheikh Hasina”.
“I expect a more cautious middle position that stresses mutual respect, reciprocal sovereignty and noninterference in each other’s domestic politics, while keeping space for Dhaka’s own strategic autonomy,” Ali told Al Jazeera.
Still, major irritants persist besides Hasina – the unresolved water sharing disputes over rivers such as Teesta, deadly border shootings by Indian forces and a large trade deficit in India’s favour.
The new government will also face pressure at home to adopt a firmer tone towards New Delhi, particularly amid anti-India sentiment among a large section of Bangladeshi youth, who allege “excessive Indian interference” in the country’s internal affairs.
Saleh Shahriar of North South University in Dhaka questioned how far the BNP would go in its dealings with India. “Tarique Rahman’s BNP is different from Khaleda Zia’s BNP,” he said.
The Pakistan pivot
Where India confronts uncertainty, Pakistan has seen an opportunity.
Under Bangladesh’s interim administration led by Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus, Bangladesh and Pakistan resumed direct flights, exchanged high-level civilian and military visits, and eased visa procedures, among various other confidence-building steps.
Analysts say that momentum could gather pace under a BNP government.
Former Pakistani foreign secretary and diplomat Salman Bashir told Al Jazeera the Bangladesh election “marks the end of Awami League’s long dalliance” with India and “a reopening of close relations” with Pakistan.
“Bangladesh does not have to balance its relations with India and Pakistan,” Bashir said. “Ties with Pakistan have improved. Pakistan should persist with its present policy of giving priority to its relations with Dhaka.”
Last month, the Pakistani military announced that it was in conversation with its Bangladeshi counterparts to sell them Pakistan-manufactured JF-17 fighter jets.
Bashir said there is a possibility that Bangladesh, Pakistan and China may come closer in defence matters.
“It should be possible for Bangladesh to lead a more independent policy towards Pakistan and the Middle East. Ties with China would be strengthened. In short, it means a reversal of India’s dominant posture in the region,” he said.
Other analysts, however, urge caution. “Bangladesh’s economic interests and geography ensure India remains its primary neighbour,” said Ali, the analyst at Georgia State University.
Praveen Donthi of the International Crisis Group thinks Dhaka will try to balance relations with both Beijing and New Delhi, with possible outreach to Islamabad as well. He said India pursues a pragmatic approach to its strategic and foreign policy, “though it may sometimes take time to reorient itself”.
Shahab Enam Khan, executive director of the Bangladesh Center for Indo-Pacific Affairs, said the BNP will pursue a “more transactional approach” towards both Islamabad and Delhi.
“Pakistan, as a natural regional neighbour, will benefit from more transparent and structured cooperation,” he said.
New chapter with China?
Perhaps the most consequential relationship for the incoming Bangladesh government will be with China.
Beijing maintained strong ties with Hasina, while also cultivating links across Bangladesh’s political spectrum, positioning itself regardless of the domestic political dynamics.
Under Hasina’s long rule, China expanded its economic footprint through its Belt and Road Initiative, deepening infrastructure investments and military cooperation with Dhaka.
The interim government that succeeded Hasina also secured about $2.1bn in Chinese investments, loans and grants, alongside high-level visits to Beijing, including by Yunus.
On Friday, the Chinese embassy congratulated the BNP on its victory, expressing readiness to work with the new government on “writing new chapters of China-Bangladesh relations”.
Hossain, professor of international relations at the University of Dhaka, said the BNP would likely “further deepen its relations with China, hearkening back to the past experience of friendly ties” under the previous governments led by the party.
At the same time, he noted, Bangladesh will face a “growing American opposition to China’s increased presence” in the region.
Ali of the Georgia State University argued that Dhaka’s most viable path would be to “keep Chinese investment and connectivity projects where they serve Bangladesh’s interests, while making foreign policy more predictable and rules-based” in relation to China, India and the US.
“If Dhaka can be transparent about its red lines and priorities and keep the China file focused on economics rather than security symbolism, it will have a better chance of avoiding being dragged into major power rivalries while protecting its own strategic space,” he said.
Dhaka’s delicate balancing act
As Rahman prepares to assume office, he faces what Shahriar, professor at North South University in Dhaka, describes as a “great power competition in the Bay of Bengal region”.
The BNP manifesto emphasised a “Bangladesh First” policy, which called for all international relations and engagements to prioritise national sovereignty, security and the welfare of the people.
“The reality is, as a sovereign country, Bangladesh needs to develop its relations with all the countries, including China, Pakistan, Myanmar. This will be a great challenge for the upcoming government,” he said.
Khan from the Bangladesh Center for Indo-Pacific Affairs said the new administration must ground its diplomacy in “pragmatism rather than rhetoric”.
Donthi of the International Crisis Group said the Bangladesh verdict gives the South Asian region a chance to recalibrate, as it is no longer a region that can be counted as the “back yard of one or the other”. Foreign policy, he said, tends to evolve gradually rather than shift abruptly.
“There are likely to be small, incremental shifts towards regional balancing between India and China, as already observed during Sheikh Hasina’s leadership. Dhaka will also aim to build a more active relationship with the US and, however minimally, normalise relations with Islamabad,” he said.

India vs Pakistan: T20 World Cup – teams, start time, lineups
The cricket world and beyond will be watching as one of sport’s greatest rivalry goes ahead despite political turmoil.
Who: India vs Pakistan
What: ICC 2026 T20 World Cup
Where: R Premadasa Stadium, Colombo, Sri Lanka
When: Sunday, February 15 at 7pm (13:30 GMT)
How to follow: We’ll have all the buildup on Al Jazeera Sport from 9:30 GMT in advance of our text commentary stream.
One of the world’s most watched sporting events will take to the screens of viewers all around the globe on Sunday, but only after last-minute talks reversed Pakistan’s decision to boycott their T20 World Cup match against neighbours and rivals, India.

Following Bangladesh’s expulsion from the tournament for refusing to play their games in India, the Pakistan government stepped in to stop the group stage match from going ahead in a show of solidarity with the Bangladeshi team.
After talks with the game’s governing body – the International Cricket Council (ICC) – Bangladesh and tournament co-hosts Sri Lanka, Pakistan reversed their decision.
Al Jazeera Sport takes a look at the game, now that matters return to the on-field rivalry – although handshakes and gestures will be under the spotlight once more.
What happened the last time India played Pakistan?
Sunday’s group-stage game is a repeat of the 2025 Asian Cup final, which India won by five wickets.
The game, much like the team’s earlier meeting in the tournament, was overshadowed by the lack of handshakes between the sides and India’s refusal to accept the trophy, which was to be presented to them by Asian Cricket Council (ACC) Chairman Mohsin Naqvi, who was also chair of Pakistan’s cricket board and the country’s interior minister.
Why are Pakistan allowed to play in Sri Lanka instead of India, but not Bangladesh?
Both India and Pakistan reached an agreement in 2024 that matches between the sides would be played at neutral venues, even if either were hosting a tournament.
Bangladesh’s late refusal ahead of its tournament to play matches in India over security concerns was not something that had been agreed to or sanctioned by the ICC.
One Pakistan player’s life was changed by an Indian cricketer
Pakistan’s Usman Tariq left his cricket ambitions back home to start a salesman’s job in Dubai, before a biopic about India great Mahendra Singh Dhoni changed his life.
The unusual bowling action of the double-jointed spinner has created plenty of chatter in his first T20 World Cup, and now he goes into Sunday’s revived clash against India as one of Pakistan’s main weapons.
His inspiration was born in India, and Tariq admits if he had not watched the 2016 Bollywood movie, M.S. Dhoni: The Untold Story, he might not be playing cricket today.
Based on the life of India’s World Cup-winning captain, the movie told a tale of grit, rejection and eventual glory – and made Tariq believe it was never too late to chase his ambition.
“I had left behind thinking of making a name in cricket, but one day I watched this film, and it convinced me that I can also do the same,” Tariq said.
Tariq, now 30, left Dubai and roamed around the world to mature as a mystery spinner.
Pakistan skipper Salman Agha insisted Tariq will be a special weapon when his side face their archrivals, after being cleared to play following an Islamabad government U-turn that reversed an earlier order to boycott the India match.
“Tariq is our X-factor and a key weapon,” Agha said ahead of the tournament after Pakistan had used him sparingly to protect his unique action.
Since making his international debut just three months ago, Tariq has taken 11 wickets in four T20 internationals, including a hat-trick against Zimbabwe in Rawalpindi.
He grabbed a match-defining 3-27 against the USA in Colombo on his World Cup debut this week.
Why is Tariq’s bowling action controversial?
The 28-year-old’s bizarre bowling action was reported as illegal twice in the last two years, but was cleared by the ICC’s laboratory.
His action carries an element of mystery as he pauses exaggeratedly before releasing the ball in a slingshot manner.
England’s Tom Banton questioned Tariq’s action in the United Arab Emirates T20 League last year.
Australia all-rounder Cameron Green mimicked Tariq’s round-arm during the T20 series before the World Cup in Lahore, raising renewed doubts.
But India player Ravichandran Ashwin, himself a great spinner, and umpire Anil Chaudhary declared Tariq’s bowling action to be within the rules.
“I believe that it is entirely legal,” Ashwin wrote on X, explaining several factors of the action.
Tariq is unperturbed by the doubters.
“I have two corners of my bowling arm elbow, which is rare,” Tariq said. “I have been cleared twice, so I am confident that it’s legal.
“I have struggled this far and am not worried about such baseless questions.”
Tariq’s progress has come in leaps and bounds. He finished with 20 wickets in the Caribbean Premier League last year, forcing his way into the Pakistan team.
“My coach informed me about my selection in the Pakistan team while I was busy with my wedding last year, and initially I thought it was a prank,” said Tariq.
“But it was true, so I think my wife brought luck for me.”
From a salesman in Dubai to Pakistan’s potential trump card against India, Tariq’s script is still being written.
Colombo boosted by India and Pakistan tourism windfall
Prices of flights and hotel bookings to Colombo, Sri Lanka, have soared as thousands of fans flock to the city to watch India play Pakistan.
The game at Sri Lanka’s largest stadium is sold out with roughly 35,000 tickets sold, and ahead of the match, most hotels in Colombo have doubled their prices – the cost of a room has climbed as high as $660 a night from a typical price tag of about $100-$150 per night, multiple booking sites showed.
After the match was finalised this week, last-minute bookings led to fuller flights from major cities like Chennai and Delhi, according to three Colombo travel agencies.
Flights from Chennai, which is about one and a half hours away, have more than tripled to about $623-$756, while flights from Delhi are up more than 50 percent to roughly $666.
Nalin Jayasundera, president of Sri Lanka Inbound Tour Operators (SLAITO) said hotels were booked out. “Most fans are coming on all-inclusive packages that could be $1,500-$2000 or even higher depending on ticket, hotel, and flight prices,” Jayasundera said.
Tourism is the third largest foreign exchange earner for Sri Lanka, famous for its ancient temples, pristine beaches and lush tea plantations.
It is hoped that hosting more sporting events could boost Sri Lanka’s economic growth, which is recovering from a severe financial crisis and a recent cyclone, which killed 650 people.
Buddhika Hewawasam, chairman of the Sri Lanka Tourism Development Authority, told the Reuters news agency that in the first 10 days of February, roughly 20 percent of the 100,000 visitors to Sri Lanka were there for the India-Pakistan cricket match.
The island nation is hoping to position itself as a neutral venue for matches between political rivals.
“This is clearly showing confidence in Sri Lanka as a neutral cricket venue. Whether it’s India, Pakistan or Bangladesh, this is a welcome message to all South Asian countries that they can play cricket in Sri Lanka,” he said.
Lahore local Mian Sultan is looking forward to his trip to Sri Lanka to watch the game.
“I think it’s going to be a great experience,” said Sultan, who spent $800 on a front-row seat to watch the game alongside a friend who is flying in from New Zealand. “I’m really excited about this match.”
Sultan added he thought Pakistan “absolutely” could come out on top on Sunday.

Law enforcement officers identify and formally charge Russian serviceman who killed unarmed AFU member in Sumy region
According to Ukrinform, the Prosecutor General's Office stated this on Facebook.
On February 24, 2022, units of the 1st Tank Army of the Russian Armed Forces illegally crossed the border and entered the Sumy region.
Ukrainian forces struck enemy equipment, after which about 15 Russian invaders fled into a forested area near Okhtyrka.
During the pursuit, a Ukrainian serviceman, a rifle company commander, was ambushed and taken prisoner. He laid down his arms and did not resist. Despite this, a Russian soldier shot the unarmed captive three times with a VSS sniper rifle. The serviceman died at the scene. It has been established that the shots were fired by a captain, the deputy commander of the 1st Special Purpose Company of the reconnaissance battalion of the 96th Separate Reconnaissance Brigade of the Russian Federation.
The Sumy Regional Prosecutor's Office has notified the suspect in absentia of charges under Part 1 of Article 28 and Part 2 of Article 438 of the Criminal Code of Ukraine (violation of the laws and customs of war combined with intentional murder committed by a group of persons).
Investigators are identifying accomplices, and a decision is being made to place the suspect on the wanted list.
As Ukrinform previously reported, law enforcement officers have identified and notified 211 individuals of suspicion for atrocities committed in Bucha and the Bucha district during the temporary occupation of the Kyiv region in 2022.

Valentine's Day at the Winter Olympics might look a little different, but it's still special
At the Milan Cortina Games, winning medals isn’t the only thing making hearts swell
- Bookmark
At the Milan Cortina Olympic Games, winning medals isn’t the only thing making hearts swell. From the ice rinks to the snowy hills, love is in the frozen air.
Some competitions already seem to have Cupid in attendance.
Dutch skater Jutta Leerdam set an Olympic record in the 1000-meter race, then turned to find her fiancé Jake Paul in the stands; both visibly weeping, they made heart signs to one another with their hands. And downhill skiing champion Breezy Johnson ’s longtime boyfriend proposed to her near the finish line Thursday while surrounded by members of the U.S. Ski Team.
Valentine's Day for athletes and attendees at the Games doesn't usually mean grand gestures, but it's no less special.
Competing on Valentine's Day
Valentine’s Day is the finals for the women’s skeleton event. That means that Kim Meylemans of Belgium and Nicole Rocha Silveira of Brazil — an international couple who play for their separate national teams — will be too busy for a romantic dinner. They told The Associated Press they didn’t even bring gifts to exchange.
But since they are together all the time, “It’s always a bit of a Valentine's Day," Meylemans said. “It is part of our sport every day, our love.”
The two feel fortunate their national Olympic committees arranged for them to bunk together at Cortina's Olympic village, since typically only teammates share housing. Half their room is decorated for Belgium, the other half Brazil.
Rocha Silveira was new to the sport in 2019 when Meylemans was already competing in World Cup races. They fell in love during the pandemic while sharing short-term rentals, since many hotels closed.
Fast forward to 2024, and they unknowingly bought identical engagement rings and planned proposals for the same boat trip in Brazil while on vacation. They married last August.
When they compete, they high-five and kiss before each run, wishing the other well.
“It doesn’t matter which one is on the podium. At the end of the day, it’s a victory for our team," Meylemans said.
Rocha Silveira said it’s important their relationship appears during these Games in Italy, where same-sex marriages aren't recognized and only married heterosexual couples are allowed to jointly adopt.
It’s a great place to “show it even more,” and “encourage and inspire people that they can be themselves,” she said.
Volunteer valentines
Lori and Curtis Brown have been married for over 30 years and will be spend Valentine's Day at the skating arena where they are volunteering for this year’s Winter Olympics.
About 18,000 volunteers are spread across the venues in northern Italy — a sea of navy blue uniforms keeping the Olympics running around the clock, with duties such as giving directions, accompanying athletes to venues, crowd control and medical support.
Curtis, 60, said neither of them had realized they were scheduled to work. Now, they're hoping they can coincide their breaks to have dinner together, perhaps surrounded by the rest of the volunteers, he joked.
“This is the most special Valentine’s Day of our lives,” Curtis said. “Because we’re both here, we’re both on the same page, we’re both enjoying this adventure together.”
While presents are neither’s love language, Lori, 61, told the AP she bought boxer briefs from the official Milan Cortina souvenir store. Curtis hadn’t bought anything for her.
“It’s not so much about gift giving, just going out and doing something together,” said Lori, 61. She spoke while sitting beside Curtis, so perhaps she’ll be surprised on Saturday.
Canadians facing off against Germany
Canadian hockey forward Laura Stacey and her wife, team captain Marie-Philip Poulin, have a different kind of date: playing Germany's team in the quarterfinals in Milan.
“We have a game, we have a big game, so spending it together. We’re pretty lucky,” Stacey said. “Most people don’t get to do what they love, chasing their dreams together, and we do. So I think on February 14th, I think it’s important for us to just appreciate that and not take it for granted."
Aside from taking on Germany, they don't have plans — but Stacey said they will surely at least give each other cards.
Other Olympian couples
Many other couples are at the Olympics, some teammates and others competing against each other.
— U.S. alpine skiing star Mikaela Shiffrin — that sport’s all-time wins leader — is engaged to Norway’s Aleksander Aamodt Kilde, who returned to racing this season after dealing with major injuries.
— Latvia’s luge team includes the husband-and-wife pair of Martins Bots and Elina Bota, both single sliders.
— Italy’s luge team Dominik Fischnaller and the U.S.'s Emily Sweeney married last year after dating for almost 15 years.
— U.S. bobsledding has a power couple with reigning women’s monobloc world champion Kaysha Love engaged to men’s push athlete Hunter Powell. She’s in the Olympics for the second time, while he's making his debut.
— American figure skaters Madison Chock and Evan Bates were married in 2024 and won a silver medal on Wednesday.
—Curling may have the most well-known couples of any sport. Norway’s Magnus Nedregotten and Kristin Skaslien have been together since 2008 and won bronze in Pyeongchang. Jocelyn Peterman and Brett Gallant of Canada married in 2022 and were favorites this year. There are Switzerland’s Yannick Schwaller and Briar Schwalller-Huerlimann, too; they brought their baby and photos of him carrying a curling broom twice his size went viral.
He looked like a curling Cupid.

UK’s Mandelson asked to cooperate in Epstein probe by US Congress
US lawmakers say Mandelson holds ‘critical information’ about Epstein’s operations and have requested his cooperation.
Former British ambassador to Washington Peter Mandelson has been asked to submit himself for an interview and answer questions as part of a United States congressional investigation into convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.
In a letter sent to Mandelson by Democratic Representatives Robert Garcia and Suhas Subramanyam, both members of the House Oversight Committee, the lawmakers say it is “clear” that the former ambassador “possessed extensive social and business ties” to Epstein and request that he make himself available for a transcribed interview.

“The Committee is seeking to uncover the identities of Mr Epstein’s co-conspirators and enablers and understand the full extent of his criminal operations,” the lawmakers said in their letter.
“While you no longer serve as British Ambassador to the United States and have stepped down from the House of Lords, it is clear that you possessed extensive social and business ties to Jeffrey Epstein and hold critical information pertaining to our investigation of Epstein’s operations,” they said.
“Numerous pieces of evidence have come to light demonstrating your close ties to Jeffrey Epstein over the span of multiple years,” they add.
While the House committee does not have the authority to compel Mandelson to testify, it said it was seeking his “cooperation” and expected his response “no later than February 27, 2026”.
Mandelson assumed the role of the United Kingdom’s ambassador in February 2025 but was removed in September after Prime Minister Keir Starmer’s government claimed further details had emerged about the depth of his ties to Epstein.
He has since resigned from Starmer’s Labour Party following intensified scrutiny and the House of Lords.
Mandelson’s links with Epstein have led to calls for Starmer to stand down as prime minister, with critics questioning his judgement in appointing Mandelson as US ambassador, which is considered the most prestigious posting in British diplomacy.
While Starmer appears to have survived for now, the controversy continues to reverberate within his inner circle.
Starmer’s cabinet secretary, Chris Wormald, resigned on Thursday – the third senior aide of the prime minister to quit in a matter of days due to the Epstein scandal.
Starmer’s chief of staff, Morgan McSweeney, a Labour Party stalwart, left on Sunday for advising Starmer to make the contentious Mandelson appointment, and so did communications director Tim Allan.
Mandelson has denied any criminal wrongdoing regarding his relationship with Epstein.

Colombia revives spraying of coca fields with drones amid renewed US cooperation

Colombia has resumed spraying drug fields with a toxic chemical using drones, the US embassy in Bogota has said, after a meeting between the two nations' leaders eased tensions.
"Colombia has launched drone eradication of coca crops" with support from the US government, Washington's mission in Bogota wrote on social media on Friday.
"This technology could be game-changing: lower coca cultivation, more security in Colombia, less deadly drugs reaching American streets, and more lives saved."
The South American nation in 2015 suspended the aerial spraying of glyphosate, which has been linked to cancer in humans, over concerns about its negative health impact.
US President Donald Trump and leftist counterpart Gustavo Petro met last week at the White House to smooth diplomatic tensions that had been building over the last year.
They pledged to resume historic military cooperation between Washington and Bogota, and to jointly combat guerrilla groups and drug cartels.
Growing pressure from US
Petro's government announced in December that it would resume the spraying of drug crops under growing pressure from the Trump administration, which is demanding a tougher anti-drug policy in Colombia.
The Colombian justice ministry presented the new drug crop eradication policy in December.
It said drones would fly 1.5 metres (5 feet) above coca fields and carry out "controlled" spraying to prevent the chemical from affecting communities.
Since taking office in 2022, Petro has followed a "total peace" policy to disband all armed groups through dialogue.
But six months before he leaves office, the efforts have yielded few results, forcing the president to shift towards a tougher war on drugs.

Controversy soon followed on Japanese social media over the use of the material related to war and displacement.
The two poets – Gaza-born Mosab Abu Toha and Palestinian American Zeina Azzam – welcomed the inclusion of their translated works in the exam, but also expressed concern about the ensuing controversy.
Nada Junior High School is a private all-boys school in Kobe whose graduates often go on to top universities in Japan. Every winter, hundreds of sixth grade students take the admissions test.
Abu Toha’s poem “What is Home?” – published in his 2022 book Things You May Find Hidden in My Ear – was used alongside Azzam’s “Write My Name” in the reading comprehension portion of the exam.

US homeland security department partially shutdown after lawmakers fail to agree funding

The Department of Homeland Security has begun a partial shutdown, after funding for the much-criticized agency expired, with a range of services, including domestic flights and the US Coastguard, now vulnerable to disruption.
The shutdown was all but confirmed on Thursday, after the Senate failed to clear the 60-vote threshold needed to pass the DHS appropriations bill and lawmakers left Washington for a long weekend without resolving the impasse.
Democrats say they won’t help approve more funding until new restrictions are placed on federal immigration operations after the fatal shooting of Alex Pretti and Renee Good in Minneapolis last month.
Democrats demanded radical reforms of how agents with Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and Customs and Border Protection (CBP) – which both fall under DHS’s remit – operate.
It is, however, unlikely the shutdown will affect ICE and CBP operations, which are deemed vital and already have extensive funding thanks to Donald Trump’s “big beautiful bill”, passed last summer.
Instead, disruption is likely to fall on services such as the Transportation Security Administration (TSA), the Secret Service and the Federal Emergency Management Agency (Fema).
TSA workers, who include airport security staff and baggage handlers, are expected to continue working over the weekend without pay, to minimize the travel disruption that marked last year’s 43-day government shutdown, the longest in US history. Many Fema workers are expected to be furloughed without pay, limiting its ability to work with local and state partners. Officials have warned that the funding lapse could impede the agency’s ability to respond to natural disasters.
Thursday’s Senate vote fell almost entirely along party lines in a 52-47 vote on the legislation, with John Fetterman of Pennsylvania being the sole Democratic exception in backing the bill. Democrats also blocked an attempt to temporarily extend funding for two weeks at current levels.
While agreeing to agents wearing body cameras, Republicans have resisted other proposals, including demands that agents obtain judicial warrants, signed by a judge, before entering private property.
Chuck Schumer, the Democrats’ leader in the Senate, accused the Republicans of choosing “chaos”.
“They need to negotiate in good faith, produce legislation that actually reins in ICE and stops the violence,” he said on Thursday.
Before Thursday’s vote, Tom Homan, the US border czar, announced that the administration was winding down “Operation Metro Surge” and that the number of ICE agents in Minnesota would return to normal levels. Homan recently took over leadership of the operation from Greg Bovino, a senior border patrol official who was in charge when federal agents killed Good and Pretti.
Although senators were reported to be on standby to return to vote if agreement is reached, a weekend resolution seemed unlikely, as several members have left the US to attend the Munich security conference in Germany.
Both the Senate and the House of Representatives – which passed the appropriations bill on 22 January and another short-term continuing resolution on 3 February to keep the DHS funded and avert a partial shutdown – are scheduled to be in recess for the next 10 days to coincide with President’s Day next Monday, making an extended shutdown likely.
The shutdown will be the second partial government shutdown this month. At the end of January, Congress failed to pass a package of five appropriations bills, triggering a four-day shutdown that ended when lawmakers agreed to fund every agency until the end of the fiscal year except DHS, which they extended for two weeks.

TSA agents are working without pay at US airports due to another shutdown
A shutdown of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security has gone into effect
- Bookmark
A shutdown of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security that took effect early Saturday impacts the agency responsible for screening passengers and bags at airports across the country. Travelers with airline reservations may be nervously recalling a 43-day government shutdown that led to historic flight cancellations and long delays last year.
Transportation Security Administration officers are expected to work without pay while lawmakers remain without an agreement on Homeland Security's annual funding. TSA officers also worked through the record shutdown that ended Nov. 12, but aviation experts say this one may play out differently.
Trade groups for the U.S. travel industry and major airlines nonetheless warned that the longer DHS appropriations are lapsed, the longer security lines at the nation's commercial airports could get.
Here’s what to know about the latest shutdown and how to plan ahead.
What's different about this shutdown?
Funding for Homeland Security expired at midnight. But the rest of the federal government is funded through Sept. 30. That means air traffic controllers employed by the Federal Aviation Administration will receive paychecks as usual, reducing the risk of widespread flight cancellations.
According to the department’s contingency plan, about 95% of TSA workers are deemed essential personnel and required to keep working. Democrats in the House and Senate say Homeland Security won’t get funded until new restrictions are placed on federal immigration operations.
During past shutdowns, disruptions to air travel tended to build over time, not overnight. About a month into last year’s shutdown, for example, TSA temporarily closed two checkpoints at Philadelphia International Airport. That same day, the government took the extraordinary step of ordering all commercial airlines to reduce their domestic flight schedules.
John Rose, chief risk officer for global travel management company Altour, said strains could surface at airports more quickly this time because the TSA workforce also will be remembering the last shutdown.
“It’s still fresh in their minds and potentially their pocketbooks,” Rose said.
What is the impact on travelers?
It’s hard to predict whether, when or where security screening snags might pop up. Even a handful of unscheduled TSA absences could quickly lead to longer wait times at smaller airports, for example, if there's just a single security checkpoint.
That’s why travelers should plan to arrive early and allow extra time to get through security.
“I tell people to do this even in good times,” Rose said.
Experts say flight delays also are a possibility even though air traffic controllers are not affected by the DHS shutdown.
Airlines might decide to delay departures in some cases to wait for passengers to clear screening, said Rich Davis, senior security advisor at risk mitigation company International SOS. Shortages of TSA officers also could slow the screening of checked luggage behind the scenes.
What travelers can do to prepare
Most airports display security line wait times on their websites, but don't wait until the day of a flight to check them, Rose advised.
“You may look online and it says two-and-a-half hours," he said. "Now it’s two-and-a-half hours before your flight and you haven't left for the airport yet.”
Passengers should also pay close attention while packing since prohibited items are likely to prolong the screening process. For carry-on bags, avoid bringing full-size shampoo or other liquids, large gels or aerosols and items like pocketknives in carry-on bags.
TSA has a full list on its website of what is and isn't allowed in carry-on and checked luggage.
At the airport, Rose said, remember to “practice patience and empathy."
“Not only are they not getting paid,” he said of TSA agents, “they’re probably working with reduced staff and dealing with angry travelers.”
Will the shutdown drag on?
The White House has been negotiating with Democratic lawmakers, but the two sides failed to reach a deal by the end of the week before senators and members of Congress were set to leave Washington for a 10-day break.
Lawmakers in both chambers were on notice, however, to return if a deal to end the shutdown is struck.
Democrats have said they won’t help approve more funding for Homeland Security until new restrictions are placed on federal immigration operations after the fatal shooting of Alex Pretti and Renee Good in Minneapolis last month.
In a joint statement, U.S. Travel, Airlines for America and the American Hotel & Lodging Association warned that the shutdown threatens to disrupt air travel as the busy spring break travel season approaches.
“Travelers and the U.S. economy cannot afford to have essential TSA personnel working without pay, which increases the risk of unscheduled absences and call outs, and ultimately can lead to higher wait times and missed or delayed flights,” the statement said.

Normalization of Russian-Japanese ties possible in near future

TOKYO, February 14. /TASS/. Normalization of relations between Russia and Japan is possible in the not-too-distant future if talks on Ukraine produce result and the process of lifting economic sanctions begins, a leading Japanese expert on Russia Taisuke Abiru has told TASS.
"There is no doubt that Prime Minister Takaichi fully understands the importance of Japan-Russia relations, as evidenced by the fact thatshe personally attended and delivered a speech at the National Convention Demanding the Return of the Northern Territories (Japanese name for Southern Kurils) held in Tokyo on February 7, the last day of her busy Lower House election campaign," said Abiru, a senior research fellow at the Sasakawa Peace Foundation and an author of numerous books on Russia, who also took part in several Valdai Discussion Forum meetings.
In his opinion, "two conditions must be in place for the Takaichi administration to turn its current policy toward Russia into a positive one."
"One is a strong domestic political base," the expert said, adding that this requirement has already been met "with the ruling Liberal Democratic Party's (LDP) sweeping victory in the recent Lower House election."
The second requirement is that peace and ceasefire talks on Ukraine, actively mediated by US President Donald Trump’s administration "must bear fruit and a trend toward lifting economic sanctions against Russia must be created." "The focus will therefore be on when the latter condition will be met," he added.
Current cooperation projects remain
"Until then, existing cooperation projects, mainly in the energy sector, such as the Sakhalin-2 LNG project, will be maintained," Abiru believes.
Japan receives almost 9-10% of all imported LNG, which is one of the key elements of the country’s energy balance, from Sakhalin-2.
"In addition, the two countries will gradually expand personnel exchanges in areas not subject to sanctions, such as the arts, culture, and academia," he said. "In this way, the groundwork should be steadily laid for the full-fledged normalization of Japan-Russia relations, which is expected to take place in the not-too-distant future."
At the same time, the expert noted that "the deterioration of Japan-China relations will also have some impact on the Takaichi administration's formulation of a new policy toward Russia."
Certain observers believe that closer ties with Russia will help Tokyo balance the cold spell in relations with Beijing to some extent.
After the start of Russia’s special military operation in Ukraine, Japan imposed several packages of sanctions against Moscow. In response, the Russian Foreign Ministry announced that it does not intend to continue consultations on the peace treaty, citing the impossibility of discussing such a fundamental document with a state that takes an openly unfriendly stance and seeks to harm Russia’s interests.
Besides, Moscow also withdrew from talks on joint business activities in Southern Kurils, and visits of former Japanese residents to these islands stopped. The Russian Foreign Ministry said on February 2 that the resumption of Moscow-Tokyo dialogue will be possible only after the Japanese government ceases its Russophobic policies. The Russian Foreign Ministry’s official spokeswoman, Maria Zakharova, told reporters on February 2 that because of Tokyo’s "clumsy steps", Russian-Japanese relations have been brought to a critical "point of no return."

Minneapolis left to decide future of streetside memorials to 2 people killed by federal officers
The Trump administration announced this week that its immigration crackdown in Minnesota is ending
- Bookmark
As the Trump administration’s immigration crackdown in Minnesota winds down, Minneapolis will need to decide how to manage makeshift memorial sites for two U.S. citizens killed by federal agents last month.
Piles of flowers, signs and artwork swiftly formed to commemorate the lives of Renee Good and Alex Pretti at the locations where they were fatally shot. The memorials are the site of candlelight vigils and musical performances and draw a regular stream of visitors.
The public grieving spots echo the community-driven memorial to George Floyd, who was murdered in 2020 by a police officer less than one mile (1.61 kilometers) from Good's killing. It took the city more than five years to figure out how to officially memorialize the site of George Floyd Square, and construction is set to begin this year.
Now, the city has two more high-profile memorials to manage.
A memorial for Good sprung up within hours of her Jan. 7 killing on a Minneapolis street.
And before the smell of tear gas used by federal agents had dissipated on the day of Pretti's killing on Jan. 24, Minneapolis protesters were already using branches, police tape and candles to mark the space. Later, people placed crosses, stuffed animals, American flags and images of Pretti.
Minnesota resident Karel Hoffmann said that while she remained outraged with Good and Pretti’s killings, the memorials represented community solidarity.
“This is so unfair, the trauma, for everyone, is too much,” Hoffmann said as she visited Pretti's memorial recently. “We’re all in this together. And I’m really glad they have this here so everybody can come and be together.”
Lynn Elrod, a nurse, visited Pretti’s memorial last month and added her own offering: a plastic evergreen tree with red hearts and portraits of him and Good.
“I printed both of their pictures and put those on there again, just to signify the love that we have for both of them, really, and their contributions to the community and supporting their neighbors,” Elrod said.
The residential street where Good died remains open, but orange traffic cones offer a narrow walkway for those paying their respects, and a small band of volunteers watches over the mound of flowers, artwork and handwritten signs that has amassed between the sidewalk and the street.
Around the Pretti memorial along a commercial district known as “ Eat Street,” traffic lanes have been temporarily shifted and parking is closed off, said Jess Olstad, a spokesperson for the city of Minneapolis.
“The City’s top priority is to give our community space to grieve and heal,” Olstad said. “This both ensures emergency vehicles can get through the area and protects those who gather or visit the memorial.”
Olstad added that the city is “actively working on next steps, including continued community engagement regarding both memorials.”
Ally Peters, a spokesperson for Mayor Jacob Frey, said last week that it was “too early” to comment on whether the memorials would be made permanent.

Widespread arrests roil Iran weeks after security forces crushed protests
A month after Iran launched a crackdown on nationwide protests, widespread arrests are roiling the country
- Bookmark
The Iranian security agents came at 2 a.m., pulling up in a half-dozen cars outside the home of the Nakhii family. They woke up the sleeping sisters, Nyusha and Mona, and forced them to give the passwords for their phones. Then they took the two away.
The women were accused of participating in the nationwide protests that shook Iran a week earlier, a friend of the pair told The Associated Press, speaking on condition of anonymity for her security as she described the Jan. 16 arrests.
Such arrests have been happening for weeks following the government crackdown last month that crushed the protests calling for the end of the country’s theocratic rule. Reports of raids on homes and workplaces have come from major cities and rural towns alike, revealing a dragnet that has touched large swaths of Iranian society. University students, doctors, lawyers, teachers, actors, business owners, athletes and filmmakers have been swept up, as well as reformist figures close to President Masoud Pezeshkian.
They are often held incommunicado for days or weeks and prevented from contacting family members or lawyers, according to activists monitoring the arrests. That has left desperate relatives searching for their loved ones.
The U.S.-based Human Rights Activists News Agency has put the number of arrests at more than 50,000. The AP has been unable to verify the figure. Tracking the detainees has been difficult since Iranian authorities imposed an internet blackout, and reports leak out only with difficulty.
Other activist groups outside Iran have also been working to document the sweeps.
“Authorities continue to identify people and detain them,” said Shiva Nazarahari, an organizer with one of those groups, the Committee for Monitoring the Status of Detained Protesters.
So far, the committee has verified the names of more than 2,200 people who were arrested, using direct reports from families and a network of contacts on the ground. The arrestees include 107 university students, 82 children as young as 13, as well as 19 lawyers and 106 doctors.
Nazarahari said authorities have been reviewing municipal street cameras, store surveillance cameras and drone footage to track people who participated in the protests to their homes or places of work, where they are arrested.
Held for weeks with no contact
The protests began in late December, triggered by anger over spiraling prices, and quickly spread across the country. They peaked on Jan. 8 and 9, when hundreds of thousands of people in more than 190 cities and towns across the country took to the streets.
Security forces responded by unleashing unprecedented violence. The Human Rights Activists News Agency has so far counted more than 7,000 dead and says the true number is far higher. Iran’s government offered its only death toll on Jan. 21, saying 3,117 people were killed. The theocracy has undercounted or not reported fatalities from past unrest.
Gholamhossein Mohseni Ejehi, a hard-line cleric who heads Iran’s judiciary, became the face of the crackdown, labeling protesters “terrorists” and calling for fast-tracked punishments.
Since then, “detentions have been very widespread because it’s like a whole suffocation of society,” said one protester, reached by the AP in Gohardasht, a middle-class area outside the Iranian capital. He said two of his relatives and three of his brother’s friends were killed in the first days of the crackdown, as well as several neighbors. The protester spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of being targeted by authorities.
The Nakhii sisters, 37-year-old Nyusha and 25-year-old Mona, were first taken to Tehran’s notorious Evin prison, where they were allowed to contact their parents, their friend said. Later, she said, they were moved to Qarchak, a women’s prison on the outskirts of Tehran where rights groups reported conditions that included overcrowding and lack of hygiene even before the crackdown.
Other people whose arrests were documented by the detainees committee have disappeared into the prisons. The family of Abolfazl Jazbi has not heard from him since his Jan. 15 arrest at a factory in the southern city of Isfahan. Jazbi suffers from a severe blood disorder that requires medication, according to the committee.
Atila Sultanpour, 45, has not been heard from since he was taken from his home in Tehran on Jan. 29 by security agents who beat him severely, according to Dadban, a group of Iranian lawyers based abroad who are also documenting detentions.
Authorities have also moved to suspend bank accounts, block SIM cards and confiscate the property of protesters' relatives or people who publicly express support for them, said Musa Barzin, an attorney with Dadban, citing reports from families.
In past crackdowns on protests, authorities sometimes adhered to a veneer of due process and rule of law, but not this time, Barzin said. Authorities are increasingly denying detainees access to legal counsel and often holding them for days or weeks before allowing any phone calls to family. Lawyers representing arrested protesters also have faced court summons and detention, according to Dadban.
“The following of the law is in the worst situation it has ever been,” Barzin said.
Signs of defiance continue
Despite the crackdown, many civic groups continue to issue defiant statements.
The Writers’ Association of Iran, an independent group with a long tradition of dissent, issued a statement describing the protests as an uprising against “47 years of systemic corruption and discrimination.”
It also announced that two of its members had been detained, including a member of its secretariat.
A national council representing schoolteachers urged families to speak out about detained children and students. “Do not fear the threats of security forces. Refer to independent counsel. Make your children’s names public,” it said in a statement.
A spokesman for the council said Sunday that it has documented the deaths of at least 200 minors who were killed in the crackdown. That figure is up several dozen from the count just days before.
“Every day we tell ourselves this is the last list,” Mohammad Habibi wrote on X. “But the next morning, new names arrive again.”
Bar associations and medical groups have also spoken out, including Iran’s state-sanctioned doctors council, which called on authorities to stop harassing medical staff.
Anger over the bloodshed now adds to the bitterness over the economy, which has been hollowed out by decades of sanctions, corruption and mismanagement. The value of the currency has plunged, and inflation has climbed to record levels.
The Iranian government has announced gestures such as launching a new coupon program for essential goods. Labor and trade groups, including a national retirees syndicate, have issued statements condemning the economic and political crisis.
Meanwhile, U.S. President Donald Trump has moved an aircraft carrier and other military assets to the Persian Gulf and suggested the U.S. could attack Iran over the killing of peaceful demonstrators or if Tehran launches mass executions over the protests. A second American aircraft carrier is on its way to the Mideast.
Iran’s theocracy has faced down protests and U.S. threats in the past, and the crackdown showed the iron grip it holds over the country. This week, authorities organized pro-government rallies with hundreds of thousands of people to mark the anniversary of the 1979 Islamic Revolution.
Still, Barzin said, he sees the ferocity of the crackdown as a sign that Iran’s leadership “for the first time is afraid of being overthrown.”

Federal law would stop the cars of drunk or impaired drivers, but it isn't happening yet
A federal law requires new cars to include technology that detects drunk or impaired driving, but regulators still have not cleared it
- Bookmark
A federal law requiring impairment-detection devices inside all new cars survived a recent push to strip its funding but remains stalled by questions about whether the technology is ready.
Rana Abbas Taylor lost her sister, brother-in-law, nephew and two nieces when a driver with a blood-alcohol level almost four times the legal limit slammed into their car in January 2019 as the Michigan family drove through Lexington, Kentucky, on the way home from a Florida vacation.
The tragedy turned Abbas Taylor into an outspoken advocate for stopping the more than 10,000 alcohol-related deaths each year on U.S. roads. Lawmakers attached the Honoring Abbas Family Legacy to Terminate Drunk Driving Act to the $1 trillion infrastructure law that then-President Joe Biden signed in 2021.
The measure, often referred to as the Halt Drunk Driving Act, anticipated that as early as this year, auto companies would be required to roll out technology to “passively” detect when drivers are drunk or impaired and prevent their cars from operating. Regulators can choose from a range of options, including air monitors that sample the car's interior for traces of alcohol, fingertip readers that measure a driver's blood-alcohol level, or scanners that detect signs of impairment in eye or head movements.
Mothers Against Drunk Driving called it the most important piece of legislation in the organization's 45-year history. Still, implementation has been bogged down by regulatory delays, without any clear signals that final approval is near.
“The way we measure time is not by days or months or years. It’s by number of lives lost,” Abbas Taylor said in an interview with The Associated Press. “So when we hear manufacturers say, ‘We need more time,’ or ‘The tech is not ready,’ or ‘We’re not there yet,' all we hear is, ‘More people need to die before we’re willing to fix this.’”
The ‘kill switch’ debate
A Republican-led effort to remove the Halt Act's funding was defeated in the U.S. House last month by a 268-164 vote. Another bill to repeal it entirely awaits a committee vote.
Most of the opposition has stemmed from suggestions that the law would require manufacturers to equip cars with a “kill switch". That would essentially allow them to “be controlled by the government,” Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis posted on the social platform X, drawing comparisons to George Orwell's dystopian novel “1984.”
The alcohol industry has fiercely defended the law against such arguments. Chris Swonger, president and CEO of the Distilled Spirits Council of the United States, said it specifically requires the technology to be passive, similar to other current safety mandates such as seat belts and air bags.
“There is no switch, there’s no government control, there is no sharing of data," he said. “That’s just an unfortunate scare tactic.”
But Rep. Thomas Massie, a Kentucky Republican who authored the defunding effort, said even the dashboard acting on its own could serve as “your judge, your jury, and your executioner." He cited the example of a mother who swerves in a snowstorm to avoid hitting a neighbor's pet, only for her car to deactivate itself because it determines she's impaired.
The Alliance for Automotive Innovation, a trade association for U.S. automakers, made a similar case to regulators in 2024, arguing that much more research was needed before mandating the technology.
“Even if 1 in 10,000 trips were expected to experience a false positive, this could result in thousands of unimpaired drivers encountering problems that prevent them from driving each day,” the Alliance wrote.
The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, which is establishing the rules to implement the Halt Act, told the AP in an email that it's still “assessing developing technologies for potential deployment” and expects to report back to Congress soon. Even supporters predict the agency will push the decision at least into 2027, and auto companies still would have another two to three years to install it.
Vouching for the tech's reliability
The Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, a research arm funded by auto insurers, recently announced that impairment detection and other technology aimed at curbing risky driving behavior would soon be included as criteria for a vehicle to earn one of its top safety awards.
Many states already have laws requiring breath-activated ignition interlock systems to be installed on the cars of DUI offenders. The system ultimately chosen under the Halt Act is intended to detect impairment beyond just drunk driving.
“We’re still sort of pushing back against this narrative that the technology doesn’t exist,” said Stephanie Manning, chief government affairs officer at MADD. “We’ve seen many different types of technology that can solve drunk driving. We just haven’t seen it deployed and implemented the way that we would like.”
To accelerate the timeline, one bill advancing in Congress would offer a $45 million prize to whoever can produce and deploy the first consumer-ready piece of technology. Abbas Taylor, whose family members were killed in the Kentucky crash, said efforts like that give her hope.
“When you've lost everything, there is nothing that will stop you from fighting for what is right,” she said. “But we see the writing on the wall, and we know it’s only a matter of time before this happens.”

Muted hearing of Christchurch mosque killer all part of the plan

Muted hearing of Christchurch mosque killer all part of the plan
Wellington, New Zealand: In a near-empty courthouse, in front of almost no one, the appeal by New Zealand’s most reviled killer was heard in muted fashion with little mention of the details of the country’s deadliest mass shooting.
Such is New Zealand’s desire to smother the racist motivations of Brenton Tarrant, who murdered 51 Muslims praying at two mosques in the city of Christchurch in 2019.
Tarrant, a self-professed white supremacist, referred to other perpetrators of hate-fuelled massacres when he committed his attack, and other mass shooters have cited his actions since. Yet, it’s rare to encounter the Australian man’s words in New Zealand, the country to which he migrated with a plan to amass semiautomatic guns and carry out the slaughter.
Officials have sought to curb the spread of his views, including through a legal ban on his racist manifesto and a video he livestreamed of the shooting. The effort to prevent public exposure to Tarrant is perhaps most apparent in New Zealand’s courts, where he sought this week to recant his guilty pleas.
A three-judge panel in the Court of Appeal in Wellington heard final arguments on Friday by Crown lawyers opposing Tarrant’s application to have his admissions in 2020 to charges of terrorism, murder and attempted murder discarded.
Tarrant is serving life in prison without a chance of parole, but the case would return to court for a full trial if he is allowed to revoke his guilty pleas. Opposing lawyers say his appeal has no merit.
The 35-year-old told the court this week he didn’t want to plead guilty and made the “irrational” admissions during a “nervous breakdown” induced by solitary and austere prison conditions. But Crown lawyers opposing his appeal bid said in their response on Friday that there was no evidence for the claims that he was seriously mentally ill.
Experts had ruled Tarrant was fit to enter pleas, and his former lawyers and prison staff didn’t raise concerns either.
“It’s difficult to see what more could’ve been done,” Crown lawyer Barnaby Hawes told the court. Tarrant, he added, “is an unreliable witness and his narrative should be treated with caution.”
The evidence against Tarrant – including his own livestream of the massacre, in which he filmed his face – was so overwhelming that a guilty verdict was assured if he had fought the charges in a trial, the lawyers said.
“Pleading guilty to charges where his guilt is certain can’t be seen to be irrational,” Hawes said.
The subdued hearing defies the tension over the case.
One topic nearly absent from the weeklong hearing was any mention of the hateful motivations Tarrant cited for committing the crimes. Lawyers both supporting and opposing Tarrant’s bid avoided reference to his white supremacist views, and proceedings unfolded in the quiet and stolid way New Zealand court cases usually do.
“Keeping this case alive is a source of immense distress” to the shooter’s victims.Crown lawyer Madeleine Laracy
But there were signs the court sought to limit the public’s exposure to Tarrant, as New Zealand’s justice system has done before. Almost nobody was permitted to view the gunman’s evidence and the appeal bid unfolded in front of nine reporters, nine lawyers, a few court staff, and an empty public gallery.
Tarrant was permitted to watch the proceedings by video conference from Auckland Prison, but his image was not visible in the courtroom except when he gave evidence.
Apart from in Christchurch, where the bereaved and wounded survivors watched a livestream of the hearing at the local courthouse, the shooter was invisible.
The approach New Zealand has enacted – in which even news outlets name the shooter as few times as possible in each article – stands at odds with the publicity given to trials for racist mass killers before, including widely covered proceedings for the Norwegian murderer Anders Breivik, whom Tarrant years later cited as an inspiration.
Crown lawyers urged the appeal judges on Friday to thwart the prospect of the matter returning to court in a lengthy public trial, which would happen if the Australian’s bid to recant his guilt was successful.
“Keeping this case alive is a source of immense distress” to the shooter’s victims, Crown lawyer Madeleine Laracy said. “It doesn’t allow them to heal.”
A swift ruling isn’t expected. The judges’ decision will be released later. New Zealand’s appeals court delivers 90 per cent of its judgments within three months of a hearing’s end, according to the court’s website.
If his bid to revoke his guilty pleas is unsuccessful, Tarrant’s case will return to the appeals court for a later hearing, where he will seek a review of his life sentence.

Partial US government shutdown throws Congress into turmoil again
Second shutdown in four months after funding halted for Department of Homeland Security, as Republicans and Democrats fail to reach a deal

Mark Magnierin New York
The US Government experienced its second shutdown in four months on Saturday, as funding for the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) halted, underscoring Washington’s growing partisanship and dysfunction.
But in an ironic twist, Immigration and Customs Enforcement, or ICE, at the centre of the Congressional showdown, will continue to operate despite being part of DHS, given its independent source of funding. In an unprecedented move, US President Donald Trump’s administration has allocated at least US$75 billion over four years to ICE in addition to its US$10 billion base budget, allowing it to circumvent the usual budget process.
The shutdown followed the death of two US citizens in Minneapolis at the hands of ICE agents. Public outcry was intense, emboldening Democrats and forcing Republicans to cede ground. Trump replaced the lead commander in the Midwestern city, wound down “Operation Metro Surge”, and agreed that ICE agents must wear body cameras.

But it balked at Democrats’ other demands, including requirements that agents stop hiding their identities behind face masks, obtain judicial warrants before entering private property, and wear identification, a move critics say engenders a sense of impunity.
This shutdown follows on the heels of the longest such stoppage in US history, when the government ground to a halt last October and November for 43 days. That saw US fourth-quarter GDP decline by 1.5 percentage points and led to a “Day 20 crisis” when millions of low-income Americans went without food assistance.
Trump’s unprecedented support for ICE has turned it into the highest-funded US law enforcement agency, resulting in some 10,000 new officers and a huge expansion in detention facilities. Law enforcement experts say its excesses are the result of inadequate vetting or training, as public antipathy has grown rapidly.

What we can learn from lovebirds, the rare birds that mate for life
Phoenix is believed to be home to the world's largest colony of rosy-faced lovebirds outside of their native Africa
- Bookmark
Minutes after getting to a park in the middle of Phoenix, you can see flashes of green in the sky and hear chatter because love is in the air — or at least, the lovebirds are.
The small parrots are transplants from the other side of the world that are thought to be descendants of pet birds. Arizona is believed to be home to the largest colony of rosy-faced lovebirds outside southwestern Africa. They've been able to survive in a place known for sweltering weather by sticking close to humans and their air conditioning.
The lovebirds may have something to teach humans this Valentine's Day about keeping strong romantic bonds.
How did African lovebirds end up in Phoenix?
Rosy-faced lovebirds are originally from another arid region, the Namib Desert, which stretches from Angola, across Namibia and into South Africa. They are one of nine species of lovebirds.
Around the world, lovebirds are a popular pet. No one knows for sure how the lovebird colony started in Phoenix but they were first noticed around the city in the 1980s.
Some think pet lovebirds escaped or were let loose by their owners or escaped from a pet store, said Robert Carter, a volunteer for the Maricopa Bird Alliance who leads bird walks in the Phoenix area. Others have speculated that they could have flown all the way to Arizona but Carter thinks in that case, they would've found another arid area to stay along the way. The population has grown to an estimated 2,000 birds in Phoenix today, he said.
They can be seen sticking their heads out of the holes in cactus and palm trees that they roost in. They're also known to hang out near air conditioning vents on really hot days to at least be a little less hot, including at Arizona State University's science building.
While Carter thinks they should have been left in Africa, he admires their adaptability.
“They definitely show a sense of resilience to the situation that they're in," he said.
While Phoenix's lovebirds are believed to be the largest, most firmly established colony outside of Africa, there are also fairly well-established colonies of rosy-faced lovebirds in parts of Hawaii — on the Big Island and in Maui, said Kenn Kaufman, field editor for Audubon magazine who has written about lovebirds.
Another kind of lovebird, the Fischer's lovebird, appear to have established a small colony on the southern coast of Portugal, he said.
How did the birds get their name?
Lovebirds earned their name because of their tendency to form lifelong bonds with their mates, who like to perch close together, almost like they're cuddling. While many parrots mate for life, fewer than half of bird species do, Kaufman said.
While genetic testing has revealed that birds considered “socially monogamous” sometimes also breed with other birds while raising their young with their mate, lovebirds are not known to stray. They often clean their mate's feathers, especially the hard-to-reach ones, and feed one another food throughout their lives, not just when they are courting, like some other birds, Kaufman said.
People who have kept lovebirds as pets report that their mate seems depressed when they lose their partner by not being active or making abnormal calls, said Dr. Stephanie Lamb, associate veterinarian and bird specialist at the Arizona Exotic Animal Hospital.
How do parrots display affection?
Even when they are with other birds, lovebirds are not afraid to engage in some PDA — or as Kaufman says, “parrot display of affection." They pass food to each other with their beaks, which often looks like kissing, he said.

Still, Lamb said lovebirds, like other parrots, can sometimes be violent with each other, screaming and pecking one another with beaks powerful enough to crack open seeds. Sometimes they have to sit at opposite ends of their cage for a bit, until one comes over and nudges their way back into a cuddle, she said.

BYU says star wide receiver charged with felony rape is no longer a student there
Brigham Young University says its standout wide receiver Parker Kingston is no longer a student there after he was arrested this week on a first-degree felony rape charge
- Bookmark
Brigham Young University said Friday that its standout wide receiver Parker Kingston is no longer a student at the Utah private school after he was arrested this week on a first-degree felony rape charge.
Kingston, 21, made his initial court appearance Friday in St. George, where prosecutors say a woman who was 20 years old at the time told officers that Kingston assaulted her at her home last February. He was arrested following a yearlong investigation in which detectives collected digital and forensic evidence and interviewed witnesses, Washington County Attorney Jerry Jaeger said.
“I found by clear and convincing evidence that Mr. Kingston was a danger to the community," Judge John Walton said during the hearing.
Still, Walton allowed Kingston be released Friday on a $100,000 bond with $10,000 cash immediately paid to the court after he was held initially without bail.
His defense attorney, Cara Tangaro, agreed that Kingston could have no contact with his accuser or any potential witnesses, must stay off social media and would wear a GPS ankle monitor to ensure he doesn't return to the southwestern Utah county, except for court appearances. He appeared before the judge by remote video link from jail Friday.
If convicted, he could serve five years to life in prison.
Tangaro did not immediately respond Friday to email and phone messages seeking comment.
BYU spokesperson Jon McBride said the administration and coaches were only made aware of the investigation and the allegations against Kingston after his arrest this week. He declined to answer whether Kingston was kicked out or left the school voluntarily.
Kingston told St. George Police that “all sexual activity” with the woman accusing him of rape was “consensual,” according to an affidavit unsealed Thursday. The woman told investigators she had made clear to Kingston before he came to her house that she did not want to have sex with him, and she told him to stop several times when he initiated sex, the affidavit said.
BYU, the flagship university of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, known widely as the Mormon church, has a strict honor code for students that prohibits all sexual relations outside of a marriage between a man and a woman. Those who violate it can face suspension, and for athletes, many weeks riding the bench.
Other top athletes including Tulane quarterback Jake Retzlaff have opted to leave BYU when faced with lengthy suspensions for violating the honor code.
Kingston was BYU’s leading receiver last season.
He is expected to make his next court appearance Feb. 25.

Looking back at George Washington’s 1790 letter, the root of American religious freedom
Unknown
Unknown Publisher

13:43:31 KST

One day in January 1948, in Atlanta, Georgia, a little boy named David stood in line with his father to visit the Freedom Train, filled with original American documents such as the Declaration of Independence, the Constitution, and the Gettysburg Address.
As we wandered through the train, we looked at these seminal papers. Several times, my father pointed out the signatures of Thomas Jefferson, John Adams, Alexander Hamilton, and, of course, George Washington.
Now, after having seen more noted American historical signatures on various documents, my great American Jewish moment occurred. Frequently, I ask myself, “Could I actually have seen that most famous George Washington letter to the ‘Hebrew congregation in Newport, Rhode Island,’ written after he visited the synagogue in 1790?”
However, why not? My father, Louis, read to me from the letter: “May the Children of the Stock of Abraham, who dwell in this land, continue to merit and enjoy the goodwill of the other inhabitants; while everyone shall sit in safety under his own vine and fig tree, and there shall be none to make him afraid.”
That letter has come to mean so much to me that I purchased two facsimiles and have read the letter many times.
As Presidents’ Day approaches (February 16), I would like to review its meaning.
Noted American Jewish historian Prof. Jonathan Sarna offers a very important interpretation of the meaning of this letter.
Rights for religious liberty
“A short exchange between President George Washington and the Jewish community of Newport articulated a theory of religious liberty grounded in inherent natural rights rather than toleration – even before the First Amendment was added to the American Constitution.”
Sarna, who has been a historical activist throughout his life, wanted to see the actual letter in 2011. It had disappeared.
In order to make the letter visible and also protected, a journalist of The Forward began to write about the lost letter. After a search which he initiated, since the name of the owner was known, the letter was found in a basement – unprotected.
Actually seeing the original of the letter has motivated me to study the analysis by Sarna and other scholars. When Sarna was in Jerusalem and spoke about the meaning of the letter, I was present.
I quote from Sarna’s words again. “The letter reframes American religious freedom as a lived constitutional principle forged through minority claims, not merely legal text.”
Now Sarna emphasizes a key point: “Discussions of America’s religious origins are often framed almost exclusively through Christianity, yet this letter suggests that even the nation’s most important founder rejected such a narrow understanding.
“Over time, the letter took on sacred proportions not only for Jews but for anyone who cared about religious liberty. In today’s climate, where debates about religion and America are increasingly shaped by Christian nationalism, the letter stands as a foundational proof text for pluralism.”
My personal experience with pluralism was most fascinating. During the last major American celebration, the Bicentennial in 1976, I was a rabbi in Wilmington, Delaware, before making aliyah the following year. I received information encouraging ministers, priests, and rabbis to plan “American celebratory events” to be funded by the Bicentennial Commission of the US. I applied, the synagogue received a grant, and the cantor and I wrote a “Pageant of Freedom” in song with an original text. Five hundred people – Jews and Christians – attended the event.
Let me introduce Irvin Ungar, the collector of the art of Arthur Szyk. Szyk had disappeared from the scene except for his famous Haggadah. Ungar discovered Szyk art treasures. A major article on Szyk appeared in The New York Times in December 2025.
Szyk moved to the US from England at the beginning of World War II. His art depicting the story of the US had a defining figure, George Washington.
In his award-winning book on Szyk, Arthur Szyk: Soldier in Art, Ungar demonstrates the particular interest of the artist in the freedom he understood was to be found in the US.
“Early on, he was drawn to George Washington and the concept of democracy. And he was mindful of the unique freedoms of American Jews precisely because the United States protects religious liberty and – for the most part – embraces the diversity that inspired its motto ‘E pluribus unum,’ [meaning] ‘Out of many, one.’”
In 1930, Szyk drew his first picture of George Washington, on a horse, leading the American colonist fighters. “This painting and 37 others in this series of Washington and the American Revolution,” Ungar notes in his book, “were completed by Szyk in time for the 200th anniversary of Washington’s birth in 1932.” Bought by the president of Poland, they were presented to President Franklin D. Roosevelt as a gift.
“When FDR delivered his famous ‘Four Freedoms’ speech to Congress in January 1941, the walls of the White House displayed the entire Szyk series.”
For another American historical moment, Ungar describes the drawing, by Szyk, of the Declaration of Independence in this fashion. “All the symbols of the American Revolution are present, most prominently George Washington with hand raised as if in benediction.”
“The text, beautified with color and pattern,” Ungar writes, “highlights the most important words: ‘We hold these truths to be self-evident that all men are created equal; that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights; that among these are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.”
Ungar points to the meaning of the 1790 letter. “Twenty-four years after these words were written, Washington made it clear in his letter to the Jews of Newport that those inalienable rights, or ‘inherent natural rights’ as he termed them, included religious liberty.”
Prof. Melvin I. Urofsky wrote the book A Genesis of Religious Freedom: The Story of the Jews of Newport, RI, and Touro Synagogue. He added in the book title “including Washington’s letter of 1790.”
As it happens in his book, facing the picture of noted benefactor Judah Touro, he writes: “Although this letter carries with it a unique and cherished significance, in many ways it is a treasure for the entire nation. America, as [Alexis] de Tocqueville famously wrote, had been ‘born free,’ unfettered by the religious and social bigotries of medieval Europe.”
This letter demonstrates “that the United States did not espouse mere toleration, but full liberty of conscience. Freedom of religion in the United States had risen to the level of an inherent natural right, protected by the Constitution and now part of those inalienable rights mentioned in the Declaration of Independence.”

From Der Judenstaat to modern Israel: Herzl’s vision in today’s world - opinion
Unknown
Unknown Publisher

13:43:28 KST

February 14 marks 130 years since the publication of Theodor Herzl’s Der Judenstaat (The Jewish State). Published in 1896, it stunned the Jewish world.
It is generally recognized that the catalyst for Herzl writing this pamphlet – or skinny booklet, as it is described – was his experience as the Paris correspondent for the Viennese newspaper Neue Freie Presse. Herzl witnessed the degrading of Alfred Dreyfus, a Jewish French artillery captain falsely convicted of selling military secrets to Germany. Herzl saw this as an example of the blatant antisemitism pervading Europe. His answer was the creation of a Jewish state where Jews could live without fear of antisemitism. His vision encapsulated that while non-Jews would be welcome, the vast majority would be Jews.
Herzl, an assimilated member of Vienna’s middle class, was not a practicing Jew nor did he speak Hebrew. His ignorance of the Jewish religion saw a future Jewish state as having little to do with Judaism, leading him, at one point, to be prepared to accept Uganda as the home of the Jewish people.
What would Herzl think if he were to return to today’s world? For sure, he would be shocked to find the level at which antisemitism has pervaded the free and so-called enlightened world.
There are those who compare today’s Jew-hatred with the hatred of Jews during the 1930s and 1940s that led to Hitler and the Germans’ annihilation of two-thirds of European Jewry. However, today’s antisemitism is particularly disturbing, as it is not limited to a single country but is practiced in far too many sovereign states throughout the world.
World educated to despise Jews
The current Jew-hatred is the result of an Iran whose supporters and proxies have ensured that the free world is educated to despise Jews. Qatar, with strong ties to Iran, has financed major universities worldwide, guiding students toward the abhorrence of Jews.
Iran’s proxies, Hamas and Hezbollah, while unsuccessful in physically eliminating the one Jewish state, have managed to persuade the “enlightened world” that Israel – the victim of Hamas’s attempt to wipe us off the map on October 7, 2023, – is the aggressor.
What the free world is not yet prepared to accept is that Iran is not only an enemy of the Jews; it is an enemy of the entire non-Muslim world.
The clearest evidence of how blind the West is in recognizing this reality is its failure to assist the brave Iranians who came out in their millions on the streets of Tehran (not for the first time), protesting against their leadership and paying the ultimate price.
Due to Iran’s complete blackout of communication, it is difficult to verify the exact number of Iranians who have been brutally murdered, but figures vary, with some quoted as high as 30,000 and beyond.
Where in the free, “enlightened” world are the demonstrators against the murderous Iranian leadership? There are those who find the time and energy to consistently demonstrate against the Jews and Israel but appear to show no sympathy for the countless men, women, and children barbarically murdered by their Iranian leaders.
What we witnessed recently in the center of London were thousands marching in support of Palestine and against Israel while brandishing placards bearing the image of Iranian Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei, with words underneath reading “The right side of history.” Chants of “Long live the ayatollah” could be heard, and Nazi salutes were visible as demonstrators marched on their way to Downing Street, home of the UK’s prime minister.
Without doubt, what the world desperately requires today is a Churchill, who alone was prepared to confront Hitler in the 1930s. The West is in dire need of such a leader. There is a time to appease and a time to confront, and – without doubt – the time to confront a second Hitler is now.
At the same time, we in Israel need to confront the ever-increasing divisions within our own society, as we are facing one of the most challenging periods in our history. The time is long overdue for self-reflection. We are a split nation, which made us vulnerable to attack on Oct. 7.
Then the country was divided over Justice Minister Yariv Levin’s proposal to weaken the judiciary – a proposal that Levin continues to promote. He also holds the position of deputy prime minister.
Israel, a country without a constitution and devoid of a second house, requires the legal input on proposed law changes. Since 1995, the Supreme Court has the authority to strike down laws passed by the Knesset if they contradict Basic Laws. In January 2024, the Supreme Court determined it has the power to review and possibly strike down even Basic Laws if they violate the “core of Israel’s identity as a Jewish and democratic state.” The court can strike down government decisions or ministerial actions based on the “reasonableness” doctrine.
What Levin aims to achieve would enable the government to do as it pleases, regardless of what is legally or morally correct.
Right now we are witnessing the government’s attempt to remove the attorney-general, its questioning of the validity of the High Court of Justice, and its refusal to recognize Supreme Court President Isaac Amit as its legally elected head.
For more than a year, Levin has failed to convene the Judicial Selection Committee, thereby preventing the appointment of judges to the magistrate and district courts, heavily increasing the burden on the judicial system.
Simultaneously, we face a government bent on passing a budget giving financial support to the ultra-Orthodox sector that continues to refuse to play its part in the defense of this country.
How dangerous is this, at a time when the IDF is short of approximately 10,000 soldiers, including an urgent need for some 7,000 additional combat personnel due to the prolonged conflict in Gaza and other fronts!
The citizens of Israel – relying heavily on those who serve in the IDF – deserve a budget that reflects the contribution made by those who give to the country, rather than those who take and give naught.
One such individual who gave of himself to save others was St.-Sgt.-Maj. Ran Gvili. The entire country, and especially his family, were relieved when his body was returned to his home for burial. Gvili was the last hostage to be released. Extraordinarily brave on Oct. 7, he was among the first to arrive to defend Kibbutz Alumim’s men, women, and children. In spite of being shot twice, Gvili succeeded in killing 14 terrorists before succumbing to his wounds.
On this 130th anniversary of Herzl’s Der Judenstadt, we appreciate how right Herzl was in recognizing the need for a state where Jews would be masters of their own destiny.
The journey to retain the one Jewish state has been fraught with challenges, of which the most testing has been to fight those bent on our destruction time and again. This we have done thanks to the sacrifice of too many – may their memory be as a blessing.
Israel, in spite of those determined to annihilate us, has succeeded in becoming a country achieving way beyond Herzl’s wildest dreams – from the days of the earliest pioneers, who turned a swampland into a country whose desert has produced untold vegetation, to the start-up phenomenon and technological world leader Israel is today, embracing manifold health-promoting discoveries utilized throughout the world.
Herzl would be proud of what the Jewish state has accomplished, and he would be even prouder if we could find a way of coming together.
Am Yisrael chai.

Mark Carney joins hands with Canada opposition leader as he pays tribute to school shooting victims

Canadian prime minister Mark Carney has told residents of Tumbler Ridge that the country is “with you, and we will always be with you”, during a candlelight vigil for the eight victims of a mass shooting that has shattered the small mining town.
The prime minister, holding hands with opposition leader Pierre Poilievre while flanked by First Nations chiefs and local officials, paid tribute to the families enduring the loss of loved ones, after the shooting at a local school that has become one of the most deadly attacks in Canadian history.
“I know that nothing I can say will bring your children home,” the prime minister told nearly 2,000 people huddled in the cold and holding candles. “I know that no words from me or anyone can fill the silence in your homes tonight, and I won’t pretend otherwise.”
On Tuesday, an 18-year-old transgender woman opened fire at the Tumbler Ridge Secondary School, killing five students and a teacher, after earlier killing her mother and stepbrother at home. The attacker then took her own life.
Police recently released the names of the victims from the school, and at the vigil, leaders remembered Kylie Smith, Abel Mwansa, Zoey Benoit, Ticaria Lampert, Ezekiel Schofield and educator Shannda Aviugana-Durand.
Maya Gebala, 12, who was wounded in the head and neck, and Paige Hoekstra, 19, who also suffered bullet wounds, remain hospitalized in Vancouver.
“When we leave here tonight and some of you go back to quiet houses, some of you go back to empty rooms, please know that you’re not alone,” Carney said. “Canada is a community that relies on each other’s grace, and may that grace bless us all.”
Earlier in the day, federal leaders walked to the memorial outside the school, meeting for the first time with victims’ families. Both Carney and Poilievre fought back tears as they spoke with victims’ families for the first time.
The two, who have clashed politically in recent weeks, have set aside partisan differences in order to show a unified front – a move welcomed by residents of the town.
“Today, there are no Conservatives. There are no Liberals, New Democrats, Greens or Bloc Quebecois” said Poilivre. “We are all just mothers and fathers. We all watch our kids going to school, expecting them to come back to us”.
Poilievre commended Carney for his “tremendous grace” and the two leaders joined hands as an Indigenous leader sang a prayer outside the town hall.
Leaders praised the acts of heroism and courage they said defined the town and its residents. British Columbia premier David Eby singled out one teacher who “did everything right” by barricading students in a classroom, even though his own son had left the class to use the bathroom. Eby credited older students for comforting and protecting younger students.
Eby also promisedthe students that, under no circumstances, would any be forced to return to the school. “We will provide a safe place for you to go back to school.”
Dwayne McDonald, the deputy commissioner of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police in British Columbia, said earlier Friday that the alleged shooter did not appear to be searching for a specific target at the school.
“This suspect was, for lack of a better term, hunting,” McDonald said. “They were prepared and engaging anybody and everybody they could come in contact with.”
McDonald described a “chaotic” scene at the school when police arrived, with fire alarms sounding and a person yelling out a window that the suspect was upstairs.
“They entered the school, proceeded to go up the stairwell, and were met with gunfire,” he said. “It was a matter of seconds after that there was more gunfire, not as we know now, having reviewed video, directed at any persons. Then the suspect took their life.”
Mayor Darryl Krakowka told the community to “make space” for each other, warning that the coming days would reveal the immense difficulty of returning to the routine of daily life. But he praised their resilience.
“Tumbler Ridge has been shaken, but not broken.”

US strike on alleged drug boat in Caribbean kills 3
February 14, 2026The United States military said on Friday that it had struck another vessel suspected of trafficking drugs in the Caribbean, killing three people.
The US Southern Command (SOUTHCOM) posted an 11-second clip on social media platform X that showed a boat wading through waters before being hit by what the military called "a lethal kinetic strike" and exploding.
The vessel "was transiting along known narco-trafficking routes in the Caribbean and was engaged in narco-trafficking operations," the statement from SOUTHCOM said.
US authorities did not provide any evidence for these claims.
Deadly US drug boat stikes
The Trump administration has carried out at least 38 strikes on alleged drug boats in the Caribbean Sea and eastern Pacific Ocean since early September in a bid to tackle international drug smuggling.
US President Donald Trump has justified the attacks as a necessary escalation, saying that his country is in an "armed conflict" with cartels in Latin America.
Friday's attack takes the death toll from such operations to at least 133, as per official figures.
But the US has offered little evidence to back its claims of killing "narcoterrorists."
Critics have also voiced concerns over the legality of the deadly strikes in international waters.
Last week, US Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth claimed that "some top cartel drug-traffickers" in the region "have decided to cease all narcotics operations INDEFINITELY due to recent (highly effective) kinetic strikes in the Caribbean."
Hegseth made the comments on his personal social media account and gave no further information supporting the claim.

Colombia resumes spraying drug crops with drones
Sign up now: Get ST's newsletters delivered to your inbox
BOGOTÁ – Colombia has resumed spraying drug fields with a toxic chemical using drones, the US embassy in Bogota said on Feb 13, after a meeting between the two nations’ leaders
The South American nation in 2015 suspended the aerial spraying of glyphosate, which has been linked to cancer in humans, over concerns about its negative health impact.
US President Donald Trump and leftist counterpart Gustavo Petro met last week at the White House to smooth diplomatic tensions that had been building over the last year.
They pledged to resume historic military cooperation between Washington and Bogota, and to jointly combat guerrilla groups and drug cartels.
Mr Petro’s government announced in December that it would resume the spraying of drug crops under growing pressure from the Trump administration, which is demanding a tougher anti-drug policy in the world’s top cocaine producer.
“Colombia has launched drone eradication of coca crops” with support from the US government, Washington’s mission in Bogota wrote on social media on Feb 13.
“This technology could be game-changing: Lower coca cultivation, more security in Colombia, less deadly drugs reaching American streets, and more lives saved.”
The Colombian justice ministry presented the new drug crop eradication policy in December.
It said drones would fly 1.5m above coca fields and carry out “controlled” spraying to prevent the chemical from affecting communities.
Since taking office in 2022, Mr Petro has followed a “total peace” policy to disband all armed groups through dialogue.
But six months before he leaves office, the efforts have yielded few results, forcing the president to shift towards a tougher war on drugs. AFP

NEW YORK, February 14. /TASS/. During their operation to capture Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro, the US military used Claude AI tool, despite the developer’s prohibition to use the technology to facilitate violence, The Wall Street Journal (WSJ) newspaper reported citing sources.
The developer Anthropic’s user guidelines prohibit the use of the technology to facilitate violence, develop weapons or conduct surveillance.
"We cannot comment on whether Claude, or any other AI model, was used for any specific operation, classified or otherwise," an Anthropic spokesman was quoted as saying. "Any use of Claude—whether in the private sector or across government—is required to comply with our Usage Policies, which govern how Claude can be deployed. We work closely with our partners to ensure compliance."
In late January, WSJ reported that a contract between the Pentagon and Anthropic worth approximately $200 million was under the threat of being cancelled because of differences on the use of artificial intelligence technologies to spy on people on the US territory.

LOS ANGELES – The Los Angeles 2028 Olympics chief Casey Wasserman is putting his talent and marketing agency up for sale, the Wall Street Journal reported on Feb 13, following criticism for f lirtatious e-mail exchanges with convicted sex trafficker Ghislaine Maxwell
Mr Wasserman has been criticised and called on to resign as the LA28 chief after the release of messages. His firm too has lost a client, with pop star Chappell Roan saying earlier this week she was no longer represented by his company
Mr Wasserman has denied having a personal or business relationship with late financier and sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. He has previously apologised for his association with Maxwell, saying their relationship came before her or Epstein’s crimes were revealed.
Mr Wasserman’s talent agency did not respond to a request for comment outside regular business hours.
According to the Journal, Mr Wasserman told his firm’s staff in an internal memo that he felt that he had “become a distraction” to its work and had begun the process of selling the company.
“I’m deeply sorry that my past personal mistakes have caused you so much discomfort,” Mr Wasserman wrote in the memo, reported by the newspaper.
“It’s not fair to you, and it’s not fair to the clients and partners we represent so vigorously and care so deeply about,” he wrote.
The LA28 said earlier this week that Mr Wasserman will remain chairman of the 2028 games after organisers conducted a review of his past interactions with Maxwell and Epstein, and found his relationship with them did not go beyond what had already been publicly documented. REUTERS

LA28 chief Wasserman is putting his talent agency up for sale after Maxwell revelations, WSJ reports

LOS ANGELES – The Los Angeles 2028 Olympics chief Casey Wasserman is putting his talent and marketing agency up for sale, the Wall Street Journal reported on Feb 13, following criticism for f lirtatious e-mail exchanges with convicted sex trafficker Ghislaine Maxwell
Mr Wasserman has been criticised and called on to resign as the LA28 chief after the release of messages. His firm too has lost a client, with pop star Chappell Roan saying earlier this week she was no longer represented by his company
Mr Wasserman has denied having a personal or business relationship with late financier and sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. He has previously apologised for his association with Maxwell, saying their relationship came before her or Epstein’s crimes were revealed.
Mr Wasserman’s talent agency did not respond to a request for comment outside regular business hours.
According to the Journal, Mr Wasserman told his firm’s staff in an internal memo that he felt that he had “become a distraction” to its work and had begun the process of selling the company.
“I’m deeply sorry that my past personal mistakes have caused you so much discomfort,” Mr Wasserman wrote in the memo, reported by the newspaper.
“It’s not fair to you, and it’s not fair to the clients and partners we represent so vigorously and care so deeply about,” he wrote.
The LA28 said earlier this week that Mr Wasserman will remain chairman of the 2028 games after organisers conducted a review of his past interactions with Maxwell and Epstein, and found his relationship with them did not go beyond what had already been publicly documented. REUTERS

Over 177,000 Russian soldiers killed in Ukraine identified by media investigation

Russian independent media outlet Mediazona, in collaboration with the BBC Russian service, has confirmed the identities of 177,433 Russian military personnel killed in Ukraine as of Feb. 13.
Since the media outlets' last update in early February, the names of 9,291 Russian soldiers have been added to the list of casualties.
The journalists note that the actual figures are likely significantly higher, as their verified information comes from public sources such as obituaries, posts by relatives, regional media reports, and statements from local authorities.
The confirmed death toll now includes over 57,200 volunteers, 21,400 recruited prisoners, and 17,000 mobilized soldiers, according to the media outlets. A total of 6,414 officers have also been confirmed to have been killed.
While Moscow does not disclose its casualty figures at all, President Volodymyr Zelensky told France TV in an interview on Feb. 4 that at least 55,000 Ukrainian soldiers have been killed on the battlefield since the start of Russia's full-scale war. Kyiv largely avoided commenting on its losses for the first two years of the full-scale invasion, until Zelensky announced in February 2024 that 31,000 Ukrainian troops had been killed.
Zelensky also told France TV that Russia would continue to incur staggering losses if it attempted to conquer all of eastern Ukraine by force of arms. His comments come amid the latest round of trilateral peace talks between Ukraine, Russia, and the U.S., where the status of Ukraine's eastern Donbas territory remains a major point of contention in negotiations.
Despite the heavy losses, Russia has been able to make marginal advances in Ukraine's front line region as it is able to offset its casualties through fresh contract soldiers. The Ukrainian open-source mapping project DeepState reported that Russian forces occupied 4,336 square kilometers (1,674 square miles) of Ukrainian territory in 2025, accounting for less than 1% of the country
The General Staff of Ukraine's Armed Forces estimates that as of Feb. 13, Russia has lost around 1,250,950 troops in Ukraine since Feb. 22, 2022. The figures do not specify killed or wounded, though the overall consensus is that it includes dead, wounded, missing, and captured.
Mediazona published the complete list of identified casualties for the first time in February, marking three years since Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine. According to the publication, volunteers manually enter and verify each record to prevent duplicate entries in the database.

CNN’s Kaitlan Collins reacts to Trump scolding her to smile after she asked about the Epstein files: ‘It’s not about me’
‘It’s not a laughing matter, I don’t think, to talk about sex trafficking victims,’ Collins told the Absolutely Not podcast

Kaitlan Collins has said she was not “fazed” after Donald Trump deflected her question about the Epstein files by complaining she never smiled, but said the president’s reaction had been “revealing” about his attitude towards the issue.
“It’s not a laughing matter, I don’t think, to talk about sex trafficking victims. And I’ve interviewed a lot of these women who were underage girls at the time and their stories are powerful,” the CNN anchor told the Absolutely Not podcast Wednesday.
During the exchange, Collins asked about justice for the women victimized by Epstein's operation, causing the president to become angry and begin ranting about CNN and calling her "the worst reporter."
He then complained that she never smiled. "You know she's a young woman," Trump said to the rest of the room before redirecting to Collins. "I don't think I've ever seen you smile."
“In that moment, I was thinking, the question is about what these victims think,” Collins said. “It wasn’t even anything accusatory of Trump himself, which I think in itself is revealing of how he thinks about it and how he is viewing it through the lens of himself.
“It’s not about me. It’s not about me smiling and my expressions. It’s what these women think about what your administration has done. And so I think that’s why that moment resonated with so many people because just the issue at hand.”
Collins said that having covered Trump for 10 years he “doesn’t really surprise me that often with his responses,” but given the seriousness of the topic it had resonated with her especially, prompting her steely response.
Trump also lashed out at Collins in December, describing her as “always Stupid and Nasty” in a Truth Social post, and has been consistent in his attacks on other female journalists who have questioned him in the Oval Office and on press trips.
Last week, while flying to Florida on Air Force One, Trump lashed out at another reporter, telling her she had a “very bad attitude” after she questioned him over a reported split within the MAGA base over his immigration agenda.
“Where are you from?” the president asked The Washington Post reporter Natalie Allison. “Washington Post? Are you having a hard time getting readers? The Washington Post is doing very poorly… You have a very bad attitude. Go ahead.”
Despite the president’s use of childish and degrading language towards female reporters taking a notable uptick in the last year, the White House has insisted previously that the insults are “nothing to do with gender.”
“President Trump has never been politically correct, never holds back, and in large part, the American people re-elected him for his transparency,” White House spokeswoman Abigail Jackson told The Independent in December.
“This has nothing to do with gender – it has everything to do with the fact that the president’s and the public’s trust in the media is at all time lows.”

MOSCOW, February 14. /TASS/. Almost 21,000 bribe-related crimes were exposed in Russia in 2025, which is the record-high number over the past few years, according to the Russian Interior Ministry’s statistics obtained by TASS.
In all, 20,918 such crimes were exposed in Russia in 2025, which is approximately 25% higher than in 2024, when the figure stood at almost 17,000. This includes over 8,500 bribe-taking crimes, almost 9,000 bribe-giving crimes and almost 3,600 cases of mediation. Compared to 2024, the growth in these categories will be 12%, 30%, and 39%, respectively.
According to the ministry’s files, a steady growth in exposed corruption-related crimes has been observed since 2017, when the number of such crimes stood at 6,270.

Mistrial declared in case of students charged after Stanford pro-Palestinian protests

A judge declared a mistrial on Friday in a case of five current and former Stanford University students related to the 2024 pro-Palestinian protests when demonstrators barricaded themselves inside the school president's office.
Twelve protesters were initially charged last year with felony vandalism, according to prosecutors who said at least one suspect entered the building by breaking a window. Police arrested 13 people on June 5, 2024, in connection with the incident, and the university said the building sustained "extensive" damage.
The case was tried in Santa Clara County Superior Court against five defendants charged with felony vandalism and felony conspiracy to trespass. The rest previously accepted plea deals or diversion programs.
The jury was deadlocked. It voted nine to three to convict on the felony charge of vandalism and eight to four to convict on the felony charge to trespass. Jurors failed to reach a verdict after deliberations.
The charges were among the most serious against participants in the 2024 pro-Palestinian protest movement on US colleges in which demonstrators demanded an end to Israel's war in Gaza and Washington's support for its ally, along with a divestment of funds by their universities from companies supporting Israel.
District Attorney seeks new trial
Prosecutors in the case said the defendants engaged in unlawful property destruction.
"This case is about a group of people who destroyed someone else's property and caused hundreds of thousands of dollars in damage. That is against the law," Santa Clara County District Attorney Jeff Rosen said in a statement, adding he sought a new trial.
Anthony Brass, a lawyer for one of the protesters, told the New York Times his side was not defending lawlessness but "the concept of transparency and ethical investment."
"This is a win for these young people of conscience and a win for free speech," Brass said, adding, "humanitarian activism has no place in a criminal courtroom."
Protesters had renamed the building "Dr. Adnan's Office" after Adnan Al-Bursh, a Palestinian doctor who died in an Israeli prison after months of detention.
Over 3,000 were arrested during the 2024 US pro-Palestinian protest movement, according to media tallies. Some students faced suspension, expulsion, and degree revocation.

Specialists neutralize Russian drone equipped with anti-tank mines in Poltava region
The Poltava regional police stated this on its website, according to Ukrinform.
After another air attack, a Geran-2 strike drone was discovered in a field in one of the communities of the Poltava region. It was equipped with KPTM-3 submunitions and a main warhead that had not detonated. Police bomb disposal experts in the Poltava region who arrived at the scene neutralized the dangerous findings and transported them to a special demolition site for further destruction.
It is noted that KPTM-3 mines are extremely insidious: they are fitted with a magnetic target sensor and a self-destruct mechanism that can be triggered without direct contact, reacting to the approach of vehicles. Even a downed or crashed UAV may remain active and pose a deadly threat.
As Ukrinform previously reported, explosive ordnance disposal specialists from the Poltava regional police also neutralized the warheads of a missile and a UAV.

Danish PM says more Greenland talks due after meeting US’s Marco Rubio
New opinion poll finds seven in 10 US adults disapprove of President Donald Trump’s handling of Greenland issue.
Denmark’s prime minister and Greenland’s premier met with United States Secretary of State Marco Rubio and agreed that talks would be pursued on the running of Greenland, the semi-autonomous Danish territory that President Donald Trump has threatened to take over.
Rubio held a 15-minute meeting with Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen and Greenland’s Premier Jens-Frederik Nielsen on the sidelines of the Munich Security Conference on Friday.

Greenland’s leader Nielsen said in a post on social media that during the meeting with Rubio, “it was emphasised that the conversations being made are the right way forward and the interests of Greenland were once again clearly highlighted”.
Prime Minister Frederiksen said on X after the meeting: “Constructive talk with Secretary of State Marco Rubio together with Jens-Frederik Nielsen, Chairman of Naalakkersuisut, at the Munich Security Conference.”
“Work will continue as agreed in the high-level working group,” she said.
The meeting between the Danish and Greenlandic leaders and the US state secretary comes amid severely strained ties between Europe and Washington, and NATO allies, amid President Trump’s repeated threats to take over Greenland and criticism of European nations as “decaying” and “weak”.
Speaking to reporters on Friday, Trump said, “We’re negotiating right now for Greenland.”
“I think Greenland’s going to want us, but we get along very well with Europe. We’ll see how it all works out,” he said.
After months of bellicose language regarding the US’s necessity to acquire Greenland, Trump abruptly stepped back from his threats last month, saying that he had reached an understanding with NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte that would give the US greater influence in the mineral-rich Arctic territory.
Late last month, the US, Denmark and Greenland also launched talks to find a diplomatic path out of the crisis.
Poll finds most US adults disapprove of Trump’s Greenland plan
The US administration has cited key national security concerns related to Russia and China to justify its demand to take control over Greenland and has accused Denmark, and Europe more broadly, of being unable to defend the strategic territory.
But, according to a new opinion poll conducted by The Associated Press and NORC Center for Public Affairs Research, Trump’s push to seize control of Greenland has gone down badly with the US public and members of his own party.
The survey, conducted between February 5-8, found that about seven in 10 US adults disapprove of how Trump is handling the Greenland issue – a higher disapproval rating than the share of those who dislike how he is handling foreign policy generally.
Even among Republican supporters, about half disapprove of his attempt to turn Greenland into US territory, according to the poll.
Sweden said on Thursday that it would send fighter jets to patrol Greenland as part of a newly launched NATO mission in the Arctic aimed at placating Trump’s concerns over the threats posed by Moscow and Beijing.
The government said in a statement that Swedish-made Gripen fighter jets would patrol Greenland as part of the newly-launched NATO mission, Arctic Sentry.
“As a NATO ally, Sweden has a responsibility to contribute to the security of the entire territory of the Alliance. The Arctic region is becoming increasingly important from a strategic perspective,” Sweden’s Prime Minister Ulf Kristersson said.
In a separate statement, the Swedish Armed Forces said the fighter jets would be based out of Iceland, where six aircraft have been stationed since early February as part of the rotating incident response force, NATO Air Policing.
Swedish special forces would also be sent to Greenland to take part in training exercises for a couple of weeks, the military said.

US ambassador to NATO believes China could stop Russia's war in Ukraine with one call
US Ambassador to NATO Matthew Whitaker has said that China is providing decisive support to Russia's aggression against Ukraine and could end the war with a single phone call.
Source: Bloomberg
Quote from Whitaker: "China could call Vladimir Putin and end this war tomorrow and cut off his dual-purpose technologies that they're selling."
Details: Whitaker added that Beijing could also stop its purchases of Russian oil and gas.
Quote from Whitaker: "You know, this war is being completely enabled by China."
Details: Bloomberg reported that China and Russia have forged even closer ties since the beginning of the full-scale war, with Moscow relying on Beijing for the supply of critical parts and components for drones and other military equipment.
China has also once again become the largest buyer of Russian crude oil, despite increasing international pressure on Moscow's vital oil trade.
Tracking data shows that Chinese ports unloaded 1.65 million barrels of oil per day in January, which is the highest level since March 2024 and the second-largest monthly volume since the beginning of Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022.
Despite this, Beijing has repeatedly said it wants to play a "constructive" role in resolving the war. Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi met his Ukrainian counterpart Andrii Sybiha in Munich this week and offered humanitarian assistance to the country as it continues to defend itself against Russian attacks.

MOSCOW, February 14. /TASS/. BRICS member countries are working to create an exchange of precious metals, Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergey Ryabkov told TASS in an interview.
"Apart from a common investment platform, which the minister [Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov] was talking about, there is also an idea to create a special platform designed to work in special economic zones, which practically all BRICS members have," he said. "There is also a recent, but very important, initiative to create an exchange of precious metals, along with a grain exchange."
During Russia’s BRICS chairmanship in 2024, at the Kazan summit, a number of Russian initiatives were adopted for implementation, including alternative payment platforms, mechanisms for settlements in national currencies, reinsurance facilities for intra-BRICS trade and with BRICS partners, the establishment of a grain exchange, and a new investment platform.
Commenting on these initiatives, Ryabkov said "there are all reasons and prerequisites for something tangible to emerge" in that regard.

BEIJING - China’s Foreign Minister Wang Yi told his French and German counterparts that Beijing was not to blame for Europe’s economic and security problems
Mr Wang made the comments at a meeting with France’s Jean-Noel Barrot and Germany’s Johann Wadephul on the sidelines of the Munich Security Conference on Feb 13.
He sought to promote China as a reliable partner of the European Union at a time when the bloc is trying to reduce its dependence on both Beijing and an increasingly unpredictable Washington.
“China’s development is an opportunity for Europe, and Europe’s challenges do not come from China,” Mr Wang said, according to the statement.
Warning that “unilateralism, protectionism, and power politics” were on the rise globally, he said he hoped Europe would “pursue a rational and pragmatic policy towards China”.
“The two sides are partners, not adversaries; interdependence is not a risk; intertwined interests are not a threat; and open cooperation will not harm security.”
The meeting came against the backdrop of trade tensions between the two giant economies and disputes over what the EU sees as China’s support for Russia’s war in Ukraine.
The EU is seeking to cut its reliance on China for strategic goods like rare earths while also rebalancing a trade relationship that sees it run a large deficit with the world’s second-largest economy.
In recent years, the two sides have clashed over Chinese electric-vehicle exports, which threaten Europe’s car industry and which Brussels argues are based on unfair subsidies, and Chinese tariffs on EU goods ranging from cheese to cognac.
Mr Wang urged Germany and France to help “give a clear direction for the development of China-Europe relations”.
In a separate meeting with Mr Wadephul – also on Feb 13 – Mr Wang touted economic and trade cooperation as “the cornerstone of China-Germany ties”, according to a Foreign Ministry readout.
Mr Wang also met Britain’s Foreign Minister Yvette Cooper, telling her that Beijing and London should “explore more potential for cooperation”, while the two sides also discussed Ukraine and Iran. AFP

Elderly man mistakenly kidnapped from Sydney’s north-west: police
Updated ,first published
Police say a trio of kidnappers took the wrong person and are appealing for the return of an elderly man who was abducted from his bedroom in northern Sydney.
Officers have called on the kidnappers to relinquish Chris Baghsarian, who they fear may be hurt and who needs daily medication. They said the widower and grandfather was not the intended target, and lives alone at his North Ryde home.
“You have the wrong person,” said Detective Acting Superintendent Andrew Marks, in a direct appeal to the abductors. “If there’s a member of the kidnap crew who has any common decency, tell us where he is and we’ll do the rest.”
Baghsarian’s neighbours called police at 5am on Friday, after hearing a commotion. One witness, Felix Cho, told Channel 9 he heard glass smashing, “the screaming that just kept going” and dogs barking before a car took off down the street.
Police found signs of forced entry to the home.
“They took Mr Baghsarian when they were at home in the bedroom, they bundled him into a car and took him to a location that we do not know,” Marks said.
Police believe there were up to three kidnappers, who drove a dark-coloured Toyota SUV. A burnt-out vehicle matching that description was found nearby. Baghsarian, who Marks said required daily medication and medical treatment, had been wearing a blue and maroon flannelette shirt and grey tracksuit pants.
Officers were worried he had been hurt. “We always fear for the safety of the hostage and we believe he may have been harmed, but we’re not sure,” Marks said.
Baghsarian’s family, which Marks said was not involved in any criminal activity, was worried. “They’re quite surprised that this has happened and what they want is the safe return of their father,” he said.
Anyone with information about his whereabouts is asked to contact Crime Stoppers on 1800 333 000.

Trauma and defiance: Life and death of 17-year-old killed fighting Israel
Wael Mesheh, from the West Bank, had wanted to study. But his life took a turn after being imprisoned by Israel.
Nablus, occupied West Bank – Before he was killed by an Israeli drone 18 months ago at the young age of 17, Wael Mesheh was an aspiring university student who wanted to be a successful computer programmer.
But having seen five of his relatives and friends cut down by Israeli forces during almost daily raids of his northern West Bank refugee camp of Balata, the Palestinian teenager came to believe that life and death were the same, engendering a desire to sacrifice himself for the cause of Palestinian freedom, and therefore turning himself – in his belief – into a “martyr”.

“What our family was suffering planted this desire inside him: He always knew he wanted to fight and see his country without occupation,” Wael’s 47-year-old father, Belal, told Al Jazeera.
“And it was not just Wael, but many of his generation in the camp.”
Before he turned 17, Wael had been imprisoned for throwing stones at Israeli soldiers, assaulted in jail, and then freed in a prisoner exchange deal.
He joined the Qassam Brigades – the armed wing of Hamas – once he got out of prison, and was eventually killed in August 2024 while fighting Israeli troops near his home in Balata, southeast of Nablus.
Wael’s story is typical of many young Palestinians in the West Bank’s refugee camps. Children learn from an early age that trauma will define their lives in ways even other Palestinians are spared.
Psychologists from the West Bank told Al Jazeera young people in the camps face “incessant traumatisation”, and most are deprived of “safety, places to play, opportunities, and a chance to escape”.
Instead, as the offspring of refugees denied the right to return to their homeland, they face a life surrounded by poverty, death, and Israeli military violence.
They are part of Palestinian society, yet remain marginalised within it – without the sense of belonging others take for granted.
The conditions endured by those in the camps make them a breeding ground for armed resistance to Israel.
Belal says that it was Wael’s time in prison that eventually pushed him to fight. He says that Wael was tortured by guards for being defiant, and was kept in solitary confinement. He was eventually released as part of the November 2023 prisoner exchange deal, at the start of Israel’s genocidal war on Gaza.
Defenders of the camps
The West Bank’s 19 refugee camps, once makeshift tented communities when they were established in 1948 after Israel’s founding and intended to be temporary, are now densely populated built-up areas housing the descendants of hundreds of thousands of refugees.
The older generations remember being forcibly expelled from their homes in historical Palestine by Zionist militias in the 1948 Nakba to pave the way for the creation of an Israeli state.
The United Nations Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA) describes the camps as dominated by poverty, severe overcrowding, and joblessness. The camps are also the primary targets of Israeli military operations in the West Bank.
Without the prospect of a normal childhood for their occupants, the lure of fighting Israel can often prove irresistible.
Nablus-based psychologist, Nisreen Bsharat, said “martyrdom”, particularly for those in the camps, is viewed as the ultimate demonstration of faith and resilience.
Bsharat, who works with young people and grieving mothers from Balata, said martyrdom is seen as a “’heroic’ contribution to Palestine”, and that martyrs and their families are celebrated as such.
Those who fight against Israel are seen as “role models” when so few opportunities exist in refugee camps, Bsharat added.
“Historically, martyrdom is tied to our national identity,” she said. “It’s seen as the least we can offer our homeland, and part of our duty.”
Though far from an exclusively Islamic concept, Palestinians often refer to those who are killed by Israeli forces as martyrs, believing they sacrifice their lives fighting for their nation, Islam, and the Holy Land – and believe that God promises them their place in paradise.
Bethlehem-based clinical psychologist and academic, Amanda Manasra, who was born in Aida refugee camp, and focuses on trauma in Palestine, told Al Jazeera the vast majority of camp residents live with untreated complex post-traumatic stress disorder (CPTSD), which is significantly more difficult to cure.
The harsh environment of the camps creates a revolutionary fervour that is far less common in wealthier areas, Manasra added.
“The idea of martyrdom is related to how Palestinians find meaning to deal with hardship, individually and collectively,” she said.
“Many of my cases are adolescent men from the camps – many former prisoners – who have lost so many friends and family members.
“Joining the resistance is about taking control – it can feel like a reward for experiencing hardship, and can satisfy feelings of retribution.
“The fighters feel they have survived, persisted, and beaten the occupation war machine.”
Camps in the northern West Bank came under even more relentless attack since Israel launched “Operation Iron Wall” in January 2025, which has displaced tens of thousands of refugees in nearby Jenin and Tulkarem, and killed hundreds.
Psychological toll
Belal, who spent eight years in Palestinian Authority (PA) prison during Wael’s childhood, feels the pain of his son’s loss deeply.
They both had only ever known the narrow, labyrinthine streets and decrepit buildings of Balata, the most populous refugee camp in the West Bank. But Belal feels that he wasn’t able to be there to guide Wael through them.
“I didn’t get the chance to see Wael growing up, or spend time with him as all other fathers do,” he said, unable to fight back his tears.
“I envy his mother and brother because at least they lived with him. They have beautiful and plentiful memories with him, shared moments.
“Do you know what it feels like to carry your son on your shoulders, place him in his grave, and bury him with your own hands? It is the hardest thing in the world.”
Belal, whose brother was also killed by Israel when he was younger, said he and his son had so many plans for when he would be released from prison.
In the end, Belal was freed only on compassionate grounds so he could see Wael for the final time before he was buried.
Israel’s actions breed hatred
For those in Nablus’s refugee camps, violent incidents like Wael’s killing are nearly a weekly reality – and a doom-laden reminder that death lurks around every corner.
Belal recalled Wael becoming deeply affected as a child by the 20-year imprisonment of his closest uncle, after whom he was named. Later, he became preoccupied with avenging those close to him whose lives he says Israel had stolen. Four of Wael’s cousins had been killed in the 12 months preceding his death.
“Of course, it was also the constant invasions and the violence he grew up around, and the barbaric way the soldiers treat us,” Belal told Al Jazeera.
“Every night, we experience the atmosphere of Israel’s raids. We’re forced to accept this life – we have no choice but to adjust.”
Belal said that when Wael was growing up, there were no youth clubs or even parks that could take his mind off the harsh life in the camp. He added that soldiers had once raided the family’s house and destroyed “literally everything”.
“It’s actions like these that breed hatred toward them.”
Belal specifically remembered Wael, who had just begun high school, being enraged by footage of Israeli soldiers beating women in Al-Aqsa Mosque in occupied East Jerusalem, one of Islam’s holiest sites.
“Wael couldn’t accept that soldiers would beat women and girls,” he said. “It was intolerable for him.”
Wael’s surviving family live in a crowded second-floor apartment near the centre of the camp, and his father, two of his brothers, his little sister, and his grieving mother took turns tearfully eulogising him.
His mother, Hanadi, was beaten, and his brother, Ibrahim, was also detained as soldiers broke into their apartment late at night to arrest Wael.
Hanadi was shocked by Wael’s condition once he was released from prison.
“The marks of torture remained on his body even after his release,” she said. “Burn scars from extinguished cigarettes were visible on his back and hands.”
Refugee camps under siege
Balata has often been a target for the Israeli military, and, according to the UN, 30 people have been killed in the camp since Israel intensified its attacks on the West Bank following Hamas’s October 7 attacks.
The pictures of Palestinians killed fighting Israel are emblazoned, like shrines, on the camp’s walls.
About 33,000 people are crammed into Balata’s narrow streets. It spans an area of 0.25 square kilometres (0.1sq miles), and has one of the highest rates of unemployment and food insecurity anywhere in the territory, according to UNRWA.
On August 15, Wael and two other fighters rushed to confront an incursion of Israeli soldiers when they were struck by a drone on the camp’s main street. Wael and fellow fighter Ahmad Khalil were killed instantly, while four others, including children, were injured.
Hanadi described the camp being surrounded by soldiers while gunshots rang close by, as she comforted her younger children.
“The moment I heard the sound of the missile, I knew he had been martyred,” she said.
“I started praying for God to accept him and to give me strength to bear this calamity.
“I also prayed that his face would remain unharmed because he always wished his face wouldn’t be disfigured so we could say our goodbyes to him properly.”
Tsunami of trauma
Manasra said there is a tsunami of untreated mental health problems across the West Bank, while services remain hopelessly stretched, underfunded, and inaccessible for most.
She says the glorification surrounding resistance to Israel and martyrdom also obscures a more difficult reality of unprocessed grief and trauma that lingers with individuals and families forever.
Supporting families in the camps like Belal’s is nearly impossible when services are so costly and restricted, she says.
Without any such mental health support, Belal spoke of his suffering and told Al Jazeera that, since his son’s death, “joy has not entered our house”.
“We may smile or laugh at each other to show politeness, but inside, it’s different,” he added.
“Inside, there’s only fire – and pain.”
Too often, the burden of resistance falls on the poorest residents of the West Bank’s refugee camps.
In each case, the reason for resisting is different. But there are nearly always similarities: Hardship, piety, retribution, and a sense of duty to one’s country.
The pride found in resisting only briefly distracts from the deep scars left by Israel’s occupation, which is tightening its grip over the West Bank – particularly in the refugee camps.
The surviving families of those killed are left somewhere between terrible grief and hopeful adulation.
“When I sit alone, I imagine Wael beside me,” Belal added.
“Sometimes, I feel like hugging his picture tightly to my chest as I cry my heart out.
“He was a role model even for me. I bid him farewell with complete serenity – I know God will accept him as a martyr.”

Senate Democrats seek probe of reported UAE stake in Trump family’s crypto company
Sign up now: Get ST's newsletters delivered to your inbox
WASHINGTON – Two Democratic members of the US Senate Banking Committee on Feb 13 asked Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent to examine the potential national security implications of a reported purchase of a US$500 million (S$631.8 million) stake in the Trump family’s cryptocurrency venture
Senators Elizabeth Warren and Andy Kim asked Mr Bessent, who heads the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS), to determine whether a CFIUS review is required of the 49 per cent UAE stake in World Liberty Financial
CFIUS is a Treasury-led interagency committee that vets foreign investments for national security risks, including top officials from the Defence, State, Commerce, Homeland Security and Justice departments.
In a letter viewed by Reuters, they asked Mr Bessent to respond to several questions about the transaction by March 5, including whether CFIUS had reviewed the deal in any form, or submitted any recommendations to Republican President Donald Trump about it.
The Treasury had no immediate comment on the letter.
“The transaction raises significant national security concerns,” the senators said in the letter.
Ms Warren and other Democratic senators have repeatedly raised questions about World Liberty Financial, which was founded two months before Mr Trump’s November 2024 victory in the US presidential election, and potential conflicts of interest.
The firm was announced by businessman Steve Witkoff, who is now a key Trump envoy.
Mr Trump’s aides have said he has handed over control of his business ventures, which are being reviewed by outside ethics lawyers.
Ms Warren and Mr Kim said CFIUS had a “clear mandate to address potential national security risks from foreign investments, including transactions that could allow foreign governments like China or the UAE to access critical technology or the sensitive personal data of US citizens”.
They said the reported deal raised questions about whether the UAE or China might be able to access any of the “sensitive personal information” that World Liberty Financial says it collects, they wrote.
The Wall Street Journal in January reported that G42, a company backed by Sheikh Tahnoon bin Zayed Al Nahyan, who manages the UAE’s largest wealth fund and is a member of the Gulf nation’s royal family, bought the stake in World Liberty Financial days before Mr Trump began his second term in January 2025.
Months later, the Trump administration approved the sale of advanced artificial intelligence chips to the UAE.
World Liberty is behind the stablecoin USD1, which is pegged to the US dollar and backed by short-term US government Treasuries, US dollar deposits and other cash equivalents.
The company counts Mr Trump and Mr Witkoff as co-founders emeritus, and is run by members of the Trump and Witkoff families.
Ms Warren and Mr Kim noted that US intelligence had long warned that G42 may have provided technology to assist China’s military. REUTERS

'Can a souffle rise once?': Albanese takes first swipe at new Opposition leaders

13:05:22 KST

Prime Minister Anthony Albanese has borrowed from a sharp-tongued predecessor to launch his first attack on new Opposition leader Angus Taylor, asking "can a souffle rise once?"
Albanese played on an infamous insult from former prime minister Paul Keating, who asked whether a souffle rises twice when Liberal Andrew Peacock mounted a challenge to regain the party leadership in 1989.
"Angus Taylor presents us with a new question: can a souffle rise once?" Albanese said during a speech to the NSW Labor Country Conference in Orange on Saturday.
It was the prime minister's first public comment on Taylor's toppling of Sussan Ley in a long-anticipated Liberal leadership spill.
Taylor's 34-to-17-vote win on Friday brought down the Liberals' first female leader just nine months after she took the top job.
Labor reaction to leadership change
Albanese said Taylor and his new deputy Senator Jane Hume had both damaged their party with their various opposition to tax cuts, cost-of-living relief and renewable energy.
"It is extraordinary that they have had eight months of plotting in order to deliver the two people to the leadership positions who more than anyone else on their entire show were responsible for alienating the Liberals from the Australian voters," he said.
"But that is what they have done. Every single challenge that is before us, they have failed on."
Within minutes of the change of leadership, the federal government rolled out online attack ads criticising Taylor's record as a minister and shadow treasurer.
Federal minister Murray Watt said the spill would do little for the Coalition.
"The Liberal Party has completely lost touch with the vast majority of Australians and what they care about," Senator Watt told reporters in Sydney on Friday.
"There is no evidence to date that Angus Taylor has any solutions for those challenges."
Treasurer Jim Chalmers said Taylor's record was shambolic.
"Angus has zero credibility on the economy and neither does the bin fire that is the coalition," he said.
Taylor pledges to prioritise 'standard of living'
Just days after reuniting the Coalition with Ley at the helm, Nationals leader David Littleproud said Taylor would be the right person to lead the Opposition back into government.
"Angus is the leader Australia needs to take up the fight against Labor's reckless spending and ideology," he said.
"Angus can offer hope to aspirant Australians and those who are struggling to enter the housing market."
Speaking after his win on Friday, Taylor said his first priority would be to restore Australia's standard of living, which he said "has collapsed under a rotten Labor government".
"They do not know how to manage this economy, [the] result is Australians are getting poorer, their standard of living [is] going backwards — not just in absolute terms, but relative to peer countries around the world," he told reporters.
Ley announced she would resign from parliament in the coming weeks after losing the leadership, triggering a by-election in her NSW seat of Farrer.
One Nation leader Pauline Hanson said her party would field a candidate in the upcoming by-election.

Freed hostage Arbel Yehoud breaks silence: 'I tried to end it three times'

More than a year has passed since Arbel Yehoud was freed from captivity after 482 days in what she describes as the hell of Gaza. Four months have gone by since she was reunited with her partner, Ariel Cunio, who was held for 738 days. Yet even now, Arbel struggles to speak about the horrors she endured, leaving them, in her words, in a “closed suitcase.” “What I went through, I went through from beginning to end, almost every day in captivity,” she said, declining to elaborate.
In a joint interview with Channel 12 News, Arbel said that after Ariel Cunio was released in the latest hostage deal in October, they "sat a little to the side and started talking. Then it dawned on both of us that he didn’t know anything about what I went through in captivity.”
“Even if I understood, I didn’t want to accept it in any way,” Ariel said of the day of his release and the painful conversation that followed. “Then you get punched in the stomach. It feels like your world has collapsed. By the end of that day, you could see it on me. I fainted. I started convulsing. My body just collapsed.”
Arbel said she had been determined to hold everything in until Ariel returned. “He is the person closest to me, the one I want to share with and tell. And we’re not there yet. It’s very hard. I so appreciate and admire and love the hostages who manage to sit down and open their mouths. To tell it, to open up their trauma.”
She said the shift for her came after former hostage Romi Gonen revealed the sexual harassment she endured in captivity, beginning on the fourth day. “I was repressing it well until then,” Arbel said.
Referring to Gonen’s account of meeting other female hostages in a tunnel and realizing she was in worse condition than the others, Arbel said she identified with much of what Gonen described, particularly the gap she felt when she encountered the other women.
“But even after I saw the horrors Romi had to endure, the gap remained. Because it was for so, so long. What I went through, I went through from beginning to end,” she said.
In a separate interview with the Daily Mail, Arbel said that what Gonen endured “I went through almost every day in captivity.” She was held alone throughout that period and said she attempted to take her own life on several occasions. “I tried to end it three times,” she said. “I felt I couldn’t go on. There were moments when I thought it was the only way out.”
What kept her alive, she said, was her love for Ariel, from whom she was separated after the two were abducted together. “Every time I remembered Ariel, it gave me the strength to keep breathing,” she said of her suicidal thoughts.
Arbel declined to provide further details about the abuse but said she was held in complete isolation, starved and subjected to psychological, sexual and physical abuse, including the breaking of two ribs.
Recalling their abduction on October 7, she said: “I put my hand over our dog’s mouth so she wouldn’t bark, but it didn’t help. They found us, dragged us outside and shot Merv in front of our eyes. We heard her crying until she died.” Arbel was beaten, and Ariel suffered severe blows to the head until he bled. Ariel’s brother David, his wife Sharon and their children were also abducted. Arbel’s brother Dolev was initially listed as missing and was later confirmed killed. Three hours after being taken into Gaza, the couple were separated and sent to different hiding places.
“I drove them crazy with questions about her,” Ariel said. “I wanted to hear her. I wanted to see her. And they understood I wouldn’t stop until they gave me something.” Eventually, he said, their captors agreed to let them exchange notes through intermediaries. The messages were short and direct: “I’m OK. I love you. Be strong.”
“It gave me strength,” Ariel told the Daily Mail. “It reminded me I wasn’t alone, that someone was fighting with me, even quietly.” Arbel said she constantly feared Ariel would try to escape and risk his life. “So the letters calmed me,” she said. But after several months, the exchanges stopped.
“They told Ariel that if he mentioned my name again, they would kill me,” Arbel said. “Every day I hoped he was safe. I didn’t know if he was alive, if they were hurting him. That fear was worse than anything.”
“The psychological price was insane,” Ariel added. “The separation, the uncertainty about whether she was OK. Sometimes I went crazy. I would walk in circles, bang my head against the wall just to release the tension.”
Arbel, who was held at times in refugee camps in the Gaza Strip, said her captors interrogated her and tried to force her to convert to Islam. The two said that at first there was even talk of selling them or smuggling them out of Gaza. “I was held with a baby who was 4 months old. When I was released, he was 15 months old. They carry knives from age 7 or 8,” Arbel said of the Gazans she encountered. “Three days before I left, the baby pointed a gun at me. He was playing with it. He pointed it at me while I begged his mother to take it away.”
Arbel, who was released last January, walked out alone on her final day into a bloodthirsty crowd, surrounded by hundreds of gunmen. “I remember going out and seeing a sea of green headbands,” she said. “I was the only woman. My brain was trying to process — I’m free, but still surrounded by them? I was afraid, but I knew I had to survive. I thought about Ariel — I had to get back to him.” Then, for the first time since her abduction, she encountered another Israeli — Gadi Mozes, who was also released that day.
Ariel was freed after 738 days in captivity. “Since I came back, I haven’t really come back to life,” Arbel concluded. “What kept him going was the thought of me, the possibility that we would meet again. That maybe we would still have a life together.”
Now they continue to struggle — with sleepless nights, flashbacks and trauma — trying to learn how to live again after their home in the kibbutz of Nir Oz was destroyed.

MOSCOW, February 14. /TASS/. Moscow, Beijing and other partners are helping to create a favorable political environment for talks between Iran and the United States, Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergey Ryabkov told TASS in an interview.
"We remain in full contact with the Iranians and, together with others, including our Chinese colleagues, we are doing what is called ensuring a proper political environment," the diplomat said, commenting on US-Iran talks.
"The focus is now on the talks that Iran is currently conducting with its partners, on the work with the Americans, which Iran is carrying out indirectly, primarily through Arab mediators," the senior Russian diplomat continued.
"I think that this work will continue," he added.
Iran and the US held another round of talks on Tehran’s nuclear program in Oman on February 6. Tehran’s delegation was led by Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi, and the US delegation was headed by Special Presidential Envoy Steve Witkoff.

Food worth flying for: Unique in-flight meals from around the globe

From Malaysian satay skewers to Korean bibimbap, these airline dishes are not your typical in-flight fare.
Immersing yourself in a destination’s culture is no longer just about museums and heritage sites – nowadays, trying traditional dishes and drinks is just as important to travellers.
Yet, your first encounter with local flavours is likely to happen well before you touch down in a destination, with airlines, particularly flag carriers, offering plates from their home countries across in-flight menus.
Forget your bog standard chicken sandwiches or vegetable pastas, these airlines are going all out to impress with their selections.
Nordic delicacies on Finnair
While the Nordic nations haven’t traditionally been recognised as foodie destinations, that has changed in recent years with the rise of New Nordic Cuisine.
You don’t have to book a table at the Michelin-starred Palace in Helsinki or Kaskis in Turku to try Finland’s gastronomic offering, though, as Finnair’s in-flight menu is meant to showcase the country’s delicacies.
The exact menu depends on the destination and the time of travel, but as an example, those flying from Helsinki to Doha in business class will start their trip with options including orange and anise seasoned gravlax, a cured salmon dish, slow-cooked lamb shoulder, followed by Finnish cheeses including aura blue and Herkkujuustola stout vilho.
The drinks list also includes a selection of local options, such as Ainoa Valokki, a cloudberry dessert wine, and spirits from Kyrö Distillery Company. Finnair’s signature cocktail, Northern Blush, features gin, orange peel and bitters, and, of course, lingonberries.
Freshly grilled satay skewers on Malaysia Airlines
Malaysia is perhaps best known for its satay, and up front in business class guests can order chicken, beef or lion’s mane mushroom skewers served with peanut sauce.
Economy class customers flying internationally can also try classic dishes like ikan percik nasi beringin, a south Malaysian-style rice served with fish in a spicy coconut sauce, as well as prawn sambal or chicken rendang paired with Malaysia’s national dish, nasi lemak.
For 2026, Malaysia Airlines has introduced a new Best of Malaysia menu on domestic flights from Sabah and Sarawak to Kuala Lumpur. The focus will change each month, with February’s menu coming from Perak, with dishes including nasi vanggey with ayam berempah, a popular dish from Ipoh with chicken in a curry gravy.
Taiwan’s famed Din Tai Fung on EVA Air
Aside from bubble tea, Taiwan’s biggest cultural export might just be Din Tai Fung.
Founded in 1958, the restaurant chain now has branches all over the world in countries such as the UK, the US, Canada and the UAE as well as much of south east Asia.
You don’t have to join the huge queues to get your fix of xiaolongbao (soup dumplings) as Taiwan’s flag carrier EVA Air has partnered with the brand to offer Din Tai Fung dishes on certain flights from Taipei to destinations including Los Angeles, San Francisco, Tokyo and Bangkok.
Options include juicy pork dumplings, spicy shrimp and pork wontons and braised beef noodle soup, although the menu rotates constantly.
Bibimbap on Korean Air
Hallyu, or the Korean wave, has seen K-culture take the world by storm in recent years.
Outside of the world of film and TV, where KPop Demon Hunters and various K-dramas dominate most-watched lists, Korean food is also hitting the big time.
For Korean Air, the dish that best represents its home country is bibimbap, and flyers in all cabin classes can order the rice dish with traditional beef, salmon, or stir-fried octopus and pork.
In business or first class, travellers can experience fine dining-inspired dishes created in collaboration with chef Seakyeong Kim, the owner of Cesta restaurant in Seoul.
Signature dishes onboard include octopus rice, steamed abalone, and sinseollo, a Korean hot pot.
South American sips on LATAM
While LATAM serves destinations across Latin America (the clue is in the name…), its home base is in Santiago, Chile, and flights from there shine a spotlight on the nation’s culinary offering.
Those flying to Madrid in economy class can dig into grilled salmon with native potatoes from Chiloé in a creamy white wine sauce, while premium class options include a traditional Chilean pastel de choclo, a meat and corn pie, from chef Carmen Aguayo.
On the drinks front, there are Chilean Reserva wines as well as freshly ground South American coffee and teas.

How ‘policy convergence’ could pave the way for US-China cooperation on AI
Two nations could work together on areas like global governance and safety and promote local-level collaboration, according to researchers
The team highlighted “policy convergence” on AI at the local level and challenged the “conventional and stereotypical” expectations of policy models in China and the United States that mainly focused on divergence.
“Despite fierce competition between the two AI superpowers, policy convergence keeps open the possibility of future cooperation and negotiation, particularly on issues of global significance, such as AI governance and safety and security management,” the researchers said in a paper published in the Journal of Comparative Policy Analysis in November.
The study involved a team from Polytechnic University, the Chinese University of Hong Kong and Hang Seng University of Hong Kong, as well as the National University of Singapore.
China and the US have been locked in an intense rivalry over AI – a technology set to have a disruptive impact on society. The competition goes beyond innovation to encompass economic power, national security, military capabilities, and global influence.
According to the paper, a prevailing “one-sided perspective” often characterises AI policy models in China and the US as “strictly binary”.

Marseille mayoral election: Who's running?

They have almost all claimed to have "Marseille in their blood," and made endless declarations of their love for the Mediterranean city, France's second largest. Each candidate has approached the race's starting line, hoping to secure Marseille's central City Hall, which has been run for the past six years by a coalition of left-wing, grassroots and Green parties known as the Printemps Marseillais.
Facing the incumbent left-wing independent mayor, Benoît Payan, who stepped in to replace his Green party predecessor, Michèle Rubirola, when she resigned in December 2020, are the ambitious local leader of the far-right Rassemblement National (RN) party, Franck Allisio; a right-wing and centrist alliance headed by Martine Vassal, the president of Marseille's metropolitan authority, who was previously defeated six years ago; and radical left-wing La France Insoumise (LFI) MP Sébastien Delogu.
This lineup of political heavyweights has barely been challenged by the unexpected candidacies of former senior civil servant Erwan Davoux, running as an independent alongside local right-wing figure Nora Preziosi. The race has also been spiced up by the presence of environmental activist Victor Hugo Espinosa, age 76, running as an independent Green candidate. Le Monde presents the six main candidates for mayor, whose scores and potential alliances between the two electoral rounds could play a decisive role in determining the future governance of Marseille and its metropolitan area.

Sheriff reveals mystery DNA found at Nancy Guthrie’s home doesn’t belong to anyone ‘close’ to her
It’s been nearly two weeks since the 84-year-old vanished from her Arizona home in what police believe is a kidnapping
- Bookmark
The Pima County Sheriff’s Department has revealed DNA that doesn’t belong to anyone in “close contact” with Nancy Guthrie was found at the missing 84-year-old’s home.
It’s suspected that Nancy, the mother of Today show star Savannah Guthrie, was taken from her Arizona home as she slept nearly two weeks ago.
Police are yet to find Nancy or her alleged adductor but have been releasing new information about the case as the days go on.
In a statement shared with The Independent Friday, the sheriff’s department said, “DNA other than Nancy Guthrie’s and those in close contact to her has been collected from the property.”
Nancy lives in the affluent and secluded Catalina Foothills just outside of Tucson.
The sheriff’s department said investigators are working to identify whose DNA was discovered. Police are not currently disclosing where exactly on the property the DNA was found.
In its statement the sheriff’s department also refuted any reports that a glove was found inside Nancy’s home or on her property.
“Several gloves have been located during the investigation. The closest gloves were found approximately two miles from the home,” the department said.
Early this week, authorities shared photos and video of a suspect in Nancy’s disappearance, taken from a doorbell camera at the front of her house on the morning police believe she may have been taken.
The FBI Phoenix Field Office announced Tuesday that the “previously inaccessible” video shows “an armed individual appearing to have tampered with the camera at Nancy Guthrie's front door the morning of her disappearance.”
The suspect, who is yet to be identified, was wearing a ski mask and gloves. It’s unclear whether the gloves the suspect was wearing in the video match the gloves authorities found.
On Thursday, the FBI increased its reward to $100,000 for information “leading to the location of Nancy Guthrie and/or the arrest and conviction of anyone involved in her disappearance.”
The FBI has also shared a detailed description of the suspect, including the type of backpack he was wearing in the doorbell video.
“The suspect is described as a male, approximately 5’9” - 5’10” tall, with an average build. In the video, he is wearing a black, 25-liter ‘Ozark Trail Hiker Pack’ backpack,” the agency wrote on X.
On Thursday, Reuters reported, citing a law enforcement official with knowledge of Nancy’s case, that Pima County Sheriff Chris Nanos was blocking the FBI from examining evidence.
The official claimed the FBI requested DNA and a glove to be processed at the agency's national crime lab in Virginia, but Nanos insisted on using a private Florida lab.
Nanos refuted the idea that he wouldn’t collaborate with the FBI, telling CNN’s Ed Lavandera his department and the bureau are “joined at the hip.”
“We want to find Nancy,” the sheriff added.
Savannah and her siblings are desperate to find their beloved mother, offering to pay for Nancy’s safe return.
There have been reports of ransom notes demanding millions of dollars in Bitcoin, but none have been verified by police.
In an Instagram video posted last Saturday, Savannah said while sitting next to her brother Camron and sister Annie, “We received your message, and we understand. We beg you now to return our mother to us, so that we can celebrate with her.
“This is the only way we will have peace. This is very valuable to us, and we will pay.”
Earlier this week, the sheriff’s department said a person was detained in connection with Nancy’s disappearance.
A man named Carlos told local outlet ABC15 he was stopped by deputies for “kidnapping” Nancy.
“They told me I was being detained for kidnapping, and I asked them, ‘Kidnapping of who?’” Carlos said. He was later released without being charged with a crime, according to the outlet.
As the investigation into Nancy’s suspected kidnapping continues, Nanos holds out hope that she will be found.
“I believe she’ll be found,” the sheriff told Lavandera.
“We are working hard.”

LONDON, February 14. /TASS/. The armed forces of the United States is preparing for a possible military operation against Iran, which may take several weeks, Reuters reported citing two unnamed US officials.
According to their information, the plans for the upcoming operation have already been drafted. It will be more complicated than last year’s attack on the Islamic Republic and may include not only Iranian nuclear infrastructure, but also its governmental and security agencies.
At the same time, Washington expects Iran’s retaliation, which may increase the risk of a regional conflict, the agency reported.
Trump stated on January 26 that Washington had sent a "big armada" towards Iran, and expressed hope that Tehran would engage in dialogue and make a deal, renouncing nuclear weapons. The US leader warned that "the next attack will be far worse" than the summer 2025 strikes on Iran. "Don't make that happen again," he added.
Iran and the US held another round of talks on Tehran’s nuclear program in Oman on February 6. Tehran’s delegation was led by Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi, and the US delegation was headed by Special Presidential Envoy Steve Witkoff.

White House submits its most detailed plans yet of Trump’s $400M ballroom project
The plans are titled the ‘East Wing Modernization Project’ and were submitted to the National Capital Planning Commission by Shalom Baranes Associates

The White House has submitted the most detailed plans yet for Donald Trump’s lavish $400 million ballroom project.
“When completed, it will be the finest Ballroom ever built anywhere in the World, one that has been sought by Presidents for over 150 years – and now they are getting THE BEST!” the president wrote on Truth Social Tuesday, sharing two images of the renderings.
“Because of its unprecedented structural, safety, and security features, it will also be used for future Presidential Inaugurations.”
Full renderings were shared with the National Capital Planning Commission, which oversees large federal construction projects in the region, by Shalom Baranes Associates. The document includes images from various angles and dimensions for the 90,000 square-foot building.
The plans are titled the “East Wing Modernization Project” and were submitted to the committee on Wednesday.
The renderings reveal that a large triangular pediment above the ballroom’s southern portico, included in previous plans, would now be removed. A similar pediment to the east remained as part of the plan.
Despite the removal of the southern portico pediment the height of the building is expected to remain the same height as the White House – a priority for Trump.
This has caused concern among outside architects and historical preservationists, with warnings that the project could overshadow the main structure and views of the White House from particular points including 15th Street NW.
Bruce Redman Becker, a Biden-appointed architect who was removed from the Commission of Fine Arts by Trump last year, told The Washington Post the designs showed “a poorly proportioned pseudo-neoclassical structure that is completely out of scale with the White House.”
Becker said the images also did not apply with guidelines developed by the National Park Service which require new additions to buildings to be compatible with the historic building. “The design team clearly ignored these guidelines, and should be asked to revise and resubmit plans that follow the guidelines,” he told The Post.
The Independent has contacted the White House and Shalom Baranes Associates for comment about the alleged non-compliance with the NPS guidelines.
The East Wing demolition prompted a public outcry after Trump forged ahead with it in mid-to-late October last year despite no independent reviews having taken place, or congressional approval given.
The National Trust for Historic Preservation has since sued to halt construction of the ballroom.
But legal battles were seemingly not of concern for the president, who added in his Tuesday post: “Two views of the Great Ballroom being built on the site of our wonderful White House – It is on budget, and ahead of schedule!”

ICE officers on leave while Feds probe into possible perjury about the shooting of a Venezuelan man in Minneapolis

Federal authorities have opened a criminal probe into whether two immigration officers lied under oath about a shooting in Minneapolis in January, as all charges were dropped against two Venezuelan men.
Immigration and Customs Enforcement Director Todd Lyons said on Friday, February 13, that his agency opened a joint probe with the Justice Department after video evidence revealed "sworn testimony provided by two separate officers appears to have made untruthful statements" about the shooting of one of the Venezuelan men during the Trump administration's immigration crackdown across the Minneapolis-St. Paul area.
The officers, whose names were not disclosed, are on administrative leave while the investigation is carried out, he said. Lyons said the two ICE officers could be fired and face criminal prosecution. "Lying under oath is a serious federal offense," said Lyons, adding that the US attorney's office is actively investigating.
"The men and women of ICE are entrusted with upholding the rule of law and are held to the highest standards of professionalism, integrity, and ethical conduct," Lyons said. "Violations of this sacred sworn oath will not be tolerated. ICE remains fully committed to transparency, accountability, and the fair enforcement of our nation's immigration laws."
Earlier Friday, US District Court Judge Paul A. Magnuson dismissed felony assault charges against Alfredo Alejandro Aljorna and Julio Cesar Sosa-Celis, who were accused of beating an ICE officer with a broom handle and a snow shovel during a January 14 fracas. The officer fired a single shot from his handgun, striking Sosa-Celis in his right thigh.
'Newly discovered evidence'
The cases were dropped after a highly unusual motion to dismiss from US Attorney for the District of Minnesota Daniel N. Rosen, who said "newly discovered evidence" was "materially inconsistent with the allegations" made against the two men in a criminal complaint and at a hearing last month.
The reversal follows a string of high-profile shootings involving federal immigration agents in which eyewitness statements and video evidence have called into question claims made to justify using deadly force. Dozens of felony cases against protesters accused of assaulting or impeding federal officers have also crumbled.
The immigration lawyer representing Aljorna and Sosa-Celis said they are "overjoyed" that all charges have been dismissed. Had they been convicted, the two immigrants would have faced years in federal prison.
"The charges against them were based on lies by an ICE agent who recklessly shot into their home through a closed door," said attorney Brian D. Clark. "They are so happy justice is being served." It is unclear whether the men could still be deported.
Last month, an FBI investigator said in a now-discredited court affidavit that ICE officers attempted to conduct a traffic stop on a vehicle driven by Aljorna on Jan. 14. He crashed the vehicle and fled on foot toward the apartment duplex where he lived. An immigration officer chased Aljorna who – according to the government – violently resisted arrest.
The complaint alleged Sosa-Celis and another man attacked the officer with a snow shovel and a broom handle as the officer and Aljorna struggled on the ground. The officer, who is not named in court filings, fired his handgun, striking Sosa-Celis. The men ran into an apartment and eventually were arrested.
After the shooting, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem attacked Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz and Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey, accusing the Democrats of "encouraging impeding and assault against our law enforcement which is a federal crime, a felony." The Department of Homeland Security did not respond Friday to questions about whether Noem stands by those statements, which ICE – part of DHS – says are now under investigation.
Robin M. Wolpert, a defense attorney for Sosa-Celis in the criminal case, said she was pleased ICE and the Justice Department are publicly acknowledging and investigating apparent untruthful statements by the two ICE officers. "These untruthful statements had serious consequences for my client and his family," Wolpert said. "My client is a crime victim." Clark, the immigration lawyer for Aljorna and Sosa-Celis, urged the government to release the name of the ICE officer who shot his client and charge him.
Court filings show state authorities have opened their own criminal investigation into the shooting, though the FBI has thus far refused to share evidence, provide the name of the ICE officer who fired his weapon or make him available for an interview.
Holes in prosecution's case
Rosen's motion seeking to drop the charges did not detail what new evidence had emerged or what falsehoods had been in the government's prior filings, but cracks began to appear in the government's case during a Jan. 21 court hearing to determine whether the accused men could be released pending trial.
In court, the ICE officer's account of the moments before the shooting differed significantly from testimony from the two defendants and three eyewitnesses. Available video evidence did not support the ICE officer's account of being assaulted with a broom and snow shovel.
Aljorna and Sosa-Celis denied assaulting the officer. Testimony from a neighbor and the men's romantic partners also did not support the agent's account that he had been attacked with a broom or shovel or that a third person was involved.
Frederick Goetz, a lawyer representing Aljorna, said his client had a broomstick in his hand and threw it at the agent as he ran toward the house. Wolpert, representing Sosa-Celis, said he had been holding a shovel but was retreating into the home when the officer fired, wounding him. The men's attorneys said the prosecution's case relied wholly on testimony from the agent who fired the gun.
Neither Aljorna and Sosa-Celis had violent criminal records. Both had been working as DoorDash delivery drivers at night in an attempt to avoid encounters with federal agents, their attorneys said.
Aljorna and Sosa-Celis retreated into their upstairs apartment and barricaded the door, so federal officers used tear gas to try to force the men out, the FBI agent said. Concerned about the safety of two children under 2 inside the home, Aljorna and Sosa-Celis surrendered.
A third Venezuelan man, Gabriel Alejandro Hernandez Ledezma, who lived in the apartment downstairs was also arrested. Hernandez Ledezma was returned to Minnesota and discharged from ICE custody on Monday after a federal judge ordered his release.

Why Renee walked away from her job to open Brisbane’s first romance bookshop

Why Renee walked away from her job to open Brisbane’s first romance bookshop
Renee Woolnough used to come home from her demanding job in corrections and curl up with a book to relax.
She used to say if she won the lotto, she would open a bookshop and cafe.
“I worked with Corrective Services. I was a senior case manager for 20 years, so I dealt with some interesting individuals, let’s say.”
Woolnough’s stories of choice are romance novels – a genre that makes up an increasing proportion of book sales, according to Nielsen BookScan Australia figures.
“Romance was my escape and then ... it was getting too much and I was burning out and I’m like, ‘My life is too short’.
“I want to bring joy to my life and bring joy to other people’s lives, and romance is a very popular genre. Who doesn’t like a coffee and a book?”
Sweet Chapter Books opened on December 20 along Moggill Road at Taringa, and is the first of its kind in Brisbane.
“I know there are a couple of romance bookshops on the Sunshine Coast, and I know there’s some new independent bookshops in Wellington Point and Redcliffe, but for solely romance, I think I’m it,” Woolnough said.
Alongside a healthy offering of books, Woolnough also stocks stickers, magnets, tote bags, book covers and more.
Romance has always been the biggest genre in publishing, award-winning author and QUT lecturer in creative writing Dr Rohan Wilson said.
Romance books sales now more than double those in pre-pandemic 2019. In 2024, Australian readers bought more than 3 million romance novels worth $46.4 million.
“It’s an absolutely huge chunk of the publishing industry,” Wilson said. “It’s easily the biggest growth area in publishing at the moment, and has been for a couple of years now.
“It’s probably the only genre that could sustain its own bookshop in Brisbane.”
Wilson said the rise of authors such as Colleen Hoover and Sally Rooney have given the genre more legitimacy in the last decade or so, but the biggest development has been the surging popularity in romantasy novels – the combination of romance and fantasy – with authors such as Sarah J. Maas and Rebecca Yarros leading the charge.
“I think people just love the emotional stakes at the centre of those stories. They love the relationships, they love the feeling of watching characters grow closer,” he said.
“And when you put that into a fantasy setting with all of the extra opportunities that fantasy storytelling brings along as well, it’s just so addictive and so compelling, and I fully understand why it’s popular and why readers are into it.”
Readers of the romance genre are voracious, Wilson said, and many will read three or four novels a week.
“The demand for it is like, you know, you almost can’t satisfy it.”
The vast majority of readers prefer their books in hard copy, with digital books only making up about 15 per cent of book sales.
“Print culture is really sticking around and not going anywhere at this stage,” Wilson said.
Wilson said the community that comes out of these spaces is another reason they remain so popular, with book signings and book clubs adding value for readers.
Woolnough hopes to promote indie authors as much as possible, with plenty of local authors available.
Local authors stocked at the shop include K.E. Barden, Lynise Reid, Millie St Graves, Asha Rose, Tania Joyce, and Nicole Rowles. Mia K. Rose’s signing for her latest novel From The Cold was held at the shop.
“I want to focus on indie authors and give them the chance to spread their wings,” Woolnough said.
“I wanted space to be able to have a couch and have people sit and do their book clubs and do all the things and just come in and browse and buy a book or two or three.”
Wilson is confident there is a huge demand out there for what Woolnough is offering.
“Romance is a very broad church. There’s literally something for everybody in the genre. It doesn’t matter who you are, it doesn’t matter your background, there is something in there for everybody, which I think you can’t say about every genre.”
“I think genres are reflections of human psychology, and it’s easy to see why romance is so important. At the end of your life, when you’re laying there on your deathbed thinking about, what are my regrets or what are my happinesses from my life? It’s always about your relationships.
“It’s the genre of human relationships, and it’s the stuff that matters most deeply to us, which is why it’s the biggest and most popular genre, and the one that never goes away.”

Malaysian police smash sex ring charging US$900 a session in posh KL area
The suspected ringleader and salesmen are Chinese nationals while a Singaporean and Malaysian have been asked to assist in investigations
The “romps”, which were either a 45-minute or 90-minute session, were offered by a syndicate that supplied women from countries such as China and Japan.
The syndicate had been operating from the detached house in the upscale residential area of Desa Pahlawan for about six months.
However, their illicit activities came to an end when immigration officers raided the bungalow at about 12.30am on Thursday.
Forty foreigners, aged between 21 and 43, were arrested.
One of them was the “salesman”, tasked with sourcing clients through online platforms. Another was believed to be the mastermind of the operation. Both men are Chinese nationals.

War crimes committed in Sudan's El-Fasher

War crimes committed in Sudan's El-Fasher
The UN rights office on Friday accused Sudan's paramilitaries of war crimes and possible crimes against humanity during the capture of El-Fasher, saying some 6,000 were killed in just three days.
Since April 2023, the conflict between Sudan's army and the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces has killed tens of thousands, displaced 11 million and triggered what the UN calls one of the world's worst humanitarian crises.
During its final offensive in October, the RSF unleashed "a wave of intense violence... shocking in its scale and brutality" and amounting to war crimes and possible crimes against humanity, said a report from the UN Human Rights Office.
The report said the RSF and allied Arab militia carried out widespread attacks, including mass killings and summary executions, sexual violence, abductions for ransom, torture and ill-treatment, detention, disappearances, pillage and the use of children in hostilities.
In many cases, these were directed against civilians and people outside of combat based on their ethnicity or perceived affiliation, it said.
Based on interviews with over 140 victims and witnesses conducted in Sudan and eastern Chad in late 2025, the Human Rights Office said it documented more than 6,000 killings in the first three days of the RSF offensive.
It said that of those, at least 4,400 people were killed within El-Fasher, and over 1,600 others were killed as they fled along exit routes.
"The actual scale of the death toll during the week-long offensive is undoubtedly significantly higher," the office said.
The report voiced serious concerns over the fate of thousands of missing people.
"The unprecedented scale and brutality of the violence meted out during the offensive deeply compounded the horrific violations the residents of El-Fasher had already been subjected to during the long months of siege, constant hostilities and bombardment," said UN rights chief Volker Turk.
He said persistent impunity was fuelling the violence.
"There must be credible and impartial investigations to establish criminal responsibility, including of commanders and other superiors," Turk said.
"These must lead to meaningful accountability for perpetrators of exceptionally serious crimes, through all available means."

First concert of “Cold Winter-2026: Kyiv and Seattle Together” project held at Kyiv’s Central Railway Station
This is according to an Ukrinform correspondent.
“This is a Ukrainian-American solidarity project. Our partners from Seattle initiated it. We are launching this project to warm Kyiv residents spiritually at Points of Invincibility,” said Herman Makarenko, head of the Kyiv Classic Orchestra and People’s Artist of Ukraine.
He noted that in 2024 the Kyiv Classic Orchestra gave a charity concert in Seattle, with the funds raised transferred to Okhmatdyt Children’s Hospital.
Makarenko has also recalled that the orchestra has been performing for Kyiv residents since March 2022. The first such concert in support of Ukrainians took place on Maidan Nezalezhnosti (Independence Square) on March 9, 2022, amid air-raid sirens and explosions.
According to the orchestra’s director, at least six concerts are planned in Kyiv by the end of February – at Points of Invincibility, at Okhmatdyt Hospital, and possibly in the Darnytskyi and Desnianskyi districts.
During Friday’s concert at the Central Railway Station, air-raid alerts were announced twice, forcing the musicians to stop playing. Nevertheless, the audience was able to hear music by Semen Hulak‑Artemovsky from the opera Zaporozhets beyond the Danube, the dance Kozachok, the famous Summertime from Porgy and Bess by George Gershwin, Jazz Legato by Leroy Anderson, and Libertango by Astor Piazzolla.
The program also included the Ukrainian folk song Oi na hori dva dubky, Chornobryvtsi by Volodymyr Vermenych, Shchedryk by Mykola Leontovych, Bozhe velykyi, yedynyi by Mykola Lysenko, and Oi u luzi chervona kalyna.
The musicians dedicated Melody by Myroslav Skoryk to the warriors who gave their lives for Ukraine.
The project is organized by The Humanity Funds and the Kyiv Classic Orchestra.
As previously reported, Ukrainians in Finland are also organizing a charity concert, with proceeds to be directed toward urgent humanitarian aid for Ukraine.

Mistrial declared in case of students charged after Stanford pro-Palestinian protests

WASHINGTON – A judge declared a mistrial on Feb 13 in a case of five current and former Stanford University students related to the 2024 pro-Palestinian protests
Twelve protesters were initially charged in 2025
The case was tried in Santa Clara County Superior Court against five defendants charged with felony vandalism and felony conspiracy to trespass. The rest previously accepted plea deals or diversion programmes.
The jury was deadlocked. It voted nine to three to convict on the felony charge of vandalism and eight to four to convict on the felony charge to trespass.
Jurors failed to reach a verdict after deliberations. The charges were among the most serious against participants in the 2024 pro-Palestinian protest movement on US colleges in which demonstrators demanded an end to Israel’s war in Gaza and Washington’s support for its ally along with a divestment of funds by their universities from companies supporting Israel.
Prosecutors in the case said the defendants engaged in unlawful property destruction.
“This case is about a group of people who destroyed someone else’s property and caused hundreds of thousands of dollars in damage. That is against the law,” Santa Clara County District Attorney Jeff Rosen said in a statement, adding he sought a new trial.
Mr Anthony Brass, a lawyer for one of the protesters, told the New York Times his side was not defending lawlessness but “the concept of transparency and ethical investment”.
“This is a win for these young people of conscience and a win for free speech,” Mr Brass said, adding “humanitarian activism has no place in a criminal courtroom”.
Protesters had renamed the building “Dr Adnan’s Office” after Dr Adnan Al-Bursh, a Palestinian doctor who died in an Israeli prison after months of detention. Over 3,000 were arrested during the 2024 US pro-Palestinian protest movement, according to media tallies.
Some students faced suspension, expulsion and degree revocation. REUTERS

Ukraine war briefing: conflict could end if Russia economically or militarily ‘exhausted’, says Germany’s Merz

-
German chancellor Friedrich Merz has told the Munich Security Council Russia’s war against Ukraine will “only end when Russia is at least economically, potentially militarily, exhausted”. The German chancellor described the security gathering as a seismograph for the state of US-European relations. Merz said the Ukraine war “had forced Europe to return from a vacation from world history”.
-
With Russia’s war against Ukraine entering its fifth year, the conflict was high on the agenda at the security conference. French president Emmanuel Macron said any peace settlement must protect Ukraine, preserve European security and disincentivize Russia from attempting another invasion, while not providing the rest of the world with a “calamitous example to follow”. He said it was a “huge strategic mistake” to urge Ukraine to accept it was defeated. “One day Russians will have to reckon with the enormity of the crime committed in their name, with the futility of the pretexts and the devastating, longer term effects on their country, but until that time comes, we will not lower the guard.”
-
Several top European leaders were scheduled to meet at the conference with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy on Friday for talks about the conflict, the French presidency said. Macron said any peace deal between Ukraine and Russia had to involve Europe. “I want to be very clear: you can negotiate without the Europeans, if you prefer, but it will not bring a peace at the table.” A US official said secretary of state Marco Rubio was not attending those talks because of a packed schedule, but was “engaging on Russia-Ukraine in many of his meetings” in Munich. Ukraine’s foreign minister Andriy Sybiga said he discussed ending the Russian invasion of Ukraine with China’s foreign minister, Wang Yi, whose country is a close partner of Moscow. Wang told Sybiga Beijing was “willing to provide Ukraine with new humanitarian aid”, according to a Chinese foreign ministry readout.
-
Meanwhile, diplomatic negotiations on Ukraine will take place in Geneva on Tuesday, a source briefed on the matter told Reuters. A US delegation including envoys Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner will participate in trilateral talks with representatives from Russia and Ukraine in the afternoon, the source said.
-
Ukraine could hold elections if there was a two to three month ceasefire with Russia, said Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. Speaking at the Munich Security Conference Zelenskyy said he would be happy, in principle, to hold a poll “as quick as possible,” but said the war had to stop first, and Ukraine had to be given security guarantees. “If president Trump … pushes Putin [into a] ceasefire [that will last for] two, three months, we will do elections.” Zelenskyy also said Trump wanted to agree on a peace deal “all at once,” because he “like things in one big package,” like he did with his “one, big, beautiful bill”. But the Ukrainian president said the sequence of getting things agreed was important.
-
Zelenskyy said Russia’s territorial demands were about Moscow’s ambitions to get Ukraine, bit by bit, a point he has emphasised to the US. He said compromises had already been made by Ukraine. “We made a lot of compromises. Putin and his friends, they are not in prison. This is the biggest compromise that the world made already.” He said Ukraine “can’t forget” how many people were killed during the war, but he said Kyiv was ready to end it at any time.
-
Britain has said it would send another £540m worth of weapons to Ukraine, including spending £150m on buying US made interceptors, using a Nato-run funding scheme for the first time. The latest commitment came before a meeting of the 50 country Ukraine Contact Group, which coordinates international weapons supplies to Kyiv, immediately after the Nato defence ministers summit. Britain has not previously used Nato’s Prioritised Ukraine Requirements List (Purl) before. It was devised last year as a mechanism for European countries to buy US weapons for Ukraine, after the US said it would no longer donate them. The remaining £390m will be spent on supplying 1,000 Lightweight Multirole Missiles (LMMs), which are manufactured in Belfast, to urgently bolster Ukraine’s air defences, which are struggling against nightly onslaughts of Russian attacks.
-
A Ukrainian missile attack killed two people and injured five on Friday in the Russian city of Belgorod near the border, regional governor Vyacheslav Gladkov said. Gladkov, speaking in a video posted on Telegram, said the men were members of crews restoring damaged heating and electricity networks in the city. Restoration work will resume on Saturday as it was too dangerous for crews to be operating at night, Gladkov said.

NBA star Chris Paul 'steps away' from basketball at age 40

12:25:21 KST

Chris Paul, a 12-time NBA All-Star point guard, announced his retirement on Friday in a social media post after the 40-year-old American was released by the Toronto Raptors. "This is it! After 21 years I'm stepping away from basketball," Paul posted on Instagram after being dropped following his trade to Toronto by the Los Angeles Clippers last week. Paul has averaged 16.8 points, 9.2 assists, 4.4 rebounds and 2.0 steals a game over 1,370 career NBA games for New Orleans, Houston, Oklahoma City, Phoenix, Golden State, San Antonio and the Clippers.
The 2006 NBA Rookie of the Year was a two-time Olympic champion with the US squad of NBA stars, winning in 2008 at Beijing and 2012 in London. "After 21 remarkable seasons, Chris Paul retires as one of the greatest point guards in NBA history and a true steward of our sport," NBA commissioner Adam Silver said. "From the moment he entered the league, Chris distinguished himself with his savvy playmaking skills, elite competitiveness and intense work ethic."
Paul had played for four clubs in the past four years and decided it was time to retire after the Raptors released him. "As I write this, it's hard to really know what to feel, but for once – most people would be surprised – I don't have the answer lol!" Paul posted. "But, mostly I'm filled with so much joy and gratitude! While this chapter of being an 'NBA player' is done, the game of basketball will forever be ingrained in the DNA of my life. "I've been in the NBA for more than half of my life, spanning three decades. It's crazy even saying that!"
Paul, the NBA 2013 All-Star Game Most Valuable Player, stressed how much he simply enjoyed playing in the NBA. "Playing basketball for a living has been an unbelievable blessing that also came with lots of responsibility," Paul wrote. "I embraced it all. The good and the bad. "As a lifelong learner, leadership is hard and is not for the weak. Some will like you and many people won't. But the goal was always the goal, and my intentions were always sincere (Damn, I love competing!!)"
Paul never played on an NBA championship team, coming the closest in 2021 when, as a member of the Phoenix Suns, he reached the NBA Finals, only to lose to Milwaukee.
'Extraordinary career'
Paul had not played since December 1, the Clippers moving away from him after a 5-16 start but never releasing him and saving money under NBA salary cap rules in the trade. His career also included a stint as president of the National Basketball Players Association from 2013 to 2021, helping the union secure collective bargaining agreements with the league.
"He also poured enormous time and energy into his role as President of the Players Association -- offering thoughtful and principled perspectives to strengthen our game and our business," Silver said.
"His leadership on behalf of the players was essential in negotiating collective bargaining agreements, helping guide the league through a pandemic, addressing important societal issues and so much more. "On behalf of the NBA, I congratulate Chris on an extraordinary career and thank him for his friendship, partnership and lasting contributions to our game."

MUNICH, February 14. /TASS/. The United States believes that China will become its main strategic rival in this century, US Permanent Representative to NATO Matthew Whitaker told the Munich Security Conference.
"You know, we face a lot of challenge. I think it's an incredibly dangerous world right now. We have certainly an ascendant China that is going to be a strategic competitor of the United States for the next century," he said.
"How we respond to that is most likely to define where we end up as a country, and whether it's another century of America and and what we offer to the world, or whether it's a century of China and what they bring to the world," Whitaker added.

Dubai's DP World replaces chair amid Epstein revelations

Dubai's DP World replaces chair amid Epstein revelations
February 14, 2026A new chairman was announced for Dubai-based logistics firm DP World after the outgoing leader, Sultan Ahmed bin Sulayem's frequent correspondence with Jeffrey Epstein was revealed in the recently released files.
DP World is one of the world's largest logistics companies. It runs the Jebel Ali port in Dubai, where it has long been a pillar of the city's economy, and operates terminals in other ports around the world.
The emails referenced pornography, sexual massages and escorts, among other things.
A person's name being mentioned in the Epstein files does not necessarily imply any wrongdoing, however the nature of the correspondence has raised a number of questions.
DP World names new chair and CEO
"DP World announced the appointment of His Excellency Essa Kazim as Chairman of its Board of Directors and the appointment of Yuvraj Narayan as Group Chief Executive Officer," the group said in a statement published by the Dubai media office.
The statement did not specifically name Sultan Ahmed bin Sulayem, but DP World took down bin Sulayem's website biography shortly after the statement was released.
The former chair is cited thousands of times in documents released by the US Justice Department (DOJ) and the files revealed frequent correspondence with the convicted sex offender.
Epstein file fallout impacting business relations
On Wednesday, British government investment institution BII expressed shock at the stream of revelations and moved to suspend investments with DP World in light of the revelations.
However, on Friday, after DP World's change of leadership, a spokesperson said: "We welcome today's decision by DP World and look forward to continuing our partnership."
Canadian firm La Caisse also took the decision to suspend ties with DP World earlier this week but changed tack on Friday following bin Sulayem's replacement.
US lawmakers highlight 'torture video' reference
Two US lawmakers, meanwhile, have linked the Emirati business leader to an Epstein mail mentioning a torture video.
US lawmakers Thomas Massie and Ro Khanna had access to unredacted versions of the Epstein documents, and posted up a 2009 email exchange between Epstein and a redacted sender discussing a "torture video" on social media platform X.
Khanna later took to the House floor and read the names of six men whose names he said had been redacted, including bin Sulayem's.
Massie on Friday posted a tweet referencing bin Sulayem's resignation and said: "DOJ redacted information necessary to identify who sent Epstein the 'torture video email.' Ro Khanna and I first discovered his name and released it Monday. Today he resigns."
Epstein was found dead inside his prison cell while awaiting trial for trafficking children in what was ruled a suicide.

UN defends expert on Palestinian rights after European criticism
A UN human rights spokesperson expressed concern on Friday about attacks on independent UN experts after several European governments criticised the organisation's special rapporteur for Palestine, Francesca Albanese, and called for her resignation.
This follows condemnation from Germany, France and Italy this week of Albanese's alleged criticism of Israel. Albanese, an Italian lawyer, denies making the remarks.
"We are very worried. We are concerned that UN officials, independent experts and judicial officials, are increasingly subjected to personal attacks, threats and misinformation that distracts from the serious human rights issues," UN human rights office spokesperson Marta Hurtado told a press briefing when asked about the criticism.
UN experts are commissioned by the Geneva-based Human Rights Council to monitor and document specific human rights crises, but are independent of the organisation itself.
On Friday, the Czech Republic's Foreign Minister Petr Macinka quoted Albanese on X as having called Israel a "common enemy of humanity", and he also called for her resignation.
A transcript of Albanese's remarks made in Doha on 7 February, seen by Reuters, did not characterise Israel in this way, although she has consistently criticised the country in the past over the Gaza conflict.
German Foreign Minister Johann Wadephul said on Thursday that Albanese's position was "untenable", while French Foreign Minister Jean-Noel Barrot accused her of making "outrageous and reprehensible remarks" against Israel.
Albanese criticises Europeans over Gaza
Albanese said in overnight remarks on X: "Three European governments accuse me - based on statements I never made - with a virulence and conviction that they have NEVER used against those who have slaughtered 20,000+ children in 858 days."
She was citing figures from the Gaza Health Ministry, which puts the total death toll from the Gaza war at more than 72,000, the figure is presumed to be higher.
US President Donald Trump's administration imposed sanctions on Albanese after she wrote letters to US companies accusing them of contributing to gross human rights violations by Israel in Gaza and the West Bank.
Albanese, whose term expires in 2028, is due to speak at the Rights Council in Geneva next month on Palestinian rights.
There is no precedent for removing a special rapporteur during their term, although diplomats said that states on the 47-member council could, in theory, propose a motion to do so.
However, they said strong support for Palestinian rights within the body means that such a motion was unlikely to pass.

Arundhati Roy ‘shocked’ by jury’s Gaza remarks, quits Berlin film festival
Jury chair Wim Wenders said filmmakers ‘have to stay out of politics’ when asked about German support for Israel’s genocidal war in Gaza.
Indian author Arundhati Roy has announced that she is withdrawing from the Berlin International Film Festival after what she described as “unconscionable statements” by its jury members about Israel’s genocidal war on Gaza.
Writing in India’s The Wire newspaper, Roy said she found recent remarks from members of the Berlinale jury, including its chair, acclaimed director Wim Wenders, that “art should not be political” to be “jaw-dropping”.

“It is a way of shutting down a conversation about a crime against humanity even as it unfolds before us in real time,” wrote Roy, the author of novels and nonfiction, including The God of Small Things.
“I am shocked and disgusted,” Roy wrote, adding that she believed “artists, writers and filmmakers should be doing everything in their power to stop” the war in Gaza.
“Let me say this clearly: what has happened in Gaza, what continues to happen, is a genocide of the Palestinian people by the State of Israel,” she wrote.
The war is “supported and funded by the governments of the United States and Germany, as well as several other countries in Europe, which makes them complicit in the crime,” she added.
During a panel to launch the festival on Thursday, a journalist asked the jury members for their views on the German government’s “support of the genocide in Gaza” and the “selective treatment of human rights” issues.
German filmmaker Wim Wenders, who is the chair of the festival’s seven-member jury, responded, saying that filmmakers “have to stay out of politics”.
“If we made movies that are dedicatedly political, we enter the field of politics. But we are the counterweight to politics. We are the opposite of politics. We have to do the work of people and not the work of politicians,” Wenders said.
Polish film producer Ewa Puszczynska, another jury member, said she thought it was “a bit unfair” to pose this question, saying that filmmakers “cannot be responsible” for whether governments support Israel or Palestine.
“There are many other wars where genocide is committed and we do not talk about that,” Puszczynska added.
Roy had been due to participate in the festival, which runs from February 12 to 22, after her 1989 film, In Which Annie Gives It Those Ones, was selected to be screened in the Classics section.
Germany, which is one of the biggest exporters of weapons to Israel, after the US, has introduced harsh measures to prevent people from speaking out in solidarity with Palestinians.
In 2024, more than 500 international artists, filmmakers, writers and culture workers called on creatives to stop working with German-funded cultural institutions over what they described as “McCarthyist policies that suppress freedom of expression, specifically expressions of solidarity with Palestine”.
“Cultural institutions are surveilling social media, petitions, open letters and public statements for expressions of solidarity with Palestine in order to weed out cultural workers who do not echo Germany’s unequivocal support of Israel,” organisers of the initiative said.

US Homeland Security faces shutdown as lawmakers clash over border enforcement

US lawmakers have remained locked in a standoff over immigration enforcement funding, putting the Department of Homeland Security at risk of a partial government shutdown beginning Saturday.
The funding lapse would take effect after midnight on Friday if Congress fails to reach an agreement.
"For weeks, we've been pushing commonsense reforms," Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer said ahead of the deadline.
White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt blamed Democrats, telling Fox News that "Democrats are barreling our government towards another shutdown for political and partisan reasons."
Democrats have refused to approve additional funding for DHS without changes to the way Immigration and Customs Enforcement carry out operations.
They are demanding limits on patrols, a ban on agents wearing facemasks during enforcement actions and a requirement for judicial warrants before entering private property.
"Donald Trump and Republicans have decided that they have zero interest in getting ICE under control," House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries said. "Dramatic changes are needed."
Democratic opposition intensified after the January deaths of two US citizens, Renee Good and Alex Pretti, who were shot and killed by federal agents in Minneapolis during protests linked to deportation operations.
"Democrats will not support a blank check for chaos," Schumer said.
Democratic votes needed
Even if all 53 Republican senators support the bill, Senate rules require 60 votes to advance it, meaning at least seven Democrats would need to back the measure.
Senate Majority Leader John Thune described the White House proposal as "an extremely serious offer" but acknowledged Democrats would not secure their full list of demands.
"Half-measures will not cut it," said Democratic Senator Patty Murray.
If no agreement is reached, thousands of federal workers could be furloughed, while others would be required to work without pay until funding is restored.
ICE would continue operating using previously approved funds, but other agencies could be affected.
The Federal Emergency Management Agency and the Transportation Security Administration have warned of disruptions, including longer airport wait times.
The shutdown would mark the third of Trump's second term.

Can German stealth cargo gliders boost Japan’s remote island defence and logistics?
The HADIS system can deliver cargo of up to 500kg over a range of 120km and safeguard transport aircraft during resupply operations
Munich-based Hensoldt said on February 5 that it had marked a milestone in the development of its High-Altitude Drop Infiltrating System, or HADIS, after releasing a scale version of the uncrewed vehicle from a transport aircraft during trials last autumn.
HADIS is an uncrewed, autonomous, disposable, remotely operated carrier system designed to be released from a transport aircraft to deliver cargo – everything that a military unit would require, from medical equipment to munitions – to troops on the ground.
The glider can be steered remotely, is silent and therefore difficult to detect because it has no engine and can more accurately deliver cargoes over further distances.
Tests have shown that while a conventional parachute drop can typically deliver supplies to a distance of 50km (30 miles) from the point of release and cannot be guided, the HADIS system can accurately transport cargo of up to 500kg (1,100lbs) over a range of 120km.
The ability to launch HADIS a long way behind the front line also helps protect the relatively slow and less well-defended cargo aircraft that are tasked with carrying out resupply operations.

BRUSSELS — Sometimes it is the answers politicians decline to give that are the most revealing — like whether it’s still possible, after clashing bitterly over the fate of Greenland, for a European leader to trust Donald Trump.
“I don’t do that kind of judgment,” Sweden’s Prime Minister Ulf Kristersson said in an interview with POLITICO, when asked directly if he can trust the U.S. president. “The discussion we had on Greenland and Denmark was a bad one.”
But European leaders, he believes, took the decision to “stand up” for their values and for European integrity in the face of Trump’s aggression — and it worked. “We protected European interests, Danish interests, broader European interests as well. And we did that very clearly.”

Azerbaijani president hopes for eternal peace with Armenia

BAKU, February 14. /TASS/. Azerbaijani President Ilham Aliyev expressed hope that his country’s peace with Armenia will last forever.
"The signing of this historic document at the White House, in the presence of the President of the United States, means that the conflict is over and that we have entered a period of peace, which I hope will last forever," the state-run AZERTAC news agency quoted Aliyev as saying in an interview with France 24 TV channel in Munich.
The president emphasized that more than six months after the signing, the situation on the Armenian-Azerbaijani border is calm. "We have a very quiet situation on the border with Armenia. No more shootings, no victims, no wounded," he said.
He also said that Azerbaijan unilaterally lifted its restrictions on transit of goods to Armenia, and began delivering critically important oil products to the republic, which de-facto means the launch of bilateral trade.
At the same time, he ruled out the possibility of signing a peace treaty between Baku and Yerevan as long as Armenia’s constitution contains territorial claims to Azerbaijan. He named it as the only obstacle to peace, adding that Armenia plans to hold a referendum on the matter.
Following the August 8, 2025, trilateral meeting with US President Donald Trump, Armenian Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan and Aliyev signed a joint declaration on the establishment of peace between Baku and Yerevan and on improving connectivity between the main part of Azerbaijan and its Nakhchivan autonomy through Armenia. The project was named the "Trump Route for International Peace and Prosperity."

A lawsuit seeks to stop Trump's overhaul of a 100-year-old public golf course in Washington
Two golfers in Washington, D.C., have sued the federal government to try to prevent the Trump administration from overhauling a more than 100-year-old public golf course

Two golfers in Washington, D.C., sued the federal government on Friday to try to prevent the Trump administration from overhauling a more than 100-year-old public golf course, accusing the administration of violating environmental laws and polluting a park that is on the National Register of Historic Places.
The suit is the latest in a series of legal battles challenging President Donald Trump's extraordinary efforts to put his mark on public spaces in the nation's capitol, including shuttering the Kennedy Center.
At the end of last year, a group of preservationists filed a similar lawsuit seeking to prevent the administration from demolishing the East Wing of the White House in order to build a ballroom — a project slated to cost $400.
Trump, who is an avid golfer himself, also plans on renovating a military golf course just outside of Washington that has been used by past presidents going back decades.
The complaint filed against the Department of the Interior on Friday says that the Trump administration's reconstruction of East Potomac Park — which includes the East Potomac Golf Course — would violate the congressional act that created the park in 1897. The roughly 130-year-old act established the park for the “recreation and the pleasure of the people."
The golf course, which has since been recognized on the National Register of Historic Places in part for its efforts to racially integrate in the 1940s. Municipal golf courses make up only 18% of courses in America.
"East Potomac Golf Links is a testament to what’s possible with public land and why public spaces matter," said Washington resident and plaintiff Dave Roberts. “It deserves better than becoming a dumping ground for waste and yet another private playground for the privileged and powerful.”
The lawsuit came after the Trump administration in December ended a lease agreement the nonprofit National Links Trust held for East Potomac and two other golf courses in Washington. The Interior Department said it did so because the nonprofit hadn't implemented required capital improvements and failed to meet the terms of the lease.
The Interior Department press office said in an email Friday that it doesn’t comment on pending litigation.
However, it said it would “ensure these courses are safe, beautiful, open, affordable, enjoyable and accessible for people visiting the greatest capital city in the world which is in line with President Trump’s agenda.”
The White House also didn't respond to an emailed request for comment on Friday evening.
Construction on the East Potomac course has already begun, according to the lawsuit. In October, the National Parks Service began dumping debris from the demolition of the East Wing of the White House onto the golf course, the complaint said, raising concerns that the materials could contain contaminants that could pollute the air.
As a result, the plaintiffs argued, the administration of also violated the National Environmental Policy Act by failing to consider the harmful environmental impacts of the project.
The National Links Trust said in December they were “devastated” by the decision to terminate the lease and defended their management of the courses.
They said $8.5 million had gone toward capital improvements at the courses and that rounds played and revenue had more than doubled in their tenure managing the courses. They also added that the termination of the lease jeopardized hundreds of local jobs.
The nonprofit has agreed to keep managing the courses for the time being, but long-term renovations will stop.
The first 18 holes of the East Potomac Park Golf Course were built from 1918 to 1923.

Prime Minister Carney and Canada's main opposition leader hold hands during school shooting vigil

Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney and the country’s main opposition leader held hands Friday as they paid tribute to the victims of one of the worst mass shootings in the country’s history at a vigil in a devastated British Columbia town.
Carney and Opposition Conservative leader Pierre Poilievre joined hands as an Indigenous leader sang a prayer outside the town hall in Tumbler Ridge.
Carney and Poilievre also spoke. The prime minister named each of the six people killed at Tumbler Ridge Secondary School and said the mother and brother of the shooter who were killed also “deserve to be mourned.”
Authorities said the 18-year-old alleged shooter, identified as Jesse Van Rootselaar, killed her 39-year-old mother, Jennifer Jacobs, and 11-year-old stepbrother, Emmett Jacobs, in their home on Tuesday before heading to the nearby Tumbler Ridge Secondary School and opening fire, killing five children and an educator before killing herself.
Carney said he sat with people who are “living through something no one should ever have to endure.”
“When you wake up tomorrow, and the world feels impossible, know that millions of Canadians are with you. When the cameras leave and the quiet sets in — know that we will still be here,” Carney said.
A crowd of hundreds attended the vigil. Some held photos of loved ones they lost.
Carney said the community has always been defined by people caring for each other.
“And when the unimaginable happened on Tuesday, you were there again. First responders at the school within two minutes. Teachers shielding their children,” he said.
Poilievre commended Carney for his “tremendous grace.” Canada’s political leaders flew from Ottawa together.
British Columbia Premier David Eby said the students of the school won’t ever have to return to the building if they don’t want to.
“I will promise that not one of you will ever be forced to go back to that school. We will provide a safe place for you to go back to school,” Eby said.
Authorities on Thursday identified those killed at the school as Kylie Smith, Abel Mwansa, Zoey Benoit and Ticaria Lampert, all age 12, as well as 13-year-old Ezekiel Schofield and assistant teacher Shannda Aviugana-Durand, 39.
Maya Gebala, 12, who was wounded in the head and neck, and Paige Hoekstra, 19, who also suffered bullet wounds, remain hospitalized in Vancouver.
Dwayne McDonald, the deputy commissioner of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police in British Columbia, said earlier Friday that the alleged shooter did not appear to be searching for a specific target at the school.
“This suspect was, for lack of a better term, hunting,” McDonald said. “They were prepared and engaging anybody and everybody they could come in contact with.”
McDonald described a “chaotic” scene at the school when police arrived, with fire alarms sounding and a person yelling out a window that the suspect was upstairs.
“They entered the school, proceeded to go up the stairwell, and were met with gunfire,” he said. “It was a matter of seconds after that there was more gunfire, not as we know now, having reviewed video, directed at any persons. Then the suspect took their life.”
McDonald said from the time the suspect encountered police there were no further injuries to students at the school.
Four guns were seized, two from the family home and two from the school, he said.
The attack was Canada’s deadliest since 2020, when a gunman in Nova Scotia killed 13 people and set fires that left another nine dead.
School shootings are rare in Canada, which has strict gun-control laws. The government has responded to previous mass shootings with gun-control measures, including a recently broadened ban on all guns it considers assault weapons.

US readying for potential weeks-long military campaign against Iran — sources
American official says strikes could target Iranian state and security facilities, not just nuclear sites; adds that US fully expects Iran to retaliate, leading to back-and-forth attacks
WASHINGTON (Reuters) — The US military is preparing for the possibility of sustained, weeks-long operations against Iran if President Donald Trump orders an attack, two US officials told Reuters, in what could become a far more serious conflict than previously seen between the countries.
The disclosure by the officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity due to the sensitive nature of the planning, raises the stakes for the diplomacy underway between the United States and Iran.
US and Iranian diplomats held talks in Oman last week in an effort to revive diplomacy over Tehran’s nuclear program, after Trump amassed military forces in the region, raising fears of new military action.
US officials said on Friday the Pentagon was sending an additional aircraft carrier to the Middle East, adding thousands more troops along with fighter aircraft, guided-missile destroyers and other firepower capable of waging attacks and defending against them.
Trump, speaking to US troops on Friday at a base in North Carolina, said it had “been difficult to make a deal” with Iran.
“Sometimes you have to have fear. That’s the only thing that really will get the situation taken care of,” Trump said.
Asked for comment on the preparations for a potentially sustained US military operation, White House spokesperson Anna Kelly said: “President Trump has all options on the table with regard to Iran.”
“He listens to a variety of perspectives on any given issue, but makes the final decision based on what is best for our country and national security,” Kelly said.
The Pentagon declined to comment.
The United States sent two aircraft carriers to the region last year, when it carried out strikes against Iranian nuclear sites.
However, June’s “Midnight Hammer” operation was essentially a one-off US attack, with stealth bombers flying from the United States to strike Iranian nuclear facilities. Iran staged a very limited retaliatory strike on a US base in Qatar.
Risks increasing
The planning underway this time is more complex, the officials said.
In a sustained campaign, the US military could hit Iranian state and security facilities, not just nuclear infrastructure, one of the officials said. The official declined to provide specific detail.
Experts say the risks to US forces would be far greater in such an operation against Iran, which boasts a formidable arsenal of missiles. Retaliatory Iranian strikes also increase the risk of a regional conflict.
The same official said the United States fully expected Iran to retaliate, leading to back-and-forth strikes and reprisals over a period of time.
The White House and Pentagon did not respond to questions about the risks of retaliation or regional conflict.
Trump has repeatedly threatened to bomb Iran over its nuclear and ballistic missile programs and crushing of internal dissent. On Thursday, he warned the alternative to a diplomatic solution would “be very traumatic, very traumatic.”
Iran’s Revolutionary Guards have warned that in case of strikes on Iranian territory, they could retaliate against any US military base.
The US maintains bases throughout the Middle East, including in Jordan, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Bahrain, the United Arab Emirates and Turkey.
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu met Trump for talks in Washington on Wednesday, saying that if an agreement with Iran were reached, “it must include the elements that are vital to Israel.”
Iran has said it is prepared to discuss curbs on its nuclear program in exchange for lifting sanctions, but has ruled out linking the issue to missiles.

Mistrial declared in case of students charged after Stanford pro-Palestinian protests
A judge declared a mistrial on Friday in a case of five current and former Stanford University students related to the 2024 pro-Palestinian protests when demonstrators barricaded themselves inside the school president's office.
Twelve protesters were initially charged last year with felony vandalism, according to prosecutors who said at least one suspect entered the building by breaking a window. Police arrested 13 people in June 2024, in relation to the incident and the university said the building underwent "extensive" damage.
Five defendants were charged with felony vandalism and felony conspiracy to trespass. The rest previously accepted plea deals or diversion programs.
The deadlocked jury voted nine to three to convict on the felony charge of vandalism and eight to four to convict on the felony charge of trespass. Jurors failed to reach a verdict after deliberations.
Charges were among the most serious against participants in the 2024 pro-Palestinian protest movement on U.S. colleges, in which demonstrators demanded an end to Israel's war in Gaza and Washington's support for its ally, along with a divestment of funds by their universities from companies supporting Israel.
Prosecutors said the defendants engaged in unlawful property destruction.
"This case is about a group of people who destroyed someone else's property and caused hundreds of thousands of dollars in damage. That is against the law," the Santa Clara County District Attorney said in a statement, adding he sought a new trial.
A lawyer for one of the protesters told the New York Times his side was not defending lawlessness but "the concept of transparency and ethical investment."
"This is a win for these young people of conscience and a win for free speech," Brass said, adding, "humanitarian activism has no place in a criminal courtroom."

Asked who he would like to see installed instead of the ayatollahs, Trump replied: "I don't want to talk about that. There are people."

Prosecutors said the pair were Islamist extremists who wanted to use automatic firearms to kill as many Jews as they could. U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer called the plot a "horrifying case."
"I want to thank law enforcement for bringing these vile cowards to justice and reassure our Jewish community that we will never relent in our fight against antisemitism and terror," he wrote on X.

'Terrorizing the civilian population' — At least 2 injured in Russian drone attack on Kyiv Oblast
Editor's note: This is a developing story and is being updated.
Russian forces launched a drone attack on Kyiv Oblast, injuring two people late on Feb. 13, officials reported.
The attack targeted the Vyshhorod district of Ukraine's national capital region, which is located on the northern outskirts of Kyiv. Regional Governor Mykola Kalashnyk reported that a man and a woman were hospitalized with injuries stemming from the attack.
"The enemy continues to terrorize the civilian population of the Kyiv Oblast," Kalashnyk said in a post on Telegram, adding that the the male injured victim sustained multiple shrapnel wounds to his upper limbs, face, and neck, while the woman suffered a bone fracture.
The attack caused a fire to break out at a home in the region, which was extinguished by emergency crews.
The full extent of the damage caused is being investigated, Kalashnyk said.
The latest attack on the capital region comes as Russia has intensified attacks on Kyiv and other Ukrainian cities over the course of the winter, targeting civilian and energy infrastructure across the capital.
The attacks have severely damaged the country's energy grid and forced it to impose lengthy blackouts amid freezing temperatures. Many Kyiv residents have been forced to suffer through heating outages as temperatures reached -20 degrees Celsius (-4 degrees Fahrenheit) in the past several weeks.
The renewed attacks on Ukraine's capital come as the United States intensifies diplomatic efforts aimed at brokering an end to Russia's war in Ukraine, which is nearing its fourth anniversary.
Despite months of negotiation and Russia's ongoing refusal to commit to ending to the war, on Feb. 13, U.S. President Donald Trump said Feb. 13 that President Volodymyr Zelensky needs to "get moving" to secure a peace deal with Russia.

The Kennedy curse: Assassinations, crashes, overdoses and the Jewish connection

“Reality surpasses all imagination,” the famous saying goes, and often it rings true. Just look at life since 2020. At least one family knows that all too well. For a change, we are not talking about the Kardashians or the British royal family, but about what might be considered their American counterpart: the Kennedys.
Since the mid-20th century, one of the most famous dynasties in the United States and around the world has made headlines time and again, almost always under tragic circumstances — assassinations, fatal accidents and even a lobotomy. The family is large. Irish Catholic by origin, many of its members had numerous children — Robert F. Kennedy, for example, died at 43 leaving behind 11 children — giving what some have grimly dubbed the serial killer named “Death” no shortage of potential victims.
Still, the scale of tragedy is hard to fathom. Of the nine children of family patriarch Joseph P. Kennedy Sr., four died unnatural deaths — two were assassinated and two were killed in plane crashes — and two others endured devastating life events, including a lobotomy and a near-fatal accident. The so-called curse spared neither children nor grandchildren, who fell victim to their own tragedies. Now, some say, it has reached the great-grandchildren.
Amid the grief, the family also produced compelling and influential figures — and more than a few romances, including that of John F. Kennedy Jr. and Carolyn Bessette, whose love story, too, was cut short. Tragically, their crash was only one episode in a chain of sorrow that has struck the family again and again.
Rosemary’s lobotomy
The Kennedy dramas began in the early 20th century. Joseph and Rose Kennedy married in 1914, launching the famed dynasty. They had nine children: Joseph Patrick Jr., John Fitzgerald, Rosemary, Kathleen, Eunice, Patricia, Robert Francis, Jean and Edward, known as Ted.
Joseph Kennedy entered politics and served as U.S. ambassador to Britain in the late 1930s. He was widely regarded as charismatic. Some biographers have also described him as antisemitic.
Those searching for the roots of the family’s “curse” often point to a tragedy the parents themselves set in motion. Their third child, Rosemary, was introverted and struggled academically. At 11, she was sent to a boarding school for children with intellectual disabilities. At 15, she moved to a convent school with a special tutor, her writing skills reportedly at a fourth-grade level.
In her early 20s, her condition deteriorated, according to her sister Eunice. Rosemary experienced violent mood swings, lashed out physically and suffered seizures. When suspicions arose that she was sexually active — possibly with more than one man — her father, unwilling to endure rumors and embarrassment, approved a lobotomy on doctors’ advice. The procedure, which severs connections to the brain’s frontal lobe, was performed in 1941, long before public awareness of mental health issues had evolved. Later assessments suggested Rosemary may have suffered from depression rather than an intellectual disability.
The operation left the 23-year-old unable to speak coherently, with cognitive abilities comparable to those of a toddler. She spent the rest of her life in institutions. According to reports, her mother did not visit her for 20 years and her father never did. The procedure became public knowledge only in 1987. Unlike many Kennedys who died young, Rosemary lived to 86, dying in 2005.
Though less known than other tragedies, Rosemary’s story marked the beginning of what many describe as an unending series of disasters.
Fatal flights and assassinations
The eldest son, Joseph Patrick Kennedy Jr., was expected to follow his father into politics and, perhaps, the presidency. Instead, he became the first sibling to die prematurely. In 1944, during a secret mission in World War II, his military aircraft exploded over the English Channel.
Four years later, Kathleen Kennedy died in a plane crash en route to a holiday with her fiancé. Years earlier, she had been widowed when her husband, the Marquess of Hartington, was killed by a sniper in Belgium less than a month after Joseph Jr.’s death.
The political assassination that shook the world
The family rose to political prominence in the early 1960s when John F. Kennedy was elected president, fulfilling his father’s ambitions.
The Democrat won the White House in 1960 and was preparing to seek reelection when, on Nov. 22, 1963, he was shot and killed while riding in an open car with his wife, Jacqueline, in Dallas.
The assassination became one of the defining moments in American history, spawning investigations, cultural works and conspiracy theories. Lee Harvey Oswald, the convicted gunman, was himself killed two days later by Jack Ruby, who died of cancer in 1967.
Earlier in 1963, Jacqueline Kennedy had lost the couple’s premature infant son, Patrick, who lived just 39 hours.
Before the decade ended, Americans — and the Kennedys — were shaken again. Robert F. Kennedy, known as Bobby, was assassinated on June 5, 1968, while running for president. He was shot by Sirhan Sirhan, a 24-year-old Palestinian Christian immigrant from Jerusalem.
The motives for the assassination remain unclear. Sirhan initially said he acted in response to Kennedy’s support for Israel during the Six-Day War, but later changed his account, claiming he had “acted unconsciously, possibly as a result of hypnotic brainwashing.”
He was sentenced to death in 1969, but his sentence was commuted to life in prison, where he remains. In 2021, a parole board recommended his release, but California Gov. Gavin Newsom rejected the decision. Sirhan, now 81, is expected to be eligible to seek parole again in 2027.
The brother linked to another woman’s death
After the assassinations of John and Robert, their brother Ted Kennedy remained in politics. In 1964, he survived a plane crash that killed an aide and the pilot, escaping with broken bones. In 1969, he drove off a bridge on Chappaquiddick Island with passenger Mary Jo Kopechne. He escaped the submerged car but failed to save her.
He contacted police about 10 hours later, drawing intense criticism and allegations he had been drinking. He pleaded guilty to leaving the scene of an accident and received a suspended sentence. The incident effectively ended his presidential prospects, though he served in the Senate for 47 years.
There was even an unexpected Israeli connection: an alleged romance with Israeli businesswoman and former lawmaker Pnina Rosenblum. In her memoir, “The Road to the Dream,” she wrote: “He was dynamic, mischievous and a lover of women. We met in Washington, and I remember him arriving in his red Mustang with a bottle of wine. I even cooked him dinner — chops and steamed vegetables.”
Ted Kennedy died in 2009 at 77 of a brain tumor. In 2011, his daughter Kara Kennedy died of a heart attack at 51.
Bobby’s descendants: drugs, deadly trees and drowning
Robert F. Kennedy’s children and grandchildren also faced tragedy. His fourth son, David, struggled with drug addiction after witnessing his father’s assassination on television. In 1984, he died of a drug overdose in a hotel room. In 1997, another son, Michael, died in a skiing accident in Aspen, Colorado, after crashing into a tree.
In 2012, Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s ex-wife, Mary Richardson, died by suicide after years of battling addiction and depression. In 2019, Saoirse Kennedy Hill, a granddaughter of Robert F. Kennedy, died of an apparent overdose. Months later, Maeve Kennedy McKean and her 8-year-old son, Gideon, drowned after their canoe was swept away in the Chesapeake Bay.
The 'curse' spared not even the world’s sexiest man
In the 1980s and 1990s, John F. Kennedy Jr., the slain president’s son, became one of the family’s most prominent figures. A lawyer and magazine publisher, he was named People magazine’s “Sexiest Man Alive” in 1988.
In 1996, he married Carolyn Bessette, a former fashion publicist. They had been married just three years when their private plane, piloted by Kennedy himself, crashed into the Atlantic Ocean, likely due to spatial disorientation caused by heavy fog and darkness.
Kennedy, his wife and his sister-in-law, Lauren Bessette, were en route to the wedding of his cousin, Rory Kennedy, when they were killed. It later emerged that he had not completed all recommended flight training or accumulated the suggested number of flying hours.
'I have added another tragedy to our family'
The sad stories continue to this day. In December 2025, Tatiana Schlossberg, a granddaughter of President John F. Kennedy, who was assassinated in 1963, died at 35 — just one month after revealing she had terminal cancer.
In an essay published in The New Yorker, Schlossberg expressed deep sorrow at adding another tragedy to her family’s long history of loss. “All my life I tried to be good — to be a good student, a good sister and a good daughter, to protect my mother and never sadden or anger her,” she wrote. “Now I have added another tragedy to her life, to our family’s life, and there is nothing I can do to prevent it.”
While the Kennedy name no longer dominates headlines as it once did, many descendants remain public figures. Robert F. Kennedy Jr., son of the slain senator, is an attorney and political figure who serves as health secretary in President Donald Trump’s administration, despite his father having been a Democrat. His role, like much associated with Trump, has drawn criticism, including from relatives.
There are also younger stars in the extended family: actor Patrick Schwarzenegger is the son of Maria Shriver, a third-generation member of the Kennedy family, and her former husband, actor Arnold Schwarzenegger. Their daughter Katherine is married to actor Chris Pratt.
Are angry rabbis to blame for the 'curse'?
Over the years, many have wondered whether the Kennedys were truly under a curse. The theories have ranged from mystical to psychological — and as often happens, Jews have surfaced in some of them.
One claim suggested the family fell victim to a “Pulsa Denura,” a Kabbalistic curse. Journalist Yigal Raviv addressed the issue in 2013. In an interview with ynet, he said: “Joseph Kennedy was the U.S. ambassador in London at the start of World War II. Some biographies strongly claim that a group of Jewish rabbis in England placed a Pulsa Denura curse on him. Today, after what happened to Rabin, we know what that means. According to those rabbis, all the disasters that befell the Kennedy family were the result of that curse.”
Another theory holds that Joseph Kennedy was cursed by a rabbi because, during his tenure as ambassador in London, he refused to help Jews flee the Nazis. A lighter version claims Kennedy had a heated argument with a rabbi during a sea voyage, and that the rabbi, angered by the dispute, cursed his descendants at the end of the trip.
A more grounded explanation suggests the Kennedys were simply a competitive, risk-taking family, many of whose members lived under intense public scrutiny and pressure — a combination that often ends in tragedy.

Jailed Palestinian leader Barghouti's writings to be collected in new book
Writings and correspondence from jailed Palestinian leader Marwan Barghouti will be collected in a new book due out later this year, with his family expressing hope on Friday that it would give a new audience insight into his mindset.
Unbroken: In Pursuit of Freedom for Palestine will be published in November and feature "private letters to his family, letters to public figures, press interviews, public statements, important historical documents", and personal photos, according to publisher Penguin Random House's Vintage division.
It will also include excerpts from his previous book, 2011's 1000 Days in Solitary Confinement, which was previously only available in Arabic, Vintage said.
Sometimes called the "Mandela of Palestine" by his supporters, Marwan Barghouti, 66, was one of the leaders of the Second Intifada, the Palestinian uprising in the early 2000s, and is often cited as a possible successor to Palestinian president Mahmud Abbas.
In June 2004, an Israeli court sentenced him to five life sentences after finding him guilty of involvement in four anti-Israeli attacks that killed five people.
"We just want to raise the awareness about who he is, why is he important for the Palestinian cause," Arab Barghouti, who lives in the occupied West Bank, told AFP. "These are his writings so everyone can have access to them."
He added that his mother, Fadwa, who has campaigned for her husband's release over the years and wrote the book's introduction, also hoped the publication would broaden the reach of Marwan Barghouti's thoughts.
"She really wishes that people can hear from him and see what he thinks and see his writings, especially his grandchildren," Arab said.
The book's publication will come roughly a year after his family and supporters launched a new campaign to secure Barghouti's release, after his imprisonment caught US President Donald Trump's attention.
In an interview with Time magazine in October 2025, shortly after a US-brokered ceasefire went into effect in Gaza, Trump was asked if he thought Barghouti, as a potentially unifying Palestinian leader, should be released from prison.
Trump responded that he had previously been approached with that question and would be "making a decision" on the matter, but did not elaborate.
Though Arab Barghouti has not been allowed to speak to his father in three years, he said the elder Barghouti represents Palestinian unity and the best chance for a two-state solution between Israelis and Palestinians.

Share where risky oysters are from, authorities urged after food poisoning cases
Restaurants say demand has plunged amid calls for diners to avoid eating them raw as number of norovirus-related food poisoning cases rises
Some Hong Kong restaurant operators have urged authorities to clearly tell the public about the origins of problematic raw oysters following a spate of food poisoning cases, so that diners can make informed decisions in the lead-up to Lunar New Year, their peak business season.
Consumers are becoming increasingly wary about oysters, with some restaurants saying demand has plunged amid calls from health officials for diners to avoid consuming them raw as the number of norovirus-related food poisoning cases rises.
“Hong Kong people love eating oysters,” said Wilson Lau, director of an oyster restaurant in Yuen Long. “But some people may have just heard the news, do not comprehend the issue clearly and may even think all oysters are problematic. It will affect the business of many other restaurants.
“Therefore, when the government releases information, it should say clearly where the problematic oysters are from. It is now like we are tarred with the same brush [as outlets linked to problematic oysters].”
A number of restaurants told the South China Morning Post on Friday night that diners were choosing oysters sourced from European markets rather than from Asia after Korean imports were linked to 13 out of the 37 food poisoning cases between February 1 and 12.
But the Centre for Food Safety said on the same day that some patients had eaten more than one type of oyster from markets such as South Korea, Spain, France, Japan and Ireland.

Trump privately lashed out at Republicans who condemned racist video depicting the Obamas as apes, report claims
‘Praying it was fake because it’s the most racist thing I’ve seen out of this White House,’ Republican Senator Tim Scott said in reaction to the video

Donald Trump has privately lashed out at two Republican senators who condemned a racist video posted to the president’s Truth Social account last week depicting the Obamas as apes, according to a new report.
A video showing former President Barack Obama and former first lady Michelle Obama’s faces superimposed onto the bodies of dancing primates to the song “The Lion Sleeps Tonight” has received sharp backlash across the political aisle.
Even some of Trump’s supporters in Congress rebuked the video, which the White House claims a staffer “erroneously” posted on February 5. The clip was taken down several hours after it was shared.
“Praying it was fake because it’s the most racist thing I’ve seen out of this White House. The President should remove it,” Tim Scott of South Carolina, the only Black Republican senator, wrote on X in response.
Trump then complained to allies while at Mar-a-Lago last weekend about Scott, people familiar with the matter told CNN.
“The president felt he could’ve handled that matter privately,” a senior Trump administration official told the outlet.
The official added: “He was like, ‘We work together all the time. He didn’t need to comment publicly.’”
Senator Katie Britt from Alabama also denounced the racist video, writing on X last Friday, “This content was rightfully removed, should have never been posted to begin with, and is not who we are as a nation.”
One CNN source said Trump slammed Britt, throwing out expletives, and said she was dead to him.
Britt’s office called CNN’s reporting “fake news” and defended her relationship with the president.
“Senator Britt has a 100% voting record with President Trump and remains one of his strongest allies in the Senate,” her office told the outlet. “Any narrative suggesting otherwise is not only misleading, it is flat out false.”
The White House boasted about Trump’s “great respect” for “incredible ally” Britt, per CNN.
The Independent has reached out to the White House and the offices of Scott and Britt.
Trump has refused to apologize for the racist video, telling reporters on Air Force One on his way to Palm Beach, Florida, last Friday, “I didn’t make a mistake.” The president insisted he only saw the first part of the video about “voter fraud,” and not the end that depicted the Obamas as apes.
The start of the video promoted false claims that Trump lost the 2020 presidential election because of voter fraud.
“It was a very strong post in terms of voter fraud,” Trump told reporters last Friday, adding that no one on his team knew the clip depicting the Obamas as apes was at the end. The president said if his staff had looked, they “probably would’ve had the sense to take it down.”
Trump said that he spoke with Scott, telling reporters, “Tim is a great guy. He understood that a hundred percent.”
The president told reporters Thursday that the staffer the White House claims mistakenly posted the video has not been fired.

The race for Farrer, and a strange saga that left the Liberals in shock

The race for Farrer, and a strange saga that left the Liberals in shock
If new Coalition leader Angus Taylor cares to study his history, he might learn that weird consequences can erupt – and have done so, to the great shock of the Liberal Party – when the voters of the vast electorate of Farrer, about to be abandoned by Sussan Ley, are asked to choose a new member.
The last time things went crazy for the Liberal Party in Farrer was in 1984, and no Liberal who was around at the time is likely to have forgotten it.
The byelection in Farrer precipitated by Ley’s decision to quit parliament following her defeat as leader is guaranteed to be Taylor’s first political test, and it is shaping up as a bunfight.
The Liberal Party and the Nationals can be expected to field candidates, splitting the traditional conservative vote, a surging One Nation has announced it will enter the race, and at least one popular and battle-ready independent – Michelle Milthorpe, who came second to Ley at the last election – is already out of the blocks. It wouldn’t be surprising if Labor chose to stay out of the contest and watch the feathers fly from a distance.
Farrer, sprawling along the Murray River from the foothills of the Snowy Mountains to the South Australian border, has always been conservative territory.
After the electorate was founded in 1949, it spent a comfortable quarter-century in the hands of the Liberal Party’s Sir David Fairbairn, wealthy grazier and minister in every Liberal cabinet until 1972.
Liberal Wal Fife, a minister under Malcolm Fraser, then held the seat from 1975 to 1984, when his home town of Wagga was removed from the electorate in a redistribution, and he transferred to the seat of Hume – now held by Taylor.
The election for Farrer in 1984, then, was expected to be won handsomely by the Liberal candidate, the long-time mayor of Albury, John Roach.
A fellow named Tim Fischer was chosen to run for the Nationals, but his bumbling manner of speaking meant he wasn’t initially taken too seriously.
Roach was so confident that he happily swanned off for a trip to the Netherlands in the middle of the election campaign.
The reason remains astonishing.
In 1934, the citizens of Albury were credited with saving the crew of a KLM Royal Dutch Airline plane called the Uiver.
The plane became lost in a storm over the upper Murray during the London to Melbourne air race, an event followed keenly by people throughout the world.
With the situation growing ever more desperate, the Albury town engineer used the town’s electric lighting system to flash morse code into the night sky, hoping to catch the attention of the Uiver’s captain.
The local radio station’s announcer, Cleaver Bunton, went on air and called on everyone with a car to drive urgently to the racecourse and line up to create a makeshift landing strip lit with their headlights.
Amazingly, the Uiver, guided by the lights, landed safely. It became bogged, but the following morning, townsfolk dug it out and pushed it to solid ground. The plane took off and won the race by handicap.
It caused a world sensation.
Fifty years later, the Dutch government announced it would present a medal honouring the city of Albury.
Alderman John Roach, Albury mayor and Liberal candidate for Farrer, flew to the Netherlands to accept the honour, leaving behind the election campaign.
In Roach’s absence, Fischer turned out to be a very canny candidate for the Nationals.
He hurtled around the electorate, meeting voters during brief stops in every small town and district, earning the nickname Two Minute Tim.
He even hired a venerable plane, the Silver City, formerly the VIP aircraft used by BHP executives, loaded it with journalists – including me, as I was employed by the Albury Border Morning Mail at the time – and took his campaign to the air.
When Roach returned from the Netherlands, I met him at Albury airport, inquired about whether he’d enjoyed his overseas jaunt, and asked whether he realised he was about to lose his tilt for Farrer.
He wasn’t happy and, unsurprisingly, berated me for asking such an impudent question.
Sure enough, a few days later Fischer became the member for Farrer. He held it comfortably until 2001, when he retired and Ley won it back for the Liberal Party.
Angus Taylor, having been handed a particularly awkward byelection by Sussan Ley, the leader he defeated on Friday, might advise whoever is chosen as the Liberal candidate to check their travel diaries and cancel any trip west of the South Australian border or east of the upper Murray.

US strikes second alleged drug boat in a week, bringing death toll to 133

The US military’s Southern Command, which oversees operations in Latin America and the Caribbean, said it had carried out its second deadly boat strike this week. The command said the latest strike killed three suspected drug smugglers in the Caribbean on Friday.
“Intelligence confirmed the vessel was transiting along known narco-trafficking routes in the Caribbean and was engaged in narco-trafficking operations,” the Southern Command said in a statement. The command included a video of the strike with its announcement, which shows a boat traveling through the water as it explodes into flames after being hit with what looks like a missile.
The Southern Command and the Pentagon did not immediately return requests for additional information.
The Friday strike comes after the Southern Command announced a deadly attack on another boat in the eastern Pacific on Monday. That hit resulted in the deaths of two suspected drug smugglers, with one survivor.
Friday’s killings bring the death toll to at least 133 people in 39 strikes, according to Pentagon statements tallied by the Intercept. This appears to be the command’s first strike in the Caribbean since November; the vast majority of the most recent strikes have happened in the Pacific.
The legality of these boat strikes is under scrutiny, with legal experts saying the attacks amount to extrajudicial killings by the Pentagon with a complete lack of accountability.
“Those being killed by US military strikes at sea are denied any due process whatsoever,” reads an analysis published Friday by the Washington Office on Latin America, an advocacy organization. The Trump administration is “asserting and exercising an apparently unlimited license to kill people that the president deems to be terrorists”.
Earlier this month, Gen Francis L Donovan was sworn in as the new head of the Southern Command. Donovan took over after Alvin Holsey, a US navy admiral, chose to retire over reported disagreements over the boat-strike policy.
Friday’s strike in the Caribbean comes after the US launched an attack on the capital of Venezuela in early January, apprehending then-president Nicolás Maduro on alleged drug-trafficking charges. The Pentagon has framed its operations in the region as a campaign against “narco-terrorism”, but has provided scant evidence of coordinated drug-smuggling rings.

Young family pays $1.04 million for large inner south-east unit

By Caroline Zielinski
A fully renovated art deco house in the heart of St Kilda passed in at auction on Saturday after a bidding war between two parties.
The home at 27 Havelock Street, located in a quiet pocket just off popular Acland Street, featured three bedrooms, an entertainer’s kitchen with skylights and a private deck. It was guided at $1.4 million to $1.5 million.
Jellis Craig Port Phillip auctioneer Michael Hingston started the bidding at $1.4 million, which was soon met by the first bidder. As he was about to call the auction, a second bidder jumped in with a bid of $1,425,000.
The pair battled it out in increments of $25,000 until they hit the $1.5 million mark, after which the increments slowed to $10,000, $5000 and $2000. Hingston worked hard to get the property on the market at $1.65 million, but sought advice from the vendor when a final bid of $1,585,000 was placed.
There is no legal requirement for a vendor’s reserve to be in line with their property’s price guide.
The second bidder was then invited to enter negotiations with the vendor, which were ongoing at the time of publication.
The property was one of 828 scheduled to go to auction in Melbourne this week. By evening, Domain Group recorded a preliminary auction clearance rate of 68.4 per cent from 601 reported results throughout the week, while 72 auctions were withdrawn. Withdrawn auctions are counted as unsold properties when calculating the clearance rate.
Lead agent Katie Ryan said the 2026 market had “started stronger than it finished last year”.
“There’s plenty of buyers around and not enough properties on the market,” she said, adding that while the first interest rate rise has not yet had an impact, a subsequent rise could.
In Melbourne’s north-east, a local family secured the keys to a quirky, colourful house after placing the winning bid of $1,052,000.
The three-bedroom home at 2/178 Porter Road, Heidelberg Heights, featuring a pool and sustainable design elements like a rainwater tanks, was listed with a price guide of $920,000 to $980,000.
Ray White MacLeod lead agent Brett Schembri said the auction opened with a genuine bid of $950,000, with bids from three parties quickly surpassing the reserve price of $980,000.
“The bidding was strong, quick, not much hesitation,” he said. The buyer was a young, local family who “really appreciated the quality and effort the vendors had put into the home”.
The vendors, a retired couple, were moving overseas to be with family.
Schembri said the market has been interesting, but patchy. “We had four auctions this week, and all sold well under hammer,” he said.
Earlier, a young family paid $1.04 million for a unit with “house-like proportions” in Elwood in Melbourne’s inner south-east, outbidding two other parties.
The three-bedroom, two-bathroom unit at 13A/3 Wimbledon Avenue, Elwood, was guided at $1 million to $1.1 million, with a reserve price of $1.02 million. It featured a front courtyard and was within walking distance of Acland Street and the beach.
Belle Property St Kilda auctioneer and listing agent Will Johnson said bidding started at $980,000 and continued with a “fast back and forward in increments of mainly $5000”. Both underbidders were downsizers.
The vendor, also a family with two children, was selling the property to fund a renovation for a newly purchased house, he added.
Despite last week’s interest rate rise and fears of further rises, Johnson said he was seeing a lot of buyers with finance ready to go.
“There is plenty of activity in the market – a lot of things selling before auction,” he said.
In Malvern East, an investor paid $45,000 above the top end of the guide for an apartment needing renovation.
The unit at 7/245 Waverley Road, featuring two robed bedrooms and balconies overlooking gardens, was guided at $540,000 to $590,000, with a reserve of $580,000.
The bidding, which opened at $540,000, quickly reached the reserve price as five parties battled it out, said Nelson Alexander Kew listing agent Nick Whyte.
“We had four bidders still active within the last $15,000,” he said. The property sold under the hammer for $635,000 to an investor for “the future use of the family”.
“I imagine they will keep it as an investment for four to five years and then the children will reside there,” Whyte said.
He was confident the market was in good shape, especially in the first-home buyer demographic.
“To have five bidders [compete] for an apartment that needs to be renovated, [that has] a company share title and which wasn’t a straightforward sale in that respect, shows you there is good depth in that first-home buyer market.”

Rome Flynn repeats as NBA All-Star Celebrity Game MVP and Team Giannis wins 65-58
Rome Flynn repeated as MVP and Team Giannis beat Team Anthony 65-58 in the NBA All-Star Celebrity Game
- Bookmark
Rome Flynn earned MVP honors for the second straight year in the NBA All-Star Celebrity Game on Friday night, scoring 17 points to lead a team coached by Giannis Antetokounmpo to a 65-58 victory.
Actor-comedian Anthony Anderson coached the losing team, led by former 7-foot-6 NBA player Tacko Fall with 20 points.
The game brought basketball back to the Forum, home of the Los Angeles Lakers’ “Showtime” era until 1999, when they moved 10 miles away to downtown Los Angeles. Now, it has a different sponsor name under Los Angeles Clippers owner Steve Ballmer and is mostly used as a concert and entertainment venue.
K-pop made its debut at the game with boy group CORTIS performing at halftime.
Victor Wembanyama tossed up the opening tip between Team Giannis' Jenna Bandy and Team Anthony's Adrien Nunez, who got control, was fouled and missed his first throw.
Bandy was the only woman in either team's starting lineup.
Team Giannis had a huge advantage in the paint with Fall grabbing most of the rebounds. His dunk made it a one-point game in the third.
Chinese actor-singer Dylan Wang garnered the loudest screams of the night, especially after he scored back-to-back baskets in the first quarter for Team Giannis.
Two of the oldest guys on the court were Phoenix Suns owner Mat Ishbia (age 46) and Rick Schnall (50-something), who's part of the Charlotte Hornets ownership group. Schnall fouled Ishbia in the first quarter, and Ishbia hit the free throws in a throwback to his Michigan State playing days.
Los Angeles Chargers star Keenan Allen hit a long shot from the red, white and blue line that was worth 4 points for Team Anthony. It launched a flurry of points for the wide receiver in the second quarter and he finished with 18 points.
Mascots from the Hornets and Mavericks alternated as sixth men restricted to playing in the backcourt for a bit in the third quarter.
Sidelined since Jan. 23 with a calf strain, Antetokounmpo won’t be playing in the All-Star Game on Sunday.
But the two-time MVP was assisted by his brothers Thanasis and Alex on Friday. Another assistant was Los Angeles Dodgers shortstop Mookie Betts.
Former NBA player Jeremy Lin credited Betts for an inspiring halftime speech. “He definitely knows a lot about basketball,” Lin said.
The game marked the start of All-Star weekend, followed by the Rising Stars game down the street at Intuit Dome.

Florida couple arrested after pickleball match turns into a brawl
Sign up now: Get ST's newsletters delivered to your inbox
The beef began over a cardinal rule of pickleball: A Florida man accused his opponent of playing a shot in a restricted rectangle on the court known as the kitchen.
From there, the match between two husband-and-wife teams descended into an exchange of verbal insults and chaos on Feb 8 at Spruce Creek Country Club in Port Orange, Florida, about 19km south-west of Daytona Beach, Florida, authorities said.
Fists flew; a paddle was used as a weapon; and 20 people joined the fracas, according to the sheriff’s office in Volusia County, which charged the husband and wife from one of the teams with felony battery.
The melee was described in explicit detail in an arrest affidavit.
Three people were injured during the fight, one of whom was transported to a hospital to be treated for cuts and bruises on his face, wrote a deputy who responded to the club.
“All three stated they had been participating in a pickleball match and were assaulted by members of the opposing team,” wrote the deputy, Tiecha West.
The couple who instigated the fight fled the club for their gated condominium on the beach, about 19km away in Ponce Inlet, Florida, and were later arrested, according to the affidavit.
They were identified by the sheriff’s office as Anthony Sapienza, 63, and Julianne Sapienza, 51.
Anthony Sapienza was charged with two counts of felony battery on a person 65 years or older, and one count of aggravated battery causing bodily harm, which, if convicted, carry maximum sentences of five years in prison on the first charge and 15 years for aggravated battery.
Julianne Sapienza was charged with one count of felony battery on a person 65 years or older.
Mr Matthew W. Thompson, a lawyer for Anthony Sapienza, said in an e-mail on Feb 13 that his client had pleaded not guilty.
“There is far more to this story than what has been alleged, and we are confident that the facts will ultimately demonstrate his innocence,” Mr Thompson said. “We will vigorously defend him against these accusations.”
A lawyer for Julianne Sapienza did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Feb 13.
According to West, the match became heated when Anthony Sapienza accused his opponent of a rules violation.
“The ‘kitchen’ is the area extending seven feet from both sides of the net to each sideline and is restricted to prevent players from standing at the net and smashing the ball downward,” West wrote in the affidavit.
At one point during the match, Anthony Sapienza used a misogynistic vulgarity to describe his opponent’s wife, which her husband took exception to, the arrest affidavit said.
The situation reached a boil from there, according to the deputy, who said that the man told him that Anthony Sapienza “then approached him and punched him on the left side of the face and struck him with a pickleball paddle, causing significant bleeding”.
Pickleball paddles resemble those used in table tennis, only they are larger and heavier.
Sapienza continued punching the other man after both fell to the ground, the man’s wife told the deputy. The man was taken to a hospital and was expected to have permanent scarring from his injuries, West wrote.
When the man’s wife ran to check on her husband, Sapienza pushed her to the ground, investigators said.
Another man was punched in the nose by Sapienza after the man tried to pull Sapienza away, according to the affidavit, which said that man was 70 years old.
His nose was bleeding profusely, according to West, who said that Julianne Sapienza began yelling at the man and also punched him.
Matt Payne, the general manager of Spruce Creek Country Club, said in an interview on Feb 13 that many people had been seeking video of the brawl, but one did not exist.
He said that the couple who were arrested did not belong to the club, which has about 550 members, and that the match was part of a league from outside.
“They have been banned from the community for life,” he said. NYTIMES

3 dead as US launches new strike on suspected drug boat in Caribbean
The attack raises the death toll from the Trump administration’s strikes on ‘narcoterrorists’ in the Caribbean and Pacific to 133
The attack raises the death toll from the Trump administration’s strikes on alleged drug boats to 133 people in at least 38 attacks carried out since early September in the Caribbean Sea and eastern Pacific Ocean.
“Three narcoterrorists were killed during this action. No US military forces were harmed,” US Southern Command said in a statement on social media.
A video linked to the post shows a boat moving through the water before exploding in flames.
But his administration has offered little evidence to support its claims of killing “narcoterrorists”, prompting heated debate about the legality of the operations that have expanded from the Caribbean to the Pacific.

A serious safety incident at an oil refinery has prompted the Health Ministry to issue a directive to all medical institutions and emergency response bodies to inspect all air and oxygen canisters in their facilities, a ministry spokesperson announced on Friday.
Two women were declared dead after being found unresponsive in a lab at the Ashdod Refinery on Wednesday, and early reports suggested a malfunction in their oxygen suits. The Health Ministry stated that concerns were raised about potentially toxic substances in the oxygen cylinders.
According to the directive, all cylinders must be inspected to verify that the imprint on the cylinder body, the color, and the label indicating the contents are all consistent. The ministry emphasized that the supplier's identity must also be consistent.
Any cylinder that does not meet that requirement must be taken out of service and marked accordingly.
Additionally, all canisters from the company Salem Yaakov and Sons are to be taken out of service immediately. Health maintenance organizations are working to conduct a recall of canisters in use by home-ventilated patients and to provide alternatives.
United Hatzalah suspends use of all oxygen canisters
United Hatzalah has instructed all volunteers across Israel to temporarily suspend the use of their oxygen canisters following the directive on Friday, according to a United Hatzalah statement.
The statement stressed that this did not reflect any issue with United Hatzalah or first responders' use of oxygen tanks and that patient safety is always its paramount concern. The organization is complying with the most stringent medical standards.
United Hatzalah’s logistics and medical divisions are working to replace the canisters and supply approved alternative equipment.
The organization remains in communication with the Health Ministry as the review continues and operations are restored.

Israel's MMA Association celebrated a historic achievement as Yotam Glander won the first-ever gold medal for Israel's under-21 national team at the European Championships, in Belgrade, Serbia, according to a report by N12.
Competing in the 52 kg weight class, Glander's victory marked the third consecutive year he reached the finals of the European Championships.
In 2024, he won a silver medal in the under-18 division, followed by another silver medal in 2025 in the under-21 category.
N12 reported that Glander defeated his Spanish opponent in under a minute, using a rear-naked choke to take his victory.
Glander's gold win marked Israel's third medal of the championship, following earlier victories by Guy Priente and Alon Avital in the youth division. In total, Israel's teams earned 19 medals across all age groups.
Also representing the association and Israel at the competition were four Israeli international referees: Ofer Lider, Arkady Sechkovsky, Shai Ofir, and Roi Ben Shalom.
'Proud to represent the State of Israel'
Ido Priente, president of the Israel MMA Association and Glander's coach, stated, "This has been an unprecedented European Championship for Israel's teams this year. For the first time, we won three historic gold medals and a total of 19 medals, representing a significant improvement in both quantity and quality. This is undoubtedly the most successful competition in the association's history since its establishment.”
He continued, “There is no doubt that the present and future generation of MMA in Israel is flourishing. I would also like to thank Eric Kaplan and the ‘Eilat’ Association for their endless support of our activities. I am prouder than ever of Yotam's victory. I had no doubt he would win gold this year, and now we are already looking ahead to the World Championships.”
“We are always proud to represent the State of Israel around the world and will continue to do so with great pride."

US unclear on UNRWA future, jettisoning would leave black hole

Main donor US unclear on UNRWA future, jettisoning it would leave black hole, agency chief says
The United States is still not clear about how it sees the future role of the UN Palestinian refugee agency, its chief said on Friday, warning that jettisoning it would create a black hole similar to Iraq after 2003.
US President Donald Trump's administration has accused UNRWA staff of having links with the Palestinian group Hamas, allegations UNRWA has vigorously disputed.
Washington was long UNRWA's biggest donor, but froze funding in January 2024 after Israel accused about a dozen UNRWA staff of taking part in the deadly 7 October attacks.
"There is no definitive answer, because the interest of the US is also to be successful in this process and if you get rid of an agency like ours before you have an alternative, you are also creating a huge black hole," UNRWA head Philippe Lazzarini told Reuters on the sidelines of the Munich Security Conference.
"Remember what happened in Iraq in 2003 when the entire administration had been dismantled (following the US-led invasion). There was no alternative and people were left without any services," he said in an interview.
UNRWA has functioned for decades as the main international agency providing for the welfare of millions of Palestinian descendants of those who fled or were driven from homes during the war around Israel's 1948 founding.
Lazzarini, who leaves his post at the end of March, said UNRWA did not foresee any more cuts in the immediate term, and it continued to offer public health and education services that no one else was really providing.
He urged Gulf Arab countries to increase their support because their contribution did not match their strong expression of solidarity with Palestinian refugees.
Israel accuses UNRWA of bias, and the Israeli parliament passed a law in October 2024 banning the agency from operating in the country and prohibiting officials from having contact with it.

Elon Musk's xAI faces threat of NAACP lawsuit over air pollution from Mississippi data center

Elon Musk's xAI, which merged with SpaceX last week, is facing increased pressure from environmental and civil rights groups over pollution concerns, this time at the company's facility in Southaven, Mississippi.
On Friday, the Southern Environmental Law Center and Earthjustice, on behalf of the NAACP, sent a notice of intent to sue xAI and subsidiary MZX Tech LLC, saying the company's use of dozens of natural gas-burning turbines requires a federal permit, violates the Clean Air Act and harms nearby communities.
Pollution from the turbines, which xAI has also used in Memphis, Tennessee, for its Colossus 1 and Colossus 2 data centers, has been a major source of local contention for more than a year.
Plans for a third data center in Southaven, located about 20 miles from Memphis, were announced early this year, when Mississippi Republican Governor Tate Reeves said he expected the project to create "hundreds of permanent jobs throughout DeSoto County."
Launched by Musk in 2023, xAI is trying to compete with OpenAI, Anthropic and Google in the booming generative AI market. On Feb. 2, Musk said SpaceX, his rocket maker and defense contractor, acquired xAI in a deal that valued the combined entity at $1.25 trillion.
Musk is banking on the area in and around Memphis as the foundation of his AI ambitions, and he's been flouting environmental rules in order to develop as quickly as possible. Musk's social network X, formerly Twitter, is also owned by xAI, which created the Grok AI chatbot and image generator.
XAI is currently under a myriad of government investigations in Europe, Asia and the U.S. after Grok enabled users to easily create and share deepfake porn, including explicit imagery depicting child sexual abuse.
Last year, residents in the majority-Black community of Boxtown in South Memphis testified at public hearings about a stench in the air, and the impact of worsening smog on their health caused by xAI's use of natural gas turbines. Research by scientists at the University of Tennessee also found that xAI's turbine use added to air pollution woes in the area.
Environmental advocates, including the NAACP, had previously said they would sue to stop xAI's un-permitted use of the turbines in Memphis. But they stopped short of filing a legal complaint after Shelby County's health department allowed xAI to treat the turbines as temporary, non-road engines, and issued permits for their use.
At the federal level, the EPA recently clarified gray areas of the law and said these turbines can't be categorized as temporary non-road engines. Nonetheless, xAI has been using the turbines across state lines without obtaining federal permits.
XAI didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.
Noise pollution from the turbines has also been a source of local consternation. Jason Haley, a Southaven resident, told CNBC the turbines make headache-inducing noises around the clock that he can hear inside his home.
Haley is part of a group called Safe and Sound which documents the decibel levels, and is pressing local officials to stop xAI from making so much noise, especially overnight, with its turbines.
Mississippi officials will hold a public hearing, scheduled for Tuesday, for community members who wish to express their concerns about xAI's expansion plans in the area. The hearing will focus on whether the state should give xAI permission to install and run 41 permanent turbines at its Southaven facility, Mississippi Today previously reported.
Similar community dynamics are playing out across the U.S. as tech giants rush to construct massive data centers, which can strain local energy and water supply and cause prices to increase.
In November, Microsoft ended efforts to build a data center in Wisconsin due to the community's vocal opposition. Amazon also pulled out of plans for a data center in Arizona after community protests.
In terms of Musk's Southaven project, Patrick Anderson, a senior attorney with SELC, said xAI "has to follow the law, just like any other company."
"And when it flouts the Clean Air Act's bedrock protections against unpermitted emissions, it puts the health and welfare of ordinary citizens at risk," Anderson said in an email. "That's why we intend to hold xAI accountable here."
The Mississippi Department of Environmental Quality did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

Jet2 flight from Turkey to Britain diverted after mid-air brawl
Sign up now: Get ST's newsletters delivered to your inbox
BRUSSELS – A brawl broke out on a Jet2 flight from Turkey to Britain on Feb 12, forcing the pilot to land in Brussels and resulting in the removal of two passengers.
The fight, captured in dramatic videos shared widely on social media, happened in the air after the flight took off from Antalya, Turkey, en route to Manchester, England.
The plane was diverted to Brussels three hours into a roughly five-hour flight. Police boarded the plane in Brussels and removed two passengers, who are now banned from the airline for life, according to a statement from Jet2.
The statement attributed the fight to “the appalling behavior of two disruptive passengers”.
“We will also vigorously pursue them to recover the costs that we incurred as a result of this diversion,” the statement said.
“As a family friendly airline, we take a zero-tolerance approach to disruptive passenger behavior, and we are very sorry that other customers and our colleagues onboard had to experience this too.”
Jet2, a British budget airline, is no stranger to banning and fining those who cause in-air disruptions. In 2022, the airline billed two brothers £50,000 pounds (about S$86,230) and handed them a lifetime ban after their violent behavior reportedly led to a flight diversion.
And a couple was banned from flying with Jet2 in 2017 after a disagreement turned physical and also forced the flight to divert.
Incidents of so-called “air rage” rose in 2021, when passengers returned to the skies after an extended quarantine period during the Covid-19 pandemic.
According to the US Department of Transportation, the Federal Aviation Administration saw a 400 per cent increase in these types of mid-air outbursts from 2019 to 2025.
Ms Wendy Patrick, a prosecutor and behavioural expert, said in an e-mail that the cramped conditions on many modern airplanes leads to air rage developing quickly. In some cases, she said, the attempts of other passengers and flight crew to deescalate the situation can only make it worse.
Multiple passengers appeared to be involved in the brawl on Feb 12, with men and women of various ages crowding into the aisle of the plane. Punches were thrown, glasses were plucked off one man’s face and screams reverberated through the cabin.
At one point, according to the videos, a flight attendant stood on a seat and appealed to passengers to stop fighting as a man in front of her held another man in a headlock. NYTIMES

Developer pays $4.5m for unrenovated Federation house in Marrickville

By Robyn Willis
A waterfront apartment with uninterrupted views of the Sydney Opera House and Harbour Bridge sold for $3,705,000 on Saturday, with one half of the successful bidders – a couple – describing it as her “Valentine’s Day present”.
Auctioneer Scott Kennedy-Green opened bidding for the two-bedroom, two-bathroom apartment at 6/23 Waruda Street, Kirribilli at $3,150,000. It initially rose in increments of $50,000 before quickly slowing to $5000. A final $3000 bid sealed the deal.
Both the price guide and the reserve were $3.5 million.
Agent Nigel Mukhi from McGrath McMahons Point said all three bidders were couples looking to invest and eventually downsize into the apartment.
He said the vendors had kept the property, which is just a stone’s throw from the prime minister’s Sydney residence, Kirribilli House, as a “bolthole”, along with their home in Queensland, but had decided they no longer needed it.
Mukhi said the result was in keeping with prices elsewhere in the beautifully maintained art deco block.
“The apartment upstairs sold for $3.6 million last year, and it’s the same size. Anything I sell with views of both icons does well. In terms of what the view is worth, the value is $1.5 million to $2 million alone.”
The new owner of the property said the apartment overlooking Beulah Street Wharf provided “a $100 million view for a several million”.
The property was one of 1009 scheduled to go to auction in Sydney this week. By evening, Domain Group recorded a preliminary auction clearance rate of 69.8 per cent from 649 reported results throughout the week, while 127 auctions were withdrawn. Withdrawn auctions are counted as unsold properties when calculating the clearance rate.
In Strathfield, a young family bought their first home, paying $1.35 million for a three-bedroom townhouse at 4/523-527 Liverpool Road, Strathfield.
The property had a guide of $1.1 million and a reserve of $1.34 million. There is no legal requirement for a vendor’s reserve to be in line with their property’s price guide.
Agent Jesse Di Loreto from Richard Matthews Real Estate said the renovated townhouse had more than 400 inquiries, with six registered and active bidders on the day. In the end, it came down to the young family and a downsizing couple.
Di Loreto said he sold this property to the current vendors four years ago, but they were now looking to upgrade into a house. He said there were some concerns among buyers over the effects of the recent rate hike on this end of the market.
“It’s a bit more sensitive for anything under $1.5 million,” he said.
In Marrickville, a developer was the successful bidder for an unrenovated house, paying $4.5 million for the 727-square-metre site with dual access, beating out an underbidder with restoration plans.
The property at 16 Darley Street, Marrickville was being offered for the first time in 60 years and was marketed as an opportunity to renovate and restore or to redevelop.
The price guide for the property was $4 million while the reserve was $4.2 million.
McGrath Leichhardt agent Alexandra Stamatiou-Buda said the underbidder had plans to restore the single level, five-bedroom Federation home. Interest in the level site was strong, she said, with all six registered bidders active.
McGrath Real Estate managing director John McGrath acted as auctioneer for the sale. He had a longstanding connection to the family home and had dined there in the past.
Stamatiou-Buda said she was unsurprised by the interest in the level block, which was marketed with “dual frontage and superb potential”. It is also within walking distance of shops, cafes and transport hubs like the soon-to-be-completed Metro station.
“There’s strong interest in these properties,” she said. “The size and the quality – they don’t come around often.”
In nearby Dulwich Hill, four bidders registered for the auction of 35 Herbert Street, Dulwich Hill, a circa 1917 four-bedroom Californian bungalow that went under the hammer for $3.5 million.
It had a price guide of $3.2 million and a reserve of $3.5 million.
The bungalow has been updated and restored, maintaining many of its original features, including patterned ceilings and original timberwork, and is surrounded by a well-maintained garden.
Adrian William Real Estate agent Norman Tran said all bidders were owner-occupiers attracted by the character and condition of the house.
“The house was a testament to the owners, to how they have kept and restored the house,” he said.
All the bidders were from the inner west, looking to upgrade and enjoy access to local amenities.
“Dulwich Hill’s popularity is underpinned by the recent opening of the GreenWay,” Tran said. “It’s been a value add. The buyer was talking about it with the owner, telling them he cycles a lot so the GreenWay was a big drawcard.”
The GreenWay is a walking and cycling corridor.

Trump administration sues Harvard, accusing it of not cooperating on admissions probe
Justice Department alleges school ‘refused to produce pertinent data and documents,’ while university states that it’s being targeted for ‘refusing to surrender its independence’
The Trump administration sued Harvard University on Friday, accusing it of failing to comply with a federal investigation and seeking documents to determine whether the university had illegally considered race in its admissions process.
The move comes less than two weeks after US President Donald Trump said his administration was seeking $1 billion from Harvard to settle probes into school policies, after a news report that said Trump had dropped his demand for a payment from the Ivy League school.
A Harvard spokesperson said the university is committed to following the law and has been responding to the government’s inquiries in good faith.
“The university will continue to defend itself against these retaliatory actions which have been initiated simply because Harvard refused to surrender its independence or relinquish its constitutional rights in response to unlawful government overreach,” the spokesperson said.
Trump’s administration has been threatening to withhold federal funds from Harvard and several other universities over issues including pro-Palestinian protests against Israel since the Hamas-led October 7, 2023, attack that triggered the Gaza war, campus diversity and transgender policies.
The Justice Department said on Friday in a press release that Harvard had “repeatedly slow-walked the pace of production and refused to produce pertinent data and documents,” including admissions policies and correspondence related to banned diversity, equity and inclusion programs.
In the complaint filed in Boston federal court, Justice Department lawyers said the documents requested will help assess whether Harvard is complying with a 2023 decision by the US Supreme Court which said that race-conscious college admissions programs are unconstitutional.
The Justice Department said it brought the lawsuit “solely to compel Harvard to produce documents relating to any consideration of race in admission” and “does not accuse Harvard of any discriminatory conduct, nor does it seek monetary damages or the revocation of federal funding.”
The administration last year attempted to cancel hundreds of grants awarded to Harvard researchers on the grounds the school failed to do enough to address harassment of Jewish students on its campus, prompting Harvard to sue.
Trump’s attempts to freeze federal funds for Harvard have faced legal resistance and the two sides have failed to reach a deal thus far.

Fire at Havana oil refinery as Cuba’s fuel crisis deepens
A fire at a key fuel refinery in the capital comes amid Cuba’s mounting fuel emergency due to US-imposed restrictions.
A fire broke out at a key fuel processing plant in the Cuban capital Havana, threatening to exacerbate an energy crisis as the country struggles under an oil blockade imposed by the United States.
A large plume of smoke was seen rising above Havana Bay from the Nico Lopez refinery on Friday, drawing the attention of the capital’s residents before fading as fire crews fought to bring the situation under control.

Cuba’s Ministry of Energy and Mines said the fire, which erupted in a warehouse at the refinery, was eventually extinguished and that “the cause is under investigation”. There were no injuries and the fire did not spread to nearby areas, the ministry said in a post on social media.
“The workday at the Nico Lopez Refinery continues with complete normalcy,” the ministry said.
The location of the fire was close to where two oil tankers were moored in Havana’s harbour.
Cuba, which has been in a severe economic crisis for years, relied heavily on oil imports from Venezuela, which have been cut off since the abduction of the country’s leader Nicolas Maduro by United States forces last month.
US President Donald Trump has also threatened Cuba’s government and passed a recent executive order allowing for trade tariffs on any country that supplies oil to the island.
The country has seen widespread power outages due to the lack of fuel. Bus and train services have been cut, some hotels have closed, schools and universities have been restricted, and public sector workers are on a four-day work week. Staffing at hospitals was also cut back.
United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres warned last week of a humanitarian “collapse” in Cuba if its energy needs go unmet.
On Thursday, two Mexican navy vessels carrying more than 800 tonnes of humanitarian aid arrived in Havana, underscoring the nation’s growing need for humanitarian assistance amid the tightening US stranglehold on fuel.
Experts in maritime transport tracking told the AFP news agency that no foreign fuel or oil tankers have arrived in Cuba in weeks.
Cuba can only produce about one-third of its total fuel requirements.
Cuba’s Deputy Foreign Minister Carlos de Cossio accused the US of carrying out “massive punishment” against the Cuban people in a post on social media Friday.
Cuba requires imports of fuel and “the US is applying threats [and] coercive measures against any country that provides it”, the deputy minister said.
“Lack of fuel harms transportation, medical services, schooling, energy, production of food, the standard of living,” he said.
“Massive punishment is a crime,” he added.
Mexico’s President Claudia Sheinbaum has said her government seeks to “open the doors for dialogue to develop” between Cuba and the US and has criticised Washington’s oil restrictions as “unfair”.

Dozens of Australians diagnosed with tattoo-related vision loss

Dozens of Australians diagnosed with rare tattoo-related vision loss
When chef Nelize Pretorius felt her vision blurring — first one eye and then the other — it was initially brushed off as conjunctivitis.
But when the swab came back negative, her GP and hospital doctors struggled to understand what was making her eye inflammation progressively worse.
"I could hardly see," she said.
"I was losing my vision and nobody was able to tell me why."
The cause was nothing to do with the eye itself — instead it was due to a years-old tattoo on Ms Pretorius's back.
The condition, known as tattoo-associated uveitis, can lead to permanent vision loss, glaucoma, and patients requiring immunosuppressants for the rest of their life.
"You get a tattoo, and you think the risk is that you might regret it later in life," Ms Pretorius said.
"[The real risk is] you could potentially lose your vision."
While tattoo-associated uveitis was thought to be extremely rare, research published in the journal Clinical and Experimental Ophthalmology has documented 40 new cases of the condition in Australia — doubling the number of published cases detected around the world since 2010.
The research, undertaken by a team of Australians, suggests this complication, while still rare given the number of people who get tattoos, may be more common than we thought.
Experts are calling for more research to understand and try to limit the vision-threatening disease.
Eyes in the immune 'crossfire'
Josephine Richards, the ophthalmologist who treated Ms Pretorius is no stranger to immune diseases.
Working in the field of eye inflammation, she's seen plenty of cases of uveitis — a dangerous condition where immune mechanisms begin to damage the eye.
It can be a complication of autoimmune arthritis, and a number of other autoimmune diseases where the immune system mistakenly attacks a part of the body.
Early symptoms of uveitis include blurred vision, light sensitivity, pain, and — if it is left untreated — glaucoma, and permanent vision loss.
"We do not know why the eye gets caught in the crossfire," Dr Richards said.
"There is something about the immune reaction that targets the eye."
But in recent years, Dr Richards has seen a rise in cases of uveitis caused by injected tattoo ink — sometimes long after the tattoo was done.
Doctors can tell the uveitis is caused by a tattoo because it can look slightly raised and inflamed.
"I only became aware of it about four or five years ago, and then once I was aware of it, I had all these patients all of a sudden," she said.
And she wasn't the only eye doctor seeing this.
At a conference of ophthalmologists interested in eye inflammation, the specialists realised that many of them were being referred cases of young people with tattoos who had ended up with this same issue.
"So we said, 'OK, we better look at this and see if it's becoming more common.'
"And just since our last conference [in November 2025] we've got four more cases in Western Australia. Probably the other states have got more too."
In the recently published research, most cases of tattoo-associated uveitis needed to go on long-term treatment including immunosuppression, and only three of the patients had no vision loss throughout the treatment.
Ms Pretorius continues to use steroid eye drops, and has spent thousands of dollars on treatment. She remains in touch with Dr Richards to deal with regular flare-ups.
"What really worries us is that we're just not managing to get these people off the drugs," Dr Richards said.
"Usually with an immune disease, we treat for two years and then slowly wind back treatment and hope that the person's going to be OK off the treatment. But mostly we're not managing to wind back the treatment."
Why is this occurring?
While it is unknown exactly what causes some tattoos to produce this reaction, the new research offers some clues.
Of the people with tattoo-associated uveitis studied in the paper, it was mostly black ink tattoos that seemed to have caused the inflammation, but pink and red ink was also recorded in one case each.
In most of the cases it was also long after the tattoo had been completed, on average around a year or two, but in one case up to 35 years after the tattoo was done.
According to Dr Richards, some, but not all people, had their tattoos done overseas, including in Bali.
This makes it particularly difficult for researchers to work out what in the ink might cause this reaction.
"It is just so hard to find out what dye was used," she said.
Dr Richards said it was important to be able to identify why the dyes caused the reaction.
"I hope we will understand why it's happening and be able to identify what it is about the dyes that are triggering it and take those out of the mix," she said.
Despite the increase in cases appearing over the past few years, Nicole Carnt, a vision scientist at the University of Sydney not involved with the research, noted that it was still a rare condition given about 20–30 per cent of Australians have at least one tattoo.
"There's millions of people who have tattoos and don't have any problems," she said.
"So what is triggering this in some people?"
Both Dr Carnt and Dr Richards suggested genetic susceptibility and the microbiome might be involved.
Dr Richards said the condition looked very similar to an immune disease called sarcoidosis, where inflammatory cells clustered around the body in red swollen lumps.
"You can take a biopsy of an inflamed tattoo, and it looks almost the same as what you'd see in the chest with sarcoidosis," she said.
"With all immune diseases, there is some genetic predisposition — some way that your immune system deals with the world — and then you get exposed to something and that sets you off," she added.
Dr Richards noted that those with a familial risk of immune diseases like sarcoidosis might be more likely to have this tattoo-associated infection occur.
How to make tattoos safer
The researchers are well aware they are unlikely to convince people to stop getting inked, especially for a rare disease that may occur years down the track.
"So many people get tattooed, and I feel like it would be very hard to stop people from doing it," Dr Richards said.
Even Ms Pretorius wasn't sure if her younger self would be convinced.
"I don't know if 18-year-old Nelize would have listened but 33-year-old Nelize certainly would," she said.
Instead, Dr Richards hoped to focus on what in the inks might cause this, and trying to ensure it could be removed.
"If you were able to make it safer, that would be the best outcome for everybody."
Dr Carnt agreed, suggesting more research was needed to find out what was causing some people to be vulnerable but not others.
Dr Richard is also working on ensuring that more people, and their doctors, know about this disease, so they can be referred and treated faster.
"It wouldn't change the decision for many people. Some of my tattooed patients that are on immunosuppression still carry on having tattoos because that is so important to them," she said.
"But I would like people to at least know."
Despite having a condition that she jokes "sounds made up", Ms Pretorius feels lucky her situation isn't worse.
"I think that my case in particular, was one of the first cases that Dr Richards had in Perth," she said.
"It's just lucky that she knew about it because if she wasn't there on that day, I may still not know what the issue is.
"There's a few people [with tattoo-associated uveitis] that lost their vision permanently, so relatively speaking I came off pretty good."

U.S. women's curling team slides to victory over Canada in an Olympic first
The U.S. women's curling team was surprised to learn that their defeat of Canada on Friday marked an Olympic first.
"If that's true," Minneapolis native Taylor Anderson-Heide said after the 9-8 nailbiter, "I think we just played a really good game. They're No. 1 in the world."
Tara Peterson of Shoreview, Minnesota, chimed in: "It just always feels really good to beat (Canada skip) Rachel Homan. So any team to beat them, that's pretty impressive."
Until Friday, the American women had never beaten Canada — a perennial favorite that has medaled in every Winter Games since curling was added to the Olympics in 1998. The U.S. men beat the Canadians for the first time in the 2018 round-robin and again in the semifinals en route to their gold medal victory in Pyeongchang.
Canada's Team Homan has for years been considered the best in the world.
In Friday's match, the U.S. managed to capitalize on a few weak shots by Canada. After the win, the Americans walked together down the ice and back to their coaches, raising fists in triumph.
Peterson, like Anderson-Heide, couldn't help but add a qualifier to her response to questions from The Associated Press: "Apparently, we've never beat them in the Olympics before. That makes it just extra special."
This year's American women's curling team — like their Gen-Z men's counterparts — meld approachability with ambition. Alongside Anderson-Heide and Peterson, the team includes skip Tabitha Peterson, who's Tara's older sister, as well as cool-as-a-cucumber Cory Thiesse, who has already won a silver medal in the mixed doubles event. Aileen Geving, from Minnesota, is an alternate.
Three of them have jobs other than curling, and three are mothers to young children. Tara is a dentist, Tabitha a pharmacist and Thiesse a lab technician.
Tara gave birth to her son, Eddie, in September 2024 and a few months later, Tabitha had a daughter, Noelle. Geving had daughter Sienna following the 2018 Games.
"That's the cool thing about the sport of curling. Your average Joe is playing against Olympians and we're friends," Tara Peterson told CBS News Minnesota ahead of the Olympics. "And after the game we'll sit down, we have dinner. We have a beer. It's just a normal life."
Tabitha Peterson told CBS News Minnesota she thinks of the Olympics "as just another tournament."
"It's another competition. And try not to focus like, oh my God, we're at the Olympics," she said.
They have several matches left in the round-robin before the semifinals next Friday. The are 2-1 after Friday's match, with a win against Korea and loss to Sweden alongside the milestone.

Son of last shah urges international intervention in Iran
The exiled son of Iran's last shah renewed calls for international intervention to support the Iranian people on Friday, as the opposition figure urged Iranians at home and abroad to continue demonstrations against the Islamic Republic.
US-based Reza Pahlavi, who has not returned to his country since before the 1979 Iranian revolution that ousted the monarchy, said Iran needed an "equalising factor" to oust the clerical authorities, while speaking at the Munich Security Conference.
"I think a lot of Iranians inside and outside hope that an intervention that will neutralise the regime's instrument of repression will finally give us an opportunity for a final solution," he said.
"We are asking for a humanitarian intervention to prevent more innocent lives being killed in the process."
US President Donald Trump had threatened military intervention to support a wave of street protests that peaked in January and were met by a violent crackdown that rights groups say killed thousands.
Trump positioned a US aircraft carrier group in the Middle East and said on Friday he would soon send another, but has shifted his pressure on Iranian authorities to focus on making a deal on its nuclear programme.
Pahlavi said Trump "needs to convince the whole world" that he has given a "diplomatic effort the maximum chance", but that he thinks "President Trump realises that the Iranian people have been very clear in their ask for support, they actually believed in his promise of help is near".
"There's a lot at stake in terms of maintaining face vis-a-vis that expectation," he added during the conversation with CNN journalist Christiane Amanpour at the conference, a rare chance for him to speak at an international event.
He called for "intervention" that will "eliminate the most important stumbling block between them (the Iranian people) and liberation, which is the regime's mechanism of repression and its killing machine", as well as further economic sanctions and diplomatic pressure.
Fresh protests
These echoed demands listed in a call for protests on Saturday in Munich, Toronto and Los Angeles to "compel the international community to take urgent, practical steps in support of the Iranian people".
On Thursday, Pahlavi also urged Iranians inside the country to join in by chanting slogans from their homes and rooftops at 8PM on Saturday and Sunday.
Videos verified by AFP showed people in Iran this week chanting anti-government slogans despite the ongoing crackdown, as the clerical leadership celebrated the anniversary of the Islamic revolution.
According to the US-based Human Rights Activists News Agency, 7,005 people, mostly protesters, were killed in the crackdown, though rights groups warn the toll is likely far higher.
Pahlavi had encouraged Iranians to join the wave of protests, which Iranian authorities have said were hijacked by "terrorists" fuelled by their sworn enemies the United States and Israel.
Many protest chants had called for the monarchy's return, and Pahlavi, 65, has said he is ready to lead a democratic transition in the country.
The Iranian opposition remains divided, and Pahlavi has faced criticism for his support for Israel, making a highly publicised visit in 2023 that fractured an attempt to unify opposition camps. He has also never distanced himself from his father's autocratic rule.

MOSCOW, February 14. /TASS/. BRICS is not a military union and there are no plans to transform it into one, Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergey Ryabkov has told TASS.
"I would like to remind you that BRICS is not a military union and not a collective security organization with collective defense commitments. It has never been planned as such, and there are no plans to transform it for the purpose," he said.
"As far as the recent naval exercise in South Africa is concerned, BRICS members participated in it as sovereign nations. It was not a BRICS event," he added.
When asked whether BRICS can somehow safeguard commercial ships of its members from attacks, he said the group had no collective mechanisms for the purpose, "other than improving logistics and ensuring greater protection from sanctions."
"This is not the task that we have set for ourselves. This security needs to be ensured by other means," he added.

Trump news at a glance: Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez blasts president’s ‘age of authoritarianism’ at European conference
Democratic representative also condemns US capture of Nicolás Maduro, Trump’s threats to annex Greenland and US support for Israel’s war on Gaza – key US politics stories from Friday, 13 February at a glance
Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez has accused Donald Trump of tearing apart the transatlantic alliance with Europe and of seeking to introduce an “age of authoritarianism”, as she condemned his administration’s foreign policy in front of its allies’ top policymakers at the Munich security conference.
Speaking at a panel on populism on Friday, the New York representative outlined what she called an “alternative vision” for a leftwing US foreign policy, challenging the Trump administration’s shift to the right in front an audience of US allies who have grown increasingly wary of the US’s increasingly nationalist – and militaristic – global posture.
She also condemned the US capture of Venezuela’s Nicolás Maduro, Trump’s threats to annex Greenland and the US’s support for Israel’s war on Gaza.
“I think that, personally, the idea of completely unconditional aid, no matter what one does, does not make sense,” Ocasio-Cortez said during another panel discussion. “I think it enabled a genocide in Gaza, and I think that we have thousands of women and children dead … that was completely avoidable.”
Ocasio-Cortez also said that she and her fellow Democrats were calling for a return to a “rules-based order” without the “hypocrisies” of US foreign policy that have dominated the past and current administrations.

Can Pop Mart turn viral hits into lasting icons? Molly and Labubu offer the answer
As Labubu’s meteoric rise cools, Molly’s longevity highlights the challenge Pop Mart faces in turning hype into stable intellectual property
Around a decade ago, aboard a train winding through China’s landscape, Wang Ning, the founder and chairman of Beijing-founded international art toy brand Pop Mart, shared with designer Kenny Wong Shun-ming the story of his early attempts at entrepreneurship.
As a fresh graduate, Wang struggled to sell affordable men’s suits sourced from Yiwu in Zhejiang province, eastern China, experimenting with small-scale arbitrage and learning first-hand how difficult it was to connect products with consumers.
The experience, Wong recalled, shaped Wang’s later understanding that branding and emotional connection could matter as much as the product itself. He later described spotting a Michael Jackson poster bearing the words “This is it” while job-hunting – a moment that crystallised that insight.
“Wang soon registered China’s first trademark (of ‘This is it’) and launched a Michael Jackson exhibition; a success that taught him the transformative power of branding,” Wong, the designer of the much-beloved big-eyed and pouty-mouthed character Molly, said in an interview with the South China Morning Post.
The company philosophy that emerged from this early experience – building products around story, identity and emotional connection – is now being tested.
As secondary-market prices for Pop Mart’s breakout figure Labubu fall sharply and the company’s shares swing more than 40 per cent from last year’s peak, the enduring appeal of its Molly doll offers a counterpoint.

‘Uber drivers’: Why specialist nurses are spending hours ferrying patients across the state

‘Uber drivers’: Why specialist nurses are spending hours ferrying patients across the state
Frustrated health workers say their peers have become part-time “Uber drivers” ferrying patients to and from Melbourne because pockets of Victoria do not have dedicated adult detox facilities, sparking calls for an overhaul in the regions.
Ballarat Community Health staff say they clocked up more than 8000 kilometres and at least 110 hours driving clients back and forth between the regional city and detox facilities in Melbourne, Geelong and Bendigo late last year.
The trips – the equivalent of almost three weeks’ worth of patient outreach and care – were recorded in the three months leading up to Christmas.
The driving was mostly done by specialist nurses trained to provide in-home or community-based care for Victorians withdrawing from alcohol and other drugs.
Ballarat Community Health clinic lead for alcohol and other drugs Mel Lishman said staff spent a lot of time driving clients to services in Melbourne, Geelong and Bendigo because the region did not have a dedicated detox facility for adults.
“Some facilities have specific admission times. And so, for example, one of our nurses this morning left at seven o’clock. She doesn’t usually start until nine, but she had to start or leave here at seven o’clock to pick up a client from Daylesford to get them to Melbourne for a 10 o’clock admission.”
Detox and rehabilitation are two separate, but sequential, phases of recovery from drug or alcohol use.
Detox refers to the short-term medical process of clearing substances from the body and safely managing withdrawal symptoms. It typically lasts three to 10 days.
Rehab follows detox and is focused on longer-term therapy that addresses the root causes of addiction and helps prevent relapse.
Ballarat does have a rehab clinic, but its detox service, Tabor House, is for young people aged 12 to 25.
Ballarat Community Health manager Suzanne Powell, who has worked in this space for 18 years, said detox had been an issue since she started.
“We have raised this issue a lot but we don’t seem to get anywhere,” she said.
“From a funding perspective, it would be more sustainable to have appropriate resources to undertake this [transport] work to reduce the amount of time our NRW [non-residential withdrawal] nurses are spending in the car.”
In community health, residential withdrawal refers to staying at a facility with 24/7 medical supervision. Non-residential withdrawal is done at home or via an outpatient service for more mild dependency.
Ballarat peer support worker Dean Seabrook said alcohol continued to be the most commonly used drug in the region, but cannabis was common, too.
There had also been an increase in the usage of GHB, also known as liquid ecstasy.
“It’s reported by clients that methamphetamine purity is very low at the moment. It’s getting cut with things, so clients aren’t getting that buzz. So they’re using other things as well.”
Chris Christoforou, the chief executive of the Victorian Alcohol and Drug Association, said there had been a general increase in demand for detox services across the state.
“It’s an important part of preparing people for rehabilitation. Often it’s a first step when there’s quite problematic alcohol or other drug use that poses a significant health risk to the individual. So being able to manage that properly as part of a supported withdrawal process is critical,” he said.
“The issue of access to detox beds or withdrawal beds is a major issue, and certainly a major issue for regional communities.”
Christoforou said being able to access support networks was an essential part of treatment success.
“People need services in their communities. Ballarat isn’t exactly a small town. It’s one of the biggest population centres in Victoria.”
Mel Thomson, the chief operating officer at Windana – which runs longer-term rehabilitation services in Ballarat, Geelong and Maryknoll – said all services transported patients, but the burden was higher in the regions.
“It’s an incredible waste of resources. They’re not Uber drivers,” she said of nursing staff. “But they do it because there isn’t an alternative that’s safe or funded.”
Thomson said she would welcome an adult detox centre in Ballarat but in an ideal world, there would be medical detox beds in every major community.
“Why does every major hospital and community health service not have medical detox beds available? This is a health issue.”
Windana also offers home-based withdrawal services for suitable clients around the south-eastern suburbs, Frankston and the Mornington Peninsula. Patients are connected to a nurse and local GP who prescribe the necessary medications.
Thomson said this was an area the government could also invest in. However, she pointed out that home-based withdrawal was unsuitable in some cases, such as Victorians consuming larger quantities of drugs or alcohol, or those at risk of homelessness.
Victorians will head to the polls for a state election in November. Aside from violence against women, the Coalition is expected to campaign hard on better access to healthcare in the regions, according to two sources speaking on the condition of anonymity to anticipate plans not yet finalised.
A spokesperson for the Allan government said that while Ballarat locals had access to specialist alcohol and drug services, more could be done.
“That’s why we’re delivering our $95 million statewide action plan to save lives, reduce drug harms and get Victorians the care they need.”

Cars, cows and more as Australia gets closer to mega trade win

Cars, cows and more as Australia gets closer to mega trade win
London: Australia is closer than ever to a trade deal with Europe that will cut prices for consumers and boost sales for exporters, after talks in Brussels cleared the way to a pact within weeks.
The likely gains for Australian households include lower prices for European exports such as cars and trucks, wiping away tariffs that add 5 per cent to every vehicle.
Australian farmers are also certain to benefit from bigger export opportunities in Europe, although both sides are still wrangling over the scale of the increase in beef and lamb sales.
The net result will expand a two-way trade relationship already worth about $110 billion to Australia each year, making this the most important agreement with the European Union in more than a decade. It has always been about much more than cars and cows.
There was a serious risk of failure when Trade Minister Don Farrell arrived in Brussels for two days of talks on Thursday and Friday with his EU counterpart, Maroš Šefčovič. There was always a chance that the Europeans would not offer enough access for beef and lamb, in which case Farrell would walk away.
So the mere fact that the talks continued into a second day, and ended with a positive statement on Friday afternoon (Brussels time), means that a deal is finally within sight.
There is now a stronger chance that European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen will visit Australia to seal an agreement with Prime Minster Anthony Albanese. This potential trip has been aired for at least four weeks, but now there is a solid reason for it to go ahead.
Sure, this will only receive modest attention when the Liberal Party is making headlines with its leadership spill and the rise of Angus Taylor as opposition leader. There is far less drama in the mundane work of government.
But there are three significant and strategic reasons to welcome the news from Brussels.
The first is that Australia and Europe are getting closer at a time when both have to contend with the sudden upheavals from Donald Trump on trade and security. The US president is turning America into an unreliable ally. The rational response for Australia is to tighten links with other allies.
The second is that Australian leaders have been saying for years that we need to rely less on China for our exports. Of course, sales to Europe cannot match the sheer volume of trade with China in coal, gas and iron ore. But it is wise to diversify.
The third is that the trade deal will be accompanied by a defence partnership.
This will not be an alliance like NATO or ANZUS, but an agreement to work together on exercises and procurement.
It might help Australian companies sell equipment to Europe, and it could help both sides work together on “hybrid warfare” threats such as drone strikes and cyberattacks. Put more bluntly, it will be about dealing with Russia and China.
There are likely to be practical and fairly swift benefits as well.
One is that cars from Europe become cheaper for households. Right now, a European car is 5 per cent more expensive because of the Australian tariff regime.
This puts companies such as Volkswagen, Skoda, Fiat and others – not just the luxury brands – at a disadvantage to rivals from China, Japan, Thailand and the US. (All these countries already have trade deals with Australia.) This is good for competition.
Another is that other capital goods also fall in price. While most products get into Australia without a barrier, there is still a 5 per cent tariff on many products from Europe. A cafe might pay more for a coffee machine, for instance. A transport company might pay more for a European truck.
There will also be a benefit for farmers who want to export more beef and lamb but have been blocked by EU quotas. In January, the Europeans appeared to be willing to allow 24,000 tonnes of beef and 20,000 tonnes of lamb from Australia each year. This was so low that there did not seem much point in doing a deal. Farrell has pushed for more.
Right now, Australia is barred from shipping more than 3389 tonnes of beef to the EU each year, according to Meat and Livestock Australia. It wants an increase to 50,000 tonnes, arguing this is in line with EU agreements with Canada and Brazil. Farm groups in Europe are lobbying to keep the number low.
Farrell sounded positive on Friday, which suggests he has made some headway. The “stretch” goal for the Australian side would be anything above 40,000 tonnes.
There are other gains to sweeten a final deal. Europe wants access to Australian critical minerals, and there is no reason to turn it away.
There is likely to be a limited agreement to make it easier for skilled workers to move between Australian and European employers, but this will not be open slather. (Anything more ambitious on visa rules would need approval from national parliaments in Europe.)
Jason Collins, who heads the European Australian Business Council, says finalising a deal would be a “smart move” to increase access to 450 million consumers across the EU.
The decision to start these trade talks dates back to 2015. Progress was so slow that Farrell walked away two years ago because the Europeans were not offering enough access on beef and lamb. He was right to insist on a better deal.
On Friday in Brussels, the trade minister issued a brief statement: “I am confident that both Australia and the European Union will reach agreement that benefits both of our economies.”
He did not say that they “could” reach a deal – he said they “will”. After more than a decade, an agreement is within sight.
This will not get as much attention as a Liberal leadership spill, but it represents a quiet economic win for Labor. The gains for households are real. And, in the age of Trump, the strategic benefits are not to be ignored.

‘An incredibly rare proposition’: Sydney Harbour island up for sale
An Aboriginal land council is leading a push for a small but historically significant island in Sydney Harbour to be returned to traditional custodians after the site was listed for sale as part of a sweeping $3 billion sell-off of surplus defence land.
Spectacle Island is at the centre of a growing debate about whether prominent public assets with deep historical value should be sold to private interests after the two-hectare former naval outpost was included in a list of 67 defence properties set to be divested by the federal government to fund modern defence priorities.
Vacant since 2023, Spectacle Island has played a quiet but consequential role in Australia’s defence history – first as a gunpowder store established in 1865, later as a naval munitions depot, and more recently as a storage base for the Royal Australian Navy’s heritage collection.
The island contains about 40 heritage buildings, including 19th-century powder magazines and laboratories.
Its listing has ignited discussion about whether surplus defence sites should be sold off or repurposed for public uses such as open space, cultural facilities or social and affordable housing.
While the NSW Government has confirmed it is considering housing options for another defence site, Victoria Barracks in Paddington, Planning Minister Paul Scully was less specific about Spectacle Island, saying NSW would “engage constructively” with the federal government as opportunities arose.
The Metropolitan Aboriginal Land Council is preparing a formal request to the federal government for Aboriginal ownership. Metro LALC chief executive Nathan Moran said the proposed sale was an opportunity to address historic land dispossession.
“More than 99 per cent of our backyard has been taken from us and rather than being sold off to private interests for the highest price, this is a rare opportunity for the federal government to help correct past injustices while creating new economic and cultural pathways for our people,” he said.
Moran said Spectacle Island, together with nearby Goat Island – which remains subject to final transfer negotiations with the NSW government – could support Indigenous-led tourism, education programs and cultural events.
“Over 70 per cent of visitors to Sydney seek an Aboriginal cultural tourism experience, and right now there’s nowhere to deliver it at scale within the harbour,” he said.
The listing has also sparked speculation that the island could be sold to private buyers and repurposed for uses such as boutique accommodation, hospitality or events.
That would align with recent changes to the management of other islands within Sydney Harbour, including the NSW government awarding a tender for a hospitality venue to operate on Fort Denison and the Sydney Harbour Federation Trust expanding public access and commercial activity on Cockatoo Island.
Property Council of Australia policy executive Matthew Kandelaars said hospitality and premium tourism were the most plausible commercial options for Spectacle Island, given constraints including water-only access and strict heritage controls.
Resort Brokers director Tim Crooks said the island could attract interest from high-net-worth individuals, investors or hospitality groups, with its value potentially reaching tens of millions of dollars depending on permitted uses.
“The sale of an island in Sydney Harbour is an incredibly rare proposition and it will generate a lot of interest, particularly among buyers looking at adaptive reuse options, such as luxury accommodation, events or destination hospitality,” Crooks said.
Defence audit documents describe many of the island’s structures as “significantly degraded” due to water ingress, lead paint and decades of limited maintenance.
The buildings are listed on the Commonwealth Heritage Register under the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act, meaning any buyer would face strict conservation and environmental remediation requirements.
UNSW City Futures Research Centre professor Chris Pettit said that while housing had been discussed as an option for other defence sites, Spectacle Island was unlikely to play a meaningful role in easing the housing crisis due to its small size and limited transport access.
He said the island had significant international tourism appeal and suggested it would be better managed by a public authority or Aboriginal organisation rather than a private owner.
“The only other option is a multimillionaire buying it as a trophy asset for prestige, but that would not be an equitable use of what has long been a publicly owned site,” he said.
Heritage advocates have warned that private ownership could jeopardise the preservation of the island’s historic buildings and military artefacts, including gun turrets and ship bells.
David Michael, president of the Naval Historical Society, said preserving the island’s buildings would require significant investment. “It is Australia’s oldest naval explosives manufacturing and storage site,” he said.
Drummoyne state Liberal MP Stephanie Di Pasqua said the proposed sale had “come as a shock” to many in the community and called for the site to remain in public hands.

Peru to debate removal of President Jose Jeri four months into his term
The debate comes as Jeri, who is not running for re-election, faces allegations of bribery and influence-peddling.
The head of Peru’s Congress, Fernando Rospigliosi, has announced a special plenary session to weigh the removal of the country’s right-wing president, Jose Jeri.
The session will take place on the morning of February 17, according to a statement Peru’s Congress posted on social media.

The debate comes as Jeri’s short tenure grows mired in scandal, just four months after he took office as interim president.
In October, Jeri — the leader of Congress at the time — took over as president following the unanimous impeachment of his predecessor, Dina Boluarte, on the grounds of “permanent moral incapacity”.
Boluarte herself assumed the presidency after her predecessor, Pedro Castillo, was impeached for attempting a self-coup.
Next week’s debate about Jeri’s future is the latest chapter in the ongoing instability facing Peru’s government. The country has seen eight presidents within the last decade, with several of them impeached or resigning before their term expired.
In recent months, Jeri has become increasingly embroiled in scandal, including one colloquially known as “chifagate”, named for the Peruvian-Chinese fusion cuisine known as “chifa”.
The scandal started when local media outlets obtained video of Jeri arriving late at night at a restaurant to meet with a Chinese businessman, Zhihua Yang, who previously received government approval to build a hydroelectric plant.
Their meeting was not listed in the official presidential agenda, as is required under Peruvian law. Critics have questioned whether Jeri’s outfit — which had a deep hood that rendered him nearly unrecognisable — was meant to be a disguise.
Additional footage placed Jeri at another one of Yang’s businesses days later. Jeri also allegedly met a second Chinese businessman, Jiwu Xiaodong, who was reportedly under house arrest for illegal activities.
Jeri has dismissed some of the off-the-books meetings as planning for an upcoming Chinese-Peruvian friendship event. Others, he said, were simply shopping trips for sweets and other food. He has denied wrongdoing but has acknowledged taking the meetings was a “mistake”.
“I have not lied to the country. I have not done anything illegal,” Jeri told the news outlet Canal N.
But critics have accused Jeri of using his position for influence-peddling at the unregistered interactions.
Similar accusations erupted earlier this month when Peruvian media highlighted the irregular hiring of several women in Jeri’s administration and contracts he awarded as possible evidence of bribery.
The debate over Jeri’s removal comes as Peru hurtles towards a general election on April 12, with the presidency up for grabs. Jeri will not be running to retain his seat.

Thailand launches wild elephant birth control to stop deadly farm raids
The vaccination drive has drawn criticism that it might undermine conservation efforts of an animal seen as a symbol of the nation
Reading Time:2 minutes
Why you can trust SCMP
Thailand has begun using a birth control vaccine on elephants in the wild to try and curb a growing problem where human and animal populations encroach on each other – an issue in areas where farms spread into forests and elephants are squeezed out of their natural habitat.
The initiative is part of efforts to address confrontations that can turn deadly. As farmers cut down forests to make more farmland, elephants are forced to venture out of their shrinking habitats in search of food.
Last year, wild elephants killed 30 people and injured 29 in Thailand, according to official figures, which also noted more than 2,000 incidents of elephants damaging crops.

Sukhee Boonsang, director of the Wildlife Conservation Office, said that controlling the wild elephant population had become necessary as numbers of elephants living near residential areas rise sharply, increasing the risk of confrontations.
The office obtained 25 doses of a US-made vaccine and conducted a two-year trial on seven domesticated elephants – using up seven doses of the vaccine – which yielded promising results, he said.

US military strikes another alleged drug boat in Caribbean, killing 3
WASHINGTON (AP) — The U.S. military said Friday that it has carried out another deadly strike on a vessel accused of trafficking drugs in the Caribbean Sea.
U.S. Southern Command said on social media that the boat “was transiting along known narco-trafficking routes in the Caribbean and was engaged in narco-trafficking operations.” It said the strike killed three people. A video linked to the post shows a boat moving through the water before exploding in flames.
Friday’s attack raises the death toll from the Trump administration’s strikes on alleged drug boats to 133 people in at least 38 attacks carried out since early September in the Caribbean Sea and eastern Pacific Ocean.
U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth declared last week that “some top cartel drug-traffickers” in the region “have decided to cease all narcotics operations INDEFINITELY due to recent (highly effective) kinetic strikes in the Caribbean.” However, Hegseth did not provide any details or information to back up this claim, made in a post on his personal account on social media.
President Donald Trump has said the U.S. is in “armed conflict” with cartels in Latin America and has justified the attacks as a necessary escalation to stem the flow of drugs. But his administration has offered little evidence to support its claims of killing “narcoterrorists.”

Pakistan vs India: Hottest ticket in cricket sparks T20 World Cup fever

Excitement is hitting fever pitch in Colombo and across South Asia after Pakistan decided to play against India in the T20 World Cup, reigniting the most lucrative match in cricket.
The hottest tickets in world cricket were hard to come by, despite Sunday evening's game in the Sri Lankan capital only being confirmed late on Monday.
The 35,000-capacity R.Premadasa Stadium was sold out, sources told AFP news agency, with tickets going for at least four times face value on the black market.
Prices of flights and hotel bookings to Colombo, Sri Lanka, have soared, with the cost of a room climbing as high as $660 a night from a typical price tag of about $100-$150 per night, multiple booking sites showed.
Flights from Chennai, which is about one and a half hours away, have more than tripled to around $623 - $756 while flights from Delhi are up more than 50 percent to roughly $666.
Nalin Jayasundera, President of Sri Lanka Inbound Tour Operators (SLAITO) said hotels were booked out. "Most fans are coming on all-inclusive packages that could be $1,500-$2000 or even higher depending on ticket, hotel, and flight prices," Jayasundera said.
Buddhika Hewawasam, chairman of the Sri Lanka Tourism Development Authority, told Reuters news agency that in the first 10 days of February, roughly 20 percent of the 100,000 visitors to Sri Lanka were there for the India-Pakistan cricket match.
Hundreds of millions more will watch the match, which has given the tournament a shot in the arm, on television in India, Pakistan and beyond.
Kashmir tensions
Emotions are expected to be high as every ball and shot is cheered or jeered in this high-stakes showdown between the nuclear-armed South Asian neighbours, whose rivalry remains rooted in the 1947 partition of British India, subsequent wars, including those in 1947, 1965, 1971, and 1999, and ongoing disputes over Kashmir.
Both teams have two wins out of two in Group A, meaning the winner should be assured of a place in the Super Eights round.
The two bitter rivals only meet in global or regional tournaments these days and only on neutral territory.
It has been more than 18 years since India and Pakistan last met in a Test match, and 13 years since either side crossed the border to play a bilateral series.
They met three times in the T20 Asian Cup in Dubai last September, with India triumphant each time, including the final.
The TV audience for Sunday's clash has been tipped to break all records.
Wild estimates of a billion-plus watching are often bandied about for India v Pakistan games.
However, according to verifiable figures from the International Cricket Council (ICC), the most-watched match was the 2011 50-over World Cup final between India and Sri Lanka in Mumbai, which had 558 million unique viewers.
India's win over Pakistan in the semi-final of that tournament is second, with 495 million.
The match will likely generate multi-millions of dollars in advertising, broadcast rights, sponsorship and tourism.
However, the biggest and most lucrative clash in world cricket was only revived after a frantic weekend of negotiations.
The governments of Bangladesh and Sri Lanka both wrote to their counterpart in Islamabad on Monday urging it to change its stance and allow the game to go ahead. They got their wish just before midnight.
After "multilateral discussions, as well as the request of friendly countries, the Government of Pakistan hereby directs the Pakistan National Cricket Team to take the field on February 15", the Pakistan government said.
The decision had been taken with the aim of "protecting the spirit of cricket", it said.
'No handshake' policy
The 20-team tournament had been overshadowed by an acrimonious political build-up.
Bangladesh, who refused to play in India after citing security concerns, were replaced by Scotland.
As a protest, the Pakistan government ordered the team on the eve of the tournament not to face India, which is co-hosting the tournament with Sri Lanka, before relenting eight days later.
The enduring India-Pakistan rivalry manifests in off-field tensions, notably India's 'no handshake' policy from 2025.
On September 14 2025, Indian captain Suryakumar Yadav declined the customary pre-toss handshake with Pakistan's Salman Ali Agha, and following India's seven-wicket victory, the entire Indian team walked off without engaging in post-match handshakes, leaving Pakistani players waiting on the field.
Yadav later explained the decision as a deliberate stance aligned with the Indian government and the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI), which holds considerable influence over the ICC.
Pakistan expressed disappointment, with coach Mike Hesson calling the snub "disappointing" and not in the spirit of the game, while captain Agha skipped the post-match presentation in protest during one game.
The incident recurred in later Asia Cup matches, such as on September 21 2025, further straining relations.
India's last cricket tour of Pakistan was in 2008, for the Asia Cup. Since then, the Indian team has not visited Pakistan for any cricket fixtures, including bilateral series or multilateral tournaments.
As a result, India-Pakistan cricket encounters have been limited to neutral venues in major ICC or Asian cricket events.
Meanwhile, Lahore local Mian Sultan is looking forward to his trip to Sri Lanka to watch the game.
"I think it’s going to be a great experience," said Sultan, who spent $800 on a front-row seat to watch the game alongside a friend, who is flying in from New Zealand. "I’m really excited about this match."
Sultan added he thought Pakistan "absolutely" could come out on top on Sunday.

What to know about the counter drone technology that triggered the closure of the El Paso airspace
The government’s ability to deal with drones that pose a threat on American soil has been questioned this week after airspace was closed over El Paso, Texas
- Bookmark
The government’s ability to deal with drones that pose a threat on American soil has been questioned this week after the use of a laser designed to shoot down drones near the border in Texas led to the abrupt closure of the airspace over El Paso, sources familiar with the situation told The Associated Press.
The details of exactly what happened before the Federal Aviation Administration shut down the busy airport in the Mexican border city on Wednesday aren’t entirely clear, but a source familiar with the situation told AP that the laser was deployed by U.S. Customs and Border Protection without coordinating with the FAA.
Two months ago, Congress agreed to give more law enforcement agencies the authority to take down rogue drones as long as they are properly trained. That could make situations like the one in El Paso more likely. Previously, only a select few federal agencies had that power.
Here's a look at what happened and the issues that raised:
Communication issues acknowledged
The government would say only that the airspace was shut down when an incursion by Mexican drug cartel drones was neutralized.
But the two people who discussed sensitive details on condition of anonymity said the FAA grounded every aircraft in the El Paso area over concerns about the safety of the laser system being used near commercial planes. The restrictions were initially expected to last 10 days, but then they were lifted a few hours later.
Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said Friday that the government agencies involved in El Paso are working to address the concerns that led to the cancellation of more than a dozen flights and sent travelers scrambling.
“This was a joint agency task force mission that was undertaken and we’re continuing to work on the communication through that,” Noem said in Arizona.
But drone warfare expert Brett Velicovich said the dysfunction in Texas raises questions about whether the U.S. will be prepared to deal with a significant drone threat.
“We need to simplify the authorities for who is really in charge and get these egos out of the way from these different agencies before an American gets hurt,” said Velicovich, who founded drone maker Power.us and consults on ways to mitigate their threats.
Drones can be a threat
Armed drones carry out devastating attacks daily in Ukraine. The unmanned vehicles have also allowed Ukraine to strike deep within Russia.
Velicovich, who used to use Predator drones in the military to bomb targets, said it wouldn’t be hard for someone with malicious intent to buy a drone for a few hundred bucks and do great harm at a major public event like a World Cup match or the celebrations of America’s 250th birthday that are planned this summer.
Cartels routinely use drones to deliver drugs across the Mexican border and surveil Border Patrol officers. Officials told Congress last summer that more than 27,000 drones were detected within 1,600 feet (500 meters) of the southern border in the last six months of 2024.
The government recently handed out $250 million in grants to the 11 states that are set to host World Cup matches this summer to help them prepare for the threat of drones. Another $250 million in grants will be awarded later this year to strengthen the nation's drone defenses.
More near misses involving drones
The threat to planes from drones continues to increase along with the number of near misses around airports. Homeland Security estimates there are more than 1.7 million registered drones flying in the United States, and that number has been growing.
Larger drones are required to carry a radio transponder that identifies the drone’s owner and broadcasts its position to help avert collisions. Cities can also invest in additional sensors around stadiums to help quickly detect drones.
Airspace Link, a Detroit company, created a low altitude air traffic control system to track drones and can alert authorities who might soon be able to take action. Cities can buy additional sensors to upgrade that system around stadiums or other high-profile locations.
“We don’t want something to happen," said CEO Michael Healander. “But we also want to be prepared to have the tools in place to take action, because these are such big global events.”
Acting against rogue drones
Common anti-drone systems use radio signals to jam or force drones to land. But the government has also developed high-powered microwaves or laser beams like the one sources say was used in Texas this week that are capable of disabling the machines.
Some other systems station small drones to take flight quickly and ram into drones that are considered a threat. And there are systems that use bullets to shoot down drones.
Michael Robbins, president and CEO of the Association for Uncrewed Vehicle Systems International trade group, said these counter drone systems are more common in warzones than across the United States. But the government is working to get them into the hands of more officers nationwide.
“It’s our belief that this is important technology that when responsibly used with proper oversight and intensive training will help to mitigate unsafe or malicious drones in the very rare instances where that needs to occur,” Robbins said.
Pilots worry about drones
Allied Pilots Association union spokesman Capt. Dennis Tajer said he's not sure how big of a threat the counter drone technology is to the American Airlines jets he flies because so few details have been released about what happened in Texas. And officials with Homeland Security and the FAA didn't respond to questions about it again on Friday.
Tajer said he's more concerned about the possibility of a passenger jet running into a drone because that could bring the plane down. A year ago, 67 people were killed when an American Airlines jet collided with an Army helicopter near Washington, D.C.
“You don’t have to be a pilot, an engineer or a defense expert to understand that two pieces of metal in the sky that one doesn’t know the other is there and is uncontrolled is dangerous,” Tajer said. “We’ve got to keep those two pieces of metal away from each other.”

Kyiv receives 16 generators, charging stations from Slovakia
Kyiv Mayor Vitali Klitschko announced this on Telegram, Ukrinform reports.
"Kyiv has received the first batch of humanitarian assistance from Slovakia: 16 generators of various capacities and two sets of charging stations rated at 8 kW each, with a total value of EUR 166,000. The three most powerful generators (225 kW, 100 kW, and 63 kW) will be delivered to schools in different districts of the capital," Klitschko said.
The mayor noted that in the second half of January, on the initiative of the Embassy of Ukraine in Slovakia, together with the country's largest fundraising platform Donio and ten leading civil society organizations in Slovakia, a large-scale fundraising campaign titled "Warmth for Ukraine" was launched.
"Nearly EUR 1.1 million has already been raised from more than 19,500 donors. These funds are being used to support Ukrainian communities. In particular, our Slovak partners are purchasing and delivering generators and charging stations," Klitschko wrote.
He thanked Slovakia for this critically important assistance.
Earlier reports said that Kyiv had received all 500 generators from the European Union's strategic rescEU reserve, with the last 234 power sources delivered on February 12.

US withdraws newly updated list of firms allegedly aiding China’s military
Sign up now: Get ST's newsletters delivered to your inbox
WASHINGTON – The United States withdrew an updated list of Chinese firms allegedly aiding Beijing’s military shortly after it was posted on Feb 13 with the addition of some of China’s biggest tech companies, including Alibaba and Baidu.
The document, which was posted for about an hour, also had removed China’s top memory chipmakers CXMT and YMTC from the list, drawing fire from China hawks in Washington who fear the growing chipmaking expertise of these companies could help supercharge China’s military.
“We would like to remove this notice from public inspection and withdraw the notice from publication in the Federal Register,” a Pentagon letter to the Federal Register, the official journal of the US government, said without specifying a reason.
The Pentagon and the White House did not immediately respond to requests for comment. The Chinese embassy in Washington did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
“Hopefully, (the Pentagon) pulled the document because removing CXMT and YMTC was an error,” said Mr Chris McGuire, a former White House National Security Council official under President Joe Biden, who said that would only make sense, given the addition to the list of many other companies critical to the Chinese AI stack, like Alibaba and Baidu.
Other additions on the withdrawn on Feb 13 document included automaker BYD, biotech firm WuXi AppTec and AI-driven robotics technology company RoboSense Technology Co Ltd. The publication and hasty withdrawal of the list comes as US President Donald Trump’s administration has sought to avoid antagonising China following a trade truce reached by Chinese President Xi Jinping and Mr Trump in October 2025.
Since then, the administration has taken a softer line on China. It gave Nvidia a green light to export its second-most advanced AI chips to China and postponed a rule that would have barred thousands of Chinese firms from buying US technology.
On Feb 12, Reuters reported the administration had shelved a number of national security measures aimed at Beijing, including a ban on China Telecom’s US operations and restrictions on sales of Chinese equipment for US data centres. Mr Trump is expected to travel to China in April, though dates for the visit have yet to be set.
Though the Pentagon list does not formally impose sanctions on Chinese firms, under a new law, the department will be prevented in coming years from contracting and procuring from companies on the list.
Being added to the list also sends a message to Pentagon suppliers and other US government agencies about the US military’s opinion of the firms, some of which have sued the United States over their inclusion.
An Alibaba spokesperson said there was no basis for its inclusion and threatened legal action.
“Alibaba is not a Chinese military company nor part of any military-civil fusion strategy,” the spokesperson said.
The list already includes major Chinese firms such as Tencent Holdings, one of China’s largest tech companies, and CATL, a major battery maker in the electric vehicle industry.
“This appears to be a process issue tied to interagency sign-off on some of the companies being removed,” said Mr Eric Sayers, a non-resident fellow at the American Enterprise Institute who specialises in Asia-Pacific defence policy and US-China technology policy.
“My view is that the new additions are unlikely to change, but a few removals still appear under review and could remain on the updated list,” Mr Sayers said. REUTERS

MOSCOW, February 14. /TASS/. A court in Moscow has arrested the Kalashnikov Concern’s former director of procurement and logistics, Ksenia Grashchenkova, as part of a criminal case into abuse of power, committed while implementing state defense contracts.
A law enforcement source told TASS Grashchenkova was detained "in the course of a preliminary investigation into a multimillion fraud" and charged with abuse of office.
She was charged under Article 201 of the Russian Criminal Code, 'Abuse of Authority,' committed in a group, while fulfilling the state defense order, which has involved grave consequences.
According to the source, Grashchenkova has been placed under arrest and is now in custody in a pretrial detention facility in Moscow.

Mistrial declared in case of anti-Israel Stanford students who occupied school president’s office
Jury deadlocks on felony charges against the students, one of whom vows that ‘we will continue to fight… because at the end of the day, this is for Palestine’; prosecutors to seek new trial
SAN FRANCISCO — A judge declared a mistrial Friday in the case of five current and former Stanford University students charged after anti-Israel pro-Palestinian protests in 2024, when they barricaded themselves inside the university president and provost executive offices.
The trial in Santa Clara County was a rare instance of demonstrators facing felony charges from protests over the Israel-Hamas war that roiled campuses across the country. The two sides argued over free speech, lawful dissent and crime during the three-week proceedings.
The jury voted 9 to 3 to convict on a felony charge of vandalism and 8 to 4 to convict on a felony charge of conspiracy to trespass. After deliberating for five days, jurors said they could not reach a verdict.
Judge Hanley Chew asked each one if more time deliberating would help break the impasse, and all answered, “No.”
“It appears that this jury is hopelessly deadlocked, and I’m now declaring a mistrial in counts one and two,” Chen said. He then dismissed the jurors.
Demonstrators barricaded themselves inside the offices for several hours on June 5, 2024, the last day of spring classes at the university.
Prosecutors said the defendants spray-painted the building, broke windows and furniture, disabled security cameras and splattered a red liquid described as fake blood on items throughout the offices.
Defense attorneys said the protest was protected speech and there was insufficient evidence of an intent to damage the property. They also said the students wore protective gear and barricaded the offices out of fear of being injured by police and campus security.
If convicted, the defendants would have faced up to three years in prison and been obligated to pay restitution of over $300,000.
Santa Clara County District Attorney Jeff Rosen said he would pursue a new trial.
“This case is about a group of people who destroyed someone else’s property and caused hundreds of thousands of dollars in damage,” Rosen said in a statement. “That is against the law and that is why we will retry the case.”
As the mistrial was announced, the students, some wearing kaffiyehs, sat on a bench in the courtroom and did not show a visible reaction.
“The District Attorney’s Office had Stanford University supporting them and other multibillion-dollar institutions behind them, and even then the district attorney was unable to convict us,” Germán González, who was a sophomore at Stanford when he was arrested, told The Associated Press by phone later. “No matter what happens, we will continue to fight tooth and nail for as long as possible, because at the end of the day, this is for Palestine.”
Authorities initially arrested and charged 12 people in the case, but one pleaded no contest under an agreement that allows some young people to have their cases dismissed and records sealed if they successfully complete probation.
He testified for the prosecution, leading to a grand jury indictment of the others in October of the others. Six of those accepted pretrial plea deals or diversion programs, and the remaining five pleaded not guilty and sought a jury trial.
Protests sprung up on campuses across the country following the Hamas-led October 7, 2023, onslaught that started the conflict in Gaza, with students setting up camps and demanding their universities stop doing business with Israel or companies that support its war efforts against Hamas.
About 3,200 people were arrested in 2024 nationwide. While some colleges ended demonstrations by striking deals with students or simply waited them out, others called in police. Most criminal charges were ultimately dismissed.

From ICE to dodgy hosts, US World Cup could be century's worst

From ICE to dodgy hosts, US World Cup could be century's worst
A World Cup is never just about football. It’s a global audit of the host nation. Everyone zooms in on its politics, culture and the gap between how a country sees itself versus how the rest of the world actually experiences it.
As the US prepares to host the FIFA tournament this summer, millions will tune in not just to watch who lifts the trophy, but to see how the country handles a level of scrutiny it so often directs at others.
And that scrutiny has already started. In the months leading up to kick-off, thousands of fans cancelled their tickets, citing the US’s deteriorating human rights record, an aggressive right-wing political climate and an unrelenting stream of criminal scandals. Even football officials have openly called for a boycott, pointing to the actions of President Trump and his administration at home, as well as on the global stage.
The first thing the world will be watching is who actually makes it through the gate. Though exemptions for athletes, staff and families exist on paper, under the Trump administration, certainty is a luxury few can afford.
The US operates one of the most restrictive and shifting visa regimes, one that categorises entire countries as security risks. Visitors from much of the global south, particularly from Muslim-majority countries, are completely barred from entry. Others, where soccer culture has long thrived, face severe limitations.
Take Senegal. The country topped the Africa Cup of Nations, yet remains among dozens facing entry restrictions. The list stretches across South America, Africa and Asia, regions where FIFA-backed football programs often serve as lifelines for kids and communities.
What gets me most is the irony of it all: the US is hosting the world’s biggest soccer tournament while shutting out the very people who have historically found real joy and refuge in it.
And even for citizens of countries that are technically “allowed,” the welcome is fragile. Stories of sudden visa revocations, border harassment, arrests and deportations are not new. In the last few years, travellers say they’ve been turned away at US airports over political views and memes.
The second test is more on the logistical side: can the US actually host millions of people safely and fairly amid mounting evidence of internal chaos?
Patriotism and confidence, arguably something the US is good at, are unfortunately not enough to host the World Cup. An event this scale requires boring systems: functioning airports, efficient public transit, clear visa processes, fair policing and emergency response that doesn’t depend on an insurance company’s mood swings. These determine whether fans make it to games, players feel safe and whether people can enter and exit a country without fear.
In the US, many of these systems are visibly strained. Air travel teeters on fragility as the administration witnessed a second government shutdown within a span of months, forcing airport staff to work without pay.
With many host cities like Houston heavily dependent on cars, public transit becomes an obvious problem when hundreds of thousands of visitors are expected to move quickly and affordably. And right now, as people are being disappeared by Gestapo-esque forces, the US is asking the world to trust policing systems that aren’t even able to keep Americans safe.
Finally, the world will be watching to see if the age-old myth of American exceptionalism still holds. This idea rests on the notion that the US is uniquely capable, uniquely free and uniquely qualified to lead. Hosting the World Cup is a chance to perform that belief on a global stage and have it tested in real time. Can a country grappling with gun violence host mass gatherings without fear? Can a nation that lectures others on human rights reconcile that image with its own record on policing, incarceration and protest? Can it centre the world without centring itself?
When Qatar hosted the World Cup in 2022, what often went unacknowledged was how much of the criticism, even when rooted in legitimate human rights concerns, slipped into something more unsettling. Labour practices, governance and cultural norms were rightly scrutinised, but with a tone scholars and commentators described as a modern repackaging of old orientalist tropes that Arab and Muslim societies are inherently backward, authoritarian and incapable of meeting global standards.
And Qatari officials pushed back on that framing. In an interview with a German newspaper, Qatar’s foreign minister said European criticism often implied that Qatar was “not intellectually or culturally prepared to host a World Cup,” calling the tone “arrogant” and “honestly… very racist.” He pointed to the double standards at play, particularly from countries that publicly questioned Qatar’s values while privately maintaining deep economic ties, including energy cooperation.
None of this negates the importance of human-rights advocacy. Much of the pressure on Qatar led to real, even if incomplete, labour reforms. But it’s worth noting what often got lost in the conversation: Qatar delivered the tournament itself with remarkable precision. Stadiums were finished on time. Transport was efficient. Fans consistently described the experience as smooth, safe and accessible.
Many fans, including those initially sceptical, later acknowledged that the logistics surpassed expectations. In a BBC poll, the Qatar World Cup was voted the best of the century.
This contrast matters now. Because as the US prepares to host, the question isn’t whether human rights should be discussed, they should. It’s whether the US can even meet the technical and logistical bar that Qatar did.
For decades, the US has positioned itself as both referee and role model. This World Cup flips the dynamic. The cameras will be pointed inward this time, and millions of viewers, many watching from afar by choice or necessity, will be looking to see whether the performance matches the promise.

Perjury probe into ICE testimonies marks latest shooting where evidence contradicts Trump officials
Federal authorities have announced an investigation into two immigration officers who appeared to have made untruthful statements under oath about a shooting in Minneapolis last month
- Bookmark
Federal authorities announced an investigation Friday into two immigration officers who appeared to have made untruthful statements under oath about a shooting in Minneapolis last month.
It is among at least five shootings in which initial descriptions by the immigration officials were later contradicted by video evidence. Those included the fatal Minneapolis shootings of Renee Good and Alex Pretti, where bystander video quickly raised questions about how they were initially described.
The probe Friday came hours after a federal judge dismissed felony assault charges against two Venezuelan men who were accused of beating an Immigration and Customs Enforcement officer with a broom handle and a snow shovel on Jan. 14. The officer, who is not named in court filings, fired a single shot from a handgun that struck one of the men, Julio Cesar Sosa-Celis, in the thigh.
In an unusual reversal, prosecutors asked to dismiss the cases because they said new video evidence contradicted allegations made against the men in a criminal complaint and at a hearing last month.
Here is a look at how the five shootings were initially described and what was later learned:
Julio Cesar Sosa-Celis non-fatal shooting
Date and location: Jan. 14, 2026, in Minneapolis
What federal officials said initially: Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said the immigration officer was “ambushed” by Sosa-Celis and others, and fired a “defensive shot” out of fear for his life. “What we saw last night in Minneapolis was an attempted murder of federal law enforcement,” she said.
What came out later: Investigators have not released the new evidence that led charges to be dropped, but cracks were already apparent in a Jan. 21 court hearing. The immigration officer’s testimony recounting the moments before the shooting differed significantly from that of the defendants and three eyewitnesses. Available video evidence did not support the officer’s account of being assaulted with a broom and shovel.
Renee Good fatal shooting
Date and location: Jan. 7, 2026, in Minneapolis
What federal officials said initially: Noem described the incident as an “act of domestic terrorism” carried out against ICE officers by a woman who “attempted to run them over and rammed them with her vehicle." She said the immigration agent shot “defensively” to protect himself and the people around him. Good died of gunshot wounds to the head.
What came out later: Videos filmed from multiple angles challenged the administration’s narrative. Shortly before the shooting Good is seen at the wheel of her SUV that is parked diagonally on a street. She tells an immigration officer, “I'm not mad at you.”
Seconds later, another immigration officer grabs at the driver’s side door while Good’s wife urges her to “drive, baby, drive.” It’s unclear in the videos if the SUV makes contact with ICE officer Jonathan Ross, who shoots while standing in front of the vehicle and then twice more while quickly moving to the driver's side of the SUV as it pulls forward.
Alex Pretti fatal shooting
Date and location: Jan. 24, 2026, in Minneapolis
What federal officials said initially: Homeland Security spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin said Pretti approached Border Patrol officers with a handgun and he “violently resisted” when they tried to disarm him. An agent feared for his life and fired defensive shots, she said. Pretti was pronounced dead at the scene. Border Patrol senior official Greg Bovino claimed Pretti intended to “massacre law enforcement," and Deputy White House chief of staff Stephen Miller described him as “a would-be assassin."
What came out later: None of the half-dozen bystander videos collected by investigators showed Pretti brandishing his gun, which he had a permit to carry. The videos showed Pretti was holding his mobile phone as a masked Border Patrol officer opened fire.
In a tense hearing Thursday in Washington, Republican U.S. Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky made leaders tasked with carrying out Trump’s mass deportation agenda watch a video of the shooting while he repeatedly scrutinized the forceful tactics used by immigration agents. Paul argued that Pretti posed no threat to the agents and said it was clear from the video that he was “retreating at every moment.”
Silverio Villegas González fatal shooting
Date and location: Sept. 12, 2025, in suburban Chicago
What federal officials said initially: Homeland Security officials said federal agents were pursuing a man with a history of reckless driving who entered the country illegally. They alleged Silverio Villegas González drove at officers and dragged one with his car. DHS said the officer fired because he feared for his life and was hospitalized with “serious injuries."
What came out later: Body camera videos from local police contradicted the Trump administration’s account. Footage showed the agent who shot Villegas González walking around afterward and dismissing his own injuries as “nothing major.”
An autopsy made public in November declared Villegas González's death a homicide. The report showed he was shot at “close range,” with wounds to his neck and fingers.
Marimar Martinez non-fatal shooting
Date and location: Oct. 14, 2025, in Chicago
What federal officials said initially: A DHS news release asserted that Martinez and the driver of another car involved in a crash with a Border Patrol officer were “domestic terrorists.” An FBI agent said in court documents that she was chasing the Border Patrol vehicle and drove at one of the officers after they got out of the vehicle. The officer was forced to open fire, the FBI agent alleged, striking Martinez seven times. She was treated at a hospital and arrested on felony assault charges.
What came out later: Videos emerged that Martinez’s attorneys said showed agent Charles Exum steering his SUV into her truck.
In a text message presented during a Nov. 5 hearing, Exum appeared to brag about his marksmanship. “I fired 5 rounds and she had 7 holes. Put that in your book boys," the text read.
The case against her was dismissed.

As I see it | Western media criticism of the Jimmy Lai case verdict needs a fact check
While some critiques of the former media boss’ sentencing come down to different standards of governance and journalism, others are steeped in hypocrisy
There is this old British chestnut that says justice must not only be done, but must be seen to be done.
There is the reality of justice and the appearance of it, and the two don’t always or even usually coincide.
There are two main reasons behind the widespread Western criticism of Lai’s case. One is that Western standards and assumptions about governance and journalism are very different from China’s. I can respect them in the same way that I respect Islamic or Christian beliefs, though I am not a Christian or a Muslim. The other reason is the West’s inherent double standards, to which I do object.
Let’s start with the latter, which I will call the West’s fact-free criticism of the case.
I will cite several examples, the first from The New York Times, written by one of its most prominent commentators, titled “Dissidents are silenced, and the West moves on”.

Lebanon's Berri says parliamentary election must be held on time
Lebanese Parliament Speaker Nabih Berri said on Friday he was committed to holding a parliamentary election as scheduled on 10 May, despite calls from some politicians to postpone the vote.
Several politicians have called for a delay, citing security concerns in southern Lebanon, where Israel has carried out airstrikes in the region.
Berri, a Shia leader allied with Hezbollah, said in a statement carried by the state-run National News Agency that he had informed President Joseph Aoun and the government of his position.
"It is not permissible that, at the start of a new era, we obstruct its launch by disrupting, postponing or extending the most important constitutional entitlement, which is the foundation for forming authorities and producing political life," Berri said.
Berri has opened the candidacy registry for the election and submitted the first nomination request for the Tyre-Zahrani district in southern Lebanon.
Lebanon last held a parliamentary election in May 2022, a vote marked by low turnout and deep public anger over a financial collapse.
The election saw some gains by reformist candidates emerging from the 2019 protest movement, while the Iran-backed Hezbollah and its allies lost their parliamentary majority.

'Disordered eating': Former captain on relationship with food while playing

Former AFL captain Dyson Heppell speaks about unhealthy relationship with food during playing career
Former Essendon captain Dyson Heppell has spoken about the unhealthy relationship he had with food early in his career after entering footy's "horrendous" environment around body image.
"You would set yourself a target and if you came back from your off season to your preseason and you didn't hit that target, you would be put into a group that would have to do extra cross training — or some form of training to strip some fat off," Heppell said on I'm A Celebrity Get Me Out Of Here.
"And the boys hailed this group 'fat club'. It was a pretty vicious one, to be honest.
"The relationship with food and stuff was horrendous and body image and shocking.
"When I had a broken leg, so I'm on crutches all off season and I didn't hit my skinny targets, so I'm in fat club for pre-season. I was like, 'you kidding?'"
Heppell played 253 games for Essendon between 2011 and 2024.
Heppell said he would often obsess over his eating, including pre-preparing meals and being wary of eating when the team was away.
"Early in my career, I ended up with a pretty unhealthy relationship with food. And [it] wasn't a full eating disorder but it was … it was disordered eating," Heppell said.
"I'd hardly want to go out and eat."
Fellow contestant, former NRL player Luke Bateman, who played for the Canberra Raiders between 2015-2019, also said unofficial 'fat clubs' were present across rugby league.
In 2016 it was reported that Carlton had a 'fat club’, set by then-Blues coach Brendon Bolton and his fitness staff.
Measured by skin folds, if a player had more than 12 per cent body fat, they would be put into 'fat club' and have to undertake intense training before rejoining the main group.
At the time, sports administrator Brian Waldron condemned the initiative, saying it was socially irresponsible to name the group the 'fat club'.
"Surely they could call it something else," Waldron said on SEN.
"There will be kids walking around school today being told they're in the fat club and I think that is just social stupidity to be calling a group of players into a group they call the fat club."
In 2024, the AFL banned clubs from conducting skin fold testing on prospective draftees in a move that was widely panned by footy media critics.
For AFLW players and girls coming through the system, they could opt out entirely of being weighed.
A memo sent to clubs, addressed by Kate Hall and Grant Williams, read: "Body weights will only be measured by qualified High Performance/Sport Scientists, Sports Dietitians, or Medical Practitioners, in a safe and private setting. All data collected must be kept private."
Former AFL premiership-winning coach Paul Roos was among those critics, telling the ABC's new AFL Daily podcast that if players were worried about skin folds, they should "go and find another job".
However, former players continue to speak out about unhealthy habits around food and weight obsession during their playing days.
Recently, former GWS player Cooper Hamilton has spoken widely across social media about body dysmorphia and his struggles with an eating disorder during his career.
He said he would avoid seeing friends or doing anything socially if it involved food and would often go into games under-fuelled.
Moreover, the ABC uncovered elite female athletes' struggles with body image and disordered eating in a recent survey.
While the AFL has taken significant steps to reduce the emphasis on player weight and body image obsession in recent years, it remains an issue across clubs.
When Heppell was asked if AFL clubs still did 'fat club', he answered emphatically: "Still a thing."

US paid US$35 million to deport 300 to remote islands, African nations
The bulk of the money – US$32 million – went to Equatorial Guinea, Rwanda, El Salvador, Palau and eSwatini
The Trump administration spent more than US$35 million to deport roughly 300 migrants to countries they had no connection to, doling out millions of dollars in lump sum transfers to foreign governments without a system to track how the money was used, according to a report released on Friday.
The White House has argued that this method is necessary to remove undocumented criminals whose home nations would not take them.
Immigration groups that have challenged the practice in court have said the practice had wide-ranging effects on law-abiding non-citizens who were at risk of being sent to unfamiliar countries with little, if any, opportunity to fight it.

Risk of missteps hangs over US-backed ceasefire deal in north-east Syria
Sign up now: Get ST's newsletters delivered to your inbox
DAMASCUS – A US-backed ceasefire agreement in north-eastern Syria
The progress of the deal tests the ability of Syria’s new leaders to stabilise a nation fractured by 14 years of war, following several bouts of violence pitting it against minority groups who are suspicious of the Islamist-led government.
The struggle for Syria’s north-east has brought the biggest shift in control since former leader Bashar al-Assad was ousted in December 2024.
After months of deadlock, Damascus seized swathes of territory from the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) before agreeing to the plan that foresees its remaining enclave being integrated into the state.
Preliminary steps have gone smoothly since the Jan 29 agreement: small contingents of government forces have deployed into two Kurdish-run cities, fighters have withdrawn from front lines, and Damascus on Feb 13 announced the appointment of a regional governor nominated by the Kurds.
But a dozen government and Kurdish officials said core issues had yet to be tackled, including precisely how SDF fighters will be integrated, the fate of SDF heavy weapons, and arrangements for a border crossing to Iraq that has been an SDF lifeline.
For now, the SDF has a firm grip over areas it still holds. But the question of how much authority the SDF would retain had yet to be answered, said Mr Noah Bonsey of International Crisis Group, a think-tank.
He said further progress in implementing the deal currently looked like the most likely scenario, “but the risk... of missteps, and thus, ultimately the risk of renewed escalation is still high”.
Washington pleased with progress, urges flexibility
Syria’s President Ahmed al-Sharaa has now brought almost all of Syria back under central control.
A Western official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Washington, which withdrew some forces from Syria this week, is pleased with progress toward integration and has urged Mr Sharaa to be as flexible as possible with SDF requests.
The US advice is: avoid taking a hard line as a sign of goodwill, since a degree of autonomy for Kurds is desirable as long as it does not threaten the core need for central authority in Damascus, the official said.
Asked for comment, the US State Department referred to a statement by Syria envoy Tom Barrack in which he said the agreement paved the way for lasting peace for all Syrians. Syria’s information ministry and the SDF did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
The agreement, a copy of which was seen by Reuters, foresees the defence ministry establishing a division for the north-east, integrating SDF forces into three brigades.
It stipulates that 15 government security vehicles would deploy into each of the SDF-held cities of Qamishli and Hasakah, and that “integration of SDF security forces” would begin.
Deployments in February were largely incident-free, in stark contrast to the government’s attempt to enter Druze-majority Sweida in July 2025, which led to deadly violence. The US, meanwhile, has moved thousands of Islamic State prisoners formerly guarded by the SDF to Iraq.
But there are also signs of friction on the ground.
The SDF accuses the government of besieging Kobani, a Kurdish-run town cut off from the main SDF enclave, while Arabs living in SDF areas are resentful of its continued control, notably in ethnically mixed Hasakah city, according to two Syrian security officials.
SDF commander Mazloum Abdi has said the three brigades comprising SDF fighters will be based in Qamishli, Hasakah and Derik, near the Iraqi border. But officials on both sides said that while there was a tentative understanding on a location near Qamishli, the other two had yet to be agreed.
The SDF wants one stationed on Mount Abdelaziz near Hasakah city, overlooking its southern approaches and an extensive network of tunnels, Syrian military sources said. Damascus objects to this.
Kurdish official sees security in Kurdish hands
Arab-majority areas fell quickly to the government advance, including Deir al-Zor province and its oil fields. But the deal requires the SDF to hand over two other fields near Qamishli – Rmeilan and Sweidiya – and Qamishli airport. This has yet to happen.
A regional intelligence officer described SDF concessions so far as symbolic.
Mr Abdulkarim Omar, a senior Kurdish official, told Reuters that government security forces would withdraw after coordinating and finalising “integration mechanisms”.
“The Asayish (Kurdish security forces) will be part of the interior ministry, and they are the ones who will protect this region from within,” he said, adding that “lengthy discussions” were needed on the agreement’s implementation.
Turkey has also indicated lingering doubts. It views the Kurdish YPG militia, the SDF’s backbone, as an extension of the Kurdistan Workers’ Party (PKK), which staged a decades-long insurgency in Turkey before entering a peace process.
Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan said the YPG’s withdrawal created a “healthier” security map, but Turkey’s security concerns would only be fully addressed when YPG severs links to the PKK and undergoes a “historic transformation”. REUTERS

Trump seeks to force voter ID for midterm elections

Trump seeks to force voter ID for midterm elections
February 14, 2026US President Donald Trump said on Friday that he intended push through voter ID requirements for the November midterm elections.
Held in the middle of a presidential term, midterm elections are usually regarded as a referendum on the sitting president's policies.
Electoral rules are largely managed by individual states, not the federal government in Washington. Some states already mande photo ID to vote, while many others do not.
Trump to present legal justification 'shortly'
The US leader took to his Truth social media platform and accused the Democrats of opposing voter identification because "they want to continue to cheat in elections," without providing evidence to support the claim.
"There will be voter ID for the midterm elections, whether approved by Congress or not!" Trump said, giving no legal rationale to underpin his assertion.
"If we can't get it through Congress, there are legal reasons why this SCAM is not permitted. I will be presenting them shortly, in the form of an executive order," Trump wrote.
The US president did not go as far as explaining how he would go about imposing such rules, which critics contend would prevent millions of legitimate voters from participating in the vote.
The Brennan Center for Justice found more than 21 million Americans lack easy access to such documents.
In its analysis, the nonpartisan law and policy institute said it would "disenfranchise Americans of all ages," especially young people and ethnic minorities.
The SAVE America Act
Trump is backing a bill that would require proof of citizenship in order to register to vote.
The Republican controlled House on Wednesday passed the SAVE America Act that would also require voters to show a photo ID before being allowed to cast a ballot.
The bill, which faces stiff Democrat opposition, is not expected to make it past the Senate, where it needs 60 votes to pass before heading to the president's desk to be signed.
Republicans control 53 seats, and there is opposition within GOP ranks to the bill.

US military strikes another alleged drug boat in Caribbean, killing 3
The U.S. military says it has carried out another deadly strike on a vessel accused of trafficking drugs in the Caribbean Sea
- Bookmark
The U.S. military said Friday that it has carried out another deadly strike on a vessel accused of trafficking drugs in the Caribbean Sea.
U.S. Southern Command said on social media that the boat “was transiting along known narco-trafficking routes in the Caribbean and was engaged in narco-trafficking operations.” It said the strike killed three people. A video linked to the post shows a boat moving through the water before exploding in flames.
Friday’s attack raises the death toll from the Trump administration’s strikes on alleged drug boats to 133 people in at least 38 attacks carried out since early September in the Caribbean Sea and eastern Pacific Ocean.
U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth declared last week that “some top cartel drug-traffickers” in the region “have decided to cease all narcotics operations INDEFINITELY due to recent (highly effective) kinetic strikes in the Caribbean.” However, Hegseth did not provide any details or information to back up this claim, made in a post on his personal account on social media.
President Donald Trump has said the U.S. is in “armed conflict” with cartels in Latin America and has justified the attacks as a necessary escalation to stem the flow of drugs. But his administration has offered little evidence to support its claims of killing “narcoterrorists.”

Trump threatens to enforce voter ID for the midterm elections: ‘Approved by Congress or not!’
The president’s warning also included a direct, unusual appeal to the Supreme Court
- Bookmark
- CommentsGo to comments
President Trump vowed to impose voter ID requirements ahead of the midterms, with or without congressional approval, the latest escalation of his campaign to assert more control over elections, which he baselessly claims Democrats have been rigging against him and others.
“We cannot let the Democrats get away with NO VOTER I.D. any longer,” the president wrote in a Truth Social post on Friday afternoon. “These are horrible, disingenuous CHEATERS.”
“I have searched the depths of Legal Arguments not yet articulated or vetted on this subject, and will be presenting an irrefutable one in the very near future,” he wrote in another post. “There will be Voter I.D. for the Midterm Elections, whether approved by Congress or not!”
The president, in his posts, also made an unusually partisan direct address to the Supreme Court, claiming that if the status quo remained, Democrats would eventually try to pack the court with an expanded number of justices, end the filibuster in Congress, and add additional U.S. states.
“Our Country will never be the same if they allow these demented and evil people to knowingly, and happily, destroy it,” Trump wrote.
The comments alarmed critics of the president.
“Trump’s authoritarian takeover and interference in the midterm elections under the guise of ‘election integrity’ has begun,” Melanie D’Arrigo, executive director of the advocacy group Campaign for New York Health, wrote on X.
This week, the House passed the SAVE Act along party lines, which would require proof of citizenship to vote and let the Department of Homeland Security seize voter rolls.
Republicans supporting the bill echoed the president’s unfounded claims of mass election interference from Democrats.
“Cheating is the only path to victory,” Representative Mary Miller, Republican of Illinois, told The New York Times.
Critics of the effort, which is unlikely to advance through the Senate, accuse the Republicans of pursuing a thinly veiled attempt at voter disenfranchisement, given that it is already illegal for non-citizens to vote, and millions of Americans don’t possess the legal documents, like a passport, that would help them prove their citizenship.
Almost all states require voters to attest that they are citizens to vote, under penalty of perjury.
Earlier this month, a federal judge in Washington blocked parts of a previous Trump executive order requiring documented proof of citizenship when military members register to vote and mandating agencies “assess citizenship” before providing federal voting forms.
"Put simply, our Constitution does not allow the President to impose unilateral changes to federal election procedures," U.S. District Judge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly wrote.
The Constitution leaves administering elections largely to the states, but President Trump has continued to push for more federal involvement, an effort rooted in his continued insistence that non-citizens are cheating in elections, even though analysis, including a review by the Trump administration, suggests this barely ever happens and does not sway elections.
Earlier this month, the president called on Republicans to “nationalize” elections.
The White House has said it can offer “no guarantee” that federal immigration agents won’t be present at polling stations, as MAGA allies like podcaster and former White House strategist Steve Bannon have pushed to use armed immigration agents to “surround the polls.”
The Justice Department has sued multiple states to force them to turn over voter registration information.
Leaders in Illinois accused the administration of using federal force there to dampen civic participation and voter turnout in future elections.
Gov. JB Pritzker called the efforts a way to “circumvent our democracy, militarize our cities, and end elections.”

U.S. women's hockey tops Italy 6-0 to advance to Winter Olympics semifinals

U.S. women's hockey tops Italy 6-0 to advance to Winter Olympics semifinals
The upstart Italians didn't make it easy on the Americans, and that's everything veteran forward Kelly Pannek could have asked for as the top-seeded U.S. continued its run through the Olympic women's hockey tournament.
A festive atmosphere, a determined opponent, a little chippiness and a 6-0 win in which 13 players — led by Kendall Coyne Schofield's two goals — registered at least a point.
"It feels like right now we're finding different ways within our identity to get the job done," Pannek said. "And it's taken every single person on the ice on our team and our staff to do it. And it feels like we're still building to what we really can be."
After a first period in which the Americans outshot Italy 20-2, but only led 1-0 on Megan Keller's goal, the U.S finally broke through with a five-goal second period.
Laila Edwards, Hannah Bilka and Britta Curl-Salemme also scored. Gwyneth Philips finished with six saves as the Americans posted their fourth straight shutout.
The Group A-winning U.S. has outscored its opponents by a combined 26-1 in winning all five games, with the lone goal allowed in a 5-1 tournament-opening win over Czechia.
With Coyne Schofield, Lee Stecklein and Grace Zumwinkle making the scoresheet Friday, the U.S. has only two skaters — defenders Cayla Barnes and Rory Guilday — without a point.
"At the other day I think it's everyone's willing to do whatever it takes to be a part of the success of this team," Coyne Schofield said. "And whatever role's asked of us on a given night, that's what we're going to do."
Now two wins away from winning its third Olympic gold medal, the U.S. advanced to the semifinals on Monday. The Americans will play either Sweden, after the Group B winner upset Czechia 2-0 earlier in the day, or Germany, should the seventh-seeded team knock off Canada in its quarterfinal on Saturday.
Finland faces Switzerland in the other quarterfinal on Saturday.
The game on Friday featured dueling chants, with each chorus of "USA! USA! USA!" met with an even louder "EEE-TA-LIA!"
Italy stood little chance making its second Olympic appearance, each time as the host team. Advancing to the knockout round was considered an accomplishment for the Italians, who went 2-2 in the preliminary round, and after going 0-4 at the 2006 Turin Games.
Goalie Gabriella Durante stole the show by stopping 19 of 20 shots through the opening period, and 45 overall.
"There's definitely obviously sadness and disappointment, but at the same time, I don't think the team has any regrets in how hard we played," said Durante, who noted the team watched the movie "Miracle," about the U.S. men's run in the 1980 Olympics, as motivation the night before.
"We were just believing from the very start. And obviously the second it got away from us a little bit, but at the same time like it's the best in the world," she added. "I'll remember it for the rest of my life, the crowd specifically, the atmosphere."
Things also got heated following a scuffle after Bilka scored to put the U.S. up 6-0 late in the second period. As Abbey Murphy and Italy's Franziska Stocker were sent off for penalties, U.S. coach John Wroblewski began shouting across the bench at Italy coach Eric Bouchard.
Wroblewski said he was unhappy with the calls seeming to favor the Italians, because Murphy stepped in after Bilka was cross-checked from behind.
"I think his team got frustrated for sure," Bouchard said. "They're the best hockey team in the world, and they found a way to capitalize on their chances. But that third period, the girls never quit."
Sweden upsets Czechia 2-0
Coach Ulf Lundberg declared "the time is now" for Sweden before the women's hockey tournament opened.
A little more than a week and five wins later, his young, talented and fearless team has delivered.
Hanna Olsson scored, Ebba Traff Svensson stopped 29 shots, and Sweden upset Czechia 2-0 on Friday to advance to the semifinal round for the first time in 12 years.
"It's a wonderful feeling," Lundberg said of a team that has finished no better than sixth at the past five world championships. "Going back to the worlds in the Czech Republic, we were close. But everyone talks about when are they going to take the step to the semifinal? And now we have done it. I'm so satisfied."
After Olsson scored a power-play goal 4:47 into the second period, Hilda Svensson sparked a huge celebration by sealing the victory with an empty-net goal with 25 seconds remaining.
Sweden had not advanced to the semifinals since finishing fourth at the 2014 Sochi Games. And the nation is in position to earn its third Olympic medal, and first since winning silver at the 2006 Turin Games, when Sweden upset the U.S. in the semifinals.
The Swedes feature a young, talented roster made up of a core of the team that won silver at the 2018 Under-18 championships. There are eight players 22 and younger, with seven currently competing at U.S. colleges. They include Svensson, the 19-year-old Ohio State freshman, who's tied for seventh in the nation with 44 points (15 goals, 29 assists) in 26 games.
Sweden entered the quarterfinals as the tournament's sixth seed after going 4-0 through preliminary round play to win the Group B title.
Czechia's Klara Peslarova finished with 21 saves.
The loss was a major disappointment for a Czech team on the rise since finishing seventh in its Olympic debut at the 2022 Beijing Games. Czechia has since won two bronze medals — its first in women's play — and finished fourth twice over the past four world championships.
"There's just no words for this. It hurts. It's going to hurt for a long time," Natalie Mlynkova said. "We were supposed to have this one."

Federal immigration officials plan to spend $38.3 billion to boost detention capacity to 92,600 beds, a document released Friday shows, as U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement quietly purchases warehouses to turn into detention and processing facilities.
Republican New Hampshire Gov. Kelly Ayotte posted the document online amid tension over ICE's plans to convert a warehouse in Merrimack into a 500-bed processing center.
It said ICE plans 16 regional processing centers with a population of 1,000 to 1,500 detainees, whose stays would average three to seven days. Another eight large-scale detention centers would be capable of housing 7,000 to 10,000 detainees for periods averaging less than 60 days.
The document also refers to the acquisition of 10 existing “turnkey” facilities.
Plans call for all of them to be up and running by November as immigration officials roll out a massive $45 billion expansion of detention facilities financed by President Donald Trump’s recent tax-cutting law.
More than 75,000 immigrants were being detained by ICE as of mid-January, up from 40,000 when Trump took office a year earlier, according to federal data released last week.
The newly released document refers to “non-traditional facilities” and comes as ICE has quietly bought at least seven warehouses — some larger than 1 million square feet (92,900 square meters) — in the past few weeks in Arizona, Georgia, Maryland, Pennsylvania and Texas.
Warehouse purchases in six cities were scuttled when buyers decided not to sell under pressure from activists. Several other deals in places like New York are imminent, however.
City officials are frequently unable to get details from ICE until a property sale is finalized.
Tensions boiled to the surface after interim ICE Director Todd Lyons testified Thursday that the Department of Homeland Security “has worked with Gov. Ayotte” and provided her with an economic impact summary.
Ayotte said that assertion was “simply not true” and the summary was sent hours after Lyons testified.
The document mistakenly refers to the “ripple effects to the Oklahoma economy” and revenue generated by state sales and income taxes, neither of which exist in New Hampshire.
“Director Lyons’ comments today are another example of the troubling pattern of issues with this process,” Ayotte said. “Officials from the Department of Homeland Security continue to provide zero details of their plans for Merrimack, never mind providing any reports or surveys.”
DHS did not respond to questions about Ayotte's comments or the new document. But it previously confirmed that it was looking for more detention space, although it objected to calling the sites “warehouses,” saying in a statement that they would be “very well structured detention facilities meeting our regular detention standards.”

The IDF has for the first time published data detailing the foreign citizenships held by its service members, revealing that tens of thousands of soldiers hold at least one additional nationality beyond Israeli citizenship.
In response to a Freedom of Information request submitted in March last year by the Israeli nonprofit Hatzlacha and published on the British website Declassified, the military said 50,632 service members hold an additional foreign citizenship.
According to the data, 4,440 soldiers hold two foreign citizenships in addition to their Israeli citizenship, while 162 hold three foreign citizenships beyond their Israeli nationality.
The IDF presented the information in two columns: one listing service members with one foreign citizenship in addition to Israeli citizenship, and another listing those with at least two foreign citizenships. The military noted that some individuals may be counted in both columns.
The figures show that 12,135 soldiers hold U.S. citizenship, 6,127 hold French citizenship and 5,067 hold Russian citizenship in addition to their Israeli nationality. More than 3,000 service members hold German and Ukrainian citizenship, respectively, while more than 1,000 hold British, Romanian, Polish, Ethiopian and Canadian citizenship.
The list also includes a small number of soldiers with citizenship from Arab countries. Fourteen service members hold Yemeni citizenship in addition to Israeli citizenship and eight hold at least two foreign citizenships including Yemen. Fifteen soldiers hold Tunisian citizenship in addition to Israeli citizenship and seven hold multiple foreign citizenships including Tunisia. Four hold Lebanese citizenship, three hold Syrian citizenship and one holds Algerian citizenship, according to the data.

India vs Pakistan: Eager fans brave surge in travel costs for T20 World Cup
Despite soaring travel costs and ticketing challenges, desperate Indian fans travel to Colombo for the match on Sunday.
Mumbai, India — For Indian cricket fans travelling to Sri Lanka this weekend, the opportunity to watch their team take on archrivals Pakistan in the T20 World Cup has come at the cost of inflated airfares, soaring hotel prices and a long wait for matchday tickets.
But these are mere sacrifices that thousands are willing to make to witness the most heated rivalry in the sport as it unfolds on Sunday at the R Premadasa Stadium in Colombo.

- list 2 of 2How India-Pakistan cricket relations went from bad to worse – a timeline
Fuelled by a decades-long fraught political relationship, cricket encounters between India and Pakistan are among the biggest spectacles in sport — often framed as bloodthirsty contests of national pride.
For the first time in the history of the World Cup, geopolitical tensions threatened to put the marquee contest in doubt until Pakistan’s government reversed its order for a boycott of the match.
While the near-last-minute U-turn revived excitement, it came at a price for the Indian supporters making late travel plans. Pakistan’s participation was confirmed only six days before the fixture, triggering a sharp surge in airfares from several Indian cities.
Fans who booked their air tickets weeks in advance, too, paid significantly higher fares due to the significantly higher demand surrounding any India-Pakistan match, which is commonly deemed the most lucrative fixture in cricket.
“I paid a premium of approximately 50 percent compared to the usual rates,” Aditya Chheda, a finance professional from Mumbai, told Al Jazeera. “This was despite booking a month in advance and opting for a layover instead of a direct flight.”
Flight, hotel prices skyrocket
A nonstop round-trip journey from India’s western metropolis Mumbai to Colombo, which typically costs approximately $275, went upwards of $1,000 two days before the match.
Similar fares were spotted for nonstop journeys from Bengaluru in southern India, while round-trip nonstop flights from Chennai to Colombo – a route that takes only about an hour and 20 minutes – had surged to at least $550, up from its usual fare of $165.
Planning ahead helped Bengaluru resident Parth Chauhan secure deals at a good price, but his friends accompanying him to Colombo had to pay a steep premium – three times the usual cost – after booking closer to the match date.
Accommodation costs rose sharply as well. Tariffs at five-star hotels in Colombo ranged between $400 and $1,000 per night from Saturday to Monday, when most spectators were expected to fly in and out.
Chauhan, who works in a cybersecurity organisation, had to wait a whopping four hours in a virtual queue to buy match tickets, but he insists the hassle was worth the wait, as he gears up to watch India play abroad for the first time.
“It’s an opportune moment, and there is a lot of exuberance to witness this because it’s a historic fixture,” he said.
For a lucky few, the surprise came not from the difficulty of securing tickets but from their unusually low price. Piyush Nathani, an IT professional from Bengaluru, paid only $5 for the fixture, which draws millions in broadcast, sponsor and advertising revenue.
“This is the cheapest ticket I’ve ever purchased. Just $5 to watch a World Cup match, that too of the magnitude of India vs Pakistan, is a steal,” said Nathani, who has travelled with a group of six friends.
‘More than a cricket match’
Having been part of the Ahmedabad crowd in 2023 that saw India beat Pakistan in a 50-over World Cup group game, Nathani is relishing the chance to watch Sunday’s match in a neutral venue, where fans from both countries are expected to be present.
“The feeling of beating Pakistan is something money cannot buy,” added the 29-year-old.
Like Nathani, Chheda has also travelled abroad previously to watch Team India. The 32-year-old watched India lift the 2024 T20 World Cup in Barbados and now wants to “pick up where I left off”.
“When there’s a World Cup, the first thing Indian fans hope for is to beat Pakistan,” he added.
“Winning the World Cup is the biggest target, but beating Pakistan feels like a moral victory – it’s more than a cricket match.”

WASHINGTON, February 14. /TASS/. US President Donald Trump said Tehran was reportedly not demonstrating readiness to take concrete measures in order to reach an agreement on its nuclear program.
"I would say they want to talk. But so far they do a lot of talking and no action," the US leader said, speaking about the Iranian government.
When asked what Iran should do to avert a US attack, Trump replied: "Give us the deal that they should have given us the first time."
"If they give us a right deal, we won’t do that," the US leader added. "Historically, they haven’t done that."
Trump stated on January 26 that Washington had sent a "big armada" towards Iran, and expressed hope that Tehran would engage in dialogue and make a deal, renouncing nuclear weapons. The US leader warned that "the next attack will be far worse" than the summer 2025 strikes on Iran. "Don't make that happen again," he added.
Iran and the US held another round of talks on Tehran’s nuclear program in Oman on February 6. Tehran’s delegation was led by Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi, and the US delegation was headed by Special Presidential Envoy Steve Witkoff.

US military kills 3 in latest attack on boat in the Caribbean
At least 133 people have been killed in US attacks on vessels in the Caribbean Sea and Pacific Ocean since September.
The United States military has attacked a boat in the Caribbean Sea, killing three people, as it continues deadly air strikes that have killed at least 133 people since September 2025.
US Southern Command (SOUTHCOM), which oversees military operations in Latin America and the Caribbean, said US forces “conducted a lethal kinetic strike” earlier on Friday, killing three people.

The US military again repeated its claim, without providing any evidence, that it was targeting people suspected of drug trafficking, and described those slain in the attack as “narco-terrorists”.
SOUTHCOM released a video of the attack that appears to show a missile strike on the boat which then explodes into flames, leaving the vessel obliterated.
International law and human rights experts have repeatedly said such attacks amount to extrajudicial executions, even if those targeted are alleged to be engaged in trafficking drugs.
The killings on Friday follow an attack on Monday in the eastern Pacific Ocean, where SOUTHCOM said it struck a vessel, killing two people and leaving one survivor.
SOUTHCOM said it had notified the US Coast Guard that there was a survivor from the attack, but did not provide details on the survivor’s condition or chances of rescue and survival.
The first attack by US forces on vessels in international waters, which took place in September 2025, included a follow-up strike that killed survivors who were clinging to the wreckage of a destroyed boat.
US administration officials, including Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth and the commander of the operation, Admiral Frank Bradley, were placed under scrutiny for the order to carry out the second attack on survivors.
Legal experts said that the US military could be involved in a crime for killing the survivors of a shipwreck.
According to monitors and tallies kept by media organisations, the US has now carried out some 38 attacks against 40 vessels in the eastern Pacific and Caribbean Sea, killing at least 133 people, including an attack that killed two people earlier this week.
US President Donald Trump has said the US is engaged in an “armed conflict” with cartels in Latin America and has justified the attacks as a necessary escalation to stem the flow of drugs to the US.
Legal experts have said that the US has no legal right to carry out attacks in international waters and that people alleged to be involved with drug trafficking have a right to due process under the law.

Indian writer Arundhati Roy pulls out of Berlin Film Festival over Gaza war
Award-winning Indian writer Arundhati Roy said Friday she was withdrawing from the Berlin Film Festival over jury president Wim Wenders's comments that cinema should "stay out of politics" when asked about Gaza.
Roy said in a statement sent to AFP that she was "shocked and disgusted" by responses from Wenders and other jury members to a question about the Palestinian territory at a press conference on Thursday.
Roy, whose novel The God of Small Things won the 1997 Booker Prize, had been announced as a festival guest to present a restored version of the 1989 film "In Which Annie Gives It Those Ones", in which she starred and wrote the screenplay.
However, she said that the "unconscionable" statements by Wenders and other jury members had led her to reconsider, "with deep regret".
When asked about Germany's support for Israel at a press conference on Thursday, Wenders said: "We cannot really enter the field of politics", describing filmmakers as "the counterweight to politics".
Fellow jury member Ewa Puszczynska said it was a "little bit unfair" to expect the jury to take a direct stance on the issue.
Roy said in her statement that "to hear them say that art should not be political is jaw-dropping".
She described Israel's war on Gaza as "a genocide of the Palestinian people by the State of Israel".
"If the greatest filmmakers and artists of our time cannot stand up and say so, they should know that history will judge them," she said.
Roy is one of India's most famous living authors and is a trenchant critic of Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government, as well as a firm supporter of the Palestinian cause.
Restored versions of two films by late Egyptian directors, "Sad Song of Touha" by Atteyat Al Abnoudy and "The Dislocation of Amber" by Hussein Shariffe, have also been withdrawn from the festival over its stance on Gaza.
"The Berlinale respects these decisions," a spokeswoman said in a statement sent to AFP.
"We regret that we will not welcome them as their presence would have enriched the festival discourse," she said.
Shying away from politics
The Berlinale traditionally has a reputation for topical, progressive programming, but so far this year's edition has seen several stars shy away from taking a stance on the big political issues of the day.
US actor Neil Patrick Harris, who stars in the film "Sunny Dancer", was asked on Friday if he considered his art to be political and if it could help "fight the rise of fascism".
He replied that he was "interested in doing things that are apolitical" and which could help people find connection in our "strangely algorithmic and divided world".
This year's Honorary Golden Bear recipient, Malaysian actor Michelle Yeoh, also demurred when asked to comment on US politics in a press conference on Friday, saying she "cannot presume to say I understand" the situation there.
This is not the first edition of the festival to run into controversy over the Gaza war.
In 2024, the festival's documentary award went to "No Other Land", which follows the dispossession of Palestinian communities in the Israeli-occupied West Bank.
German government officials criticised "one-sided" remarks about Gaza by the directors of that film and others at that year's awards ceremony.
Israel's genocidal war has left at least 72,000 people dead in Gaza, according to its health ministry, whose figures the UN considers reliable.

Brisbane’s big chill: Rain and cloud bring end to sweltering heat
Brisbane residents woke up to a cold snap on Saturday, with a maximum temperature of 24 degrees forecast.
The temperature is expected to remain cool on Sunday and Monday before rising again.
“It’s quite a bit cooler with all the cloud around, and there’s still a fair bit of shower activity,” meteorologist Daniel Hayes said.
“It will be pretty similar for today and tomorrow. We should start to see the skies clearing a little bit early next week, and we’ll see those temperatures warming up again.
“We’re still likely to see shower activity around today, and potentially increasing again tomorrow.”
Hayes said Sunday could see “rain rather than showers, at least for a period”, with 20 to 30 millimetres possible across parts of the city.
The showers were expected to continue on Monday morning before easing to a dry afternoon.
“After that, there’s very little activity expected for the rest of next week,” Hayes said.
Temperatures will warm up from Tuesday, but will remain at or below average.
“We’re back to around 29 degrees from Tuesday onwards, and then we sit around 30 to 31 through until the end of next week,” Hayes said.
Heavy rain and storms hit Brisbane on Thursday evening, bringing an end to the severe heat that had hung over the city for much of the week.
The temperature in Brisbane city hit 35 degrees on Thursday, while Ipswich residents sweltered through 37 degrees. On Friday, temperatures dropped by almost 10 degrees.
A flood watch is in place for south-east Queensland, with rapid river rises possible in areas that receive the heaviest rainfall.
Catchments that may be affected include the Logan and Albert rivers, Gold Coast and Sunshine Coast rivers and creeks, and the Burnett, Mary, Noosa, Pine and Caboolture rivers.
The Upper Brisbane River may be impacted, though the affected portion of the lower section will be contained to the Brewer River, and Warrill, Lockyer, Laidley, Ipswich and Brisbane creeks.

Four people have been indicted on federal charges stemming from clashes with federal officers in Minneapolis, including one woman who is accused of biting off an immigration officer’s fingertip.
The three others were charged in connection with threats made to FBI agents after documents containing the agents' personal information was stolen from a vehicle.
According to sworn statements filed in those cases, the FBI agents were investigating a shooting by an Immigration Customs Enforcement Officer on Jan. 14 when protests made the area unsafe and they had to flee on foot, leaving behind two of their vehicles. The vehicles were vandalized and broken into, and several things were stolen including guns, FBI identification cards and documents that included addresses, phone numbers and other personal information of some FBI employees.
That personal information was then posted on social media, according to the court documents, and that's when the officers began receiving threatening phone calls, text messages and emails.
Woman accused of biting off immigration officer’s fingertip
Claire Louise Feng, 27, is accused of biting off the fingertip of a special agent from Homeland Security Investigations during a Jan. 24 protest that happened after immigration officers shot and killed Alex Pretti. Feng, who is from St. Paul, Minnesota, was indicted on the charge of assaulting a federal officer resulting in injury.
In an affidavit filed in the case, Homeland Security Investigations special agent Bronson Day said an immigration officer was attempting to arrest another protester when Feng tackled the officer. A Customs and Border Protection officer took Feng to the ground and was trying to secure her arms when Feng bit the officer’s finger through a glove, Day wrote.
The day was very cold and the officer didn’t immediately realize the severity of the injury, Day wrote, but when the officer removed his glove, he realized the tip of his ring finger had been removed, exposing the bone. He was able to get medical attention within an hour, Day wrote.
Feng’s attorney, Kevin C. Riach, said she would fight the charge.
“All you have to do to assess the credibility of ICE (Immigration and Customs Enforcement) agents when they make allegations like this is to look at yesterday’s dismissal that confirmed ICE agents have made false allegations against a defendant,” Riach said. “We look forward to fighting this case and clearing Ms. Feng’s name.”
3 people indicted in threats to FBI agents
Brenna Marie Doyle, 18, of Spokane, Washington, was indicted Thursday on charges of threatening to murder a federal law enforcement officer, threatening to murder a federal law enforcement officer’s family member and interstate transmission of a threat to injure a person. The indictment alleges she left voice messages on the FBI agent's phone threatening to kill them and their spouse and child.
Doyle hasn't entered a plea yet, and her attorney Robert D. Richman said they were waiting to receive evidence from the government so they can evaluate the case. He noted Doyle lives in Washington state and has never been to Minnesota.
“There is no allegation that she took any steps whatsoever to carry out any of these threats or come within a thousand miles of the agent,” Richman said.
James Patrick Lyons, 45, of California was indicted on five counts of interstate transmission of threats to injure a person, and Jose Alberto Ramirez, 29, of Illinois was indicted on one count of the same charge. Both men are accused of sending threatening text messages to FBI employees.
Attorneys for Ramirez and Lyons did not immediately respond to messages requesting comment. Neither man has had the opportunity to enter a plea.

Will allowing more Hong Kong schools to teach in English be too testing for pupils?
After decades of debate, authorities and schools sector say time is right to adjust the language policy but some argue move is mainly political
Throughout her secondary schooling at Yan Chai Hospital Law Chan Chor Si College in Kowloon Bay, only science subjects, such as maths and biology, were taught in English as the school adopted Chinese as the medium of instruction (CMI).
Chan, 19, felt that she lacked the vocabulary needed to tell a compelling story and often compared herself with peers from schools with English as their medium of instruction (EMI).
“I felt hesitant the moment I started writing,” she said. “I questioned whether my plot would be as well written or creative as those of students from EMI schools. I thought my writing was formulaic and lagged behind.”
Chan said she was not alone, as her struggles were shared by many other students who graduated from CMI schools when they entered higher education.

Scientists say they now know what went wrong with Johnson & Johnson’s Covid vaccine
Some people who took the shots developed a rare and severe type of blood clot called VITT
- Bookmark
- CommentsGo to comments
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration authorized Johnson & Johnson’s Covid vaccine for emergency use in February 2021, nearly a year into the global pandemic that would go on to kill more than one million Americans.
Just over two years later, the agency requested the voluntary withdrawal of the authorization, following cases of a “rare and severe” type of blood clot in people who had gotten the shot called “VITT.”
Now, Australian researchers say they finally know what happened with the shots and the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine in Europe.
The people who developed the clots had a reaction to the virus used to make the shots, known as adenovirus. And, they were genetically prone to the reaction.
“By modifying or removing this specific adenovirus protein, future vaccines can avoid this extremely rare reaction while continuing to provide strong protection against disease,” Flinders University researcher Dr. Jing Wang said in a statement.
So, what happens?
When people get the shots, the body’s immune system can accidentally confuse a normal protein from adenovirus - which is used to ferry coronavirus DNA into our cells, leading to the creation of antibodies that protect us from the disease - with a protein found in the blood called PF4.
It’s this confusion that triggers the production of a dangerous blood antibody that leads to clotting, the researchers said. Known as an autoantibody, it mistakenly attacks the host.
Building on years of previous research that examined PF4 and antibodies from vaccines, they found this out by using a mass spectrometer, an instrument that works to identify and quantify molecules within a sample.
“A novel aspect of the paper was our use of powerful mass spectrometry sequencing to identify molecular mimicry between the adenovirus vector protein and the PF4 culprit target,” Wang said.
“This was the missing link that explains how a normal immune response can, in very rare cases, become harmful.”
Nowhere to go but forward
The FDA and CDC reported that 15 cases of VITT had been reported in 2021, with all cases occurring in women between the ages of 18 and 59 years old.
They experienced symptoms between six and 15 days after receiving the vaccine.
And, hundreds of other cases have been reported in Europe, although little data has been made available regarding cases reported elsewhere.
Some researchers have estimated a death rate for VITT of more than 20 percent.
For patients who have a very low platelet count and have experienced a brain hemorrhage following blood clots in the brain, however, the risk of death jumps to 73 percent, according to University College London.
But the new research can help to prevent this rare problem entirely, the Australians say.
“Researchers say the findings will help ensure future vaccines built on this technology remain effective, accessible and even safer, particularly in regions where adenovirus‑vector vaccines are critical tools for disease prevention,” Flinders University wrote.

Stung by online critics who accuse her of neglect over morning meal choices, woman gets creative with bizarre line-up of dishes
A mother from eastern China who faced online criticism for making simple breakfasts has turned heads and gone viral with her bizarre breakfast creations.
Clothing shop owner Zhang Liping from Zhejiang province lives with her husband and their 16-year-old son.
Last December, Zhang casually posted videos on social media of her son’s breakfasts, including several pieces of dry bread, rice crackers and a cup of hot water.
Netizens quickly pointed out the lack of nutrition this provided, with one accusing her of “neglecting her son”, and another humorously dubbing it a “stepmother’s breakfast”.
Dissatisfied with the backlash, Zhang unleashed her creativity, crafting bizarre breakfast combinations.
One morning, her groggy son discovered a skewer of candied fruit, sour fish soup and milk on the table. In another video, she served barbecue, coffee and luosifen.

Feb 13 - A Ukrainian missile attack killed two people and injured five on Friday in the Russian city of Belgorod near the border, regional governor Vyacheslav Gladkov said.
Gladkov, speaking in a video posted on Telegram, said the men were members of crews restoring damaged heating and electricity networks in the city.
Restoration work will resume on Saturday as it was too dangerous for crews to be operating at night, Gladkov said.
Gladkov had earlier said that the attack caused serious damage to energy facilities, and that electricity, heating and water supplies were cut. Three apartment buildings in the city sustained damage.
The unofficial SHOT Telegram channel said residents reported a series of loud explosions in the city and air defences were in operation.

Trump says Iran regime change could be ‘best thing’ as second carrier heads to Middle East
Sign up now: Get ST's newsletters delivered to your inbox
WASHINGTON/FORT BRAGG, North Carolina – US President Donald Trump on Feb 13 embraced potential regime change in Iran and declared that “tremendous power” will soon be in the Middle East, as the Pentagon sent a second aircraft carrier to the region.
Mr Trump’s military moves and tough talk comes even as Washington and Tehran seek to revive diplomacy over Tehran’s long-running nuclear dispute with the West.
A source briefed on the matter told Reuters that US envoys Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner will hold negotiations with Iran on Feb 10 in Geneva, with representatives from Oman acting as mediators.
The source said Mr Witkoff and Mr Kushner will also meet officials from Russia and Ukraine on Feb 10 in Geneva in the US drive to bring an end to the war in Ukraine.
Asked if he wanted regime change in Iran, Mr Trump responded that it “seems like that would be the best thing that could happen”. He declined to share who he wanted to take over Iran, but said “there are people”.
“For 47 years, they’ve been talking and talking and talking,” Mr Trump said after a military event at Fort Bragg, North Carolina. “In the meantime, we’ve lost a lot of lives while they talk. Legs blown off, arms blown off, faces blown off. We’ve been going on for a long time.”
Washington wants nuclear talks with Iran to also cover the country’s ballistic missiles, support for armed groups around the region and the treatment of the Iranian people. Iran has said it is prepared to discuss curbs on its nuclear programme in exchange for lifting sanctions, but has ruled out linking the issue to missiles.
Mr Trump has threatened strikes on Iran if no agreement is reached, while Tehran has vowed to retaliate, stoking fears of a wider war as the US amasses forces in the Middle East. The US targeted Iran’s nuclear facilities in strikes in 2025.
When asked what was left to be targeted at the nuclear sites, Mr Trump said the “dust.” He added: “If we do it, that would be the least of the mission, but we probably grab whatever is left.”
Long deployments
US officials described the complex process of moving military assets. The carrier Gerald R. Ford will join the carrier Abraham Lincoln, several guided-missile destroyers, fighter jets and surveillance aircraft that have been moved to the Middle East in recent weeks.
The Gerald R. Ford, the United States’ newest and the world’s largest carrier, has been operating in the Caribbean with its escort ships and took part in operations in Venezuela earlier in 2026.
Asked earlier on Feb 13 why a second aircraft carrier was headed to the Middle East, Mr Trump said: “In case we don’t make a deal, we’ll need it ... if we need it, we’ll have it ready.”
One of the officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the carrier would take at least a week to reach the Middle East.
The United States most recently had two aircraft carriers in the area in 2025, when it carried out strikes against Iranian nuclear sites
With only 11 aircraft carriers in the US military’s arsenal, they are a scarce resource and their schedules are usually set well in advance.
In a statement, US Southern Command, which oversees US military operations in Latin America, said it would continue to stay focused on countering “illicit activities and malign actors in the Western Hemisphere”.
The Ford has essentially been at sea since June 2025. It was supposed to be operating in Europe before it was abruptly moved to the Caribbean in November.
While deployments for carriers usually last nine months, it is not uncommon for them to be extended during periods of increased US military activity.
Navy officials have long warned that long deployments at sea can damage morale on ships.
Officials said the administration had looked at sending a separate carrier, the Bush, to the Middle East, but it was undergoing certification and would take over a month to reach the Middle East.
The Ford, which has a nuclear reactor on board, can hold more than 75 military aircraft, including fighter aircraft like the F-18 Super Hornet jet and the E-2 Hawkeye, which can act as an early warning system.
The Ford also has sophisticated radar that can help control air traffic and navigation.
The supporting ships, such as the Ticonderoga-class guided missile cruiser Normandy, Arleigh Burke-class guided missile destroyers Thomas Hudner, Ramage, Carney, and Roosevelt, include surface-to-air, surface-to-surface and anti-submarine warfare capabilities. REUTERS

IKEA to close one of its stores a year after it completed a full renovation
Residents are saddened to see the Swedish furniture store close its location in the spring

IKEA has decided to close one of its stores just a year after it completed a full renovation at the location.
Memphis residents say they are saddened to see the affordable Swedish retailer shut its doors in the Tennessee city later this year.
Once the IKEA store closes on May 3, there will be no more in-store shopping locations in Tennessee. There is another store in Antioch, Tennessee, but it’s pick-up only.
“I just found a place where I can get all the items that I need, and then now I find out it’s closing,” IKEA shopper Jim Kincaid told WMC Memphis. “That’s devastating news to me.”
In an announcement on Tuesday, the retailer said it decided to close its Memphis store after “a comprehensive review, and considering several factors including market share, business performance, cost structure, and overall optimization of physical assets.”
The news came as a shock to some.
“From what we see, it’s busy all the time, never heard about anything bad about it. It’s convenient,” Memphis shopper Milton Siler said of the IKEA location.
“We have friends that come from out of town. They come in here to specifically visit the store before they go back,” Siler told WMC Memphis. “We did not see that coming
The Memphis store had just undergone renovations that IKEA unveiled about a year ago.
After opening the Memphis location in 2016, IKEA overhauled its showroom and market hall. The renovations included a Central Planning Hub with experts ready to help customers with home projects and a 100-plus-seat Swedish restaurant and food market.
The Independent has reached out to IKEA for comment.
Another IKEA shopper, Morgan Shea, called the store closure “really heartbreaking.”
“It’s rare to find affordable, good furniture,” she told WMC Memphis.
IKEA said Memphis customers can still shop online for its home goods.
Despite the Memphis closure, IKEA is investing $2.2 billion in the U.S., according to the company’s announcement.
This investment includes the opening of 14 “new format” stores last year and plans to add an undisclosed number of new locations this year.
As for the workers impacted by the Memphis store closure, IKEA said it will try to “retain as many co-workers as possible by supporting transitions into roles at other IKEA locations.”
Those who do not want to relocate will be offered severance.

Trump threatens an executive order to mandate voter IDs before elections
The US president’s message comes as part of a broader push to increase federal control of the election process, raising legal questions.
United States President Donald Trump has hinted at a new executive order that would force election organisers to require voter identification before distributing ballots.
In a social media post on Friday, the Republican leader warned he would soon take executive action, apparently frustrated by a lack of progress on the issue in Congress.

“This is an issue that must be fought, and must be fought, NOW,” Trump wrote.
“If we can’t get it through Congress, there are Legal reasons why this SCAM is not permitted. I will be presenting them shortly, in the form of an Executive Order.”
It was not clear from his message what those legal reasons might be. But Trump’s post comes two days after the US House of Representatives successfully passed a bill to require documents that prove citizenship before voter registration.
That bill, however, is unlikely to go any further, as it faces steep odds in the Senate.
In the US, it is illegal for non-citizens to participate in elections, and voter fraud is exceedingly rare.
Nevertheless, Trump and his Republican allies have repeatedly claimed that election rigging is widespread. Trump himself has continued to falsely claim that he won the 2020 presidential election, despite bipartisan pushback from election officials about the accuracy of the tally.
But faced with drooping poll numbers, Trump has turned his attention to November’s midterm elections, which will decide which party controls Congress for the last two years of his term.
Already, Trump has expressed fears that, should the Democrats claim the majority in the Republican-held House of Representatives, he could face a third impeachment.
He was successfully impeached twice in his first term, once for abusing his office and a second time for inciting an insurrection, after his supporters attacked the US Capitol on January 6, 2021.
The midterms featured prominently in Trump’s message on Friday. He urged Republicans to leverage popular support for voter ID laws in their campaigns for November.
“Republicans must put this at the top of every speech – It is a CAN’T MISS FOR RE-ELECTION IN THE MIDTERMS, AND BEYOND,” Trump wrote.
A study from the Pew Research Center in 2025 found that US citizens from both major parties overwhelmingly supported requiring photo identification before registering to vote.
The rate was higher among Republicans, 95 percent of whom supported such measures. But approximately 71 percent of Democrats also favoured such legislation.
But voting rights advocates and Democratic leadership have largely opposed such measures.
They argue that providing photo identification could be burdensome for members of low-income and marginalised communities who may not have easy access to documents that prove their identity.
That, in turn, could disenfranchise US citizens who might otherwise cast a ballot.
Voter ID laws are not uncommon in the US, though: Roughly 36 states have measures on the books that require residents to show proof of identity before voting, though they vary as to their strictness.
Congress has also weighed such bills before, including last year. But a renewed push has begun as the midterm elections approach and Trump pressures states for increased federal control over elections.
The US Constitution requires that states, not the federal government, administer the “times, places and manner of holding elections”. Election organising, therefore, takes place at the state and local level.
But Trump has threatened to take away that constitutional power. Speaking to conservative podcaster Dan Bongino earlier this month, the president suggested the federal government should take over the election process.
“We should take over the voting, the voting, in at least, many, 15 places,” Trump said, tripping over his words slightly. “The Republicans ought to nationalise the voting.”
His comments coincided with the reintroduction of the Safeguard American Voter Eligibility (SAVE) Act earlier this month.
The expanded version of the bill initially required proof of citizenship, not just at the time of voter registration but ahead of each ballot cast, in the form of a passport or a birth certificate – documents many US citizens lack.
That provision has since been amended, but critics have also blasted measures that would require state voter rolls to go to the federal government as unconstitutional.
The bill passed the House on Wednesday with 218 votes in support and 213 against. Only one Democrat, Henry Cuellar, voted in favour of the latest SAVE Act.
But even with its House passage, the legislation is unlikely to attract enough backing to overcome the Senate filibuster, a tool which allows the minority to block passage of a bill if it fails to attract at least 60 votes in the 100-seat chamber.
Trump railed against the filibuster, and Democrats in general, in his social media post on Friday.
“We cannot let the Democrats get away with NO VOTER I.D. any longer. These are horrible, disingenuous CHEATERS,” he wrote.
He also called upon the Supreme Court to reject Democrats’ priorities, calling them “corrupt”, “deranged”, “demented” and “evil”.
But advocacy groups like the Brennan Center for Justice called on the Senate to reject the latest voter ID push.
“These bills are part of a broader federal agenda to sow distrust in our elections, undermine election administration, and discourage Americans from making their voices heard,” the Brennan Center said in a statement.
“Congress should stand firm once again and reject the SAVE Act.”

Philippine efforts to unseat Duterte-Carpio face snags: too popular to impeach?
There is some uncertainty over whether President Marcos’ allies would be able to make up the numbers to support the complaints
The accusations range from misuse of public funds to an assassination threat against Marcos – claims she denies. Her lawyer has said the complaints were “devoid of both factual and legal basis”.
Even with the president’s allies holding a majority in the House, there are doubts whether they will support impeaching his former ally.
The latest complaints against Marcos’ deputy were largely the same as last year’s and what was “crucial is whether the impeachment of the VP still has the support of one-third of the House membership”, said Congresswoman Leila de Lima, a critic of the Duterte family who endorsed two of the three complaints filed against the vice-president this year.

NATO chief explains his odd nickname for Trump: ‘Do you have some daddy issues?’
Mark Rutte admitted it was his ‘insufficient command of the English language,’ that had led to the amusing name for the president
- Bookmark

NATO’s Secretary General has explained the origin story behind the bizarre “daddy” nickname he bestowed upon Donald Trump, which the president awkwardly took ownership of last month.
Speaking to Politico’s Dasha Burns, Mark Rutte admitted that it was his “insufficient command of the English language,” that had led to the amusing name for Trump and that he realized only later that the word had “a lot of connotations.”
“I have to ask: where did ‘daddy’ come from? Do you have some daddy issues, Mr Rutte?” Burns joked to Rutte, at the tail end of a sit-down interview at the Munich Security Conference Friday.
Rutte, who is Dutch, explained that the nickname had risen out of a meeting with Trump last summer, in which they had spoken of the U.S. bombing of Iran and the president’s ongoing negotiations with Israel.
“And then I said – and here is my insufficient command of the English language –I said, ‘Daddy sometimes has to be tough.’ And of course, later realizing that the word ‘daddy’ has a lot of connotations,” he said.
“Then what he did – and this is to his credit because he is a fun guy and he has a lot of humor – the American side then put this on T-shirts. There was a video when he came back from the Hague Summit where he said, ‘Daddy is home.’
“So there it was born, and it was never intended.”
Trump unashamedly owned the nickname during a cringe-inducing speech at the National Economic Forum in Davos last month, amid European criticism of his apparent attempts to annex Greenland.
During his speech the president claimed he’d been “helping” Europe and NATO, before veering off topic, claiming “they loved me” until he tried to claim the Danish territory, which he then incorrectly named as Iceland.
Referring to Rutte’s offhand remark, which had taken place six months prior, he went on: “They called me ‘Daddy,’ right? The last time? [A] very smart man said: ‘He’s our Daddy. He’s running it.’”
He went on: “I was, like, running it. I went from running it to being a terrible human being.”
Rutte now appeared to find the interaction with Trump comical, telling Burns: “I’m now carrying it, living with it. It’s a fact of life. Now he’s Daddy.”
Elsewhere at the Conference, others were not so positive, with New York Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez telling attendees that Trump’s administration was “tearing apart the transatlantic partnership.”

Winter Olympics 2026: US figure skating star Malinin stumbles, Shaidorov wins surprise gold
France

US star Ilia Malinin suffered the biggest upset of the Winter Olympics on Friday as the overwhelming favorite for the men's figure skating title fell twice to finish off the podium, with Mikhail Shaidorov of Kazakhstan taking a surprise gold.
Malinin, a two-time defending world champion and undefeated for over two years, had been leading after Tuesday's short program, but he capitulated and ultimately finished 15th in the free skate, and eighth overall, after an error-strewn routine. "I was not expecting that. I felt like going into this competition, I was so ready," the 21-year-old said. "I just felt ready getting on that ice. But I think maybe that might have been the reason, that maybe I was too confident it was going to go well. Honestly, it happened. I can't process what just happened."
Before the Games, Malinin had admitted to not having a mental coach and had often joked that talking to his cats served as therapy. When asked whether his difficulties were more mental or physical, the American replied: "I think it was definitely mental." Despite leading by nearly five points after the short program, Malinin seemed overwhelmed by stress.
With US gymnastics star Simone Biles watching in the stands the three-time Grand Prix final winner failed to reproduce the form that sealed team gold for the United States last Sunday. Taking to the ice last to a deafening roar from the crowd in a shimmering all-black costume featuring gold details, the skater known as the "Quad God" was in difficulty early in his program.
He landed his opening quadruple flip jump but singled his second quadruple axel, which he had been attempting to become the first skater to land at an Olympics. That set the tone for the rest of his four-minute performance which drew gasps of disbelief from the crowd at the Milano Ice Skating Arena.
Two major falls followed and then two of his quadruple jumps were replaced by double jumps, whereas he usually features seven quadruple jumps in his free skate. There were only three clean quads in his routine to the songs The Ball by Asaf Avidan, The Smell of the Sea by Alan Mayer and Code Duello by Power-Haus and Sergiu-Dan Muresan.
'Not a pleasant feeling'
After his performance, Malinin buried his face in his hands, realising the disaster that had just unfolded as his father and coach looked shellshocked in the "Kiss and Cry" area.
They watched as his scores flashed up, nearly 70 points below his personal best of 333.81 points. "It's not a pleasant feeling and, honestly, I'm still trying to understand what happened specifically," said Malinin, the son of Olympic figure skaters who represented Uzbekistan and emigrated to the United States. "But I know that it's done, so I can't change the outcome." "It just felt so overwhelming, so, honestly, I didn't really know how to handle it at that moment."
Japan's Yuma Kagiyama, who had been second after the short program, also fell during his routine along with France's Adam Siao Him Fa who had been third. But Shaidorov surged from fifth after the short program to take a surprise first figure skating gold for his country at the Olympics.
His free skate to The Diva Dance earned him personal best scores of 198.64 for the routine and 291.58 overall, racking up over 21 points for his technically difficult opening triple axel-quad salchow combination.
Shaidorov said Malinin told him after his victory: "You deserve it." "I just did my work. I just wanted to enjoy my free skate," said Shaidorov, who finished sixth in the Grand Prix final in December, where Malinin hit a record seven quads. "It was my goal. It's why I'm training every day, and why I wake up and go to the training. That's it. It was my goal this season (to) do five quads."
Kagiyama took silver, as he did in Beijing four years ago (280.06 points), ahead of compatriot Shun Sato (274.90 points) who moved up from ninth.

Thai election sees old order restored as political dynasties weigh on vote
Thailand’s dynastic centres of political power and patronage, the ‘Baan Yai’ (Big Houses), swayed election for conservatives, analysts say.
Bangkok – Thailand’s swing to more conservative politics in last weekend’s election reveals as much about the dynamics of local power brokers as it does the missteps of the main progressive party, which failed to get its message to stick outside of urban centres.
Anutin Charnvirakul, the leader of the Bhumjaithai Party, comfortably won Sunday’s election, according to an unofficial count by the Election Commission of Thailand (ECT), securing more than 190 of the 500 seats in Thailand’s parliament.

- list 4 of 4Thailand’s PM Anutin claims victory in general election
While the ECT has 60 days to verify the results, Anutin is wasting no time.
On Tuesday, his attention had already turned to forming a coalition government with himself as prime minister, as his election rivals were left to pick through the ruins of their failed campaigns.
The youth-facing reformers in the People’s Party had been widely expected to secure the largest number of seats and the biggest share of the vote.
But they won just 118 seats, according to the ECT’s website, dozens fewer than the party secured in the 2023 election. The drop in support would seem to suggest that the public has turned away from the People’s Party’s call for structural reform in Thailand’s economy and politics.
Votes appear to have shifted to Anutin’s camp, an arch-nationalist who represents the interests of the country’s political and economic elite.
‘Baan Yai’ (Big Houses) politics
Though allegations of vote-buying and other polling irregularities in close constituency contests were growing, even the People’s Party leader, Nattaphong Ruengpanyawut, said it would not have been large enough to change the overall result.
Instead, a tearful Nattaphong apologised in a television interview to the party’s faithful and his members of parliament who lost their seats.
“I’m sad how the results turned out … but despite these tears, I’m committed to carrying on working for the people,” the 38-year-old said.
Analysts and political insiders told Al Jazeera that the People’s Party’s loss of voters – apart from urban areas in and around the capital, Bangkok, and the northern city of Chiang Mai – pointed to the deeper realities of Thai politics that continue to be insurmountable for reformists.
First among those obstacles is political patronage, experts say, where political support is based upon the promise of future favours.
Powerful political dynasties, called “Baan Yai” (Big Houses) in the Thai language, are entrenched across the country and particularly in Chonburi, Buriram and Sisaket provinces.
The “Baan Yai” joined forces under Anutin’s Bhumjaithai Party umbrella and brought along their followers to block out the People’s Party on election day.
“It’s been like this for a really long time,” said an aide to one of the most prominent of the political dynasties.
“In Bangkok, they think of their MPs as lawmakers, but we see them as village heads – someone who goes out and bats for you,” said the aide, who requested anonymity as he was not authorised to speak to the media.
“This is a person you see every day. This is the person who fixes your problems,” the aide added.
‘The only safety net they have’
Khemthong Tonsakulrungruang, a constitutional law scholar at Chulalongkorn University in Bangkok, said the People’s Party may have made a strategic mistake by neglecting “to combat the entrenched influence of Baan Yai” over local voters.
“Because resources are so scarce, rural populations do not view an MP as a representative in the civic sense … instead, they see them as a ‘clan leader’,” Khemthong explained.
“They remain tethered to this patronage system because it is effectively the only safety net they have,” he said.
Thailand’s last election in 2023 delivered a shock warning to some of those dynasties – in Chiang Mai and Chonburi – as younger voters could not be counted on to respect the influence of the Baan Yai at the polls.
That year, a so-called “orange wave” got behind the strong pro-democracy and reform message of the Move Forward Party – the People’s Party predecessor – after nine years of military rule by former army chief Prayut Chan-ocha.
Move Forward won that election, but it was promptly dissolved as a political party by the courts over its intention to reform the country’s draconian royal defamation laws, which protect Thailand’s powerful monarchy from criticism.
Move Forward rose from the ashes and came back as the People’s Party. But with its front-line leaders banned from politics, the movement struggled to reorganise across Thailand, another reason given for the party’s shortfall at the polls last weekend.
History also appears to be repeating.
Barely 24 hours after polling stations closed, Thailand’s National Anti-Corruption Commission (NACC) forwarded a petition to the Supreme Court seeking to ban 44 of the People’s Party Members of Parliament – including Natthaphong – from politics.
The Supreme Court’s decision could result in a lifetime ban for the progressive MPs – the latest legal blows to its momentum.
Nationalism also played a big part in Anutin’s win, particularly in the wake of the recent border war with neighbouring Cambodia.
Bhumjaithai cast itself as the party that got behind the military during the conflict and cast its political rivals as less able to protect the country.
‘Politicians buy the poverty of rural people’
Now, as election analysts assess the results, it appears that the return of the Baan Yai was the most crucial to Anutin’s decisive win, as old political power brokers consolidated under Bhumjaithai’s conservative credentials and refrained from splitting the vote share, which would have been advantageous to the progressive bloc.
“Voter turnout is at a historic low in the last 30 years, only 65 percent, according to the Election Commission,” said Prinya Thaewanarumitkul, a Thai politics expert and an academic at Thammasat University in Bangkok.
“When voter turnout is low, the ‘organised votes’ [mobilised supporters] and the influence of the ‘Baan Yais’ become the deciding factors,” he said.
Preliminary results show that Bhumjaithai made significant gains from central Thailand to the northeast, as well as the southernmost border area with Malaysia – many seats being won due to support from political families who expressed their support publicly for Anutin before the vote.
Beyond the drop in support for reformers and MPs losing their seats, the vote has left many Gen Z supporters at a loss as to why people did not choose to change Thailand for the better. They wonder why their countrymen appear to have thrown their support behind conservatism rather than change, especially when the poor are falling further behind the rich in Thailand’s slowing economy.
For People’s Party voter Arsikin Singthong, 22, who lives in Thailand’s southern Muslim-majority border province of Pattani, the reason can be found in money, politics and rural poverty.
“These Baan Yai politicians buy the poverty of rural people. This is the game,” Arsikin told Al Jazeera.
“But they can’t buy the urban population any more because we have already woken up,” she said.
The return of the political dynasties as power brokers reflects the systemic poverty still found in many parts of rural Thailand, analysts say.
The northeast, north and south lean towards political dynasties and populist promises in nearly all Thai elections, they say.
“The country is fundamentally split by resource allocation,” said Chulalongkorn University’s Khemthong.
“A younger generation has managed to break free from these patronage networks,” Khemthong said, referring to urban voters who form the People’s Party support base in Bangkok and elsewhere.
“They have the luxury of dissent because they have exited the system that still binds those left behind,” he added.

MUNICH, February 14. /TASS/. The United States cannot afford to be a member of an unbalanced alliance where it bears the majority of costs, US Permanent Representative to NATO Matthew Whitaker told the Munich Security Conference.
"We can't have an unequal Alliance where the United States bears the burden. We can't have an unequal Alliance within Europe where certain European countries do a lot more than others. We need everybody to equalize and get stronger together," he said.
At the same time, he expressed hope that the additional defense expenditures, which European allies had to undertake under the US pressure, have made the alliance stronger.
"NATO is stronger right now than certainly it has been in the last five years. And it's probably stronger than it has been since the end of the Cold War," Whitaker added.

IDF chief in Rafah: 'Ready to shift to offensive, not giving up on Gaza demilitarization'

After a week of clashes in southern Gaza, the IDF chief of staff visited Rafah and delivered a message, speaking with a female soldier, against the backdrop of the coalition’s effort to pass the exemption bill. “We are not giving up on the war’s objective — the complete demilitarization of the Gaza Strip and the disarmament of Hamas,” Lt. Gen. Eyal Zamir said during a situation assessment and field tour he conducted Friday in Rafah.
Zamir toured the area following the clashes over the past week and instructed forces to deepen clearing operations, with an emphasis on targeting underground infrastructure. He was accompanied by Southern Command chief, Gaza Division commander Brig., the commanders of the 188th Armored Brigade, the 7th Armored Brigade, the Paratroopers Brigade and the Southern Brigade, as well as the commander of the elite Yahalom combat engineering unit and other officers.
“During the war, we achieved an unprecedented accomplishment — all of Hamas’ frontline battalions were destroyed. Hamas was militarily defeated and all the hostages returned home,” Zamir said. “The IDF is deployed along a security boundary, the Yellow Line, controlling the entrances to the Strip and systematically clearing the area of terrorist infrastructure. We are prepared to shift from defense to offense. For every violation, we will respond and strip away capabilities. We have recently eliminated many terrorists, including senior members of terror organizations.”
“We are acting in accordance with the directives of the political leadership, while holding military plans for decisive action and prepared to operate offensively as required. We will continue to strengthen the defense of communities in the western Negev,” a region of southern Israel bordering Gaza. “The achievements across all combat arenas are the result of courageous fighting and the bravery of IDF soldiers over the past two years. You, the fighters and commanders, deserve the highest appreciation.”
Zamir stressed that “there is no immunity for terrorism. What is true for Gaza is also true for the other arenas. We will remain focused and cut down threats with determination and offensive action.”
He also noted the establishment of the 38th Division, the first new maneuvering division formed by the IDF since 1956. “It will enhance the IDF’s operational capabilities and ground strength. The war has demonstrated the importance of divisions as the driving force of the IDF’s war machine and as a vital component in achieving a decision and victory in a prolonged, multi-front campaign,” he said.
IDF spokesman Brig. Gen. Effie Defrin also attended the tour in the Yellow Line area and said: “We are continuing determined operations to thwart emerging threats and cut down terrorism in Gaza and in all nearby and distant arenas. I want to emphasize again — we are monitoring developments across the Middle East and are well prepared in all arenas. Home Front Command guidelines remain unchanged. If there is any change, we will update accordingly.”

‘There’ll be nothing left of the Liberal Party’: Inside the downfall of Sussan Ley

‘There’ll be nothing left of the Liberal Party’: Inside the downfall of Sussan Ley
By the time Sussan Ley rose to the dispatch box for one final question time on Thursday, her political fate was sealed.
She had less than 24 hours remaining as leader of the Liberal Party, but it did not show. The composure held. The smile remained fixed.
But the faces behind her told the story: colleagues who had concluded the greater risk lay not in change, but in standing still. The argument that had ultimately toppled her was neither ideological purity nor factional revenge. It was survival.
James Paterson, a key player behind Angus Taylor’s accession, had earlier given it blunt expression that, under Ley, the party had lost about 200,000 voters every month since last May’s worst-ever election result.
“It’s more than 50,000 votes a week. It’s more than 7000 votes a day. This cannot go on,” the Victorian senator said, announcing he was joining Taylor and resigning from the shadow cabinet. “If it goes on, there’ll be nothing left of the Liberal Party by the next election.”
That arithmetic – repeated in corridors and offices – reframed the contest. If the trajectory continued, MPs warned privately, no seat would be safe: not marginals in outer suburbs, not regional Queensland strongholds, no chance of regaining once-blue ribbon electorates eroded by teal independents. The fear was no longer of losing more seats; it was of mass extinction.
The scale of the revolt became clear internally at 10.30am on Thursday, when James McGrath, a member of Ley’s shadow cabinet and leadership group, wandered into her Parliament House office.
Accounts of that short conversation are disputed, but his message to Ley was ultimately clear. Her leadership was doomed. McGrath would hold off on making his resignation public until 3.30pm, after the end of question time.
“While I realise this news won’t please everyone, it is important that Australia has a strong and effective opposition,” he said. “I have made this decision as I believe it is in the best interest of Queensland, Australia and the Liberal National Party.”
McGrath has a reputation for sniffing the breeze. In 2015, he was a central player in the move to kill off Tony Abbott’s prime ministership. He then moved on Malcolm Turnbull three years later when his leadership was in peril.
A key supporter last May, McGrath was rewarded with a role in Ley’s inner circle. Allies now paint it as a major betrayal, but others say McGrath’s move should not have blindsided Ley. In recent weeks, they say, the Queensland senator had sharpened his interventions, pressing colleagues about electoral losses and questioning whether the leadership could arrest the slide reflected in polling.
Facing a looming preselection battle within the LNP, he was acutely aware of conservative grassroots anxiety and the rise of One Nation.
“The McGrath switch was a big deal,” says one MP, aligned to the party’s moderate faction. “When he deserted Sussan, it gave an impression to others on the fence that this thing was over. People wanted to back a winner.”
The numbers men in both camps slowly shifted names from one list to another. Ley supporters from May were moved into Taylor’s column, among them Western Australia’s Dean Smith, South Australian Tom Venning, Queenslander Leon Rebello, Victorian Zoe McKenzie, and Tasmanian Wendy Askew.
But the collapse had deeper roots.
For much of her two decades in parliament, Ley had been a steady if largely nondescript presence; a competent minister across portfolios including health and environment, but rarely a dominant personality shaping the national argument. What she was not was a political insurgent capable of redefining a party in crisis.
The chaos had spread dramatically lately after Nationals leader David Littleproud detonated the Coalition arrangement when Ley attempted to discipline three Nationals senators who had crossed the shadow cabinet’s position on hate speech laws.
Littleproud’s declaration that he could not serve under her leadership – later reversed – left her authority exposed. The attempted reconciliation, staged at a joint press conference, convinced few that unity had been restored. In parliament, Labor MPs revelled in the spectacle of an opposition fighting itself.
Ley had tried to recalibrate many times along the way. She toughened rhetoric on immigration, linking migration to housing affordability. Likewise, she dumped the Coalition’s net zero policy to placate conservatives. But the shifts failed to cut through.
Close allies argue that right-wingers in the party room were never comfortable with a woman leader, especially one who made clear in her first press club speech that she wanted to ditch the types of culture wars increasingly animating conservative voters.
One ally said: “If we got every decision right, every hour of every day, this party room never would have allowed her to succeed.”
Ley herself hinted as much on Friday when she resigned.
“It is important that the new leader gets clear air, something that is not always afforded to leaders, but which in the present moment is more important than ever,” she said.
Another moderate MP says Ley was an introvert who took advice from a small group of figures, including NSW numbers man Alex Hawke, trusted staff and, occasionally, moderate faction figures such as Anne Ruston and Maria Kovacic. On the whole, though, even MPs who believed in the Ley project were often perplexed by her tactics, and felt cut out.
Shrill attacks on the prime minister’s fashion sense, on Penny Wong’s emotional state and demands to recall parliament early to vote on hate speech legislation left the Coalition wedged and many questioning her judgment.
“She didn’t talk to people. It was really quite bizarre. No leader ever has had so few MPs who would really fight for her,” the same MP said.
A deeper dispute was about identity. Should the Liberals attempt to win back moderate, teal-held inner-city seats? Or pivot harder towards cultural conservatism and economic nationalism to reclaim voters drifting to One Nation?
“It was never going to be easy to lead the party after its worst-ever defeat,” Abbott, who elevated Ley to cabinet in 2014, said on Friday, adding that she had shown strong character and dignity, often under great pressure.
“As John Howard once said, politics is a hard and unforgiving business, but it’s the highest and noblest form of public service.”
Ongoing tensions came to a head about 10 days after the first damning Newspoll of the year, published in The Australian, which showed the Coalition behind One Nation on the primary vote for the first time.
In Melbourne, on the morning of former Liberal MP Katie Allen’s memorial service on January 29, senior figures gathered.
Ley had emerged from what supporters considered her strongest stretch – internal critics quiet over summer as she led attacks on Anthony Albanese over the Bondi massacre. Then the poll landed.
At the suburban home of a party figure, Taylor expressed strongly that he was intent on running. Fellow leadership aspirant Andrew Hastie was less conclusive, according to sources in the room. Hastie’s key supporters there – senators Jonno Duniam and Matt O’Sullivan – had urged him to nominate but acknowledged he would have time on his side if he stepped back.
Taylor told Hastie that a challenge could only succeed with his support. Paterson advised Hastie that he did not have the numbers and would be better served by waiting. Former PM Abbott was also strongly lobbying internally for Taylor.
Hastie, in the end, determined he should withdraw and give Taylor a clear run, avoiding a damaging split among those on the right of the party that would further diminish the party.
But even then, there was no fixed timetable. Those involved were open to waiting weeks or months. But secrecy collapsed after photojournalist Liam Mendes, of The Australian, unexpectedly exposed the talks. Once it became clear that Paterson and Duniam – senior members of the shadow ministry – were discussing Ley’s leadership, pressure intensified for movement.
Those images had infuriated many MPs, who likened them to a meeting of mafia bosses, labelling the meeting “grotesque”, “student politics” and “amateur hour”. Some even thought they might even buy more time for Ley.
But the next Newspoll would become pivotal. On Sunday night, it showed One Nation up five points to 27 per cent and the Coalition down three percentage points at 18 per cent.
Taylor did not move immediately. He delayed declaring until late Wednesday, prompting internal jokes about a “TACO spill” – a reference to the “Trump Always Chickens Out” insults circulating in US politics. The hesitation reflected his concern that Ley might call a snap spill the moment he declared, catching him before every commitment was secured.
In recent weeks, McGrath, Ruston, Hawke and leading moderate figure Andrew Bragg had all attempted to convince right-wing MPs to give Ley a few more months. The need to give her a budget reply speech became a narrative.
In these whispered talks, Ley’s supporters suggested they could convince Ley to stand down sometime after the May budget if she was unable to lift the party’s standing in the polls.
But the overtures went nowhere. Members of the conservative grouping felt the case for change was too urgent to wait. Hawke’s suggestions were not believed by his right-wing enemies.
When Taylor eventually walked to Ley’s office just after 7pm on Wednesday, he found the door locked. Security guards were closing up for the night. Ley and her senior staff were minutes from leaving for an evening engagement.
The pair spoke in her suite for just three minutes before Taylor left and publicly announced he would quit the frontbench. The next morning, he moved. NSW senator Jess Collins and Queensland MP Phil Thompson wrote to the whip the next day, demanding a party room meeting.
Shadow treasurer under Peter Dutton’s leadership, Taylor had narrowly lost the previous leadership ballot, 29-25, and waited as defence spokesman while polls weakened Ley’s standing. Events had forced him to launch earlier than he had planned.
“I am running to be the leader of the Liberal Party because I believe that Australia is worth fighting for,” he said in a slick Instagram video.
On Friday morning, the party room met. Ley lost 34 votes to 17. Taylor had the leadership.
The margin was emphatic. It formalised what had been obvious in the corridors days earlier.
“What we’ve been through over the last 10 or 11 months has been incredibly difficult,” said Victorian MP Dan Tehan, who withdrew his support for Ley and ran unsuccessfully for deputy, on Friday.
“The feedback I was getting was that things did need to change and there was no criticism against Sussan and what she’s done.”
The symbolism will linger. The Liberals have removed their first female leader after 276 days. But for MPs staring at polling that suggested erosion on multiple fronts – to Labor, to the teals, to One Nation – symbolism proved secondary.
“We’re at a critical juncture right now. Sussan Ley has been a diligent, hard-working servant to our party and to the country, but unfortunately, we’re simply not cutting through now,” Senator Jane Hume, who won a ballot for deputy leader, told reporters.
Taylor’s win on Friday morning was decisive and hands him a mandate larger than many predicted. However, the party room remains fractured, and the coup has left scars.
A supporter of Ley suggests that Taylor has little time to prove his mettle and begin reviving the Liberal Party’s fortunes in the polls – rather than just getting a short sugar hit from the change of leader – or supporters of his conservative rival, Hastie, will come knocking.
“He will need to hit the ground running,” said the MP, who asked not to be named so they could speak freely.
“I think he has six months. Angus’ first gift to the party could be handing Farrer [Ley’s seat] to an independent at a byelection.”
Taylor inherits the numbers and the warning: 50,000 voters a week; 7000 a day.
The arithmetic that felled his predecessor will not spare him if it continues.

US military preparing for potentially weeks-long Iran operations
The US military is preparing for the possibility of sustained, weeks-long operations against Iran if President Donald Trump orders an attack, two US officials told Reuters, in what could become a far more serious conflict than previously seen between the countries.
The disclosure by the officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity due to the sensitive nature of the planning, raises the stakes for the diplomacy underway between the United States and Iran.
US and Iranian diplomats held talks in Oman last week in an effort to revive diplomacy over Tehran's nuclear program, after Trump amassed military forces in the region, raising fears of new military action.
US officials said on Friday the Pentagon was sending an additional aircraft carrier to the Middle East, adding thousands more troops along with fighter aircraft, guided-missile destroyers and other firepower capable of waging attacks and defending against them.
Trump, speaking to US troops on Friday at a base in North Carolina, said it had "been difficult to make a deal" with Iran.
"Sometimes you have to have fear. That's the only thing that really will get the situation taken care of," Trump said.
Asked for comment on the preparations for a potentially sustained US military operation, White House spokesperson Anna Kelly said: "President Trump has all options on the table with regard to Iran."
"He listens to a variety of perspectives on any given issue, but makes the final decision based on what is best for our country and national security," Kelly said.
The Pentagon declined to comment.
The United States sent two aircraft carriers to the region last year when it carried out strikes against Iranian nuclear sites.
However, June's "Midnight Hammer" operation was essentially a one-off US attack, with stealth bombers flying from the United States to strike Iranian nuclear facilities. Iran staged a very limited retaliatory strike on a US base in Qatar.
Risks increasing
The planning underway this time is more complex, the officials said.
In a sustained campaign, the US military could hit Iranian state and security facilities, not just nuclear infrastructure, one of the officials said. The official declined to provide specific details.
Experts say the risks to US forces would be far greater in such an operation against Iran, which boasts a formidable arsenal of missiles. Retaliatory Iranian strikes also increase the risk of a regional conflict.
The same official said the United States fully expected Iran to retaliate, leading to back-and-forth strikes and reprisals over a period of time.
The White House and Pentagon did not respond to questions about the risks of retaliation or regional conflict.
Trump has repeatedly threatened to bomb Iran over its nuclear and ballistic missile programs and the crushing of internal dissent. On Thursday, he warned the alternative to a diplomatic solution would "be very traumatic, very traumatic."
Iran's Revolutionary Guards have warned that in case of strikes on Iranian territory, they could retaliate against any US military base.
The US maintains bases throughout the Middle East, including in Jordan, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Bahrain, the United Arab Emirates and Turkey.
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu met Trump for talks in Washington on Wednesday, saying that if an agreement with Iran were reached, "it must include the elements that are vital to Israel."
Iran has said it is prepared to discuss curbs on its nuclear program in exchange for lifting sanctions, but has ruled out linking the issue to missiles.

PM calls for 'full explanation' after Muslim prayer disrupted by police at Sydney protest

Prime Minister Anthony Albanese says NSW Police should provide a "full explanation" after officers dragged away Muslim worshippers praying at a Sydney protest opposing the visit of Israeli President Isaac Herzog.
Speaking on The Sydney Morning Herald's Inside Politics podcast, Albanese said he was concerned by the incident outside Sydney's Town Hall on Monday evening.
"I'm concerned at the great deal of hurt which the Muslim community are feeling about the disruption of prayers," he said.
"I think that is something that needs a full explanation. I know that that has caused a great deal of distress."
More than 100 Muslim organisations issued a joint statement condemning the incident as "completely unacceptable" and calling for a public apology and an investigation after footage emerged showing officers pulling several men from the ground as they prayed.
NSW Police commissioner Mal Lanyon said he had privately apologised to Muslim community leaders for any offence caused.
However, NSW Premier Chris Minns has refused to apologise, defending the actions of the police and saying he didn't support an independent inquiry.
On Friday, the NSW police watchdog, the Law Enforcement Conduct Commission, said it was investigating the conduct of officers at the rally, including "incidents of alleged misconduct".
NSW Police also revealed said a senior officer had told others to wait for the prayer to be completed before moving the group on, but the order was not followed.
"The senior officer was attempting to relay that message to other officers who were carrying out a move-on direction during what was a noisy, dynamic and fast-moving situation," police said in a statement to SBS News.
PM defends Herzog invitation
Asked whether Herzog's visit — which was on invitation by the federal government — had failed to advance social cohesion, Albanese said the Israeli president's trip was about supporting the Jewish community following the Bondi Beach terror attack.
"People can have criticism of the actions of the Netanyahu government and [they] are entitled to express that," he said.
Albanese said the majority of pro-Palestinian demonstrators wanted to peacefully express their views.
But he was critical of organisers of the Sydney rally, noting they had refused to relocate the demonstration to Hyde Park, as suggested by NSW Police.
"They chose not to come up with or participate in a sensible way that would have ensured separation by having the meeting in Hyde Park and then walking, marching, to Belmore Park," he said.
"It is beyond my comprehension why that would not be taken up, that suggestion by the New South Wales Police."
Josh Lees, of Palestine Action Group, earlier this week said the rally would not be "shunted off to some park out of sight and out of mind".
The prime minister said his electorate office in Marrickville, in Sydney's inner-west, had been targeted by some protesters with stink bombs, graffiti and broken windows, which did nothing to advance the Palestinian cause.
He also reiterated his government's support for a two-state solution.
"There are two paths in the Middle East," he said.
"One is a passive path of peace and reconciliation, and a settlement which gives Palestinian justice but also recognises the right of Israel to exist within secure borders, to have security assured [and] its right to defend itself."
He said the other path was the "status quo", which had existed for decades and left Palestinians oppressed and without self-determination.

All Eyes On Rubio: Munich Braces For Transatlantic Reality Check
Unknown

00:29:35 UTC
09:29:35 KST

MUNICH -- The first day of the Munich Security Conference (MSC) ended late on February 13 with the world’s foreign-policy elite left in a state of suspended animation.
After a day defined by pointed rhetoric and “wrecking ball” warnings from European leaders, the focus has shifted entirely to the man set to deliver Washington’s answer: Secretary of State Marco Rubio.
As the “Davos of Defense” concludes its opening sessions, the spotlight has fixed squarely on Rubio, who arrived tasked with articulating how US President Donald Trump’s “America First” doctrine will interface with a jittery global order.
In the ornate corridors of the Bayerischer Hof and during a series of frantic "pull-aside" meetings on the sidelines, a singular question dominated the day's discourse: Will Rubio’s keynote address -- scheduled for the morning of February 14 -- serve as a stabilizer for the transatlantic project, or will it further expose the widening fissures between Washington and its oldest allies?
A Moment Of Reckoning
Established in 1963 as a forum to coordinate Western strategy against the Soviet Union, the Munich gathering now faces a different strategic test: whether Washington and its European allies can adjust the terms of their partnership without allowing it to fracture.
Several European officials told RFE/RL late on February 13 that this year’s meeting represents a pivotal moment for the transatlantic alliance.
One scenario discussed in the hallways would see NATO recalibrated around a more capable European pillar -- a Europe better able to provide for its own defense while maintaining a steadier, more-balanced partnership with the United States.
The alternative, which weighed heavily on the first day's atmosphere, is a continuation of transatlantic disputes over shared values, national priorities, and burden-sharing -- tensions that, left unresolved, could harden into lasting estrangement.
Senior Western officials who spoke privately as the sun set on the forum’s first day said the concern is shifting from headline-grabbing rhetoric to a gradual weakening of cohesion.
The greatest risk, they cautioned, is not an open rupture but another round of forceful declarations unaccompanied by concrete steps -- deepening uncertainty about US reliability and Europe’s willingness to act.
Rubio’s Balancing Act
Rubio has described his trip as taking place at a defining moment and the dawn of a “new era” in geopolitics. Before departing for Germany, he offered reassurance about the depth of US-European ties.
“We’re very tightly linked together with Europe,” he told reporters. “Most people in this country can trace both, either their cultural or their personal heritage, back to Europe.”
But he also signaled change: “We live in a new era in geopolitics, and it’s going to require all of us to reexamine what that looks like.”
Early impressions from the first day in Munich show Trump’s allies defending the administration’s “America First” approach, even as Rubio spent his arrival working to reassure skeptical Europeans that the United States is acting in their interest as well.
His schedule on February 13 reflected that dual track.
Rubio began with an hour-long meeting with Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi, underscoring that Europe’s security debate cannot be divorced from broader US-China competition.
He then spent significant time with Germany’s leader, Friedrich Merz, the host country’s representative. Merz acknowledged that Europe’s “excessive dependency” on the United States was its own doing but insisted the answer is not to abandon NATO.
During a brief photo-op between the two leaders, RFE/RL asked Rubio directly whether the United States remained committed to European security. In a moment that underscored the day's prevailing uncertainty, neither Rubio nor Merz took the opportunity to respond, leaving the question hanging in the air as they were ushered away.
Rubio also met Moldovan President Maia Sandu, held a pull-aside meeting with NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte, and spoke with Croatian Prime Minister Andrej Plenkovic and Polish Foreign Minister Radosław Sikorski -- key voices from NATO’s eastern flank.
Notably, while Rubio has been active in Munich, he was absent from a key NATO ministerial last December, and US Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth also did not attend the corresponding meeting earlier this week.
“But he [Hegseth] is here in Munich,” one European official said, adding that Russia’s war against Ukraine would be addressed in “all possible formats.”
On February 14, following his speech, Rubio is expected to huddle with G7 allies and meet Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.
Deep Concern -- And Hard Truths
Veteran US diplomat John Herbst, now a senior director at the Atlantic Council’s Eurasia Center, told RFE/RL on February 13 that European leaders’ anxiety was palpable.
“What we heard today was deep concern from European leaders about the state of transatlantic relations,” Herbst said.
Since the end of World War II, he noted, global security and prosperity have largely been based on the NATO alliance and the partnership between the United States and key European allies.
Tensions over the past year have strained that foundation. European leaders recognize this is not good for their security or prosperity, Herbst said -- and, in his view, it is not good for American security or prosperity either.
He argued that Rubio has long understood the importance of NATO and strong US-European relations and expects his speech and interactions to reflect that. At the same time, Herbst noted, Rubio is a loyal secretary to Trump, and some themes from the administration -- even those not always welcome in Europe -- will likely feature in his remarks.
On Europe’s role, Herbst said Washington has been urging greater European defense efforts for decades. Europe is now moving in that direction, but he cautioned against shifting the overwhelming burden of ensuring European security entirely onto Europe.
Close cooperation between Washington and Europe remains essential, he argued, even as Europe must increase defense spending, expand arms production, and strengthen troop sustainment.
Looking ahead to Rubio’s meeting with Zelenskyy and his messaging on NATO’s eastern flank, Herbst said he expects Rubio to follow the policy lines evolving within the Trump administration.
But he added that he would hope -- and expect -- the secretary to underscore that when Europe needs the United States, it will be there, provided Europe fulfills its commitments.
The Question Of Consistency
For Tyson Barker, a former US deputy special envoy for Ukraine’s economic recovery and now with the German Council on Foreign Relations, the central issue is consistency.
Speaking to RFE/RL hours before Rubio’s speech, Barker said the tone currently coming from Washington -- including signals about tapered troop withdrawals, continued commitment to nuclear deterrence, and a rebalancing of conventional forces -- is constructive.
But it must be sustained. “It’s not enough for the Trump administration to say this once and have a different message in two weeks,” Barker said. The message must remain consistent from the highest levels, including the president, over the medium and long term, he said.
Right now, he argued, the concern is less about a single headline and more about the trend line -- which has appeared erratic. A reassuring speech in Munich could be undercut by destabilizing signals weeks earlier or weeks later.
As the first day concludes, NATO's Rutte pointed to a “shift in mindset,” with Europe taking more care of its own defense. Meanwhile, US Ambassador to the UN Mike Waltz told the conference that the status quo was no longer sustainable.
The broader European debate -- championed by leaders like French President Emmanuel Macron -- envisions a more integrated Europe.
But “strategic autonomy” demands politically fraught trade-offs. Building a stronger European pillar will take more than three days in Munich, most agree.
For now, all eyes are on Rubio’s podium on the morning of February 14.

Australia and EU on the cusp of signing landmark free trade agreement

In short:
Australia is close to forming a new free trade agreement with the EU.
Farmers in Australia and the EU have warned that the agreement exposes them to intensified competition in fragile markets.
What's next?
EU President Ursula von der Leyen is widely expected to travel to Australia to sign the free trade deal.
Australia and the European Union (EU) are on the cusp of finally reaching a free trade agreement after years of sometimes fraught negotiations, with both sides increasingly optimistic that Prime Minister Anthony Albanese and EU President Ursula von de Leyen will be able to sign a deal within weeks.
Talks have long been stalled after collapsing spectacularly in 2023, and Trade Minister Don Farrell has been adamant Australia will not sign a deal unless the EU agrees to tear down tariff barriers to larger quantities of agricultural exports such as beef and lamb.
Both sides have also been negotiating over working rights and labour mobility, Australia's luxury car tax, and the use of geographical indicators that could stop Australian producers using labels such as "fetta" and "prosecco".
Earlier this week Senator Farrell flew to Brussels for talks with EU Trade Commissioner Maroš Šefčovič and Agriculture Commissioner Christophe Hansen, as both sides try to break the deadlock and strike a blow for free trade in the face of global economic fragmentation and the Trump administration's tariff assault.
Sources from the EU and Australia said the deal was now close.
Mr Albanese and Ms von de Leyen now have to resolve one outstanding issue — believed to be connected to red meat exports — before the deal can officially be signed.
In a joint statement, Senator Farrell and the EU commissioners said the talks were "constructive and positive" and "allowed the two sides to converge positions on a range of issues".
"Good progress was achieved in narrowing gaps on a small number of outstanding matters," the statement said, adding they would take the offer to Mr Albanese and Ms von der Leyen respectively for sign off.
EU nations are collectively already Australia's third-biggest trading partner, and the deal could help further open the 450 million-strong market to Australian producers, delivering a major win to the federal government and, potentially, a significant boost to GDP.
It would also help reinforce the strategic relationship with Australia and the EU — which are already close to finalising a separate security partnership — in the face of global turmoil.
Agriculture access a sticking point
But farmers' groups in Australia have been fiercely critical of Europe's generous agricultural subsidies, and have urged the federal government to reject any deal that does not provide "significantly increased access" for Australian agricultural exports.
The European Union and member states are also likely to face political pressure from European farmers, with one prominent lobbying group warning earlier this week that the pact should not "expose EU farmers to intensified competition in already fragile markets".
Senator Farrell said he was confident both sides would "reach agreement that benefits both of our economies".
"As I've said repeatedly, any agreement must be in Australia's national interest and provide real benefit for Australian business, producers, exporters and workers,"he said.
Ms von der Leyen is widely expected to travel to Australia to sign the free trade deal and the security partnership, but it is not yet clear exactly when she will make the trip.

PALM BEACH, Florida, Feb 13 - Two sets of diplomatic negotiations, on Ukraine and Iran, are set to take place in Geneva on Tuesday, a source briefed on the matter told Reuters on Friday.
A U.S. delegation including envoys Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner will meet with the Iranians on Tuesday morning, the source said. Representatives from Oman will be on hand and mediate the U.S.-Iran contacts, the source said.
Witkoff and Kushner will then participate in trilateral talks with representatives from Russia and Ukraine in the afternoon, the source said.
President Donald Trump is pressuring the Iranian government in the wake of its violent crackdown on protesters and has amassed a large U.S. naval presence in the region.
He is also trying to coax Ukraine and Russia into an agreement to end Moscow's four-year-old invasion of Ukraine. REUTERS

Eyeing midterms, Trump threatens to bypass Congress with executive order on election reforms

US President Donald Trump has threatened to bypass Congress and impose new nationwide voting rules ahead of November's midterm elections, signalling he could act unilaterally if lawmakers fail to pass election reforms.
In a post on his Truth Social platform on Friday, Trump said he would issue an executive order requiring photo identification to vote and introducing other nationwide measures if Congress does not approve the changes.
"There will be Voter I.D. for the Midterm Elections, whether approved by Congress or not!" Trump wrote.
"If we can't get it through Congress, there are Legal reasons why this SCAM is not permitted. I will be presenting them shortly, in the form of an Executive Order," he added.
Any such move would likely face immediate legal challenges and could ultimately be decided by the Supreme Court.
The Trump-backed "SAVE America" election reform act passed the Republican-controlled House of Representatives this week.
Potential failure
However, it is widely expected to fail in the Senate, where Republicans hold only a narrow majority and would require Democratic support to advance the legislation.
In addition to requiring a photo ID to cast a ballot, the bill would also require proof of citizenship to register to vote.
Critics say that the bill's measures would push millions of people away from casting ballots, because they don't have a passport or a paper copy of their birth certificate.
An analysis by the Brennan Center found more than 21 million Americans lack easy access to such documents.
This would "disenfranchise Americans of all ages," the center found — especially young people and ethnic minorities.
While many US jurisdictions already mandate photo ID, others do not.
Trump and several Republican allies have argued that areas without strict ID requirements are vulnerable to voter fraud.
Under the US Constitution, states retain broad authority over the administration of elections, and it remains unclear how the White House could legally impose a national voter ID mandate.
Opinion polls suggest Republicans risk losing their narrow control of Congress in November.
Democrats have indicated that, if they regain the majority, they would block Trump's legislative agenda and could pursue impeachment proceedings.

Air Assault Forces cadets must repeat course if they miss over 30% of training – Commander

Air Assault Forces cadets must repeat course if they miss over 30% of training – Commander
This was stated in an interview with Ukrinform by Lt. Col. Viktor Moroz, commander of a training battalion at the 199th Training Center of the Air Assault Forces.
“If a person misses more than 30% of the training, for example, due to medical treatment or family leave, they are assigned to repeat the course. A cadet cannot leave the training center without completing live-fire drills and all required exercises. Nearly 1,000 rounds are now allocated for the shooting course, so we give cadets the opportunity to fire as much as needed to acquire the necessary skills,” Moroz said.
According to him, there are many cases when brigade combat training officers and battalion commanders call the training center saying a soldier claims they were not properly trained there. Moroz noted that this is a typical reaction driven by fear or a deliberate attempt to mislead commanders – behavior that often begins during training.
“A cadet who did not want to defend the country continues that attitude after joining a brigade. If we managed to retain them for the brigade and they did not abandon service, they then try by any means to avoid combat missions. We have various safeguards in place to independently monitor a cadet’s level of training. This includes full records of completed exercises and mandatory attendance tracking for every discipline,” the lieutenant colonel said.
He added that all documentation is transferred to brigades in both electronic and paper form, making it possible to review training records even if the soldier completed training a year earlier.
Moroz also emphasized that newly arrived soldiers are given at least two weeks for unit coordination, regardless of the direction or specialization of the brigade. This period includes familiarization with unit-specific weapons systems, operational realities related to terrain, and other factors. If additional skills are needed during this time, new arrivals receive further training from brigade instructor teams, which also operate at a very high level.
As previously reported by Ukrinform, nearly 45% of service members are satisfied with their experience of basic combined-arms training, while another 30% report partial satisfaction.

Times Square billboard targets PA 'pay-for-slay' policy

Times Square in New York City unveiled a new billboard on Friday that highlighted the Palestinian Authority's 'pay-for-slay' policy.
The billboard, created in collaboration with the Foreign Affairs Ministry, features a photo of Mahmoud Abbas, the President of the Palestinian Authority (PA) and Chairman of the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO). The message read: "Palestinian Authority still pays for killing Jews - END PAY FOR SLAY."
This is not the first time Times Square has served as a prominent stage for the Israel-Palestine regional conflict and the Israel-Gaza war.
Times Square campaigns
In December, a billboard sponsored by the American Arab Discrimination Committee displayed the Christmas-themed message: “Jesus is Palestinian.”
Efforts to raise awareness about Israeli captives were also showcased at the New York landmark. The Israeli government purchased a billboard in Times Square to feature a video released by Hamas showing Israeli hostage Evyatar David, along with the message: “Hamas is starving the Israeli hostages - Ignored by the media, too busy echoing Hamas propaganda.”
The inclusion of the Palestinian Authority's 'pay-for-slay' policy (also known as the ‘Martyrs’ Fund’) in the Times Square campaign comes into focus as President Mahmoud Abbas ordered the publication of a draft constitution for a Palestinian state earlier this week.
Formalizing ''pay-for-slay''
The drafted constitution notably omits any mention of Jewish ties to Jerusalem, refers to greater Palestine as "part of the Arab homeland," and appears to formalize the continuation of the Palestinian Authority's controversial "'pay-for-slay'" policy, which provides financial stipends to families of convicted terrorists and terror suspects.
Article XXIV of the draft outlines the Palestinian state's commitment to "provide protection and care for the families of martyrs, the wounded, prisoners, and those released from occupation prisons, as well as victims of genocide."
It further states that Palestinian leadership will ensure "comprehensive care for the families of martyrs, the wounded, prisoners, and those released [from prison], in order to preserve their national dignity and meet their humanitarian and living needs."
This formalization of the 'pay-for-slay' policy comes after multiple attempts by the PA to deny its continued effect, following its reported cancellation in February 2025 when PA President Abbas signed a decree to end it.
Michael Starr, James Gunn, and Jerusalem Post staff contributed to this report.

MUNICH, February 14. /TASS/. During the Munich Security Conference, Europeans made it clear that the European Union will help the Kiev government for as long as it can, German political scientist Alexander Rahr wrote on Telegram.
In his post, the expert noted that French President Emmanuel Macron made emphases that differed from those of German Chancellor Friedrich Merz. "He [Macron] sees reasons for Europe to negotiate with Russia on Ukraine’s future," Rahr said. "But the general message of the conference is clear: Europe will continue fighting on Ukraine’s side for as long as it can."
Commenting on Merz’s speech, the expert described it as "provocative," adding that in his opinion, the German chancellor wants Germany to play the leading role in Europe and to start rapid militarization of the European Union.
"For Merz, it makes no sense to negotiate with [Russian President Vladimir] Putin," Rahr wrote.
Therefore, in his opinion, Germany "once and for all rejected its historical role of a mediator between the East and the West."

Award-winning Indian writer Arundhati Roy has withdrawn from the Berlin Film Festival over jury president Wim Wenders's comments that cinema should "stay out of politics" when asked about Gaza.
Roy said in a statement on Friday that she was "shocked and disgusted" by responses from Wenders and other jury members to a question about the Palestinian territory at a press conference on Thursday.
Roy, whose novel "The God of Small Things" won the 1997 Booker Prize, had been announced as a festival guest to present a restored version of the 1989 film "In Which Annie Gives It Those Ones", in which she starred and wrote the screenplay.
However, she said that the "unconscionable" statements by Wenders and other jury members had led her to reconsider, "with deep regret".
When asked about Germany's support for Israel at a press conference on Thursday, Wenders said: "We cannot really enter the field of politics," describing filmmakers as "the counterweight to politics."
Fellow jury member Ewa Puszczynska said it was a "little bit unfair" to expect the jury to take a direct stance on the issue.
Roy said in her statement that "to hear them say that art should not be political is jaw-dropping."
She described the situation in Gaza as "a genocide of the Palestinian people by the State of Israel".
"If the greatest filmmakers and artists of our time cannot stand up and say so, they should know that history will judge them," she said.
"It is a way of shutting down a conversation about a crime against humanity even as it unfolds before us in real time — when artists, writers and filmmakers should be doing everything in their power to stop it," she said.
Roy is one of India's most famous living authors and is a trenchant critic of Prime Minister Narendra Modi's right-wing government, as well as a firm supporter of the Palestinian cause.
Restored versions of two films by late Egyptian directors, "Sad Song of Touha" by Atteyat Al Abnoudy and "The Dislocation of Amber" by Hussein Shariffe, have also been withdrawn from the festival over its stance on Gaza.
"The Berlinale respects these decisions," a spokeswoman said in a statement sent to AFP.
"We regret that we will not welcome them as their presence would have enriched the festival discourse," she said.
Shying away from politics
The Berlinale traditionally has a reputation for topical, progressive programming, but so far this year's edition has seen several stars shy away from taking a stance on the big political issues of the day.
US actor Neil Patrick Harris, who stars in the film "Sunny Dancer" was asked on Friday if he considered his art to be political and if it could help "fight the rise of fascism".
He replied that he was "interested in doing things that are apolitical" and which could help people find connection in our "strangely algorithmic and divided world".
This year's Honorary Golden Bear recipient, Malaysian actor Michelle Yeoh, also demurred when asked to comment on US politics in a press conference on Friday, saying she "cannot presume to say I understand" the situation there.
This is not the first edition of the festival to run into controversy over Israeli genocidal war in Gaza.
In 2024, the festival's documentary award went to "No Other Land," which follows the dispossession of Palestinian communities in the Israeli-occupied West Bank.
German government officials criticised "one-sided" remarks about Gaza by the directors of that film and others at that year's awards ceremony.
Israel’s genocide in Gaza has left at least 72,000 people dead in Gaza and wounded more than 171,400, according to conservative estimates by Palestinians.
Analysts suggest these figures may be an underestimation, with the total death toll possibly reaching around 200,000.

The Lone Democratic Senator Who Voted for Funding DHS

With a shutdown of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) fast approaching, all but one Democratic Senator voted against advancing an appropriations bill to fund the department.
Congressional Democrats have refused to pass an annual DHS funding bill without new restrictions on federal immigration enforcement as President Donald Trump’s immigration crackdown draws widespread outcry. But Sen. John Fetterman of Pennsylvania, a long-standing opponent of government shutdowns, on Thursday broke with his party and voted to advance a yearlong spending bill for the department that didn't include such reforms.
Fetterman warned that declining to fund DHS would have “zero impact on ICE functionality” but would impact other agencies housed under the department.
“Shutting DHS down has zero impact and zero changes for ICE. ICE already has $75B in funding from the BBB that I did not vote for,” Fetterman said in a video posted to his X account, referencing Trump’s“Big, Beautiful Bill.” The massive domestic policy bill included a hefty supplement to ICE’s base budget that the agency could tap amid the looming lapse in appropriations.
“But it will hit FEMA, Coast Guard, TSA and our Cybersecurity Agency,” Fetterman continued., “As a Democrat, I can’t vote to shut down critical parts of our government.”

DHS is set to shut down at 12:01 a.m. on Saturday without a clear end in sight after lawmakers left Washington for a scheduled week-long recess on Thursday still unable to come to an agreement.
Amid the negotiations over funding for the department in recent weeks, anti-ICE activists have protested outside of Fetterman’s office in Philadelphia, where video showed them chanting "ICE out" and holding signs bearing messages including “FETTERMAN VOTE NO on DHS BILL.”
But Fetterman has never supported a halt in government funding since he took office in 2023, according to the Philadelphia Inquirer. And this time around is no different, though the Pennsylvania Senator has joined many of his colleagues from both sides of the aisle in raising concerns about the tactics used in the immigration crackdown in Minneapolis, where federal agents fatally shot two residents within less than three weeks last month.
Democrats have outlined demands for additional guardrails for immigration officers including requirements for agents to obtain court-issued warrants before entering private property and to clearly display their identification and badge numbers; limits on agents’ use of masks; increased use of body cameras; updated guidelines governing federal agents’ use of force; and measures to ensure that independent investigations be carried out in the case of shootings.

The White House and many Republicans have argued that such restrictions would prevent agents from carrying out the President’s immigration agenda.
“We’re talking, but we have to protect law enforcement,” Trump said to reporters on Friday. “I know what they want, I know what they can live with. The Democrats have gone crazy.”
A recent survey by Hart Research for a Senate Democrat-aligned group showed that 54% of likely midterm voters supported blocking DHS funding without reforms to ICE. A separate poll by Data for Progress showed that 56% of voters support funding the TSA, FEMA, and the Coast Guard while making additional funding for ICE conditional on reforms.
“Country over party is refusing to hit the entire Department of Homeland Security,” Fetterman argued in a post on X on Friday. “Democracy demands a way forward to reform ICE without damaging our critical national security agencies.”

Some US schools cancel class pictures after online claims surrounding Epstein
Some school districts in the U.S. dropped plans for class pictures after widespread social media posts linked a billionaire with ties to Jeffrey Epstein to the photography giant Lifetouch
- Bookmark
Some school districts in the U.S. dropped plans for class pictures after widespread social media posts linked a billionaire with ties to Jeffrey Epstein to the photography giant Lifetouch, which on Friday called the claims “completely false.”
The disruption to school picture plans in Texas and elsewhere began after online posts linked Lifetouch, which photographs millions of students each year, to the investment fund manager Apollo Global Management. Apollo's former CEO is billionaire investor Leon Black, who met regularly with Epstein and was advised by Epstein on financial matters.
Black led the company in 2019, when funds managed by Apollo bought Lifetouch's parent company, Shutterfly. The $2.7 billion deal closed in September 2019 — a month after Epstein's death by suicide behind bars as he awaited trial over allegations from federal prosecutors that he sexually abused and trafficked dozens of girls.
Both Lifetouch and Apollo noted that timeline in statements Friday, two days after Lifetouch CEO Ken Murphy said in an Instagram post that neither Black nor any of Apollo's directors or investors ever had any access to Lifetouch photos.
“No Lifetouch executives have ever had any relationship or contact with Epstein and we have never shared student images with any third party, including Apollo,” Lifetouch said in its statement Friday. “Apollo and its funds also have no role in Lifetouch’s daily operations and have no access to student images.”
The canceled school pictures are another ripple effect over the release of millions of files from the Epstein investigation, including documents showing Epstein's regular contacts with CEOs, journalists, scientists and prominent politicians long after a 2008 conviction on sex crimes charges.
In the small Texas town of Malakoff, the local school district canceled a student picture day after several parents told the district they weren't comfortable with Lifetouch photographing their children, spokesperson Katherine Smith said in a statement e-mailed Friday. Several other schools and districts in Texas also canceled or changed plans, as well as a charter school in Arizona, according to Facebook announcements posted by the schools.
“We decided our students and families would be best served by keeping all of our pictures in-house for the rest of this year, and we are looking at all of our options for the 2026-2027 school year,” Smith said.
Parents concerned about Lifetouch included MaKallie Gann, whose children attend schools in Howe, about 60 miles (97 kilometers) north of Dallas. She said she was worried about how much information Lifetouch collects on students.
“Whenever you order the pictures, it has their name. It has the age, of course. It has their grade, their teacher, the school that they’re in,” she said.
No evidence of Epstein or anyone in his orbit seeing Lifetouch photos has emerged from news organizations' review of thousands of documents released this month by the U.S. Department of Justice, though there are at least 1.7 million records.
The review shows Black's name appeared 8,200 times, though that figure likely includes some duplicate records. Black stepped down as Apollo's CEO in March 2021, saying he wanted to focus on his family, health, and "many other interests.”
That was two months after a committee of the company's board issued a report concluding that Epstein had advised Black personally on estate planning, tax issues, charitable giving and running his “family office,” but provided no services to Apollo or invested in no Apollo funds.
The report also said the review — which Black requested — found “no evidence” that he was involved with Epstein’s alleged criminal activities “in any way” or “at any time.” ___

Europe calls for US reset at security talks

Europe calls for US reset at security talks
Sign up now: Get ST's newsletters delivered to your inbox
MUNICH – European leaders called Feb 13 for a reset in relations with the United States as they met at a top security conference where US President Donald Trump’s potshots at traditional transatlantic ties loomed large.
German Chancellor Friedrich Merz urged “a new transatlantic partnership” and French President Emmanuel Macron called for “a strong Europe” as more than 60 leaders gathered for the annual Munich Security Conference.
British Prime Minister Keir Starmer will meanwhile tell the conference on Feb 14 that Europe is “a sleeping giant” and must rely less on the United States for its defence, his office said in a preview of his remarks.
The 2026 conference comes at a time of strained ties between Europe and the United States, after Mr Trump threatened to take over Greenland and criticised “decaying” and “weak” European nations.
Russia’s war against Ukraine, set to enter its fifth year in February, is high on the agenda, alongside efforts by European NATO members to raise their defence budgets, in line with Mr Trump’s demands, out of concern that Moscow could seek to expand into their territory.
European leaders at the gathering defended their security commitments and the NATO alliance, which Mr Trump’s rhetoric has rattled.
“Being a part of NATO is not only Europe’s competitive advantage. It’s also the United States’ competitive advantage. So let’s repair and revive transatlantic trust together,” Mr Merz said.
“In the era of great-power rivalry, even the United States will not be powerful enough to go it alone.”
‘Greater European autonomy’
The gathering comes a year after US Vice-President JD Vance used the conference’s stage to attack European policies on immigration and free speech, shocking allies on the continent.
Macron emphatically defended Europe in his speech, saying “everyone should take their cue from us, instead of criticising us”.
Mr Starmer’s office said his speech would call for “a vision of European security and greater European autonomy that does not herald US withdrawal but answers the call for more burden sharing in full and remakes the ties that have served us so well”.
US Secretary of State Marco Rubio, who arrived on Feb 13, is also due to speak at the gathering on Feb 14, as is Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, organisers said.
A German government source said Mr Merz and Mr Rubio had met at the conference and discussed “Ukraine, the status of negotiations with Russia and further support for the country, particularly in terms of military aid”.
They also discussed Iran and NATO, and “Rubio praised Germany’s steps to strengthen the alliance,” the source added.
Mr Rubio also met his Chinese counterpart Wang Yi on the sidelines of the conference, at a time of heightened Washington-Beijing tensions.
Mr Rubio then held a 15-minute meeting with the prime ministers of Denmark and Greenland about the future sovereignty of the Arctic island. Denmark’s Mette Frederiksen called the talks “constructive”.
Ties plunged in January when Mr Trump stepped up threats to annex Greenland, an autonomous territory of NATO ally Denmark, forcing European nations to stand firm in protest.
Ukraine discussions
Mr Merz, Mr Macron and the leaders of the European Union, Canada and NATO met with Mr Zelensky on Feb 13 for talks on Ukraine.
A US official said Mr Rubio did not attend those talks due to a packed schedule, but was “engaging on Russia-Ukraine in many of his meetings” in Munich.
Ukrainian Foreign Minister Andriy Sybiga said he discussed ending the Russian invasion with Mr Wang, whose country is a close partner of Moscow.
Mr Wang told Sybiga that Beijing was “willing to provide Ukraine with new humanitarian aid”, according to a Chinese foreign ministry readout.
Mr Macron meanwhile said a new framework was needed to deal with “an aggressive Russia” once the fighting in Ukraine ends.
“If it makes sense to talk, we are willing to talk,” said Mr Merz. “But as you can see with the American side, Russia is not yet willing to talk seriously.”
Mr Zelensky, urged by Mr Trump to “get moving” on a deal to end the war, visited a drone factory near Munich with German Defence Minister Boris Pistorius before meeting with European leaders.
“It’s good to have strong partnership with Americans... but I think that Europe... needs (an) independent defence industry, very strong,” he said.
NATO’s Secretary General Mark Rutte said on the sidelines of the conference that Europe was “stepping up... taking more of a leadership role within NATO” and “taking more care of its own defence”.
“A strong Europe in a strong NATO means that the transatlantic bond will be stronger than ever,” Mr Rutte said. AFP

Gary wasn't impressed by Australia's dumpling scene. Now he's selling thousands a day

At a small restaurant near Melbourne's Chinatown, dumpling-making is in full swing.
It's a special Lunar New Year event that's drawn almost 30 foodies from a range of backgrounds.
"This is the first time I have made dumplings," customer Gavin Rajahmoney said. His family migrated from Sri Lanka.
"I am studying Chinese language and my teacher invited me to this event," he said.
"I first made dumplings when I was in China, about 25 years ago," said Adam, who previously lived and worked in Hong Kong and drove 70km from home in Geelong to join the workshop.
Hand-rolling dumplings is an age-old skill in Asia, dating back thousands of years to the Han dynasty in China.
The pockets of pastry symbolise prosperity and are traditionally filled with vegetables or minced meat such as pork, ginger and spices.
"Normally we start off with the dumpling skin that'll be pre-prepared," customer Paul Hordijenko said.
"Then we roll it out and then get some of the filling, pop it into the middle, and then we have to squeeze it together to make a seal."
Dumpling restaurant owner Gary Zhao, 33, who came up with the idea of a make-your-own workshop several months ago, said the concept has taken off.
"The reality has shocked me. Many people from different cultures have come along and they are all very interested in this," he said.
"Also, the customers learn very fast to make the dumplings, even faster than I can imagine, and they really enjoy it."
Zhao grew up in China's Guangdong province, and his family — originally from northern China — routinely prepared dumplings for meals.
After migrating to Australia in 2016, Zhao felt disappointed by the local offering.
"I really love to eat dumplings and didn't find the ones I liked here, so I decided to start my own dumpling restaurant," he said.
Zhao opened Hoppy Dumpling in Melbourne's Russell Street in 2024 and will soon open a second venue in South Yarra.
Hoppy Dumpling's menu spans pan-fried dumplings, premium steamed xiao long bao, wontons, noodles and a range of fried dishes.
Dumplings are served cooked to order, and fresh or frozen for takeaway.
However, Zhao said the workshop offered fillings beyond traditional flavours, with five pre-prepared choices.
"One traditional filling is celery and pork. But other filling flavours are Korean-style spicy kimchi with pork. There's also a French-style chicken liver pâté, as well as chicken, cheese and corn," he said.
"I liked the chicken and corn, it tasted really good. It was like a burst of flavour in my mouth," customer Linisha Condisetti said.
To please the palates of a diverse range of customers, there is also a curry beef option.
"Curry beef I like but I also like all the others," Rajahmoney said.
While new flavours are well received, many still prefer traditional fillings — with pork and celery crowned most popular.
"Some customers do prefer original Chinese style dumplings," said Zhao.
"But Melbourne is a very diverse city with people from all over the world and we wanted to offer a fillings inspired by different cultures."
While the choice of filling may be to personal taste, there's one thing many agree on:
"The dumplings that you buy in a supermarket are just quick and convenient, with pretty standard taste," Hordijenko said.
"But the ones that you make by hand, they taste much fresher."
Hordijenko's family migrated from Ukraine, where dumplings called varenyky are also popular. They are crescent-shaped, boiled and made from unleavened dough.
"Ukrainian dumplings are normally quite a lot bigger and the skin is thicker and sticky. And then the traditional filling that you will get inside is normally a mix of potato and cheese," he said.
Hordijenko said he discovered more about the history of Lunar New Year celebrations during the workshop.
"Today I learned that in China, people normally put a coin inside the filling for good luck, for prosperity."
Good fortune has certainly arrived for Zhao, who said sales have soared since he introduced the first DIY dumpling event.
"Previously, we sold about 1,000 dumplings a day. But after launching this event, now we average 2,400–2,500 dumplings a day," he said.
"Business is getting better and better so we also plan more make-your-own dumpling events, and also hope to open even more branches."
For many customers, making dumplings together helps to bring the family closer.
"It is a really nice activity for family bonding and a really great way to learn the art of making traditional dumplings," Condisetti said.
Zhao can only agree.
"Gathering to make dumplings and eat dumplings — no matter the holiday and even if people are busy across the country — sharing dumplings does unite families," he said.
"This is the food culture we really want to convey."

Lindsey Graham says Greenland ‘is behind us’ and ‘who gives a s***’ who owns the territory

Lindsey Graham says Greenland ‘is behind us’ and ‘who gives a s***’ who owns the territory
Trump’s aggressive push to gain control of Greenland, a semi-autonomous territory of Denmark, has been met with intense backlash from Europe
- Bookmark

Senator Lindsey Graham, a South Carolina Republican, has said Greenland is “behind” the United States and asked, “Who gives a s***” who owns the Danish territory amid President Donald Trump’s efforts to acquire the mineral-rich Arctic island.
Trump’s aggressive push to gain control of Greenland has been met with intense backlash from Europe.
After threatening last month to impose a 10 percent tariff on several NATO allies, including Denmark, until a deal is reached for the “complete and total purchase of Greenland,” leaders from those European nations said they “stand in full solidarity” with Denmark.
They rebuked Trump’s tariff threats, saying such an ultimatum would “undermine transatlantic relations and risk a dangerous downward spiral.”
Trump later pulled back on his tariff threats after a “very productive meeting” with the head of NATO, Mark Rutte, where they “formed the framework of a future deal with respect to Greenland.”
When asked by Politico what he’d say to his “friends from Europe” who are “nervous” about the controversy over Greenland, Graham joked, “If you’re nervous, have a beer, go see a doctor.”
“Greenland is behind us, but the goal is to get outcomes. Who gives a s*** who owns Greenland? I don’t,” Graham said on the sidelines of the Munich Security Conference in Germany on Friday.
“Greenland is gonna be more fortified because Donald Trump…is gonna go big,” Graham said, adding that Trump has “got skin in the game.”
Trump claims his push for Greenland is rooted in “national security” concerns, warning that the semi-autonomous territory is threatened by Russia and China.
The U.S. currently has one military base in Greenland. The Pituffik Space Base “supports Missile Warning, Missile Defense and Space Surveillance missions,” according to the U.S. Space Force.
Trump mentioned the ongoing negotiations between the U.S. and Europe over Greenland Friday.
“Greenland’s gonna want us, but we get along very well with Europe. We’ll see how it all works out. We’re negotiating right now for Greenland,” the president told reporters outside the White House.
Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York reassured Europe that the “vast majority of the American people do not want to see these relationships frayed.”
The Democrat said during a discussion at the Munich Security Conference Friday that her party is “shocked at the president's destruction of our relationship with our European allies. His threatening over Greenland is not a joke. It is not funny. It threatens the very trust that allows peace to persist.”

US military preparing for potentially weeks-long Iran operations

09:06:11 KST

The US military is preparing for the possibility of sustained, weeks-long operations against Iran if President Donald Trump orders an attack, two US officials told Reuters, in what could become a far more serious conflict than previously seen between the countries.
The disclosure by officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity because of the sensitive nature of the planning, raises the stakes for the ongoing diplomacy between the United States and Iran.
US and Iranian diplomats held talks in Oman last week in an effort to revive diplomacy over Tehran's nuclear program, after Trump amassed military forces in the region, raising fears of new military action.
US officials said on Friday that the Pentagon was sending an additional aircraft carrier to the Middle East, adding thousands more troops, fighter aircraft, guided-missile destroyers, and other firepower capable of conducting attacks and defending against them.
Trump, speaking to US troops on Friday at a base in North Carolina, said it had "been difficult to make a deal" with Iran.
"Sometimes you have to have fear. That's the only thing that really will get the situation taken care of," Trump said.
Asked for comment on the preparations for a potentially sustained US military operation, White House spokesperson Anna Kelly said: "President Trump has all options on the table with regard to Iran."
"He listens to a variety of perspectives on any given issue, but makes the final decision based on what is best for our country and national security," Kelly said.
The Pentagon declined to comment.
The United States sent two aircraft carriers to the region last year when it carried out strikes against Iranian nuclear sites.
However, June's "Midnight Hammer" operation was essentially a one-off US attack, with stealth bombers flying from the United States to strike Iranian nuclear facilities. Iran staged a very limited retaliatory strike on a US base in Qatar.
Risks increasing
The planning underway this time is more complex, the officials said.
In a sustained campaign, the US military could hit Iranian state and security facilities, not just nuclear infrastructure, one of the officials said. The official declined to provide specific details.
Experts say the risks to US forces would be far greater in such an operation against Iran, which boasts a formidable arsenal of missiles. Retaliatory Iranian strikes also increase the risk of a regional conflict.
The same official said the United States fully expected Iran to retaliate, leading to back-and-forth strikes and reprisals over a period of time.
The White House and Pentagon did not respond to questions about the risks of retaliation or regional conflict.
Trump has repeatedly threatened to bomb Iran over its nuclear and ballistic missile programs and crushing of internal dissent. On Thursday, he warned the alternative to a diplomatic solution would "be very traumatic, very traumatic."
Iran's Revolutionary Guards have warned that in case of strikes on Iranian territory, they could retaliate against any US military base.
The US maintains bases throughout the Middle East, including in Jordan, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Bahrain, the United Arab Emirates, and Turkey.
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu met Trump for talks in Washington on Wednesday, saying that if an agreement with Iran were reached, "it must include the elements that are vital to Israel."
Iran has said it is prepared to discuss curbs on its nuclear program in exchange for lifting sanctions, but has ruled out linking the issue to missiles.

One-month deadline? Trump weighs military options as new threat looms over Iran

Iran has begun observing 40 days of mourning for those killed in the massacre, as U.S. President Donald Trump said the deadline for talks with Tehran is “within the next month” — and a possible reason for that timetable may now be emerging. According to an assessment cited by the Daily Mail, the aircraft carrier USS Gerald R. Ford, which the United States has decided to deploy to the Middle East along with its strike group, will take up to four weeks to reach the region from its current position in the Caribbean.
Speaking outside the White House on Friday evening, Trump was asked why he had ordered the Ford’s deployment. "If we need it, we’ll have it ready,” he replied. The president added that he believes the talks will succeed, "but if they’re not, it’s going to be a bad day for Iran, very bad.”
The New York Times reported, citing U.S. officials, that the options Trump is considering include military action against Iran’s nuclear program and its ability to launch ballistic missiles. He is also weighing the possibility of sending U.S. commandos to strike specific military targets inside Iran.
A senior U.S. administration official told the Daily Mail that during a White House meeting between Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Trump, Netanyahu urged the president to take a tougher line on Iran. “Netanyahu basically said, ‘Iran is playing games. You don’t want them to maneuver you.’ Trump listened,” the official said.
Inside Iran, anger continues to simmer over the regime’s sweeping crackdown on protests and the killings that followed. The outrage may intensify in the coming days as families begin marking the traditional 40-day mourning period for their loved ones.
Videos circulating online already show mourners gathering in several parts of the country, holding portraits of the dead. One video showed mourners at a cemetery in Razavi Khorasan province singing a patriotic song dating back to the 1940s, during the rule of Shah Reza Pahlavi. “O Iran, land full of treasures, your soil is full of art,” they sang. “May you live forever. O enemy, if you are granite — I am iron.”
According to the New York Times, at the outset of the anti-regime protests in late December, demonstrators received threatening text messages from authorities stating that their presence at “illegal gatherings” had been documented and that they were under “intelligence surveillance.” “It is recommended to refrain from participating in such gatherings, which the enemy desires,” the message said. Researchers concluded that the government likely tracked protesters using cellphone location data.
Organizations that have examined Iran’s capabilities say the regime possesses one of the most extensive surveillance systems known worldwide, including technology to monitor mobile devices, as well as facial recognition and other tracking methods. While these digital tools have received less attention than the sweeping internet shutdowns imposed during last month’s violent crackdown, Iranian accounts and a security official told the Times that as authorities gradually restore internet access, they have detained individuals suspected of participating in protests and subjected them to lengthy, aggressive interrogations based on facial recognition and phone data.
The USS Gerald R. Ford will join the USS Abraham Lincoln already in the Middle East, marking the first time since March 2025 that two U.S. aircraft carriers have operated in the region simultaneously. At that time, the USS Harry S. Truman and USS Carl Vinson were deployed during U.S. strikes against Houthi targets in Yemen.
The Ford previously deployed to the region at the outset of the war, in a move intended to deter Hezbollah following former President Joe Biden’s widely noted “Don’t” speech. U.S. officials at the time informed Israel of the deployment and stressed that sufficient forces were in place, with additional assets available if needed.
Named for the 38th president of the United States, the carrier carries more than 75 aircraft and is staffed by thousands of Navy personnel. Its defensive systems include missile launchers, Rolling Airframe Missiles, radar systems and Phalanx close-in weapon systems designed to intercept short-range threats, as well as 25 mm and .50-caliber machine guns to defend against small vessels.
In remarks that included sharp criticism of President Isaac Herzog, Trump reiterated that talks with Iran have a deadline of “the next month” or the consequences would be “very traumatic” for Tehran. “A deal with Iran will probably happen within the next month, something like that,” he said. “It shouldn’t take long — it should happen quickly. They need to agree very quickly.”
He noted that when Iran previously failed to reach an agreement, it culminated in Operation Midnight Hammer, during which the U.S. military struck Iranian nuclear facilities, including the site at Fordow. He did not explicitly mention Israel’s Operation Rising Lion, which marked the start of the 12-day war.
Asked whether Netanyahu wants him to halt negotiations with Iran, Trump said, “He didn’t say that and we didn’t discuss it. I’ll talk to them as long as I want, and we’ll see if we can make a deal. And if we can’t, we’ll have to move to phase two, which will be very hard for them. I don’t want that to happen.”
Israeli officials are familiar with the timeline Trump outlined and say he has allocated only a few weeks for negotiations. Netanyahu remains skeptical, though he has defined his red lines.

As a Colorado River deadline passes, reservoirs keep declining

- The Trump administration gave seven states a deadline to reach a water deal for the Colorado River.
- As they missed it, the governors of California, Arizona and Nevada called their stance “firm and fair.”
The leaders of seven states announced Friday, one day before a Trump administration deadline, that there is still no deal to share the diminishing waters of the Colorado River.
That leaves the Southwest in a quagmire with uncertain repercussions while the river’s depleted reservoirs continue to decline.
Former U.S. Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt said in an interview with The Times that the impasse now appears so intractable that Trump administration officials should take a step back, abandon the current effort and begin all over again.
Babbitt said he believes it would be a mistake for Interior Secretary Doug Burgum to “try to impose a long-term solution” by ordering major water cuts across the Southwest — which would likely set off a lengthy court battle.
“We need a fresh start,” Babbitt said. “I believe that in the absence of a unanimous agreement, [the Interior Department] should renew the existing agreements for five years, and then we should start all over. We should scrap the entire process and invent a new one.”
Negotiators for seven states remain deeply divided over how to cut water use along the Colorado River. The chances of a court battle appear to be growing, with the threat of deep cuts in water deliveries to California and other Western states.
Officials for the seven states have tried to boost reservoir levels via voluntary water cutbacks and federal payments to farmers who agree to leave fields dry part of the year. But after more than two years of trying to hash out new long-term rules for sharing water, they remain deadlocked; the existing rules are set to expire at the end of this year.
The states similarly blew past an earlier federal deadline in November.
Interior Department officials have not said how they will respond. The agency is considering four options for imposing cutbacks starting next year, as well as the option of taking no action.
Babbitt, who was Interior secretary under President Clinton from 1993 to 2001, said he thinks the Trump administration’s options are too narrow and inadequate. They would place the burden of water cuts on Arizona, California and Nevada while not requiring any for the four other upriver states — Colorado, Utah, Wyoming and New Mexico.
Without a consensus, the only reasonable approach is to extend existing water-saving agreements for a few years while making a new push for solutions, Babbitt said.
Federal officials have “missed the opportunity” to take a strong leadership role, he said, and it’s time to reimagine the effort as a “much more inclusive, public, broad” process.
The river provides for about 35 million people and 5 million acres of farmland, from the Rocky Mountains to northern Mexico. California uses more water than any other state but has cut back substantially in recent years.
Since 2000, relentless drought intensified by climate change has sapped the river’s flow and left reservoirs depleted. This winter’s record warmth and lack of storms has left the Rockies with very little snow.
Lake Mead, the river’s largest reservoir, is now 34% full, while Lake Powell is at 26%.
Years ago, scientists said climate change would bring a Colorado River crisis. Their warnings, which largely went unheeded, are now playing out.
“Our states have conserved large volumes of water in recent years,” California Gov. Gavin Newsom said in a joint statement with Arizona’s Katie Hobbs and Nevada’s Joe Lombardo. “Our stance remains firm and fair: all seven basin states must share in the responsibility of conservation.”
The states’ positions haven’t changed much in the last two years, said JB Hamby, California’s lead negotiator, and moving toward an agreement will require firm commitments for cuts by all.
Officials representing the four Upper Basin states said they’ve offered compromises and are prepared to continue negotiating. In a written statement, they stressed they are already dealing with substantial water cuts, and said their downstream neighbors are trying to secure water “that simply does not exist.”

Enemy weapons detector in the hands of soldiers five years early
New acoustic weapon detection system will help keep soldier safe on the battlefield by helping to locate and target positions of enemy gunfire, mortars and explostions.
-
250 jobs across the country sustained after new contract signed with Leonardo UK.
-
System to be in soldiers’ hands five years ahead of schedule, with rollout to frontline troops within 12 months.
-
29 UK SMEs to benefit as part of the supply chain, helping to make UK defence an engine for growth.
British soldiers will be able to more aggressively hunt, detect, and locate hostile gunfire, as well as receive a further layer of protection on the battlefield, with the early delivery of new technology.
Through SONUS - a new system to detect enemy weapons - UK forces will now have access to a capability that weighs 70% less than its predecessor, making it easier to transport and able to deploy in under three minutes.
SONUS works by detecting acoustic pressure waves from gunfire, mortars and explosions.
This form of detection means the system can operate covertly, without emitting an electronic signature, helping troops to avoid enemy fire. It will also enable soldiers to identify targets faster and more accurately, meaning they can take evasive or offensive action more effectively.
Defence supplier Leonardo UK have been awarded the £18.3 million contract by the Army five-years earlier than originally planned. The works sustains 250 jobs across the UK, notably at Leonardo’s Basildon site, as well as through 29 small and medium sized enterprises (SMEs).
The procurement is happening as part of the largest sustained increase in defence spending since the end of the Cold War – hitting 2.6% of GDP from 2027.
Minister for Defence Readiness and Industry, Luke Pollard MP, said:
We’ve accelerated our procurement of this equipment by five years to provide additional layers of safety for our personnel through more durable, lightweight systems in a new era of threat.
Making defence an engine for growth is a key priority for this government and this deal sustains jobs across the UK, benefits multiple SMEs and boosts our Armed Forces.
The SONUS platforms will be delivered to 5th Regiment Royal Artillery, the British Army’s dedicated Surveillance and Target Acquisition Regiment, over the next 12 months.
Brigadier M Birch, Senior Responsible Owner for the Land ISTAR Programme, said:
This investment in Leonardo’s SONUS Acoustic Weapon Locating System demonstrates the Army’s commitment to delivering cutting-edge technology to the front line.
It will significantly enhance our ability to protect our people and respond to emerging threats, ensuring the Army remains ready to meet the challenges of the future.
Olly Manning, Vice President Mission Systems at Leonardo, said:
Leonardo has over 40 years of experience in passive acoustic weapon-locating technology, with battle-proven systems that have seen operational use with over 13 armed forces – many of whom are NATO members.
We are looking forward to working in partnership with the British Army to ensure SONUS provides them with an accurate, robust and reliable passive detection system that will keep our Armed Forces safe – now and into the future.
The investment helps deliver on the Strategic Defence Review (SDR) and Defence Industrial Strategy (DIS) – improving warfighting readiness, strengthening the UK’s defence industrial base, and making defence as an engine for growth.
Through procurement reforms, the Army prioritised fast tracking important weapon-locating systems as part of the Army’s initiative to modernise and double their lethality by 2027. Its accelerated delivery was achieved by the LAND ISTAR Team, working with Defence Equipment and Support (DE&S) and Task Force RAPSTONE.

Twenty years of the Chip and Pin: How the way we pay has evolved
There has been a 95 per cent reduction in losses to counterfeit card fraud over the past 20 years thanks to the chip & pin
- Bookmark
- CommentsGo to comments
This weekend marks two decades since Chip and PIN fundamentally transformed in-store card payments, revolutionising daily transactions long before mobile phones became digital wallets.
The system significantly enhanced security, replacing traditional signature authorisations with a four-digit personal identification number (PIN) entered via a keypad for purchases.
According to UK Finance, the banking and finance industry body, a primary objective was to reduce "card-present" fraud, including magnetic stripe cloning and counterfeit card scams.
The initiative proved highly effective, leading to a 95 per cent reduction in losses from counterfeit card fraud over the past 20 years.
The UK's full adoption of Chip and PIN officially began on 15 February 2006, following the implementation deadline on Valentine's Day.
At that time, 99 per cent of cardholders were thought to have at least one chip and pin-enabled card in their wallet.
Some security concerns were voiced around the time that the scheme was initially introduced, including that criminals may watch someone inputting their pin and then steal their card, and that some people could become a fraud target by carrying their pin details around with their card.
However, there were also significant concerns about the opportunities for fraudsters from using the old-style payment.
Ways to pay have transformed in the past 20 years, along with criminals’ tactics.
UK Finance said there are more than 25 million additional cards now in circulation compared with two decades ago.

Contactless payments were also introduced in 2007, initially with a limit of £10.
The current contactless card payment limit is £100 and in March the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) will make changes to enable banks and payment providers with strong fraud controls to set their own limits in future, if they choose to.
Currently, contactless accounts for two-thirds (66 per cent) of all credit card and three-quarters (76 per cent) of UK debit card transactions, according to UK Finance.
Mobile payments have also grown rapidly, UK Finance said, with about half of people using mobile contactless payments at least once a month.
Despite the evolving way that people pay, UK Finance said that chip and pin remains important for higher value transactions, accounting for 30 per cent of credit and debit card payments by value.
As a result, the average chip and pin transaction is £93 compared with an average of £17 for a contactless payment.
As criminals’ tactics have changed, there has been a rise in remote purchase fraud, with £215 million stolen in the first half of 2025, UK Finance said.
Fraudsters will use social engineering techniques to trick people into handing over their one-time passcodes, enabling criminals to make fraudulent online card transactions or fraudulently register digital wallets.
UK Finance is urging people to follow the advice of the Take Five to Stop Fraud campaign, which encourages people to pause to consider whether something could be a scam, before acting on a request.
Jana Mackintosh, managing director of payments at UK Finance said: “The evolution of payments is remarkable and will continue to be so as the needs of consumers and businesses change.
“In 2006 the iPhone hadn’t yet been launched, and you couldn’t tap your card to pay for something, whereas today these are the most popular payment methods for UK consumers and many people are happy to only carry their phone rather than a bank card.
“The industry will continue to support and drive innovation and change, like the introduction of chip and pin, which gives consumers the confidence to safely buy things in shops and drive growth across the economy.”
Nick Quin, chief corporate affairs officer at ATM and cash access network Link, said: “The anniversary highlights how things change quickly in payments and banking.
“In the past 20 years we’ve seen people increasingly shift from cash to card and now increasingly digital wallets.
“Our research shows that half of people are happy to leave the house without a physical wallet but cash still plays role in everyday spending for millions.
“As we embrace the next generation of payments technology, we need to make sure it serves everyone, from cash users to digital natives.”
Simon Forbes, division president, UK and Ireland at Mastercard, said: “Chip and pin – and more recently contactless – have played a pivotal role in the evolution of payments.
“Today, online innovation is driving the next leap forward, moving us away from manually entering long card numbers when shopping online and towards one‑click payments, such as click to pay, that are safer, faster and more convenient.”

Valentine’s Day: What makes a good kiss? Here is the psychology behind it
Scientists have explained that ‘thoughts, fantasies and emotional context’ all enhance kissing quality
- Bookmark
- CommentsGo to comments
Scientists have revealed that the quality of a kiss is less about technique and more about the "thoughts, fantasies and emotional context we bring to it".
Researchers at Abertay University challenged the common belief that kissing inherently ignites sexual chemistry, instead investigating the profound impact of cognitive and emotional elements on kissing behaviours.
Their methodology involved an online survey, where participants from the UK and Italy were questioned on their attitudes, experiences, and fantasies concerning intimacy and the act of kissing.
They rated what they considered to be the hallmarks of a good kiss, alongside assessing their own perceived kissing prowess.
The survey also gathered data on the frequency of intimate fantasies and details regarding their sexual desire.
The results showed kissing is “far more than a sensory experience”.
The researchers found people who often daydream about intimacy tend to place more importance on contact and arousal when deciding what makes someone a good kisser.
This pattern held even when the researchers considered factors like creativity and sexual desire.
They said this shows imagination, and not just physical sensation, plays a key role in how we experience affection.
Dr Christopher Watkins, senior lecturer in the department of sociological and psychological sciences at Abertay University, said: “Our findings show that kissing is far more than a sensory experience.
“It’s shaped by the thoughts, fantasies, and emotional context we bring to it.
“Historically, certain strands of research on human sexuality have focused on sensory experiences and how we respond to physical stimulation, but our study highlights how imagination and internal states play an important role in how we interact with a partner when kissing them.
“By examining both the psychological and physical elements, we can better understand why people differ in how they use and appreciate kissing in their relationships, and why a single kiss can feel so meaningful.”
The team said the study’s findings could be developed into a “simple tool” within couples therapy.
Study co-author Milena Rota, who is now a PhD student at the University of Leicester, said: “By showing how fantasy shapes romantic behaviour, our research offers fresh insight into the role played by our thoughts in how we express ourselves in romantic contexts.
“Our research could be developed further as one simple tool within couples therapy, looking at how fantasy could guide behaviours – in this case a romantic kiss – where frequent kissing has previously shown to be related to higher quality romantic relationships.”
The study was published in the journal Sexual and Relationship Therapy.

Thousands of mental health patients could receive better treatment thanks to major study
The research, which is being supported by 10 NHS trusts, could “transform” the understanding of severe mental illness, officials said

Thousands of individuals in England with severe mental health problems are being recruited for a major study, aiming to develop personalised treatments for conditions like schizophrenia and bipolar disorder.
Supported by 10 NHS trusts, officials state the research could "transform" the understanding of severe mental illness.
The three-year GlobalMinds project is looking for 49,000 participants.
Eligible patients with severe depression and psychosis will be identified and contacted via NHS England’s DigiTrials service.
Participants will receive at-home sampling kits, enabling experts to combine genetic data from blood or saliva with questionnaire responses and NHS medical records.
The aim is to develop detailed data on severe mental health conditions to eventually improve diagnosis and potentially develop personalised treatments.
Dr Adrian James, NHS England’s national medical director for mental health and neurodiversity, said: “This major new study could transform our understanding of severe mental illness and lead to the dawn of a new era of personalised treatments for patients with conditions including schizophrenia and severe depression.
“People living with a severe mental illness are affected by their condition every day, and it can often lead to preventable physical conditions and shorter lifespans.
“The new study gives us the opportunity to change the way we treat these conditions and we’re using the NHS’s DigiTrials service to invite suitable people faster, fairly and at scale. I’d encourage anyone contacted to consider signing up to be part of this ground-breaking study.”
The study is being led by mental health data science company Akrivia Health in partnership with Cardiff University.
It has initially been launched in England and Wales, with plans to expand internationally.
Around 2,000 patients are already enrolled and 1,000 people with dementia will also take part.
Professor James Walters of Cardiff University, who is chief investigator on GlobalMinds, said the study “provides an unprecedented opportunity to uncover and identify the many personal and biological factors behind mental health conditions”.
He added: “Precision medicine has already revolutionised the treatment of cancer and other rare diseases and we want GlobalMinds to bring the same breakthroughs to mental health.
“By creating the first large-scale dataset linking both genetic and detailed routine clinical information, GlobalMinds will unlock a new era of personalised mental health care, so we can help tackle the global mental health crisis.”
Brian Dow, deputy chief executive of Rethink Mental Illness, said: “This study has real potential to deepen our understanding and open the door to a new generation of treatments for mental illness.
“The strength of the study lies in the partnership between researchers, the NHS and charities like ours, which means data can be powerfully fused with lived experience, with the voices of people experiencing mental illness remaining front and centre.”
According to the mental health charity Mind, around one in five adults in England have a common mental health condition, such as anxiety or depression, in any given week.
It also estimates the percentage of people reporting severe mental health symptoms rose from 7% in 1993 to nearly 12% in 2023/24.

‘Remarkable’ changes to the way we pay in 20 years of using chip and pin

This weekend marks 20 years since chip and pin fully replaced signatures for in-store card purchases, with the initiative transforming how people make day-to-day transactions long before people started digging out their mobile phone to pay.
The move enhanced security around card payments as customers put their four-digit personal identification number (pin) into a keypad to authorise a purchase, moving away from the “traditional” signature authorisation.
Banking and finance industry body UK Finance said that one of the key reasons for the introduction of chip and pin was to reduce “card-present” fraud, and magnetic stripe cloning or counterfeit card fraud.

Ocasio-Cortez says US military aid to Israel ‘enabled a genocide in Gaza’

Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez said during a Munich security conference panel on Friday on the future of foreign policy that the Democratic party’s next presidential nominee should reconsider the country’s military aid to Israel.
Hagar Shezaf of the Israeli newspaper Haaretz asked the US congresswoman if she thought “the Democratic presidential candidate in the 2028 elections should re-evaluate military aid to Israel”.
“To me this isn’t just about a presidential election,” Ocasio-Cortez replied, “personally, I think that the United States has an obligation to uphold its own laws, particularly the Leahy laws.
“I think that, personally, the idea of completely unconditional aid, no matter what one does, does not make sense,” she added. “I think it enabled a genocide in Gaza, and I think that we have thousands of women and children dead … that was completely avoidable.
“So I believe that enforcement of our own laws, through the Leahy laws, which requires conditioning aid in any circumstance when you see gross human rights violations is appropriate,” Ocasio-Cortez concluded.
The Leahy laws are two statutory provisions, named for the former senator Patrick Leahy who introduced them in the 1990s, which prohibit the US defense department and state department from providing funds to “units of foreign security forces where there is credible information implicating that unit in the commission of gross violations of human rights”.
But, according to Charles Blaha, the former director of the state department office that leads Leahy vetting of foreign security units, while state “department officials insist that Israeli units are subject to the same vetting standards as units from any other country. Maybe in theory. But in practice, that’s simply not true.”
Matt Whitaker, the US ambassador to Nato, declined to directly answer the question, saying Israel is “one of our closest allies”.
Earlier in the day, Ocasio-Cortez had accused Donald Trump of seeking to introduce an “age of authoritarianism” and condemning his foreign policy in front of its allies’ top policymakers.
In her remarks, Ocasio-Cortez said Trump and Marco Rubio, the secretary of state, were “looking to withdraw the United States from the entire world so that we can turn into an age of authoritarianism”, as they sought to “carve out a world where Donald Trump can command the western hemisphere and Latin America as his personal sandbox, where Putin can saber rattle around Europe and try to bully our own allies there”.
She went on further to outline what she called an “alternative vision” for a leftwing US foreign policy, saying that she and her fellow Democrats were calling for a return to a “rules-based order” without the “hypocrisies” of US foreign policy that have dominated the past and current administrations.
It remains unclear how big a role Democrats’ positions on the Israel-Gaza conflict will play in the 2028 presidential race. Some of the Democrats viewed as likely contenders have already faced questions on the issue, with some staking out a more critical stance than Kamala Harris or Joe Biden did in the 2024 race.

Philippines’ AI reckoning puts 13 million jobs on the line
The US$30 billion outsourcing sector is fighting to adapt, leaving millions of workers with a stark choice: upskill or be left behind
Renso Bajala didn’t expect a machine to help decide whether he kept his job.
The AI analysed his tone, delivery and keyword usage, scoring each interaction for sentiment and customer experience. No one had mentioned it during training.
“I was a new hire, and nothing in our training curriculum said that AI would be used to measure our performances,” Bajala told This Week in Asia. “Then the trainer informed us that the outcome from the AI software would be part of our metrics.”
At first, he did not resist the idea of being evaluated by AI. What wore him down was the way the scoring felt fixed and context-blind, as if the system could not see what a human listener might understand about a difficult call.
“If it [the score] was low, you’d start overthinking what you did wrong, even if you felt you did your best,” he said, adding that the process felt “unfair”.

President Volodymyr Zelensky met with Reza Pahlavi, Iranian opposition figure and exiled son of the country's last monarch, on the sidelines of the Munich Security Conference on Feb. 13.
In a social media post after the meeting, Zelensky said Ukraine "supports the Iranian people in their struggle for their future" and expressed sympathy "with all the victims of the Iranian regime."
Zelensky said the two discussed the situation inside Iran and "the areas in which the people of Iran need support," as well as the importance of strengthening sanctions against Iran and other authoritarian governments.
He also condemned cooperation between Moscow and Tehran, citing Iran's supply of Shahed drones to Russia and what he described as the transfer of licenses related to their production.
"Such a partnership poses a real threat not only to Ukraine, but also to the entire region," Zelensky wrote.
Zelensky thanked Pahlavi for supporting Ukraine's territorial integrity and said Ukraine was prepared to help "to protect human lives."
Pahlavi, who has lived in exile since the 1979 Islamic Revolution that toppled his father—the last shah of Iran—said on social media he was "very pleased" to meet Zelensky.
"We represent two nations that are fighting against threats to their freedom and national sovereignty," Pahlavi wrote. "Our two nations are bound together by this very reality and also by the extraordinary courage of their people."
Pahlavi has advocated for a secular, democratic Iran, though his prominence among opposition figures and influence inside the country are debated. During Iran's most recent wave of protests, he urged demonstrators to overthrow the government.

WASHINGTON – Anthropic’s artificial-intelligence model Claude was used in the US military’s operation to capture former Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro, the Wall Street Journal reported on Feb 13, citing people familiar with the matter.
Claude’s deployment came via Anthropic’s partnership with data firm Palantir Technologies, whose platforms are widely used by the Defense Department and federal law enforcement, the report added.
Reuters could not immediately verify the report. The US Defense Department, the White House, Anthropic and Palantir did not immediately respond to Reuters’ requests for comment.
The Pentagon is pushing top AI companies, including OpenAI and Anthropic, to make their artificial-intelligence tools available on classified networks without many of the standard restrictions that the firms apply to users, Reuters exclusively reported on Feb 11.
Many AI companies are building custom tools for the US military, most of which are available only on unclassified networks typically used for military administration. Anthropic is the only one that is available in classified settings through third parties, but the government is still bound by the company’s usage policies.
The usage policies of Anthropic, which raised US$30 billion (S$37.9 billion) in its latest funding round and is now valued at US$380 billion, forbid using Claude to support violence, design weapons or carry out surveillance.

A White House memo says demolition crews "excellently preserved" the White House residence when they tore down the East Wing for President Donald Trump’s planned ballroom

The White House mansion's eastern facade appears to have been “excellently preserved” when demolition crews tore down the East Wing to make way for President Donald Trump's planned ballroom, an administration official said in a memo made public Friday.
Contractors took pains to protect the White House residence during demolition, keeping heavy equipment at a safe distance and removing some pieces by hand, Joshua Fisher, director of the White House Office of Administration, wrote to the commission charged with approving plans for Trump's ballroom. Some sections of the building were stabilized ahead of time, and vibration and crack movement were monitored, he wrote.
The National Capital Planning Commission, which is led by a top Trump aide, had requested more details about the demolition that began with little advance notice last fall. The agency has jurisdiction over construction and major renovations to government buildings in the region.
The East Wing demolition prompted a public outcry when it began without the independent reviews, congressional approval and public comment that are typical for even relatively minor modifications to historic buildings in Washington. The National Trust for Historic Preservation has sued to halt construction of the ballroom.
The memo documents the history of the East Wing dating back to Thomas Jefferson's presidency and lays out the White House's justification for tearing it down, saying it was not feasible to preserve it while meeting Trump's goals for the project. The completed ballroom will include an improved visitors center for security screening and will lessen the need for road closures during major events, Fisher wrote.
Curators documented and preserved artwork, furniture and other items of historical significance, including “the East Wing cornerstone and plaque, movie theater furniture, the East Colonnade columns, the Porte-cochere columns, interior wood paneling, chandeliers, historic windows and doors, and other hardware and fixtures,” he wrote.
“Our goal is to ensure that some of these items will be integrated into the new structure,” Fisher added.
Engineers are studying whether the West Colonnade, which connects the White House residence to the West Wing offices, can support a second story that would make it more visually symmetrical with plans for a larger East Colonnade connecting to the ballroom, the memo said. No decisions have been made.
The White House also submitted the most detailed renderings of the ballroom published to date. It shows a massive new building that dwarfs the size of the demolished East Wing and matches the height of the historic White House mansion.
The project is scheduled for discussion during a March 5 meeting of the National Capital Planning Commission.

Prince William wanted Andrew banished from royals ‘before rot set in’, new book claims
Charles was said to be furious over William trying to rid Andrew from the Royal family

Prince William demanded that Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor be forced out of the royal family “before the rot set in”, following his disastrous Newsnight interview in 2019, a new biography has claimed.
After further details of Andrew’s relationship with convicted paedophile Jeffrey Epstein, the Prince of Wales was said to have viewed the then-prince as a serious threat to the royal family’s survival.
The revelations are in an upcoming book about the Prince and Princess of Wales, written by the Mirror’s royal editor, Russell Myers.
A palace source in the book said: “The Prince of Wales was adamant the whole episode would never go away and, despite how others may have felt, there was absolutely no upside in Andrew being protected.”
William had urged action from Charles and Queen Elizabeth, who were in favour of protecting him, which provoked a furious reaction from his father, who “put him in his place”, the book claims.
The new biography alleges Charles was “engaged in a full-scale fire fight”, and William feared the Epstein scandal would pose a threat to the royal family’s survival.
A palace source in the book, said: “His view was crystal clear, Andrew shouldn’t be anywhere near the family under any circumstances, not by association, not at family functions, anywhere.
“Every single time there was a new revelation, which no one knew when it was coming or what the next one would be, it was a stain on all of the family.”
In a now infamous interview with BBC Newsnight in 2019, Andrew was asked about sexual abuse allegations made by the late Virginia Giuffre. Andrew has always denied any wrongdoing.
He claimed he had “no recollection” of ever meeting Ms Giuffre and said it was not possible he could have had sex with her in March 2001, as he was at a Pizza Express in Woking with his daughter.
Andrew also failed to apologise for his relationship with convicted paedophile Jeffrey Epstein.
The Prince and Princess of Wales publicly addressed the Epstein scandal for the first time this week, saying they have been “deeply concerned” over the ongoing revelations surrounding Andrew.
Another source in the book said: “Once you understand the fact that everything that happens in the here and now, affects everything in the future, William’s future, it is very easy to put yourself in his shoes.
“He never much liked his uncle and wanted him out of the picture immediately before the rot further set in. William’s view was that he [Andrew] got himself into the whole mess, so he should be left to his own devices to sort it out away from the family.”
A Buckingham Palace spokesperson said the King had “profound concern at allegations which continue to come to light in respect of Mr Mountbatten-Windsor’s conduct.”
US Congress members have urged the King to “answer what he knew” about his brother’s ties to Epstein and compel him to testify in the US.
Andrew suffered a fall from grace following the release of Epstein files in October, which saw him stripped of all his titles, including the Duke of York.
In the latest tranche of documents released, Andrew is alleged to have shared confidential reports with Epstein that he had access to in his role as a UK trade envoy.
The Independent has contacted Buckingham Palace and Andrew’s representatives.

Kristi Noem abruptly ends press conference when asked about CBP shooting down a party balloon forcing airport closure
Federal officials initially claimed a cartel drone infiltrated U.S. airspace in bizarre incident

Homeland Security Kristi Noem abruptly ended a press conference in Arizona on Friday after being asked about a bizarre incident in which federal officials closed the airspace above El Paso this week after border officials reportedly used a laser to shoot down a party balloon they mistook for a cartel drone.
During the press conference in Phoenix, a journalist asked if the reports were true, and if so, why border officials did not appear to coordinate with the Federal Aviation Administration.
“You know, this was a joint agency task force mission that was undertaken and we’re continuing to work on the communication through that but recognize we’re grateful for the partnership of the Department of War and FAA as we go forward,” said Noem, who then walked away from her microphone.
Following the abrupt airspace closure and reopening, Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said the FAA and Defense Department had “acted swiftly to address a cartel drone incursion.”
“The threat has been neutralized, and there is no danger to commercial travel in the region,” he wrote on X, in a post that is still public.
However, reporting suggests that the incident occurred when officials at U.S. Customs and Border Protection, with military officials present, used a new Defense Department anti-drone energy weapon this week on a flying object that in fact appeared to be a party balloon, The New York Times reported.
The FAA, which hadn’t been briefed on the technology, shut down the El Paso airspace out of safety concerns, according to the paper.
The apparent inter-agency confusion alarmed elected leaders.
"The information coming from the administration does not add up," U.S. Rep. Veronica Escobar, Democrat of Texas, said after the incident in a press conference.
"This should have never happened. You cannot restrict airspace over a major city without coordinating with the city, the airport, the hospitals, the community leadership," El Paso Mayor Renard Johnson told reporters after the closure. "This was a major and unnecessary disruption, one that has not occurred since 9/11."
The closure comes at a sensitive time for both Noem and the U.S. transit system.
Noem’s agency, the Department of Homeland Security, is under heavy scrutiny after agents carrying out the administration’s military-style crackdown on illegal immigration shot and killed two Americans last month during their deployment in the Minneapolis area.
A recent Wall Street Journal exposé, meanwhile, alleges that Noem’s department has been in a state of internal “chaos,” with the secretary chasing made-for-TV moments dressing up in agency-branded flak jackets while carrying on an alleged extramarital affair with a deputy, which they both strongly deny.
There have been multiple high-profile incidents in U.S. airspace under the Trump administration, including a crash last January near Reagan airport in Washington, D.C., between a civilian airliner and a military helicopter, which killed 67 people.

IDF's new mechanical AI robot takes two hours to clean tanks, which soldiers needed 48 hours for

The IDF unveiled a new robotic system that enables its tank mechanics to perform 48 hours of maintenance, including fault location and equipment cleaning, in just two hours.
Developed by the Israeli company Ruby AI, the new IDF robot looks like something out of an animated movie. With multiple robotic arms, kind of like a mechanical octopus, it can penetrate the tank's engine, clean and wash, scan, and perform operations that previously required a human hand.
The robot operates autonomously, without soldiers present in dangerous environments and without exposure to chemicals, oils, or extreme heat.
Daniel Ben Dov, CEO of Ruby AI, founded the company in the Bar Lev High-Tech Park in Northern Israel. He had previously worked n the space and defense industries, including management positions at Gilat Satellites and Elbit.
The company currently employs about 20 people, most of them engineers in software, hardware, aerospace, and physical artificial intelligence.
“We are developing both the robotic arms themselves and their brains,” explained Ben Dov. “We have developed a Physical AI core that can learn elements of the physical world, understand what it sees, and perform precise actions. This is not a sterile factory robot, but one that can work in mud, dust, heat, and cold.”
The system was developed during the war to take soldiers out of dangerous maintenance chores, and Ben Dov explained that it is now fully operational.
More than just cleaning robots
Founded in 2020, Ruby AI has been working with clients worldwide, with one of its most prominent products being the United Arab Emirates' refueling robots.
This is the only robot in the world that performs a full refueling without human contact, in an explosive environment, and with strict safety standards.
"If a robot knows how to refuel, it also knows how to deal with hazardous materials," says Ben Dov. "This opens the door to a whole world of military maintenance."
Among the developments in the pipeline are robots that will assist in replacing heavy wheels on tanks and bulldozers, a task that currently requires enormous physical effort and poses an injury risk. The robots are capable of holding weights over 100 kilos, performing the operation with the required precision, and working alongside a soldier, taking the most dangerous chores instead of humans.
“We are not developing cute robots that fold laundry,” Ben Dov emphasizes. “We focus on difficult, repetitive physical work in places where a person is not supposed to be.”
From terror tunnels to field hospitals
One of the company's main objectives is to develop a robot capable of performing a task that is extremely dangerous for a soldier: clearing underground tunnels.
Being close to dangerous areas makes tunnels an ideal environment for mission robots. "A humanoid robot eighty meters tall won't go in there," says Ben Dov. "It can't crawl, it can't work in mud and water. We design the robot according to the mission, not according to how it looks."
The world of military medicine is also on the horizon, with the development of five-fingered bionic arms that could, in the future, perform precise therapeutic operations, from physiotherapy to working in dangerous environments such as areas affected by chemical or biological warfare agents, where you don't want to send a person.
The IDF is examining the developments cautiously, but it’s clear that the direction has been set. The robots are not coming to fight in the place of soldiers, but to relieve them of burdens, risks, and drudgery.

US President Donald Trump on Friday embraced the idea of regime change in Iran, telling reporters it "seems like that would be the best thing that could happen," as Washington plans new talks with Tehran while also upping its military presence in the region.
A US delegation, including envoy Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner, is set to meet with the Iranians on Tuesday morning in Geneva, according to a source briefed on the matter.
When asked what Iran should do to avoid attack, Trump said that Iran would need to "give us the right deal," but that, despite Iran being willing to talk, historically, they haven't agreed to give the right deals.
"For 47 years they've been talking and talking, and in the meantime we've lost a lot of lives," Trump said.
Setting course for the Persian Gulf
On Thursday, the USS Gerald R. Ford, the largest aircraft carrier in the world, was reported to receive instructions to set course for the Persian Gulf in order to bolster forces in the Middle East. Currently, the aircraft carrier USS Lincoln is in the region alongside several other vessels.
When asked for comment on sending a second aircraft carrier on Friday responded that "in case we don't make a deal, we'll need it."
The president added that if a deal was made, the trip could be cut short, and that the aircraft carrier would be leaving "very soon."
Trump said he had a deadline for Iran, but did not specify further.

ICE wants to spend more than $38 billion to convert warehouses into massive detention centers

ICE wants to spend more than $38 billion to convert warehouses into massive detention centers
Officials and residents in red and blue districts across the country urge DHS to block plans to detain up to 10,000 people at a time in formerly industrial buildings
- Bookmark

Donald Trump’s administration intends to spend nearly $40 billion on a plan to detain tens of thousands of immigrants in retrofitted warehouses across the country, expanding the president’s mass deportation efforts into cities and towns that are increasingly urging officials to keep them out of their backyards.
Documents published by officials in New Hampshire offer the clearest and most comprehensive picture yet of Immigration and Customs Enforcement’s nationwide plans to scale up the president’s campaign to quickly arrest, detain and deport people from the United States, which is already detaining more than 60,000 immigrants at any given time.
ICE expects to spend more than $38 billion buying up 16 buildings it can convert into “processing” centers to temporarily detain up to 1,500 immigrants in each before they’re moved to larger facilities.
Another eight larger warehouses would hold up to 10,000 people at a time, serving as “primary locations” for removal from the country, according to the documents.
Those facilities add to an already-expansive immigration detention system of more than 200 jails, mostly operated by private firms, in a country with one of the highest incarceration rates on the planet.
The plans are meeting fierce resistance, including in states and counties that supported Trump — and from Republican officials.
Last week, Mississippi Senator Roger Wicker (R) said he spoke with Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem about a proposed facility in Marshall County. “I relayed to her the opposition of local elected and zoning officials as well as economic development concerns. I appreciate her for agreeing to look elsewhere,” he said.
Democratic Senator Maggie Hassan of New Hampshire, whose state published documents about the warehouse expansion, grilled ICE’s acting director Todd Lyons on whether he would similarly cancel a project in her state.
“No, ma’am,” he said during his testimony to the Senate Homeland Security committee Thursday.
“The people of Merrimack, their leadership, do not want this ICE facility in their community. I have yet to find a Granite State community that does,” she said. “I would hope I get the same treatment that Senator Wicker got, which is that the town doesn’t want the detention center, so please cancel it.”
New Hampshire’s Republican Governor Kelly Ayotte said Homeland Security shared the documents with her office for the first time that same day, appearing to contradict Lyons’s testimony that he spoke with the governor and provided her with an “economic impact summary” about the project.
ICE plans to spend $158 million retrofitting a warehouse in Merrimack.
Similar plans are underway across the country. ICE has already spent nearly $700 million acquiring warehouses in Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Pennsylvania and Texas, according to public records and local reports.
This week, ICE announced the purchase of a former warehouse in Chester, New York, which it plans to convert into a detention center, despite widespread, bipartisan opposition to the project from state and local officials
That facility, roughly 60 miles outside of New York City could hold up to 1,500 people.
“I think every American should be alarmed,” New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez said this week. “They are building and have built a black box system that disappears people, both immigrants and U.S. citizens alike.”
ICE’s decision to move forward with the project “despite clear local opposition underscore the urgent need for New York to be a bulwark against the Trump administration’s mass deportation agenda,” according to Murad Awawdeh, president of the New York Immigration Coalition.
That kind of opposition is working in other states, even in deep-red districts.
But ICE, flush with cash after a massive injection of taxpayer funds through Trump’s One Big Beautiful Act domestic spending bill last year, intends to “fully implement a new detention model by the end of Fiscal Year 2026,” according to the documents.
Last month, Homeland Security told officials in largely Republican-leaning Hanover County, Virginia, that ICE intends to build a facility on a former cattle farm that houses a 500,000-square-foot warehouse constructed by a company owned by Canadian billionaire Jim Pattison.
Pattison’s company reportedly intended to sell that warehouse to ICE, but after a threat of boycotts, in addition to business and union pressure and outrage from nearby residents, the county’s board of supervisors announced plans to oppose the sale and called on federal, state and local leaders to do the same.
Shortly after the board’s vote, Pattison’s company issued a one-line statement: “The transaction to sell our industrial building in Ashland, Virginia will not be proceeding.”
In Utah, local opposition forced a real estate group that owns a warehouse with plans for ICE conversion to issue a brief statement saying it has “no plans” to lease the property to any federal agency.
In Oklahoma, officials passed a resolution to block any ICE facility there. And in Maryland, Howard County Executive Calvin Ball revoked the building permit for one.
Similar resistance is underway across the country, though with mixed results; ICE spent nearly $130 million on a more than 1 million square foot warehouse roughly 50 miles outside of Atlanta, one of two new additions to Georgia’s already-sprawling immigration detention center network.
Officials there already appear to be regretting it.
“This is not something, hands down, that the city can support,” Social Circle City Manager Eric Taylor told Georgia Public Radio. More than 72 percent of residents in Walton County voted for Trump in 2024.
“The frustration here is that they’re looking at a building that was not built for human habitation,” he said. “There's nothing more than a shell of a building.”

Trump threatens to bypass Congress and order new voting laws ahead of midterms

US President Donald Trump, on Friday, February 13, threatened to try to bypass Congress and force new voting laws ahead of the November midterm elections, where his Republican Party fears losing control of the legislature. Trump said he would soon issue an executive order attempting to impose the rules if Congress does not pass a law requiring photo identification to vote and other nationwide reforms.
Any attempt would likely be met by a legal challenge that could ultimately be decided by the Supreme Court. "There will be Voter ID for the Midterm Elections, whether approved by Congress or not!" Trump wrote on his Truth Social platform. "If we can't get it through Congress, there are Legal reasons why this SCAM is not permitted. I will be presenting them shortly, in the form of an Executive Order," he wrote.
While many jurisdictions across the United States require photo ID to cast ballots, not all do, with Trump and many Republicans arguing without evidence that those areas have permitted significant voter fraud.
Expected to fail in the Senate
The Trump-backed "SAVE America" election reform act passed in the Republican-controlled House of Representatives this week. However, it is expected to fail in the Senate, where the Republican majority is too slim to pass the law without Democratic support.
In addition to requiring a photo ID to cast a ballot, the bill would also require proof of citizenship to register to vote. There is no evidence of meaningful fraud in US elections and critics say that the bill's measures would instead push millions of people away from casting ballots, because they don't have a passport or a paper copy of their birth certificate.
An analysis by the Brennan Center found more than 21 million Americans lack easy access to such documents.
This would "disenfranchise Americans of all ages," the center found – especially young people and ethnic minorities. Trump's push for federal election reforms has also run up against constitutional concerns. Under the US Constitution, states retain broad control over the administration of elections.
Debunked claim of mass fraud
It was unclear how Trump could legally force a national mandate on voter ID. However, the 79-year-old Republican has repeatedly overturned norms in the White House.
In his post on Friday, he repeated his widely debunked claim that more election security is needed because of mass fraud. For years, Trump has propagated the falsehood to justify his unprecedented – and ultimately unsuccessful – attempt to overturn his 2020 election loss to Democrat Joe Biden.
Polls show that Trump's Republican Party faces a serious threat of losing its narrow control of Congress in the Midterms, particularly the lower chamber. If Democrats win, they have signaled they will block Trump's agenda and could move to impeach him.

US used Anthropic’s AI model Claude during the Venezuela raid, WSJ reports

WASHINGTON – Anthropic’s artificial-intelligence model Claude was used in the US military’s operation to capture former Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro, the Wall Street Journal reported on Feb 13, citing people familiar with the matter.
Claude’s deployment came via Anthropic’s partnership with data firm Palantir Technologies, whose platforms are widely used by the Defense Department and federal law enforcement, the report added.
Reuters could not immediately verify the report. The US Defense Department, the White House, Anthropic and Palantir did not immediately respond to Reuters’ requests for comment.
The Pentagon is pushing top AI companies, including OpenAI and Anthropic, to make their artificial-intelligence tools available on classified networks without many of the standard restrictions that the firms apply to users, Reuters exclusively reported on Feb 11.
Many AI companies are building custom tools for the US military, most of which are available only on unclassified networks typically used for military administration. Anthropic is the only one that is available in classified settings through third parties, but the government is still bound by the company’s usage policies.
The usage policies of Anthropic, which raised US$30 billion (S$37.9 billion) in its latest funding round and is now valued at US$380 billion, forbid using Claude to support violence, design weapons or carry out surveillance.

Trump says change of power in Iran would be ‘best thing’, as he sends second carrier
The US president’s comments are his most overt reference yet to regime change, as he pushes Tehran to make a nuclear deal
US President Donald Trump said on Friday that a change of government in Iran would be the “best thing that could happen”, as he sent a second aircraft carrier to the Middle East to ratchet up military pressure on the Islamic republic.
Trump’s comments were his most overt call yet for the toppling of Iran’s clerical establishment, and came as he pushes on Washington’s arch-foe Tehran to make a deal to limit its nuclear programme.
At the same time, the exiled son of the Iranian shah toppled in the 1979 Islamic revolution renewed his calls for international intervention following a bloody crackdown on protests by Tehran.
“Seems like that would be the best thing that could happen,” Trump told reporters at the Fort Bragg military base in North Carolina when a journalist asked if he wanted “regime change” in Iran.
Trump declined to say who he would want to take over in Iran from supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, but he added that “there are people”.
He has previously backed off full-throated calls for a change of government in Iran, warning that it could cause chaos, although he has made threats towards Khamenei in the past.

Former Oxfam head accuses charity of racism, sexism and ‘toxic antisemitic culture’ in legal action
The former head of Oxfam in the UK says she is taking legal action against the charity, accusing it of racism, sexism and antisemitism.
Halima Begum is asked by Channel 4 News about her claims to an employment tribunal of a “toxic antisemitic culture” at the charity.
“We have to show consistency with other crises that that are taking place in the world. and it always felt as though we were disproportionately working around the crisis in Gaza,” Begum says.
“But other examples include quite strong push back when we were not ready yet to use the word genocide. Because to use the word genocide, it has to be something that we arrive at with consultation and evidence and good legal advice. And to try and use that term before we’re ready as an organization feels quite risky to me,” she says.
“Essentially, it was very hard to hold on to neutrality and impartiality, and I say that as a Muslim woman,” she says.
In December, Begum was forced to step down. The BBC reported that Oxfam’s trustees said Begum’s position was “untenable” because of an “irretrievable breakdown in its trust and confidence” in her ability to do the job amid accusations of bullying.
In a statement to Channel 4 News, Oxfam GB says it refutes Begum’s allegations.
Oxfam works in over 70 countries, helping people in developing countries out of poverty and providing emergency aid during humanitarian crises.
Mark Goldring resigned as CEO of Oxfam GB in 2018 following revelations that the charity’s aid workers used sex workers while in Haiti following a 2010 earthquake. The British government halted funding for Oxfam in 2021 after it reported it had suspended staff members in the Democratic Republic of Congo over claims of sexual misconduct and bullying.

Budget impasse shuts down US Department of Homeland Security, but ICE remains operational
The Department of Homeland Security enters a partial shutdown as US lawmakers fight over funding the agency overseeing much of President Donald Trump’s immigration crackdown.
Thousands of government workers, from airport security agents to disaster relief officials, will either be furloughed or forced to work without pay until funding is agreed upon by Congress.
At the center of the budget dispute is the department’s Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), whose agents killed two US citizens amid sweeping raids and mass protests in Minneapolis.
Democrats oppose any new funding for DHS until major changes are implemented over how ICE conducts its operations.
In particular, they have demanded curtailed patrols, a ban on ICE agents wearing face masks during operations and the requirement that they obtain a judicial warrant to enter private property.
“Donald Trump and Republicans have decided that they have zero interest in getting ICE under control,” says House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries.
“Dramatic changes are needed,” Jeffries tells a news conference. “Absent that, Republicans have decided to shut down parts of the federal government.”
White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt puts the blame on the opposition, telling Fox News that “Democrats are barreling our government towards another shutdown for political and partisan reasons.”
But while DHS faces a shutdown, ICE itself will remain operational, under funds approved in last year’s government spending bill.
Doctors Without Borders suspends activities at Gaza hospital due to presence of gunmen, suspected weapons transfers
Doctors Without Borders says that it has suspended non-critical medical activities at Nasser Hospital in Gaza’s Khan Younis due to the presence of armed men at the medical facility and “a recent situation of suspicion of movement of weapons.”
The aid group says that armed men have additionally been arresting patients.
Israel has offered evidence of medical facilities’ regular use by Palestinian terror groups as bases of operations due to their protected status. Hostages have also said they were held at Nasser Hospital.
“In recent months, in Nasser hospital in Khan Younis, patients and MSF personnel have seen armed men, some masked, in different areas of the large compound of the hospital. This had not been in areas where MSF has activities, but in other parts of the hospital compound,” says Doctors Without Borders, also known by its French acronym MSF.
“With an uptick since the ceasefire, MSF teams have reported a pattern of unacceptable acts, including the presence of armed men, intimidation, arbitrary arrests of patients, and a recent situation of suspicion of movement of weapons,” the humanitarian organization says. “These incidents pose serious security threats to our teams and patients.”
Last year a doctor, who also serves as a spokesperson for Nasser Hospital, hinted that he had been threatened by Palestinian Islamic Jihad due to his refusal to let the terror group’s operatives enter and use the hospital.
Israel announced earlier this month that it was terminating all the activities in Gaza and the West Bank of the organization after it failed to provide a list of its Palestinian staff. MSF slammed the move, which takes effect on March 1, as a “pretext” to obstruct aid. Israel has accused MSF of having at least two employees who held membership in the Palestinian Islamic Jihad and Hamas terror groups.
MSF has been a key provider of medical and humanitarian aid in Gaza, particularly since the October 7, 2023, Hamas-led invasion and massacre in southern Israel triggered a two-year war in the enclave.

Ex-hostage reveals she tried to kill herself in Gaza, says seeing footage of protests saved her
Former hostage Arbel Yehoud reveals that she attempted to end her life several times while held captive by Palestinian terrorists in Gaza, but decided not to after seeing a poster with her picture when shown images of a protest in Israel.
“One of the times, not long before my release, I saw drone footage from Hostages Square [in Tel Aviv]. I saw people holding signs of people I don’t know, and then suddenly I saw signs of people I know. I saw a sign for Ariel [Cunio] and a sign for me, signs of people from the kibbutz,” Yehoud tells Channel 12 news in an interview aired Friday evening.
“From the moment I saw that, I didn’t try to put an end to my own life there,” she continues. “That was the last time I tried. When I saw the drone footage and understood that people who I don’t know are fighting for me as if I am their sister or daughter, I have the duty to return to Ariel and my family, but also to those fighting for me.”
Cunio and Yehoud, self-described “high school sweethearts,” were kidnapped together from their home at Kibbutz Nir Oz on October 7, 2023, and then held separately in the Gaza Strip. Yehoud was released from captivity during a truce in January 2025, while Cunio was returned to Gaza as part of the Israel-Hamas ceasefire deal reached in October.
“I told her, ‘the most important thing is that we stay together. As long as they don’t separate us, we’ll be okay.’ Half-an-hour later, that is what happened,” Cunio says when recalling their abduction. “It happened so fast, there wasn’t even time to say ‘I love you, be strong.'”
“I didn’t manage to tell him bye, I didn’t get to see his eyes,” Yehoud adds.
Cunio says that after pressing his captors for information on Yehoud, they told him to write a letter, which they ended up passing along to her, leading to a period of few months in which they were able to correspond.
“It was a lot of writing about the love between us, what was going on with us each day, our conditions, trying to get some sort of picture of what is going on outside,” he says in the interview. “She wrote to me in the last letter that she heard there was a massacre at Nir Oz and that we need to stay strong about what we will discover when we get out, because you don’t know anything. You don’t know if your family is living, who is dead, who was kidnapped.”
In the interview, Yehoud says she had tried to push away her experiences in captivity, though that changed when former hostage Romi Gonen revealed in a recent interview that she was repeatedly sexually assaulted by terrorists before being transferred underground with other captives.
“I really identified with what she said, in terms of the gap she feels when she met with the other girls in the tunnel,” Yehoud tells Channel 12. “But even after I saw the horrors that Romi needed to endure, the gap remains. Because it was a very long time, and the things I went through, I went through from beginning to end, so they are in a sealed box.”
Witkoff, Kushner to hold separate talks on Iran and Ukraine-Russia in Geneva next week
PALM BEACH, Florida — Two sets of diplomatic negotiations, on Ukraine and Iran, are set to take place in Geneva on Tuesday, a source briefed on the matter tells Reuters.
A US delegation including envoys Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner will meet with the Iranians on Tuesday morning, the source says. Witkoff and Kushner will then participate in trilateral talks with representatives from Russia and Ukraine in the afternoon, the source adds.
US readying for potential weeks-long military campaign against Iran, sources tell Reuters
The US military is preparing for the possibility of sustained, weeks-long operations against Iran if President Donald Trump orders an attack, two US officials tells Reuters, in what could become a far more serious conflict than previously seen between the countries.
The disclosure by the officials, who speak on condition of anonymity due to the sensitive nature of the planning, raises the stakes for the diplomacy underway between the United States and Iran.
Asked for comment on the preparations for a potentially sustained US military operation, White House spokesperson Anna Kelly says: “President Trump has all options on the table with regard to Iran.”
“He listens to a variety of perspectives on any given issue, but makes the final decision based on what is best for our country and national security,” Kelly says.
The Pentagon declines to comment.
The United States sent two aircraft carriers to the region last year, when it carried out strikes against Iranian nuclear sites.
However, June’s “Midnight Hammer” operation was essentially a one-off US attack, with stealth bombers flying from the United States to strike Iranian nuclear facilities. Iran staged a very limited retaliatory strike on a US base in Qatar.
The planning underway this time is more complex, the officials say.
In a sustained campaign, the US military could hit Iranian state and security facilities, not just nuclear infrastructure, one of the officials says. The official declines to provide specific detail.
Experts say the risks to US forces would be far greater in such an operation against Iran, which boasts a formidable arsenal of missiles. Retaliatory Iranian strikes also increase the risk of a regional conflict.
The same official says the United States fully expects Iran to retaliate, leading to back-and-forth strikes and reprisals over a period of time.
The White House and Pentagon don’t respond to questions about the risks of retaliation or regional conflict.
Jury deadlocks in trial of anti-Israel Stanford students who occupied university president’s office
A jury has deadlocked in the trial of five current and former Stanford University students charged after anti Israel, pro-Palestinian protests in 2024.
The students faced felony charges for vandalism and conspiracy to trespass after they barricaded themselves inside the university president and provost executive offices.
Santa Clara County prosecutors said demonstrators broke furniture and splattered a red liquid described as fake blood on items throughout the offices.
Defense lawyers said the protest was protected speech and there was no intent to damage property.
The trial in California’s Silicon Valley is a rare instance of demonstrators facing felony charges from the wave of campus protests that year.

Stephen A Smith makes strong hint at 2028 presidential run
ESPN star has been hinting at a possible presidential run for at least a year
- Bookmark
- CommentsGo to comments
ESPN broadcaster Stephen A. Smith is once again dangling a potential presidential run after saying last year he had abandoned the notion.
Smith sat for an interview with CBS News Sunday Morning's Robert Costa, which will air in full on February 15. Costa teased a snippet of the interview in a social media post, revealing that Smith said he was giving "strong consideration" to a 2028 run.
“I will confess to you, I’m giving strong consideration to being on that debate stage for 2027,” Smith reportedly said. “I’ve got this year coming up, 2026, to think about it, to study, to know the issues.”
It's not the first time Smith has suggested he wants the Oval Office, and he has even appeared in some 2028 candidate polls, according to Mediaite.
When asked who his preferred 2028 Democratic candidates are, Smith has previously named both Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro — who was considered a likely candidate for former Vice President Kamala Harris's running mate in 2024 — and Maryland Governor Wes Moore.
However, he has also said he is so disillusioned by the Democratic party that he believes he has no choice but to run himself.
“I’ve been approached by people on Capitol Hill. I’ve been approached by people who are elected officials in office, whether it’s governors or mayors or what have you. People have legitimately, seriously, asked me about it. I have no desire to be a politician, but I’ve decided that I’m no longer going to close that door,” Smith said last April.
A month before that, Smith told USA TODAY that he didn't "give a damn about the office" and said he preferred trading jabs with other sports personalities.
But he also made comments on The View that same month saying he could "beat them all," referring to likely Democratic primary opponents.
Then in June, he ruled out a run entirely during an appearance on The Daily Show with Jon Stewart.
During the episode, Smith said he would prefer to be a "hell raiser" and was not looking to run for president in 2028.
“The way I look at it, the money that I have earned working my ass off all of these years now, I would have to curry favor, which means I would be owned. And I ain’t having that, so I’m not interested in that at all,” he told Stewart.
It's unclear if he still feels as though he'd be "owned" if he does run.
In July 2025, Smith told ABC News that the Democratic Party looked "leaderless."
"I'm certainly not here to cast dispersions upon individuals, but as a body, the Democratic Party just looks very, very bad right now because they look leaderless," Smith said at the time. "They don't have a definitive voice that anybody can depend on."
It's unclear who Smith's primary base of supporters would be, but what's clear is that he has at least one fan who says he'd "love" to see the broadcaster make a run at the Oval Office: President Donald Trump.
"I love watching him. He’s got great entertainment skills, which is very important. People watch him," Trump told NewsNation during a town hall last year. "I've been pretty good at picking people and picking candidates, and I will tell you, I’d love to see him run."

Trump threatens to impose photo ID for voters for midterm elections

Donald Trump threatened on Friday to impose a requirement that US voters present photo identification before being allowed to cast ballots in the upcoming midterm elections.
Trump insisted he will push for the change even if Congress fails to pass the Save America act, which cleared the House earlier this week but faces an uphill battle in the Senate. The bill would impose a national photo identification requirement to vote, in addition to requiring proof of citizenship to register and drastically limiting mail-in voting.
“There will be Voter I.D. for the Midterm Elections, whether approved by Congress or not!” Trump posted while onboard Air Force One on Friday afternoon after speaking to troops at Fort Bragg.
“Also, the People of our Country are insisting on Citizenship, and No Mail-In Ballots, with exceptions for Military, Disability, Illness, or Travel,” the president added, falsely, since there is no popular majority for banning vote by mail.
In fact, polling conducted last year showed the exact opposite: 58% of Americans favor allowing any voter to cast their ballot by mail if they want to.
Trump’s efforts to impose voter ID requirements are likely to face immediate legal challenges, as the US constitution leaves the conduct of elections to the states.
The president, however, claimed to have “searched the depths of Legal Arguments not yet articulated or vetted on this subject, and will be presenting an irrefutable one” that would allow the federal government to take unprecedented control of elections run by the states. But in a second post during his flight to his Palm Beach resort, he offered more hyperbole than facts, in a long diatribe punctuated with all-caps words.
“We cannot let the Democrats get away with NO VOTER I.D. any longer. These are horrible, disingenuous CHEATERS,” Trump wrote.
“If we can’t get it through Congress, there are Legal reasons why this SCAM is not permitted. I will be presenting them shortly, in the form of an Executive Order,” Trump added.
“I hope the Supreme Court realizes, as they ‘painstakingly’ review the very simple topic of Country Saving Tariffs … that these Corrupt and Deranged Democrats, if they ever gain power, will not only be adding two States to our roster of 50, with all of the baggage thereto, but will also PACK THE COURT,” the president posted.
Trump has long alleged systemic voter fraud contributed to his 2020 presidential election loss, despite no evidence to back up that claim.
Trump signed an executive order last year requiring proof of citizenship to register to vote and blocking states from accepting mail-in ballots received after election day, even if they were postmarked before then. A federal judge blocked the citizenship requirement in October, saying the president “lacks the authority to direct such changes”.

Britain’s ‘Brexit years’ are over, Starmer says
- Sir Keir Starmer will declare Britain's "Brexit years" over at the Munich Security Conference, advocating for closer European security ties and reduced dependence on the United States.
- The prime minister will describe Europe as a "sleeping giant" with significant economic and military power, urging the continent to leverage its defence capabilities through greater cooperation, including with the UK.
- His remarks come amidst transatlantic tensions, following a US president's threats regarding Greenland and criticism of European NATO allies, with a Munich Security Report warning of "wrecking-ball politics" and the destruction of the post-1945 international order.
- Sir Keir will also criticise Reform UK and the Green Party, accusing them of offering "easy answers" that are "soft on Russia and weak on Nato", potentially leading to division and capitulation in Europe.
- On Friday, Sir Keir held trilateral talks with Germany's Friedrich Merz and France's Emmanuel Macron, emphasising the interconnectedness of UK and European security.

Judge dismisses charges against 3 Connecticut officers accused of mistreating paralyzed prisoner
A Connecticut judge has dismissed criminal charges against three New Haven police officers accused of mistreating a prisoner who was paralyzed in the back of a police van
- Bookmark
A Connecticut judge on Friday dismissed criminal charges against three current and former New Haven police officers who were accused of mistreating prisoner Richard “Randy” Cox after he was paralyzed in the back of a police van in 2022.
Judge David Zagaja dropped the cases against Oscar Diaz, Jocelyn Lavandier and Luis Rivera after granting them a probation program that allows charges to be erased from defendants' records, saying their conduct was not malicious. Two other officers, Betsy Segui and Ronald Pressley, pleaded guilty last year to misdemeanor reckless endangerment and received no jail time.
Cox, 40, was left paralyzed from the chest down on June 19, 2022, when the police van, which had no seat belts, braked hard to avoid an accident, sending him head-first into a metal partition while his hands were cuffed behind his back. He had been arrested on charges of threatening a woman with a gun, which were later dismissed.
“I can’t move. I’m going to die like this. Please, please, please help me,” Cox said in the van minutes after being injured, according to police video. He later was found to have broken his neck.
Diaz, who was driving the van, brought Cox to the police department, where officers mocked Cox and accused him of being drunk and faking his injuries, according to surveillance and body-worn camera footage. Officers dragged Cox out of the van and around the police station before placing him in a holding cell before paramedics brought him to a hospital.
Before pulling him out of the van, Lavandier told Cox to move his leg and sit up, according to an internal affairs investigation report. Cox says “I can’t move” and Lavandier says “You’re not even trying.”
New Haven State's Attorney John P. Doyle Jr.'s office said prosecutors and Cox did not object to the charges being dismissed.
Defense lawyers said that while the officers were sympathetic to what happened to Cox, they did not cause his injuries or make them worse. The three officers whose cases were dismissed were scheduled to go on trial next month.
“We don’t think that there was sufficient evidence to prove her guilt or any wrongdoing,” said Lavandier's attorney, Dan Ford. "This is a negotiated settlement that avoids the risk of having go through the emotional toll of a trial.”
Rivera's lawyer, Raymond Hassett, called the decision to charge the officers “unjust and misplaced.”
“The actions of the Police Chief and City Mayor in targeting the officers were a misguided effort to deflect attention from the police department shortcomings in managing the department and ensuring proper protocols were in place and followed,” Hassett said in a statement.
Attorneys for Cox and Diaz did not immediately return phone and email messages Friday. Cox's lawyer, Louis Rubano, has said Cox and his family hoped the criminal cases would end quickly with plea bargains.
New Haven Mayor Justin Elicker said city officials disagreed with the judge's decision to dismiss the charges.
“What happened to Randy was tragic and awful,” he said in a statement.
The case drew outrage from civil rights advocates including the NAACP, along with comparisons to the Freddie Gray case in Baltimore. Cox is Black, while all five officers who were arrested are Black or Hispanic. Gray, who also was Black, died in 2015 after he suffered a spinal injury while handcuffed and shackled in a Baltimore police van.
The case also led to reforms at the New Haven police department as well as a statewide seat belt requirement for prisoners.
In 2023, the city of New Haven agreed to settle a lawsuit by Cox for $45 million.
New Haven police fired Segui, Diaz, Lavandier and Rivera for violating police conduct policies, while Pressley retired and avoided an internal investigation. Diaz appealed his firing and got his job back. Segui lost the appeal of her firing, while appeals by Lavandier and Rivera remain pending.

Trump: Regime change in Iran ‘would be the best thing that could happen’
US president confirms sending second aircraft carrier to Middle East in case ‘difficult’ Islamic Republic doesn’t make a deal, says ‘fear’ is only thing that will get Tehran to sign agreement
Asked Friday about potential regime change in Iran, US President Donald Trump said, “it seems like that would be the best thing that could happen,” as he confirmed sending a second aircraft carrier to the Middle East “in case we don’t make a deal” with the Islamic Republic.
“For 47 years, they’ve been talking and talking and talking,” Trump told reporters after visiting with troops at Fort Bragg, North Carolina, referring to Iran’s clerical rulers. “In the meantime, we’ve lost a lot of lives while they talk. Legs blown off, arms blown off, faces blown off. We’ve been going on for a long time.”
Pressed on who he would like to take over Iran, Trump declined to answer, but he added that “there are people.”
His comments appeared to contradict those made by US Vice President JD Vance, who indicated earlier this week that the administration was not pursuing regime change in Iran.
“If the Iranian people want to overthrow the regime, that’s up to the Iranian people,” Vance said, appearing to suggest that this was not the administration’s goal. What we’re focused on right now is the fact that Iran can’t have a nuclear weapon.”
The US had recently appeared to be open to the idea of regime change in Iran, with Trump calling on protesters to “take over” government institutions amid the mass protests there, and reportedly asking aides for a strike plan that could help spur the toppling of the government.
But then Washington entered negotiations with Iran, a second round of which will be held in Geneva next week, a source briefed on the matter told Reuters. Trump has repeatedly threatened Tehran with an attack if it doesn’t agree to a deal that sees the Islamic Republic give up its capabilities to produce a nuclear weapon, roll back its ballistic missile program, and cease its support for armed proxies in the region.
According to the source, a US delegation including envoys Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner will meet with the Iranians on Tuesday morning, with representatives from Oman — which hosted the first round of talks — on hand to mediate the US-Iran contacts.
Witkoff and Kushner will then participate in separate trilateral talks with representatives from Russia and Ukraine in the afternoon, the source said.
‘Sometimes you have to have fear’
Before heading to Fort Bragg, Trump hit out Iran for being “difficult” in the nuclear talks.
“If we don’t have a deal, we’ll need it; if we have a deal, we could cut it short — it’ll be leaving very soon,” said Trump of the USS Gerald R. Ford, the world’s largest aircraft carrier.
The Ford’s deployment was first reported by the New York Times on Thursday.
The aircraft carrier is currently en route from the Caribbean to join the USS Abraham Lincoln, which deployed in the Arabian Sea in January amid Trump’s threats to strike Iran if it did not stop its crackdown on anti-regime protests, where regime forces killed thousands of people.
Referring to the Lincoln, Trump told reporters outside the White House that “if we need it, we have it ready, a very big force.”
Later, speaking to troops at Fort Bragg, Trump said only fear would get Iran to sign a deal.
“We have a situation right now where we have sent a very big carrier group to Iran,” he said. “I would love to see if we could make a deal. They’ve been difficult to make a deal with.”
“I thought we would have had a deal last time. They wish they did,” said Trump, citing the US strike on Iran’s key nuclear sites on June 22, during the 12-day Israel-Iran war, which put an end to a previous round of US-Iran nuclear talks.
“Sometimes you have to have fear. That’s the only thing that really will get the situation taken care of,” he added.

Iran, whose leaders are sworn to destroy Israel, denies seeking to acquire nuclear weapons, but has enriched uranium to levels that have no peaceful application, obstructed international inspectors from checking its nuclear facilities, and expanded its ballistic missile capabilities.
Rafael Grossi, head of the UN nuclear watchdog, Rafael Grossi, told the Munich Security Conference on Friday that reaching an accord with Iran on inspections of its processing facilities is possible but “terribly difficult.” He added that the agency’s inspectors had returned to Iran following the war, but have not been able to visit any of the sites that were targeted.
Oman facilitated the indirect US-Iran talks in its capital Muscat last week. A spokesperson for Iran’s foreign ministry said the talks let Tehran gauge Washington’s seriousness, and showed enough consensus for diplomacy to continue. The date and venue of the next round of US-Iran talks have yet to be announced.
The Islamic Republic has refused US demands to expand the scope of the negotiations to include the Islamic Republic’s ballistic missile program and support for regional proxy forces. Trump has repeatedly threatened to attack Iran if it doesn’t agree to a deal that encompasses all three issues.
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, returning from a meeting with Trump at the White House, on Thursday said any agreement with Iran must cover “not only the nuclear issue, but also ballistic missiles and Iran’s regional proxies.”
The premier expressed “general skepticism about the possibility of reaching any agreement with Iran,” but said Trump believes the Iranians could be forced into “a good deal.”
Commenting on the meeting with Netanyahu, Trump told reporters on Thursday: “We have to make a deal, otherwise it’s going to be very traumatic, very traumatic.”

Seoul intelligence reports about 6,000 North Korean troops killed or wounded in war against Ukraine
According to Ukrinform, Yonhap stated this in an article, citing data from South Korea's National Intelligence Service (NIS).
According to the intelligence agency, about 10,000 North Korean combat troops and 1,000 engineering soldiers are currently deployed in Russia's Kursk region to support Moscow's war against Ukraine.
The NIS estimates that approximately 6,000 North Korean soldiers have been killed or wounded in the war.
The intelligence service added that about 1,100 troops and engineers who returned to North Korea last December could be sent back to the war.
"Despite suffering 6,000 casualties, the North Korean military has achieved the results of acquiring modern combat tactics and data in the battlefield, as well as upgrading its weapons systems with technical assistance from Russia," the NIS stated.
The intelligence agency also noted that Pyongyang has created a new unmanned aerial vehicle department and is accelerating efforts to build a system capable of developing and mass-producing drones.
As Ukrinform previously reported, South Korea's Minister of Unification, Chung Dong-yong, during talks in Seoul with Dutch Foreign Minister David van Weel, stated that there is a link between negotiations to end the Russia–Ukraine war and the situation on the Korean Peninsula.

A Russian blogger documented horrific conditions at a local morgue — and police promptly beat him up and threw him in jail

A Russian blogger documented horrific conditions at a local morgue — and police promptly beat him up and threw him in jail
A blogger in Siberia faces criminal charges after posting a video documenting unsanitary conditions at a morgue, according to a lawyer familiar with the case. Artem Pavlechko, who lives in the city of Tulun in the Irkutsk region, has been charged with violating privacy laws, according to his lawyer, Anna Anufrieva. State investigators confirmed that a 34-year-old man is suspected of illegally sharing private details about a doctor, including his home address, in a video posted in January to VKontakte, Russia’s largest social network.
The footage that led to the charges shows graphic conditions inside the morgue. Anufrieva said that on January 14, Pavlechko published a 16-minute video recorded inside Tulun’s forensic medical department with the caption: “Horrible unsanitary conditions at Tulun morgue, or making money off people’s grief.”
Dressed in camouflage, Pavlechko confronts morgue staff, including a medical worker who discards a cigarette butt in a sink beside an autopsy table. “People are complaining that things here aren’t done in a Christian way,” he says in the video. “It’s a mess, it’s filthy, it’s a dump. You’re spraying bodies down with a hose; dead bodies are just piled on top of each other. People bury these folks later, kiss them goodbye. Is everybody in Tulun going to end up like this someday? Right? Tossed here with your cigarette butts?”
You’re currently reading Meduza, the world’s largest independent Russian news outlet. Every day, we bring you essential coverage from Russia and beyond. Explore our reporting here and follow us wherever you get your news.
The video shows bodies on dirty cots, with clothing and belongings scattered or piled on the floor beside them, and filthy instruments lying near the autopsy tables.
Pavlechko then visits a church, a funeral services company, and the residence of Sergey Dolenchuk, whom he identifies as the morgue’s director. Throughout the video, Pavlechko is accompanied by an unnamed man, possibly the former morgue worker who had also lobbied human rights activists to “bring national attention to this story.”
The footage ends with police being called to the morgue after the blogger’s visit. He and his companion then go to the prosecutor’s office to file a complaint. Shortly after the video was published, the prosecutor’s office reported that it had initiated an inspection of the Tulun morgue facilities following a complaint from a local resident, whose name was not disclosed. No results of the inspection have been announced.
The morgue director countered by filing a police complaint against the blogger, alleging invasion of privacy, according to Baza, a Telegram channel with law enforcement ties. The director accused Pavlechko of “barging onto private property,” Baza said.
Police arrested the blogger on the morning of February 11. Human rights activist Anna Tazheeva told the media outlet Ostorozhno Media, run by socialite Ksenia Sobchak, that special forces officers raided Pavlechko’s home and assaulted him. Lawyer Anna Anufrieva published a photo showing Pavlechko being escorted by several officers. The image shows a large bruise on his face.
Law enforcement held Pavlechko for two days and released him only on the evening of February 13, Sobchak reported. After his release, Pavlechko confirmed that officers beat him while he was in custody and forced him to record an apology to the morgue staff and the person who filed the complaint against him — likely the morgue’s director.
Irkutsk police later released footage of the arrest. The video does not name Pavlechko, identifying him merely as a 34-year-old “offender who calls himself a blogger” and partially blurring his face. However, Pavlechko remains identifiable in the video, largely due to his clothing. The footage shows special forces officers smashing down his apartment door with a sledgehammer before forcing him to apologize to the morgue workers.
Law enforcement officials studied Pavlechko’s posts and filed a report against him for publicly displaying extremist symbols, according to the agency’s statement. It did not specify the exact nature of the violation. Baza reported that anti-extremism authorities spotted a keychain with a “thieves’ star” image in one of the blogger’s videos and may have deemed it a symbol of the banned “AUE movement” — a purported subculture among Russian teenagers that glorifies prison and criminality. The Interior Ministry said a court had already reviewed the case and ordered Pavlechko to serve the short jail sentence he had just completed.
Baza reported that Pavlechko was released on his own recognizance. The blogger’s family and friends told the Telegram channel he suffered bruises and scrapes on his body. Baza published a video of Pavlechko showing visible signs of beatings on his body.
Artem Pavlechko, a Tulun-based blogger who documents local and regional issues on social media, became known for videos in which he argues with traffic police officers, according to the Siberian news outlet People of Baikal. Pavlechko ran for mayor of Tulun in 2024 and won 17 percent of the vote.
Pavlechko has styled himself as the “blogger of all Russia” and “Russia’s future president.” His YouTube channel, Siberian Freshness, promises to “sow goodness, light, and eternity,” according to its description. Pavlechko’s public page of the same name was later rebranded as “Your Mentor at Alfa,” where he actively promoted Alfa Bank’s services and published videos until January 2025.
Pavlechko’s Instagram reveals a catalog of videos: musings on his personal life, feuds with other bloggers, and criticism of local government officials. He began posting frequently about local issues in Tulun roughly a year before the city’s mayoral race.
His social media accounts also feature darker content, including a xenophobic video urging followers to form a “Bastrykinite militia” — a reference to Federal Investigative Committee Chairman Alexander Bastrykin — to target Tajik migrant workers in Russia. He also posted videos about fundraising for Russian forces in Ukraine. At the same time, however, his Facebook avatar depicts his Russian passport engulfed in flames.

'Recipe for disaster': Piastri raises Melbourne F1 safety concerns

Oscar Piastri raises safety concerns ahead of F1 Australian Grand Prix
In short:
Concerns over the safety of the new Formula 1 cars off the starting grid have been raised during preseason testing.
Oscar Piastri drove 161 laps on Friday during testing in Bahrain.
What's next?
A second three-day testing session in Bahrain will be held from February 18-20, ahead of the Australian Grand Prix weekend on March 6-8.
Oscar Piastri has raised concerns about safety issues at the upcoming Australian Grand Prix, worried about potential chaos at the very start of the F1 season opener.
The McLaren ace warned it sounded like "a recipe for disaster" to have the sport's new-look "low downforce" cars, still untested in race conditions, jostling for position, and he also brought up uncertainties surrounding overtaking.
Piastri noted his concerns after a successful but long day behind the wheel of his new McLaren on Friday, during which he churned out 161 laps — more than anyone else — and finished fourth-fastest in the standings behind a Mercedes 1-2 led by Kimi Antonelli.
Piastri believes his concerns will need to be looked at before his home grand prix in Melbourne in three weeks when the first race will take place since F1's cars, rules and regulations were completely revised.
"Starts need to be addressed because, probably as we've all seen, it's a pretty complicated process now to have a safe start, let alone a competitive one," he said after the final session of the first official preseason testing at the Sakhir circuit.
"There's plenty of topics to address. Starts, and overtaking is certainly going to be different as well.
"Whether we use straight mode at the start or not, as well.
"I think a pack of 22 cars with a couple hundred points less downforce sounds like a recipe for disaster to me, but there's a few of those aspects that need to be spoken about.
"The thing is, everyone's going to need different things for the start, and to be completely honest with you, I'm not sure any of us know exactly what we need yet.
"There's so many things just from an even borderline safety point of view that need to be kind of figured out on track, that do need addressing."
Piastri was talking to reporters after the drivers went through a practice start in Bahrain, which turned into a fairly chaotic exercise.
He said that wasn't connected to the new engines but to a miscommunication.
The Australian had failed to get away in his McLaren but explained: "I got told to wait until whoever was in front of me had gone and then do my own launch, and not do it to the lights.
"Clearly, some other people had a different idea. So that was nothing to do with the power units."
As for his verdict on which teams looked most powerful over the week — McLaren, Mercedes, Red Bull and Ferrari all seemed their usual powerhouse selves — he shrugged: "Where we are in the pecking order, I don't know.
"It kind of looks like the top-four teams are still the top-four teams, but I don't know where exactly we sit in that at the moment."
Mercedes's George Russell, second-fastest on Friday ahead of Ferrari's third-fastest Lewis Hamilton, was still adamant Red Bull had a "pretty scary" advantage over the rest as Max Verstappen finished fifth on the time sheets.
Red Bull, in turn, reckoned Mercedes looked impressive as the pre-Melbourne mind games started to get into gear.
A second three-day testing session in Bahrain will be held from February 18-20, ahead of the Australian Grand Prix weekend on March 6-8.

Hume was punished after the election. Now she's been crowned Liberal deputy

Jane Hume was punished for her election slips. Now she's been crowned deputy Liberal leader
Jane Hume started the parliamentary term in the doldrums.
The Victorian senator and favourite of the media had been turfed from the opposition front bench by her "friend" Sussan Ley, after being tarred personally with much of what went wrong to deliver the Coalition its cataclysmic election loss.
The demotion had hurt, she conceded, but she also wasn't about to let it get her down.
"This isn’t the playground, this is the parliament. I’m not here to make friends. I’m here to make a difference," she told morning television two days after Ley's first shadow cabinet was unveiled.
"As my very wise mother would say, 'Stop your nonsense, chin up, chest out, straighten your tiara and let's get on with the job.'"
On Friday there was no tiara but a metaphorical crown as she ascended over three of her colleagues to be elected deputy Liberal leader, while the party ousted the woman that had orchestrated her move to the back bench just nine months earlier.
It makes Hume the first senator to hold the title since 1990 and, depending on the portfolio she chooses for herself, that could mean some new horizons for the opposition to traverse.
Hume, along with new Liberal Leader Angus Taylor, made up Peter Dutton's economic team. Whether they can shake that association in the minds of voters, who emphatically rejected the party the last time around, remains to be seen.
"We know the challenge that faces us. We know that many people have lost faith," she told reporters on Friday.
"Our party and our movement has a proud history. In my role as deputy, I will make it my mission to ensure that it also has a bright future."
From banker to parliamentarian
Hume, 54, was born in Melbourne and stayed in the city for her studies, earning a commerce degree at Melbourne University.
She entered the workforce as a graduate at NAB, before spending two decades moving between various roles in the banking and superannuation sector.
After multiple attempts at Senate preselection, she was elected in fifth position on the Coalition ticket in 2016, behind now prominent frontbencher James Paterson.
Her success at the ballot box came after a bleak period in her personal life. At a women's summit last year, she spoke of finding herself unemployed, recently divorced and a single mother of three.
"Were my parents thrilled? Absolutely not. Was I thrilled? No, not in the least," she said.
Three years after joining parliament, Scott Morrison named the former super adviser as assistant minister for superannuation and financial services.
Hume got straight to work, telling the Sydney Morning Herald she sought to make urgent changes to the "inefficient" super system and reintroduce legislation to make it opt-in for those under 25 years of age.
After the Coalition's 2022 defeat, the senator was appointed as the shadow minister for finance and the public service.
She was also tasked with helming the party's election review alongside former director Brian Loughnane, which recommended targets rather than formal quotas for female MPs, despite the party's poor result with women.
It was an issue she had some experience with. Long before being elected to the Senate, Hume had established a program to help mentor young women keen on entering politics.
"One of the tough things we have to do is convince our members and our colleagues that there is a business case for increasing the number of women in parliament," she told the ABC in 2017.
But she came under fire the following year for comments made during an episode of Q&A that suggested women who weren't able to break through the preselection process should simply work harder.
"We have to work for what we want," she said "And for women that don’t get there, well, the trick is work that little bit harder. Don’t get bitter, get better."
Blunders mar election campaign
The first sign of trouble for Hume came before the official election campaign. During a speech at the Menzies Research Centre she declared it would be an expectation of a Coalition government that "all members of the APS [Australian Public Service] work from the office five days a week".
While there would be some exceptions, she said, "they will be made where they work for everyone rather than be enforced on teams by an individual".
Hume had apparently been inspired to float the proposal after a conversation with her son, who was working from home as an intern.
Her comments were quickly met with backlash and Labor seized upon them to claim that everybody would be at risk of being forced back to the office if Dutton was elected.
The policy was particularly poisonous among women, for whom the ability to work from home is often essential to being able to juggle a career and parenting responsibilities.
Such was the outrage that Dutton had to publicly abandon the position — a remarkable concession in the midst of an election.
"I think it was pretty clear during the election campaign that that policy was a mistake," she told reporters on Friday.
It was not her only election misstep. Two days before Australians went to the polls, she suggested on live television that there were "Chinese spies" volunteering for Labor.
The comment swiftly went viral on social media platforms popular with Chinese voters and prompted calls for the prominent Liberal to apologise.
Hume this week labelled the comment a "throwaway line" that had been taken out of context and blamed Labor for weaponising it.
"I have in fact, apologised to those that were offended by that," she said. "They were ill-considered remarks."
Both fumbles were widely cited as key contributors to the Coalition's defeat — and Hume did not escape unscathed.
Banished to the backbenches
With the wreck of the election still smouldering, Sussan Ley stood up in front of journalists and declared that the Liberal Party would go in a new direction, one that reflected modern Australia.
That new vision for the party apparently did not include Hume on the front bench, despite her status as a fundraising powerhouse.
The high-profile senator was unceremoniously left off Ley's ministry, along with fellow Liberal woman Sarah Henderson. It meant the number of women on the front bench went backwards under Ley, even as she acknowledged the need to attract more women to the party.
Asked about the snub, Ley described Hume as a "strong performer across a range of different subject areas" and an "enormously talented, fantastic" team member.
Hume kept quiet on the slight for two days, before turning to Sunrise to break her silence.
"If you’re asking me whether I feel hurt or slighted by this move from Sussan, of course it hurts," she said.
"It hurts professionally because I was a hard-working and prolific member of the front bench in the previous opposition. It hurts personally, too, because you know, Sussan and I are friends."
But Hume also saw a silver lining: "There is something very liberating about being on the back bench and being able to speak without having to stick to the party line and without having to stick to talking points."
Indeed, despite being on the back bench, Hume managed to stay in the spotlight. She is known for her strong and often entertaining performances in Senate estimates, including one particularly memorable exchange with a witness who she often bumped into wearing lycra at the gym.
"Less worthy men have seen me in far less," she joked, before her own mouth dropped open seemingly in surprise at what had slipped out.
In the hearings this week, Hume questioned the Department of Parliament Services about why condoms were available in women's changing rooms but not men's. The public servant said she thought it was wonderful that women were taking control of their sexual health.
"I agree ... I just wonder why men aren't taking responsibility as well," Hume replied.

Mark Carney visits memorial as new details surface about Canada shooting

Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney has laid a bouquet of flowers at a makeshift memorial in Tumbler Ridge, as new details have emerged about the school shooting that left eight people dead in the remote British Columbia town.
On Friday, Carney travelled to the mining community alongside opposition leaders in a show of national solidarity following Tuesday’s attack at Tumbler Ridge Secondary School, one of the deadliest episodes of violence in recent Canadian history.
Police have identified the shooter as 18-year-old Jesse Van Rootselaar.
The Royal Canadian Mounted Police said she was "hunting" and that "there was no specific targeting of any individuals."
According to investigators, Van Rootselaar killed her 39-year-old mother and 11-year-old stepbrother at their home before heading to the school, where she shot dead five students and a teacher, then took her own life.
'Unforgivable act of violence'
Her estranged father, Justin Van Rootselaar, said in a statement to CBC that he was offering condolences for a "senseless and unforgivable act of violence."
"As the biological father of the individual responsible, I carry a sorrow that is difficult to put into words," the statement said.
Police have released a photograph of the suspect and confirmed she had known mental health issues.
Carney is expected to address a vigil outside the town hall in Tumbler Ridge, about 1,180 kilometres north of Vancouver.
The town of roughly 2,400 residents has been marked by grief, with families of victims sharing tributes.
Carney earlier told parliament that "these children and their teachers bore witness to unheard-of cruelty," describing Tumbler Ridge as resilient and compassionate.
He cancelled plans to attend the Munich Security Conference following the attack.

Judge gives US 2 weeks to retrieve student deported to Honduras while traveling for Thanksgiving
A federal judge says the U.S. government has to bring a Babson College freshman back after officials deported her to Honduras
- Bookmark
A college student deported to Honduras while traveling for Thanksgiving in November must be returned to the United States within two weeks, a federal judge in Boston ruled Friday.
U.S. District Judge Richard Stearns issued an order that required the return of 19-year-old Babson College freshman Any Lucia Lopez Belloza by the end of February.
Stearns said he had hoped the Trump administration would come up with a solution after it acknowledged mistakenly deporting Lopez Belloza. Having failed to do that, Stearns said, he was compelled to act. He said it was up to the courts to determine her rights and the legality of her removal.
“This is not an issue for the Executive to prejudge and arrogate to itself, whatever stance it may choose to take in litigating the removal issue before a court of law,” Stearns wrote.
Asked about the decision, the Department of Homeland Security e-mailed a statement saying Lopez Belloza received “full due process” and a final order of removal. The federal agency said she entered the U.S. in 2014 and that the removal order was issued by an immigration judge the following year.
The government has said she missed multiple opportunities to appeal. But Lopez Belloza said her previous attorney told her there had been no removal order.
Her lawyer, Todd Pomerleau, said previously that the government’s response “spills a lot of ink on the difficulty of a student visa, but it fails to address the numerous simple solutions available to itself to rectify its ‘mistaken’ deportation.” Pomerleau could not be reached for comment late Friday.
Lopez Belloza, who has no criminal history, was detained at Boston's airport Nov. 20 as she prepared to fly home to Texas for the holiday. She was deported two days later.
She has been staying with her grandparents in her native Honduras, a country she had last been to more than a decade ago.
Babson has offered her support to continue her studies remotely, as she pursues a business degree.

Wife of Cherokee Nation judge accused of shooting him dead in his sleep
Elizabeth Poteete, 70, told deputies she shot her husband because she feared for her life
- Bookmark
An Oklahoma woman is facing murder charges after she allegedly shot and killed her husband, a former Cherokee Nation Supreme Court justice, as he slept in their home.
Elizabeth Poteete, 70, is charged with first-degree murder in the Cherokee Nation District Court in connection with the February 5 shooting death of Troy Wayne Poteete, according to newly filed court records obtained by KOTV.
Investigators say Poteete called 911 around 11 p.m. that night and reported that she had shot her husband multiple times. She told the dispatcher that she would be waiting for deputies on her front porch.
When deputies with the Sequoyah County Sheriff’s Office responded to the couple’s home in Vian, they found Troy Poteete on the couch suffering from gunshot wounds. He was pronounced dead at the scene.
Poteete told investigators that her husband had threatened her, saying that his girlfriend and another person were going to kill her.
She claimed she feared for her life, so she grabbed a handgun from a file cabinet, stood four to five feet away from her husband, and fired multiple shots, according to records viewed by FOX24.
She told investigators she was unsure how many times she pulled the trigger.
Troy Poteete was a founding member of the Trail of Tears Association. He also served eight years as a Cherokee Nation Tribal Council member and was director of the Arkansas Riverbed Authority.
Poteete is being held at the Sequoyah County Jail without bond, according to court records. She is scheduled to appear in court on March 3.

A woman thought she was bathing alone in her apartment. When she looked out the window a police drone was staring back
Denver police admitted its drone was on the way to the scene of a call and was part of a four-month first responder program

A Denver woman was left shocked and feeling “violated” after spotting a police drone hovering outside her window while she was taking a bath.
"I was just playing on my phone, relaxing, and I saw a flashing light coming from the window," the woman, who asked to be identified as Eden, told KUSA. "It was a drone, and I was like, 'Oh my God’... I felt violated.”
Eden called out to her boyfriend, Carlos, who was also in the apartment and saw the drone flying close to their window on Monday night. The couple estimated the drone was flying around 30 ft from the ground.
"I mean, I saw it right out of my window," Carlos told the outlet. "At least, close enough to where I feel like if I threw a rock, I'd be able to hit it."
When contacted, Denver police admitted that the drone belonged to them and was part of a four-month first responder program, on the way to the scene of a call about a suicidal person near to the apartment.
Despite police insisting that the camera had been pointed in the other direction, Eden said she still felt uncomfortable.
"I almost preferred that it was a stranger because the police are here to protect and not to violate," she told KUSA. "It didn't feel good. It didn't make me feel safe at all."
The department told the outlet that it offered to show Carlos the footage from the flight – which were confirmed by DPD logs – and said the drone was flying at 200 ft for the entire flight, which the couple disputes.
The Independent has contacted the Denver Police Department for more information on Monday’s incident.
DPD told the couple that the drone had only been flown in the area for approximately two minutes and circled the location of the call for service during that time. Information is stored on its Drone as First Responder Transparency Dashboard for 60 days.
According to the department, such first responder drones have been deployed to 622 calls for service from when the program was quietly rolled out in October last year, through to February 12.
Drones arrive on scene before officers more than 84 percent of the time and drone pilots can determine whether or not a physical patrol response is needed in more than 36 percent of cases – freeing up officers for more serious incidents.
Eden told KUSA that, despite her negative experience, she believed that the drones “can be used in a right way,” though added: "I don't like the fact that they were hovering in a very residential spot where people could get the wrong idea."

Andrew tried to ‘fix’ meeting between Jeffery Epstein and Colonel Gaddafi, emails reveal
The disgraced financier appeared to ask for a meeting with Gaddafi but it is understood that it did not go ahead
- Bookmark

Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor tried to arrange a meeting for Jeffrey Epstein with Colonel Gaddafi in Tripoli, Libya, emails appear to show.
Messages within the latest release of the US Department of Justice’s Epstein files, from the autumn of 2010, show the disgraced financier contacted royal aide David Stern
He said: “i want to go to tripoli lets organize with pa”.
The paedophile then sent another email to Mr Stern, which said: “people that have seen the father, have asked me if i want to meet him as he does not know where to put his money as opposed to what to do with it, currencies etc, I wondered if Pa should make the intro instead.”
The emails were first unearthed from the Epstein files by Channel 4 News, which reported “the father” refers to the late Libyan dictator Muammar Gaddafi to distinguish him from his well-known son Saif.
It appears Mr Stern then consulted Andrew, in a reply dated the following day, October 8 2010, writing: “He is thinking about the best approach and will discuss with me when I see him next on 17th Oct in Hong Kong (he is leaving today for Asia).”
Andrew then spoke to a Libyan contact in an attempt to facilitate the meeting.
The former Duke of York made an official visit to China in October 2010 and was the UK’s trade envoy at the time.
Later emails from “The Duke”, signed “A”, to Epstein’s address say “I will call you later this evening after I have had my chat with my Libyan contact to see what we can arrange for you in Tripoli.”
The same day, November 4 2010, “A” follows up to Epstein writing “Libya fixed. Call me whenever.”
The emails come as Thames Valley Police on Wednesday said it had held discussions with specialists from the Crown Prosecution Service about allegations that Andrew shared confidential reports from his role as the UK’s trade envoy with Epstein.
It appears the planned meeting did not go ahead, as Epstein did not end up flying to the Libyan capital, Channel 4 News reported.

US military preparing for potentially weeks-long Iran operations, as second carrier heads to Middle East
Sign up now: Get ST's newsletters delivered to your inbox
WASHINGTON – The US military is preparing for the possibility of sustained, weeks-long operations against Iran if President Donald Trump orders an attack, two US officials told Reuters, in what could become a far more serious conflict than previously seen between the countries.
The disclosure by the officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity due to the sensitive nature of the planning, raises the stakes for the diplomacy underway between the US and Iran.
US and Iranian diplomats held talks in Oman last week in an effort to revive diplomacy over Tehran’s nuclear programme, after Mr Trump amassed military forces in the region, raising fears of new military action.
US officials said on Feb 13 the Pentagon was sending an additional aircraft carrier to the Middle East, adding thousands more troops along with fighter aircraft, guided-missile destroyers and other firepower capable of waging attacks and defending against them.
Mr Trump, speaking to US troops on Feb 13 at a base in North Carolina, said it had “been difficult to make a deal” with Iran.
“Sometimes you have to have fear. That's the only thing that really will get the situation taken care of,” Mr Trump said.
Asked for comment on the preparations for a potentially sustained US military operation, White House spokesperson Anna Kelly said: “President Trump has all options on the table with regard to Iran.”
“He listens to a variety of perspectives on any given issue, but makes the final decision based on what is best for our country and national security,” Ms Kelly said.
The Pentagon declined to comment.
The United States sent two aircraft carriers to the region last year, when it carried out strikes against Iranian nuclear sites.
However, the June 2025 Midnight Hammer operation
Risks increasing
The planning underway this time is more complex, the officials said.
In a sustained campaign, the US military could hit Iranian state and security facilities, not just nuclear infrastructure, one of the officials said. The official declined to provide specific details.
Experts say the risks to US forces would be far greater in such an operation against Iran, which boasts a formidable arsenal of missiles. Retaliatory Iranian strikes also increase the risk of a regional conflict.
The same official said the US fully expected Iran to retaliate, leading to back-and-forth strikes and reprisals over a period of time.
The White House and Pentagon did not respond to questions about the risks of retaliation or regional conflict.
Trump has repeatedly threatened to bomb Iran over its nuclear and ballistic missile programs and crushing of internal dissent. On Feb 12, he warned the alternative to a diplomatic solution would “be very traumatic, very traumatic”.
Iran’s Revolutionary Guards have warned that in case of strikes on Iranian territory, they could retaliate against any US military base.
The US maintains bases throughout the Middle East, including in Jordan, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Bahrain, the United Arab Emirates and Turkey.
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu met Mr Trump for talks in Washington on Feb 11, saying that if an agreement with Iran were reached, “it must include the elements that are vital to Israel”.
Iran has said it is prepared to discuss curbs on its nuclear programme in exchange for lifting sanctions, but has ruled out linking the issue to missiles. REUTERS

Trump says Iran regime change best, 'fear' is powerful motivator
US President Donald Trump said Friday that a change of government in Iran would be the "best thing that could happen," as he sent a second aircraft carrier to the Middle East to ratchet up military pressure on the Islamic Republic.
Trump's comments were his most overt call yet for the toppling of Iran's clerical establishment, and came as he pushes on Washington's arch-foe Tehran to make a deal to limit its nuclear programme.
At the same time, the exiled son of the Iranian shah, toppled in the 1979 Iranian revolution, renewed his calls for international intervention following a bloody crackdown on protests by Tehran.
"Seems like that would be the best thing that could happen," Trump told reporters at the Fort Bragg military base in North Carolina when a journalist asked if he wanted "regime change" in Iran.
Trump declined to say who he would want to take over in Iran from Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, but he added that "there are people."
He has previously backed off full-throated calls for a change of government in Iran, warning that it could cause chaos, although he has made threats towards Khamenei in the past.
Speaking earlier at the White House, Trump said that the USS Gerald R. Ford, the world's largest warship, would be "leaving very soon" for the Middle East to up the pressure on Iran.
"In case we don't make a deal, we'll need it," Trump said.
The giant vessel is currently in the Caribbean following the US overthrow of Venezuela's Nicolas Maduro. Another carrier, the USS Abraham Lincoln, is one of 12 US ships already in the Middle East.
'Fear' is powerful motivator
Trump told US troops on Friday that Iran has been "difficult" in nuclear negotiations and suggested that instilling fear in Tehran may be necessary to resolve the standoff peacefully.
"They've been difficult to make a deal," Trump said of the Iranians before an audience of active-duty soldiers at Fort Bragg Army base in North Carolina, after US officials said they were sending a second aircraft carrier to the Middle East.
"Sometimes you have to have fear. That's the only thing that really will get the situation taken care of."
During his address, Trump also referenced the US bombing of Iran's nuclear sites last June.
Earlier, he said the deployment of the world's largest aircraft carrier was being made so "we'll have it ready" should negotiations with Iran fail.
Oman facilitated talks between Iran and the US last week, which a spokesperson for Iran's foreign ministry said had allowed Tehran to gauge Washington's seriousness and showed enough consensus for diplomacy to continue. The date and venue of the next round of US-Iran talks have yet to be announced.
The head of the UN nuclear watchdog, Rafael Grossi, said Friday that reaching an accord with Iran on inspections of its processing facilities was possible but "terribly difficult".

Emerald Fennell’s New Take on This Wuthering Heights Character Is Its Best Twist

Warning: This post contains spoilers for "Wuthering Heights."
As far as iconic characters from Wuthering Heights go, Isabella Linton typically isn't one of the first to come up in conversation about Emily Brontë's classic 1847 gothic romance novel. In the timeless tale of the obsessive love-hate relationship between headstrong Catherine Earnshaw and her brooding outsider of a foster brother Heathcliff, Isabella is introduced as the pampered and privileged younger sister of Edgar Linton, the wealthy heir to Wuthering Heights' neighboring estate of Thrushcross Grange and Catherine's eventual husband. Isabella goes on to fill the role of used and abused pawn in Heathcliff's quest for vengeance against the Earnshaw and Linton families before ultimately fleeing the Yorkshire countryside and dying young.
In the newly-released "Wuthering Heights" (purposefully stylized with quotation marks to distance the adaptation from its source material), on the other hand, filmmaker Emerald Fennell (Promising Young Woman, Saltburn) paints Isabella (played by a scene-stealing Alison Oliver) as the shy, skittish, and sexually repressed young ward of Shazad Latif's measured and mature Edgar—her guardian rather than, as in the book, her brother. Titillated by the introduction of Margot Robbie's Catherine into their lives, and even more so by the subsequent arrival of a newly rich and polished Heathcliff (Jacob Elordi), the delightfully unhinged Isabella transforms before our eyes.
"There are a lot of descriptions in the book about how she is infantile and ill-mannered, and can be quite like a petulant child, and obviously very romantic and spoiled," Oliver told ELLE Canada of her character's spin. "[This] Isabella is this sort of baby-woman, and she’s been kept a child by Edgar. The experience of having Cathy and Heathcliff come into her home is her stepping into a new phase of her life."

Despite some mean-spirited warnings from Cathy that Heathcliff will destroy her, Isabella ultimately gives in to Heathcliff's advances and consents to a loveless marriage in which she will serve as his tormented plaything. The novel's Isabella is coerced and tricked into this arrangement, and finds herself miserable, alone, and at the mercy of a sadistic abuser once the wedding deed is done. The Isabella of "Wuthering Heights," however, not so much.
When Catherine's handmaid Nelly (Hong Chau) shows up at Wuthering Heights in an attempt to retrieve Isabella from Heathcliff's clutches, she finds her chained up like a dog—an apparent dark wink to the reveal in the book that Heathcliff has hanged Isabella's beloved springer spaniel. But in a raunchy and unexpected twist on Brontë's tortured naif, when Isabella crawls across the floor and peers smirkingly up at Nelly with a mad glint in her eye, it becomes decidedly (if somewhat uncomfortably) clear that she's not only a willing participant in Heathcliff's cruel game, but also seemingly enjoying her role as submissive pet.
"'Emerald’s interpretation of Isabella’s story is the reverse of Cathy's; there's an uncorseting of her," Oliver told ELLE UK. "Like she becomes undone. There’s something so powerful about being underestimated."

‘Please don’t shoot me’: Missing Wisconsin woman found dead in woods after desperate call to family
The body of 24-year-old Gabriella Cartagena was found in a wooded area of Menominee County, Michigan
- Bookmark
Five days after Gabriella Cartagena’s family heard her pleading for her life before vanishing, the Wisconsin woman was found dead in a wooded area in Michigan – and her boyfriend is in custody.
The 24-year-old was last seen around 5 p.m. on February 4 at her home in Marinette, Wisconsin. Around 7:20 p.m. that same night, Cartagena made a troubling phone call to her mother.
Family members later told police that during the phone call, they heard Cartagena in distress as she cried, “Please don’t shoot me. I’m sorry.”
Cartagena was reported missing the next day. Her body was found five days later in a wooded area off Birch Creek Road in Menominee County, Michigan.
Investigators learned from the family that Cartagena was believed to be with her boyfriend, 29-year-old Robert Chilcote, at Red Arrow Park in Wisconsin. He was identified as a person of interest, police confirmed at a press conference Thursday, FOX11 reported.
When officers initially responded to the park after receiving the missing persons report, they found signs of blood and immediately treated the area as a crime scene, Marinette Police Department Chief John LaCombe said.
“While looking around the scene, we found some signs of possible blood and other disturbances in the area, which led us to believe that this was a scene we needed to focus on from the start,” LaCombe said.
Police tracked Chilcote in Minnesota and on February 5, after a 16-minute car chase that reached speeds of up to 100 mph, Chilcote was taken into custody.
“There was weapons found in the vehicle,” LaCombe said. “I don’t know if those were the weapons used in this incident or not. There was several firearms located in his vehicle at the time of his arrest in Minnesota.”
Chilcote, who is from the Marinette area, had no known ties to Minnesota, LaCombe added. It took another four days to find Cartagena’s body.
Using surveillance footage from area businesses and cell tower data to track Chilcote’s movements after her disappearance, police were led to a wooded area near Birch Creek Road in Menominee County.
Police said they searched the area repeatedly before locating Cartagena’s body Tuesday morning. LaCombe said he believes Cartagena was killed at Red Arrow Park and later transported to the wooded area in Michigan.
Chilcote is being held on a $100,000 bond in Minnesota on charges of fleeing a peace officer in a motor vehicle and being a fugitive from justice from another state.
Marinette County District Attorney DeShea Morrow said her office is awaiting the results of Cartagena’s autopsy before filing charges. She added that the extradition process is underway to bring Chilcote back to Wisconsin.
Authorities have not released a motive. It’s unclear how long Cartagena and Chilcote had been together, but police say the two lived together in Marinette and there were no prior domestic disturbance reports involving the couple.
LaCombe said Chilcote is the only suspect and does not believe anyone else was involved.
“We remain committed to seeking justice and ensuring the safety of our community,” LaCombe said.
Cartagena, who moved to Marinette from the Milwaukee area about a year ago with her family, leaves behind a three-year-old daughter from a previous relationship, her family said.
A GoFundMe created by Cartagena’s brother states that “their family is still trying to process this sudden loss.”

Trump Says Regime Change 'Best Thing That Could Happen' In Iran

US President Donald Trump said regime change is the "best thing that could happen" in Iran, as he confirmed that a second aircraft carrier would soon join a "massive" US armada in the Arabian Sea amid high tensions between the bitter rivals.
"Seems like that would be the best thing that could happen," Trump told reporters on February 13 at a military base in North Carolina when asked whether he sought "regime change" in Tehran.
"For 47 years, they've been talking and talking and talking. In the meantime, we've lost a lot of lives while they talk," he added in his most direct call for the fall of Iran's hard-line clerical regime.
Trump did not say who he would like to see take over should the government fall, only that "there are people."
Reza Pahlavi, the exiled son of the last shah of Iran, is one of many figures vying for prominence among the fractured Iranian opposition in exile.
Iran's theocratic regime has been in power since 1979, when the Islamic Revolution saw clerics loyal to Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini overthrow the US-backed shah, Mohammad Reza Pahlavi. The two countries have not had diplomatic relations since 1980.
Washington and Tehran have been involved in indirect talks over Iran's nuclear program. Western countries suspect Iran is attempting to develop a nuclear weapon, while Tehran insists its program is strictly for civilian purposes.
Trump has also threatened a new military strike against the Iranian government if it executes any of the protesters arrested during recent mass anti-government demonstrations.
'Difficult' Nuclear Negotiations
Trump told US troops at the base that Tehran has been "difficult" in nuclear talks and suggested more pressure on the Iranians was needed.
"They've been difficult to make a deal," he said. "Sometimes you have to have fear. That's the only thing that really will get the situation taken care of."
Trump also hailed the 12-day war in June, when Israel and the United States launched a bombing campaign targeting Iran's nuclear and military sites.
The latest comments come amid one of Washington's largest-ever military buildups in the Persian Gulf region.
Experts say the deployment is aimed at giving Trump military options if he chooses to act on his threats to attack Iran for failing to make a nuclear deal and violently cracking down on protesters.
Iranian security forces killed thousands of demonstrators in January, after protests erupted in late December 2025, initially over economic issues but later raging into general anger against the regime. More than 53,000 people were arrested, rights groups say.
"The gathering of forces is a point of pressure applied by the United States on Iran to come to a negotiated agreement," said Amin Tarzi, professor of strategic studies at Marine Corps War College.
Tarzi added that after the buildup, the US military posture in the Gulf is "robust" with "naval and defensive air defense capabilities, plus offensive air components."
Reuters on February 13 quoted two unnamed US officials as saying the military was preparing for the possibility of a weeks-long operation against Iran if Trump orders an attack.
World's Largest Warship
The US military has previously deployed the aircraft carrier Abraham Lincoln to the Persian Gulf region to join what Trump called a "massive Armada" near Iran.
On February 13, Trump confirmed that another aircraft carrier, Gerald R. Ford, along with its escort ships, was departing the Caribbean and would soon join US forces in the region, likely within about seven days.
The Gerald R. Ford is considered the largest warship in the world with a length of 337 meters and the capability to carry some of the most advanced military technologies.
When asked why he was sending the second warship, Trump said: "In case we don't make a deal, we'll need it...If we need it, we'll have it ready."
Negotiators met in Muscat last week in talks mediated by the Omani government, and follow-up sessions are unclear, although Reuters quoted sources as saying a fresh round of talks are scheduled for Geneva on February 17.
The source said the US delegation will include envoys Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner and that Omani representatives would serve as mediators. Witkoff and Kushner will then participate in trilateral US-Russia-Ukraine talks later in the day, the source added.
Tehran has expressed a willingness to discuss its nuclear program but has ruled out negotiations over its ballistic missile program and other related matters.
Sanctions Hit Iranian Economy
Iran has been hit hard by Western financial sanctions that have helped crater the country's economy.
Iran in 2015 agreed to a landmark nuclear deal, the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), with world powers aimed at preventing it from developing a nuclear weapon in return for an easing of economic sanctions.
However, it started rolling back its commitments after Trump, during his first term, withdrew the United States from the deal in 2018 and reimposed sanctions on Tehran.

LONDON, February 13. /TASS/. The United Kingdom will spend 400 million pounds ($545 million at the current exchange rate) in 2026 to design new types of high-precision and hypersonic weapons in cooperation with other European countries, the UK Defense Ministry said.
"Britain is progressing the Stratus joint missile programme with France and Italy - leading the work to develop a next generation stealth replacement to the Storm Shadow missile," the statement says.
According to the ministry, the new missiles will be able to defeat high-value targets, destroy enemy ships, and suppress enemy air defenses.
Apart from that, "Britian’s new long-range weapon programme with Germany is progressing rapidly with a new joint study phase about to begin, accelerating both future stealth and hypersonic weapons."
The new system will be known under the name Deep Precision Strike. With the range of over 2,000 km, it will be "among the most advanced systems ever designed by the UK, coming into service in the 2030s.
The UK’s hypersonic weapons investment this year "also includes funding for developing critical technologies, ground and flight testing, as well as significant funding for academic skills and training including funding post-graduate study."

‘The best thing that could happen’: Trump hints at change in power in Iran
Washington: President Donald Trump has said that a change in power in Iran “would be the best thing that could happen” as the US administration weighs whether to take military action against Tehran.
Trump made the comments on Friday (US time) shortly after visiting with troops in Fort Bragg, North Carolina, and after he confirmed earlier in the day that he’s deploying a second aircraft carrier group to the Mideast for potential military action against Iran.
“It seems like that would be the best thing that could happen,” Trump said in an exchange with reporters when asked about pressing for the ouster of the Islamic clerical rule in Iran. “For 47 years, they’ve been talking and talking and talking.”
Trump said earlier that the USS Gerald R. Ford, the world’s largest aircraft carrier, is being sent from the Caribbean Sea to the Middle East to join other warships and military assets the US has built up in the region. The planned deployment comes just days after Trump suggested another round of talks with the Iranians was at hand. Those negotiations didn’t materialise as one of Tehran’s top security officials visited Oman and Qatar this week and exchanged messages with U.S. intermediaries.
“In case we don’t make a deal, we’ll need it,” Trump told reporters about the second carrier. He added, “It’ll be leaving very soon.”
Already, Gulf Arab nations have warned any attack could spiral into another regional conflict in a Mideast still reeling from the Israel-Hamas war in the Gaza Strip. Meanwhile, Iranians are beginning to hold 40-day mourning ceremonies for the thousands killed in Tehran’s bloody crackdown on nationwide protests last month, adding to the internal pressure faced by the sanctions-battered Islamic Republic.
The Ford, whose new deployment was first reported by The New York Times, will join the USS Abraham Lincoln and its accompanying guided-missile destroyers, which have been in the region for over two weeks. US forces have already shot down an Iranian drone that approached the Lincoln on the same day last week that Iran tried to stop a US-flagged ship in the Strait of Hormuz.
It is a quick turnaround for the Ford, which Trump sent from the Mediterranean Sea to the Caribbean last October as the administration built up a huge military presence in the lead-up to the surprise raid last month that captured then-Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro.
It also appears to be at odds with the Trump administration’s national security and defence strategies, which put an emphasis on the Western Hemisphere over other parts of the world.
In response to questions about the movement of the Ford, US Southern Command said US forces in Latin America will continue to “counter illicit activities and malign actors in the Western Hemisphere.”
“While force posture evolves, our operational capability does not,” Colonel Emanuel Ortiz, spokesperson for Southern Command, said in a statement. US “forces remain fully ready to project power, defend themselves, and protect US interests in the region.”
The Ford strike group will bring more than 5,000 additional troops to the Middle East but few capabilities or weapons that don’t already exist within the Lincoln group. Having two carriers will double the number of aircraft and munitions that are available to military planners and Trump.
Given the Ford’s current position in the Caribbean, it will likely be weeks before it is off the coast of Iran.
Trump has repeatedly threatened to use force to compel Iran to agree to constrain its nuclear program and earlier over Tehran’s bloody crackdown on nationwide protests.
Iran and the United States held indirect talks in Oman a week ago, and Trump later warned Tehran that failure to reach an agreement with his administration would be “very traumatic.” Similar talks last year ultimately broke down in June as Israel launched what became a 12-day war on Iran that included the U.S. bombing Iranian nuclear sites.
Asked by a reporter about the new negotiations, Trump said that “I think they’ll be successful. And if they’re not, it’s going to be a bad day for Iran, very bad.”
Trump held talks with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Wednesday and said he insisted to Israel’s leader that negotiations with Iran needed to continue. Netanyahu is urging the administration to press Tehran to scale back its ballistic missile program and end its support for militant groups such as Hamas and Hezbollah as part of any deal.
Iran has insisted its nuclear program is for peaceful purposes. Before the June war, Iran had been enriching uranium up to 60 per cent purity, a short, technical step away from weapons-grade levels.
The USS Ford, meanwhile, first set sail in late June 2025, which means the crew will soon have been deployed for eight months. While it is unclear how long the ship will remain in the Middle East, the move sets the crew up for an unusually long deployment.
The Navy’s top officer, Admiral Daryl Caudle, told reporters last month that keeping the Ford longer at sea would be “highly disruptive” and that he was “a big non-fan of extensions.”
Carriers are typically deployed for six or seven months. “When it goes past that, that disrupts lives, it disrupts things ... funerals that were planned, marriages that were planned, babies that were planned,” Caudle said.
He said extending the Ford would complicate its maintenance and upkeep by throwing off the schedule of repairs, adding more wear and tear, and increasing the equipment that will need attention.
For comparison, the aircraft carrier USS Dwight D. Eisenhower had a nine-month deployment to the Middle East in 2023 and 2024, when it spent much of its time engaged with the Iran-backed Houthi rebels in Yemen. The ship entered maintenance in early 2025 as scheduled, but it blew past its planned completion date of July and remains in the shipyard to this day.
Caudle told The Associated Press in a recent interview that his vision is to deploy smaller, newer ships when possible instead of consistently turning to huge aircraft carriers.

Abortion, again, threatens to bring Crisafulli’s careful plan unstuck

Abortion, again, threatens to bring Crisafulli’s careful plan unstuck
Coming into the second calendar year of their first term in government in more than a decade, the LNP has been ticking off much of what it came to power promising to do.
Premier David Crisafulli and his team are now well into a thornier patch of events over which they have little or no control – or find themselves backed into a corner.
And not just any events: these are ones that pick at the ideological and pragmatic stitching holding together its party room members and their promises to Queenslanders.
One, a response to the Bondi massacre, tore their federal Coalition apart. Another – abortion – has delivered the first public rupture in the facade of unity since the state election.
Then there’s the budget, which the government says is headed for further inevitable credit downgrade-driven debt woes, despite experts saying their own actions will be crucial. These actions are likely to rub against vows to not lift taxes or slash the public service.
On Bondi, the state’s drip-fed “calm and methodical” response has resulted in its status as the only jurisdiction to give a hard no to a national gun buyback.
Instead, it has tinkered with penalties and police powers while seemingly walking back from limits on gun ownership, and rejecting the Wieambilla inquest’s calls for a serious look into mental health checks.
The state LNP has also pressed ahead with a crackdown on hate symbols and what it deems hate speech – contested pro-Palestinian slogans.
Crisafulli has painted these laws as tough. They have been backed by the state’s major Jewish group, but panned by civil libertarians and supporters of the Palestinian cause.
His gun law reform efforts have been described by at least one advocacy group as leaving the state with “weakest” scheme in the country. The opposition has issued some criticism of this and is seriously considering a symbolic stand over free speech concerns with omnibus bill’s hate speech element.
What Labor has seized on more forcefully is Mackay LNP backbencher Nigel Dalton’s break with his colleagues in a procedural parliamentary vote to unwind a gag on any debate around abortion.
Dalton then sat down for an interview with an anti-abortion campaigner to say he never believed Crisafulli’s insistence law changes were “not part of our plan”, and regretted his silence since.
A major anti-abortion lobby group then fired up its own social media channels to put the spotlight on similar claims said to have been made privately by some of Dalton’s party room colleagues.
While Labor jumped on this as more evidence of barely papered-over LNP desires to unwind the state’s recent abortion reforms within Crisafulli’s ranks, this came in a parliamentary week parallel to CFMEU inquiry evidence of former minister Mark Bailey’s directions around talks with the union.
Asked in question time on Thursday about Oodgeroo MP Amanda Stoker’s reported statements on abortion, Crisafulli fired up through a series of interjections to accuse Labor of trying to “run a scare campaign again”.
Later, amid more interjections, Crisafulli called out Opposition Leader Steven Miles for not holding a media conference while the inquiry was running this week and “not even going out to face the music as to what is going on in his own backyard”.
At the centre of the abortion debate issue, though, is Robbie Katter, the Traeger MP and eponymous party leader who provided a heaping of the election campaign pressure on the LNP and has made little effort to hide his anger at the party’s campaign tactics then and in the recent byelection loss.
Katter provided the fuel for Dalton’s rebellion in his motion which, while failing to lift the ban on abortion law debate in parliament, succeeded in reigniting broader public debate about the issue.
In light of that, you can expect it won’t be the last Katter effort to poke at the LNP’s fault lines. And One Nation leader Pauline Hanson, currently riding the shine rubbing off from the federal Coalition, is joining in.
Polls suggest One Nation’s rise is not yet playing out at a state level. But they have shown falling support for Crisafulli and his party. At some stage, carefully kept plans may need to be altered.
Alternatively, further events might force them to be.
Heads up
- While the state’s corruption watchdog did not get a chance to air its concerns and suggestions around government’s unpicking of a developer donation ban and quadrupling of the donation cap at a public hearing last month, its boss is likely to face MPs at a regular parliamentary appearance on Tuesday.
- It’s due to be a busy week for committees, with at least one hearing also scheduled for MPs to probe gun control and antisemitism laws set for Thursday.
Catch up
- This week, parliament also passed the government’s bill to give the option of electronic monitoring for youth offenders as young as 10, with Labor even lobbing a bill this week to introduce a daily five cent cap on fuel price increases (the LNP opposition didn’t introduce its first in the last term until three years in).
- Meanwhile, the Child Safety inquiry has agreed to shave six months off its November deadline to give the government suggestions to fix the “broken” system it can feed into its budget deliberations. Labor has accused minister Amanda Camm of prematurely cutting off the probe before it could look at a troubled IT system rollout.

Starmer: Britain’s ‘Brexit years’ are over and we need Europe, not Donald Trump
After the US president rocked the continent with his threat to take Greenland, the prime minister praises Europe as a ‘sleeping giant’
- Bookmark
- CommentsGo to comments
Britain’s “Brexit years” are over, Sir Keir Starmer will tell world leaders on Saturday as he calls for closer security ties with Europe – and less reliance on Donald Trump’s United States.
After transatlantic tensions flared following the US president’s repeated threats to take Greenland from Denmark, the prime minister will call for Europe to curb its dependence on the US, while praising the continent as a “sleeping giant” whose economic and military might can defeat its enemies.
After surviving the most tumultuous week of his premiership so far, including an attempt to oust him from office, Sir Keir will also warn that turning inwards, as the UK did during Brexit, would amount to “surrender” in a perilous era.
The prime minister will make his remarks at the Munich Security Conference, where last year the US vice-president JD Vance stunned delegates by accusing Europe of “retreating from some of its most fundamental values” and claimed that the greatest peril facing the continent was not Russia or China but “the threat from within”.
Since then, President Trump has sent shockwaves through Europe with repeated threats to take over Greenland, as well as directing insults at various leaders. He has also falsely accused European Nato allies, including the UK, of avoiding the front line in the war in Afghanistan.
As he departed for Munich on Friday, the US secretary of state Marco Rubio, who is attending on behalf of the Trump administration this year, warned of a “new era” in geopolitics.
In his speech, Sir Keir will say he is setting out “a vision of European security and greater European autonomy that does not herald US withdrawal, but answers the call for more burden-sharing in full, and remakes the ties that have served us so well”. However, he will also praise the contribution made by the US to European security, and say that it remains a key ally.
Sir Keir will describe Europe as “a sleeping giant”, saying: “Our economies dwarf Russia’s, 10 times over. We have huge defence capabilities.” But he will warn that, too often, this has amounted to less than the sum of its parts, with gaps in some areas and “massive duplication” in others. And he will call on the continent to make the most of its defence capabilities, including via closer cooperation on defence between the UK and the EU in order “to multiply our strengths and build a shared industrial base across Europe that can turbocharge our defence production”.
Sir Keir’s speech comes less than three months after talks on Britain joining the EU’s new €150bn (£130bn) Security Action for Europe rearmament fund broke down amid financial disagreements.
The Labour leader will also hit out at Reform UK and the Green Party, describing them as “the peddlers of easy answers on the extreme left and the extreme right” and claiming that the future they offer would see “the lamps ... go out across Europe once again”, a reference to the chilling remark made by the then foreign secretary Sir Edward Grey before the First World War.
Sir Keir will say: “It’s striking that the different ends of the spectrum share so much. Soft on Russia and weak on Nato – if not outright opposed. And determined to sacrifice the longstanding relationships that we want and need to build, on the altar of their ideology.
“The future they offer is one of division and then capitulation. The lamps would go out across Europe once again. But we will not let that happen.”
On Friday shortly after his arrival in Munich Sir Keir held trilateral talks with Germany’s Friedrich Merz and France’s Emmanuel Macron where he emphasised the need for cooperation in defence.
The prime minister said: "There's no UK security without European security. There's no European security without UK security. So we have to work together."
World leaders gathering in Munich for the annual security conference are being greeted by a report that savages the policies of Mr Trump and warns that global security structures risk being turned to rubble. The Munich Security Report 2026, titled “Under Destruction”, says that the world has entered a period of “wrecking-ball politics”.
“Sweeping destruction – rather than careful reforms and policy corrections – is the order of the day,” it reads. “The most prominent of those who promise to free their country from the existing order’s constraints and rebuild a stronger, more prosperous nation is the current US administration. As a result, more than 80 years after construction began, the US-led post-1945 international order is now under destruction.”
Dame Priti Patel, the shadow foreign secretary, said: “Keir Starmer has a habit of handing away sovereignty, and now he is once again rolling the pitch for greater EU integration and less control for the UK. Britain is uniquely placed to help bring the US and Europe together, ensuring Nato is as strong as possible.
“We must not be overdependent on America, but neither should we offer Europe a blank cheque, prepared to accept any and all costs, as Labour are. Starmer’s repeated surrenders to China show he lacks the backbone to stand up for Britain on the international stage. His weakness has undermined the special relationship and put our country in danger.”

Ukraine, European partners agree on €90B aid, joint weapons production
Denmark to allocate major funding package during EU Presidency; Zelenskyy meets with Norwegian, German leaders to boost air defense, energy infrastructure
ISTANBUL
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy announced a major €90 billion ($97.2 billion) aid package Friday from Denmark and secured new agreements on joint weapons production during high-level meetings at the 2026 Munich Security Conference in Germany.
Zelenskyy confirmed that Denmark, during its upcoming Presidency of the Council of the European Union, supported the decision to allocate the funds for 2026-2027 to bolster collective security.
The Ukrainian leader, who arrived in Munich for the three-day forum, also held talks with Norwegian Prime Minister Jonas Gahr Store and representatives of the "Berlin format" to prioritize air defense and the protection of energy infrastructure.
- Strengthening air defenses, PURL Initiative
In discussions with Store, the two leaders focused on strengthening Ukraine’s skies through the PURL initiative, which facilitates the purchase of American missiles for air defense systems.
"Protected skies over Ukraine are one of the key factors that will force Russia to end this war," Zelenskyy stated, expressing gratitude for Norway’s continued delivery of NASAMS missiles.
The meetings also addressed the full activation of the Security Action for Europe (SAFE) instrument, a mechanism designed to enhance joint weapons production between Ukraine and its European allies.
Following a Berlin format meeting with multiple partners, Zelenskyy noted that Ukraine is preparing a comprehensive list of requirements to support energy infrastructure and military capabilities.
- Long-term security guarantees
The diplomatic flurry in Munich included a meeting between Zelenskyy and German Chancellor Friedrich Merz to discuss the establishment of joint weapons production projects.
"Today, I saw with my own eyes the first Ukrainian-German enterprise for the production of drones," Zelenskyy said, noting that the leaders explored further defense cooperation and the implementation of joint projects aimed at strengthening both nations.
Zelenskyy emphasized the need for "more of our joint production, more of our resilience, more coordination and effectiveness of our shared security architecture in Europe."
Regarding diplomatic efforts, the Ukrainian leader briefed partners on recent meetings involving Ukrainian, American and Russian representatives.
Zelenskyy provided details on the preparation for upcoming negotiations and outlined the key points of the documents currently under development.
The Munich Security Conference, bringing together more than 1,000 participants from over 115 countries, will feature a panel discussion Saturday with Zelenskyy titled, “Coalition of the Able? Securing Long-Term Support for Ukraine.”

Cooperation with Argentina not targeted at any 3rd party: China’s top diplomat
Chinese foreign minister meets Argentinian counterpart at Munich Security Conference in Germany
ISTANBUL
Foreign Minister Wang Yi said Friday that Beijing’s cooperation with Argentina does not target any third party, according to a statement from the Chinese Foreign Ministry.
Wang made the remarks during his meeting with Argentinian Foreign Minister Pablo Quirno on the sidelines of the Munich Security Conference in Germany.
He urged the two sides to “remain committed to the right direction of bilateral relations.”
Noting that China and Argentina are economically complementary with a solid foundation for practical cooperation, Wang proposed “deepening collaboration in economy and trade, technology, finance, and mining.”
He also expressed hope that Argentina would provide a ”fair, transparent, and non-discriminatory business environment for Chinese enterprises, and welcomed Argentine citizens to take advantage of the visa-free policy for trips to explore China.”
"China's development and growth represent a reinforcement of peace and stability in the world," Wang said, noting that this year marks the 54th anniversary of the establishment of ties.
"We never engage in geopolitical contests, nor do we ask other countries to take sides. China-Argentina cooperation is not targeted at any third party, nor should it be disrupted by any third-party factors," he added.
His remarks came as Argentina, under current President Javier Gerardo Milei, has grown closer to the administration of US President Donald Trump.

China’s top diplomat Wang hails talks to end Ukraine war
Wang Yi makes remarks in meeting with Ukrainian counterpart Andrii Sybiha as trilateral talks, led by US, progress to end war with Russia
ISTANBUL
Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi on Friday hailed talks to end the Russia-Ukraine war during a meeting with his Ukrainian counterpart Andrii Sybiha.
On the sidelines of the Munich Security Conference in Germany, Wang said Beijing values the “traditional friendship” between the two countries and will continue to advance cooperation across various fields.
Wang said Beijing “remains committed to the original principles underpinning diplomatic ties, namely mutual respect, equality and mutual benefit, and win-win cooperation,” according to a statement from the Chinese Foreign Ministry.
He noted that in recent days, “intensive diplomatic efforts and dialogue surrounding the Ukraine crisis have been encouraging,” and that Beijing “is willing to provide Ukraine with a new batch of humanitarian assistance.”
His remarks come as Moscow said Friday that the next round of trilateral peace talks between the US, Russia and Ukraine will be held from Feb. 17-18 in Geneva.
Russia and Ukraine held two rounds of US-mediated peace talks in Abu Dhabi, the capital of the United Arab Emirates, in January and earlier this month.
China is currently Ukraine’s largest trading partner and largest source of imports, with trade reaching $21 billion last year. The two nations have maintained ties since 1992.

Trump takes a beating from his own party amid Epstein files release and tariffs rebuke

President Donald Trump's iron grip on the Republican Party might be starting to loosen, just a bit.
The few elected Republicans who regularly cross him — including Kentucky Rep. Thomas Massie and Sen. Thom Tillis of North Carolina — are more vocal than ever. And in recent days, daylight has emerged between the president and a handful of his top supporters in Congress.
The apparent shift is underway as Trump, the Republican Party's undisputed leader, grapples with stubbornly low approval ratings — especially on the economy, a perennial issue on which he was elected that has only grown more important to Americans chafing under high prices.
Six U.S. House Republicans voted this week to overturn Trump's tariffs on Canada. Tillis remained resolute in holding up the president's Fed chair nomination in protest over a Justice Department investigation of the current one. The administration pulled back the sustained anti-immigration law enforcement push in Minnesota. And fallout from the Epstein files — in which Trump and allies are mentioned — is roiling the world and its most powerful players.
Democrats are jumping on the opening, with some pushing a narrative that "the tide is turning" on Trump. Their perceived momentum follows big wins in last fall's off-year elections after hammering an affordability message, and as prediction markets favor them to win control of the House in the midterms.
"Trump's grip on power is slipping," Rep. Jim McGovern, D-Mass., said Thursday in a gloating social media post. "Nobody is taking his bulls--- that somehow he's lowering prices for families."
The administration's efforts this week to wrest the affordability narrative — by drawing attention to Trump's drug-pricing initiatives, or to gains in the stock market, or to projections that Americans' tax refunds will rise this season — have been muddied by the deluge of political setbacks and controversies. Trump on Friday gave a passing glance to curbing price increases when he spoke to troops in North Carolina hours after the release of January consumer price index figures that showed slowing inflation.
He's had fewer public appearances since a racist social media post last Friday, a shift from his recent cadence of Oval Office appearances in front of reporters with supporters from the political ranks and business community. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is a frequent press conference partner of Trump, but his visit to the White House this week yielded no public remarks.
White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt, when asked about challenges to Trump from the Republican Party, said the party will stay together with the president as its leader.
"Under President Trump's leadership, Republicans will remain united together against the radical Democrats, who will destroy our country once again, if given the chance, with wide open borders, noncitizens voting in elections, and horrible economic policy," Leavitt said via email.
The majority-GOP House of Representatives' vote to override Trump's tariffs on Canadian goods only came about because three Republican members previously sided with Democrats to defeat a rule that would have blocked House votes on Trump's tariffs through July. Trump's threats of retaliation didn't thwart the end result.
While the tariff votes are almost purely symbolic, they show GOP leadership failing to stop enough of their members from publicly defying Trump on his signature economic policy. Republicans can only afford to lose one vote in the House to prevail on party-line votes.
A day after the House tariff vote, U.S. border czar Tom Homan announced the government would wrap up its immigration enforcement "surge" in Minnesota, following public outcry against federal agents' aggressive tactics exacerbated by the killing of two U.S. citizens in Minneapolis.
A new AP-NORC poll found most Americans think the administration's deployment of deportation forces has gone too far, and that the GOP's advantage on immigration has shrunk since last year.
The Minnesota actions drew fiery pushback not only from protesters and Democrats but also from business owners. In an open letter shared Thursday, more than 266 businesses from across the U.S. that said they represent 100,000 others warned the government's actions threaten free markets.
A series of other Trump-related stumbles have drawn national focus away from the administration's attempt to tout its accomplishments.
Last week, the president's social media account posted a racist image depicting the Obamas as apes. Numerous Republicans spoke out forcefully and quickly against the post, including close Trump ally Sen. Tim Scott of South Carolina, the only Black Senate Republican, who called it "the most racist thing I've seen out of this White House."
The White House initially defended the post, but after the flood of bipartisan outrage, pivoted to blaming it on an unnamed staffer. Trump subsequently condemned the image but refused to apologize.
This week, a federal grand jury rejected U.S. prosecutors' attempt to indict six Democratic lawmakers, weeks after Trump accused them of sedition for telling military members not to follow unlawful orders. It is highly unusual for grand juries to decline to indict.
The Department of Justice is also in the midst of a criminal investigation into Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell, whose refusal to quickly slash interest rates has made him a top target of Trump's ire.
The probe, which Powell says is retaliatory, has prompted vocal pushback from Republicans worried about the erosion of the central bank's long-established independence.
Tillis, who is retiring at the end of his current term, is blocking all Trump administration nominees to the Fed — including Kevin Warsh, the president's pick to replace Powell — from advancing through the Senate until the DOJ drops the investigation.
The president has said U.S. attorney for the District of Columbia Jeanine Pirro, a Trump loyalist, should continue the probe to completion.
Scott, the Senate Banking Committee chairman, said he does not believe Powell committed a crime —while Trump has repeatedly claimed Powell is either corrupt or grossly incompetent, complaining about cost overruns on building renovations. Numerous Republicans on the Banking panel agree that Powell did not commit a crime, according to Tillis.
Trump is also grappling with the fallout from the DOJ's release of millions of its files on notorious sexual predator Jeffrey Epstein, which is only intensifying days after the latest disclosures. Trump had opposed a bill forcing the DOJ to publicly share its files, but he reversed course as a growing number of Republicans geared up to vote for it anyway.
The newly released records have revealed ties between Epstein and administration officials, including Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, who has since admitted visiting Epstein's island for lunch with his family in 2012.

Quick hits: Calls to investigate judging ignored, Aussies forced home

Winter Olympics 2026: Injured Australians return home from Games, skating union defends controversial scoring — quick hits from day seven
A petition to investigate the judging of the ice dance competition has been dismissed by the sport's governing body, as two injured Australians are forced home from the Games.
Here are the quick hits from the Winter Olympics.
1. Skating union stands by judge's controversial score
Earlier this week, France claimed ice dance gold in one of the most controversial moments of the Games so far.
Laurence Fournier Beaudry and Guillaume Cizeron finished with an overall score of 225.82 in the free dance, with American silver medallists Madison Chock and Evan Bates hot on their heels with a total of 224.39.
The French victory was heavily impacted by judge Jezabel Dabouis — who also happens to be French.
Despite a terrific dance from the Americans and a seemingly less than perfect dance from the French, Dabouis favoured her compatriots by a margin of almost eight points.
Without Dabouis's score, the US figure skaters would have risen to the peak of the dais, with five of the nine judges favouring the Americans.
Since then, more than 10,000 people have signed a Change.org petition urging the International Skating Union (ISU) and the International Olympic Committee to investigate the result.
But yesterday the ISU threw cold water on any suggestion of judging dishonesty, saying it had "full confidence in the scores given and remains completely committed to fairness".
"It is normal for there to be a range of scores given by different judges in any panel and a number of mechanisms are used to mitigate these variations," an ISU spokesperson said.
2. Two Aussies forced to return home
While the Aussie camp is still cheering loudly for Josie Baff and Cooper Woods, it's a different story for two of their peers.
Australian team officials confirmed Daisy Thomas had to make the difficult decision to withdraw from the freeski big air competition after consultation with her coach and the Australian Olympic medical team.
Last November, Thomas suffered a ruptured ACL during competition. After extensive rehab, time in the gym and getting mentally focused, Thomas returned to the World Cup circuit and was selected to make her Olympic debut.
Then this month, she landed awkwardly during slopestyle training and after returning to official training, was unable to complete the session.
Meanwhile, Aussie snowboarder Cam Bolton is returning to Melbourne after being airlifted to hospital after breaking his neck at the Winter Olympics two days ago.
The decision was made — after scans and assessment in Milan — that the best and safest line of management for Cam would be to return home.
3. Ukrainian skeleton athlete Heraskevych loses appeal, receives Order of Freedom
Ukrainian skeleton athlete Vladyslav Heraskevych was disqualified from the Milano Cortina Games earlier this week over the use of a helmet depicting Ukrainian athletes killed during Russia's invasion of Ukraine.
Heraskevych's team appealed the decision but the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) dismissed the case.
Heraskevych has reacted to the decision by saying: "CAS has failed us. We will consider our next steps."
Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has signed a decree awarding Heraskevych the Order of Freedom.
Zelenskyy said the helmet was about honour and remembrance.
"Sport shouldn't mean amnesia, and the Olympic movement should help stop wars, not play into the hands of aggressors. Unfortunately, the decision of the International Olympic Committee to disqualify Ukrainian skeleton racer Vladyslav Heraskevych says otherwise," Zelenskyy wrote on social media.
"This is certainly not about the principles of Olympism, which are founded on fairness and the support of peace. I thank our athlete for his clear stance."
4. Sturla Laegrid earned another bronze medal — didn't confess an affair afterwards this time
Norwegian biathlete Sturla Laegreid cemented himself as one of the main storylines of the 2026 Winter Games when he confessed to an affair in his live post-race interview after winning bronze for the 20km individual race.
It was a moment that will overshadow just how well he's doing at these Games.
Three days after that initial bronze, he won another one, this time in the men's sprint biathlon race. However, this one made fewer headlines outside his home country.
He's also set to be a favourite to medal in the pursuit, mass start and relay later in Milano Cortina.
Perhaps learning from the fallout from that first confession, he didn't reveal anything personal this time post-victory.
And in case you missed the ex-girlfriend's response, she said the cheating was "hard to forgive".
"Even after a declaration of love in front of the whole world," she told Norwegian newspaper VG in a statement.
"I did not choose to be put in this position, and it hurts to have to be in it."
5. Norway’s Klaebo ties all-time Winter Olympics gold record
Norway’s cross-country skiing star Johannes Hosflot Klaebo won his eighth Olympic gold medal (third at these Games), putting him equal with the all-time Winter Games record.
His latest victory came in the men’s 10km interval start free.
Coming from quite a country of winter athletes, he now shares the record with countrymen (who have all retired) Marit Bjoergen and Bjoern Daehlie in cross-country skiing and Ole Einar Bjoerndalen in the biathlon.
However, there's a good chance he'll overtake them, as he still has three races ahead of him.

Damascus, Washington stress Syria’s sovereignty, territorial integrity at Munich meeting
US backs Syrian government, recent integration deal with SDF, counter-ISIS efforts, Foreign Ministry says
ISTANBUL
Syrian and US officials stressed Syria’s sovereignty and territorial integrity during talks on the sidelines of the Munich Security Conference, according to a statement Friday by the Syrian Foreign Ministry.
The Syrian delegation, headed by Foreign Minister Asaad al-Shaibani, met US Secretary of State Marco Rubio to discuss key local and regional developments.
Both sides emphasized the unity of Syria, its sovereignty and the integrity of its territory. The US reaffirmed its support for the Syrian government.
Washington also expressed support for the recent integration agreement between the government and the YPG/SDF terror organization, as well as Syria’s efforts to combat the ISIS (Daesh) terror group.
Syria formally joined the anti-ISIS coalition last November. The coalition was formed in 2014 and has carried out military operations against the terror group in Syria and Iraq, though Damascus was not previously a member.
The talks also addressed relations between Syria and the US and ways to develop cooperation in various fields.
On Jan. 18, the Syrian government and the SDF reached a comprehensive ceasefire and full integration agreement, outlining sweeping measures to restore state authority in the northeast.
Syrian security forces and administrative bodies have entered areas previously controlled by the SDF, including Hasakah, Qamishli and Ayn al-Arab (Kobani), as well as strategic facilities such as airports, oil fields and border crossings.
The agreement provides for the gradual handover of security responsibilities, the deployment of state institutions and the integration of SDF forces into official government structures.
The Syrian Army launched an operation against the SDF on Jan. 16 in areas west of the Euphrates River. The operation later expanded east of the river with the participation of tribal forces, leading to all of the territories previously occupied by the group coming under government control.

Ethiopian prime minister urges dignity-based Africa-Europe ties at Italy-Africa Summit
Summit advances Italy’s Mattei Plan to boost investment-led partnerships in energy, infrastructure, agriculture, training
ADDIS ABABA, Ethiopia
Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed urged a new Africa-Europe partnership on Friday, based on dignity and shared prosperity as he hosted the Second Italy-Africa Summit in Addis Ababa.
“Together, we can shape a new Africa-Europe relationship, not based on dependency, but dignity; not on extraction, but shared prosperity,” Abiy told leaders.
The co-host of the summit, Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, said Italy’s cooperation with Africa is “based on mutual benefit, will continue to strengthen,” and Rome’s “Mattei Plan” is intended to deliver “concrete benefits for African populations.”
Launched in 2024 after the first Italy-Africa Summit was held in Rome earlier that year, the Mattei Plan promotes investment-led partnerships in energy, infrastructure, agriculture and training.
Italy said the initiative aims to spur development and help curb irregular migration by supporting joint projects rather than traditional aid.
Participating in the summit, UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said that cooperation “must be built on mutual respect and trust,” urging reforms to the global financial system to close a $4 trillion annual development financing gap and reduce high borrowing costs faced by African countries.
Leaders from across Africa and Europe, including senior African Union officials, attended the summit, which focused on energy, climate action, digital transformation and industrial development.

Carney, other leaders mourn victims at site of Canada mass shooting
Sign up now: Get ST's newsletters delivered to your inbox
OTTAWA - Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney and opposition leaders laid flowers at a makeshift memorial as they paid their respects to the victims of one of the country’s worst mass shootings
Mr Carney, a Liberal, exchanged hugs and handshakes with other officials as he laid a bouquet at the base of an evergreen tree, near the school where a teacher and five young students were killed on Feb 10. He was joined by Conservative Party leader Pierre Poilievre, as well as leaders of smaller parties.
Jesse Van Rootselaar
Van Rootselaar, who police say was born a male but began identifying as a woman six years ago, then died by suicide.
Van Rootselaar was not targeting anyone specifically at the school, Royal Canadian Mounted Police Deputy Commissioner Dwayne McDonald said. “This suspect was, for lack of a better term, hunting. They were prepared and engaging anybody and everybody they could come in contact with,” he said at a news briefing.
The agency said earlier they had at one point seized guns from the house where Van Rootselaar was living but returned them after the owner, whom they did not identify, successfully appealed the decision.
The Canadian Coalition for Firearm Rights, a pro-gun lobby group, questioned why weapons had been returned to a house where a person with mental illness was living.
Mr McDonald said the two main weapons used in the attack had not previously been seized by police. He did not address the status of two other firearms that were used in the shooting.
The mass shooting was one of the worst in Canadian history. The deadliest took place in April 2020 when a 51-year-old man killed 22 people in Nova Scotia, before police shot him dead.
Few townspeople wanted to speak to media on Feb 12 and British Columbia police said families and friends of the victims had requested privacy.
Police named the school victims as Abel Mwansa, 12; Ezekiel Schofield, 13; Kylie Smith, 12; Zoey Benoit, 12; and Ticaria Lampert, 12, as well as teacher Shannda Aviugana-Durand, 39.
Ticaria’s mother Sarah, speaking to reporters on Feb 12, described her daughter as a “blazing light in the darkness ... (who) just wanted to bring sunshine to everyone and everything she ever touched”. REUTERS

Trump says regime change in Iran would be ‘best thing that could happen’ amid rising tensions
The USS Gerald R. Ford, the world's largest aircraft carrier, is being dispatched from the Caribbean Sea to the Middle East to bolster other warships and military assets already in the region
- Bookmark
- CommentsGo to comments
Donald Trump has declared that a change in power in Iran "would be the best thing that could happen," as his administration considers military action against Tehran amidst the deployment of a second aircraft carrier group to the Middle East.
The comments were made shortly after Trump visited troops at Ft. Bragg, North Carolina, and confirmed the deployment of the USS Gerald R. Ford. When asked about pressing for the ousting of Iran's Islamic clerical rule, Trump stated, "It seems like that would be the best thing that could happen. For 47 years, they’ve been talking and talking and talking."
While the president had recently prioritized Iran scaling back its nuclear program, he indicated on Friday that this was only one aspect of the concessions the US demands.
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who recently met Trump in Washington, has advocated for any deal to include steps to neutralize Iran's ballistic missile program and end its funding for proxy groups like Hamas and Hezbollah.
Trump remarked that targeting Tehran's nuclear program, which suffered setbacks in US military strikes last year, "If we do it, that would be the least of the mission." Iran maintains its nuclear program is for peaceful purposes, though it had been enriching uranium up to 60 per cent purity before a conflict in June.
The USS Gerald R. Ford, the world's largest aircraft carrier, is being dispatched from the Caribbean Sea to the Middle East to bolster other warships and military assets already in the region. This deployment follows days after Trump hinted at another round of talks with Iran, which did not materialise despite Tehran's security officials exchanging messages with US intermediaries in Oman and Qatar. "In case we don’t make a deal, we’ll need it," Trump told reporters regarding the second carrier, adding, "It’ll be leaving very soon."
Gulf Arab nations have cautioned that any attack could ignite another regional conflict in a Middle East still grappling with the Israel-Hamas war. Internally, Iranians are observing 40-day mourning ceremonies for those killed in a bloody crackdown on nationwide protests last month, intensifying pressure on the sanctions-battered Islamic Republic.
The Ford will join the USS Abraham Lincoln and its accompanying guided-missile destroyers, which have been in the region for over two weeks. US forces recently shot down an Iranian drone that approached the Lincoln, on the same day Iran attempted to stop a US-flagged ship in the Strait of Hormuz.
Despite the military build-up, Trump offered measured hope for a deal, stating: "Give us the deal that they should have given us the first time. If they give us the right deal, we won’t do that."
The Ford's new assignment marks a swift turnaround, having been sent from the Mediterranean to the Caribbean last October as part of a military presence leading to the capture of then-Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro. This move appears to contradict the administration’s national security strategy, which emphasises the Western Hemisphere. US Southern Command affirmed its forces would continue to "counter illicit activities and malign actors in the Western Hemisphere," with spokesperson Col. Emanuel Ortiz stating, "While force posture evolves, our operational capability does not."
The Ford strike group will add over 5,000 troops to the Middle East, effectively doubling the available aircraft and munitions for military planners. Given its current position, it will likely take weeks for the Ford to reach the coast of Iran. Mr Trump has repeatedly threatened force to compel Iran to constrain its nuclear programme and over its crackdown on protests. Indirect talks in Oman a week ago failed, with Mr Trump warning Tehran that failure to agree would be "very traumatic." Similar talks last year broke down, leading to a 12-day war and US bombing of Iranian nuclear sites. Asked about new negotiations, Trump said: "I think they’ll be successful. And if they’re not, it’s going to be a bad day for Iran, very bad."
The USS Ford, which first set sail in late June 2025, means its crew will soon have been deployed for eight months. While the duration of its Middle East stay is unclear, this move suggests an unusually long deployment. The Navy’s top officer, Adm. Daryl Caudle, previously stated that extending the Ford’s time at sea would be "highly disruptive" and that he was "a big non-fan of extensions."
Carriers typically deploy for six or seven months. Adm. Caudle noted that exceeding this "disrupts lives, it disrupts things ... funerals that were planned, marriages that were planned, babies that were planned." He added that extending the Ford would complicate maintenance and upkeep, disrupting repair schedules and increasing wear and tear. For comparison, the USS Dwight D. Eisenhower’s nine-month deployment to the Middle East in 2023 and 2024, engaging Houthi rebels, led to it blowing past its scheduled maintenance completion date. Adm. Caudle has expressed a preference for deploying smaller, newer ships over consistently relying on large aircraft carriers.

US will send second aircraft carrier to Middle East ‘very soon’: Trump
Trump says he believes negotiations with Iran will be ‘successful’ as he confirms USS Gerald R Ford deployment.
Trump orders second aircraft carrier to Middle East
President Donald Trump says that he is sending a second aircraft carrier to the Middle East as the United States increases pressure on Iran over its nuclear and ballistic missile programmes.
Speaking at the White House on Friday, Trump confirmed that the USS Gerald R Ford would be leaving the Caribbean for the Middle East “very soon” as tensions remain high following indirect talks in Oman last week.

“If we need it, we’ll have it ready, a very big force,” said Trump, adding that he believed negotiations would be “successful” while warning it would be a “bad day for Iran” if the country failed to make a deal.
Later, Trump said a change of government in Iran would be the “best thing that could happen”.
“For 47 years, they’ve been talking and talking and talking. In the meantime, we’ve lost a lot of lives,” he said, in an apparent reference to Tehran’s crackdown on recent antigovernment protests that left thousands dead.
The imminent departure of the Gerald R Ford is part of an ongoing buildup of military hardware in the region, with the Abraham Lincoln carrier, several guided-missile destroyers, fighter jets and surveillance aircraft sent in recent weeks.
Trump’s comments come days after he met Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in Washington, with the latter saying a “good deal” was expected while voicing reservations if any agreement did not also curb Iran’s ballistic missile programme. Tehran has publicly rejected US pressure to discuss the missiles.
Netanyahu has repeatedly called for further military action since Israel’s 12-day war against Iran in June, which the US briefly joined by attacking three Iranian nuclear sites, in a military operation dubbed “Midnight Hammer”.
Trump at the time said the US attacks had “totally obliterated” the nuclear facilities.
The indirect US-Iran talks were the first to be held since the June conflict, which halted previous rounds of negotiations between Tehran and Washington over potentially replacing the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), which Trump ditched during his first term in office.
Risk of escalation
The JCPOA, a deal reached between Iran, the US and several European powers, saw Tehran curtail its nuclear programme in exchange for sanctions relief.
Following Trump’s unilateral withdrawal in 2018, Tehran subsequently began enriching uranium beyond the limits set out in the agreement, though it has repeatedly denied Western claims it is seeking a nuclear weapon.
Upon taking office for a second time in January, Trump initially sought a new nuclear deal with Iran, but soon adopted a zero-enrichment policy long dismissed by Iranian negotiators as a non-starter.
As the latest attempts at negotiations continue, United Nations nuclear watchdog chief Rafael Grossi has had trouble getting Iran to agree on inspections of sites targeted in the 12-day war.
Grossi, who heads the International Atomic Energy Agency, told the Munich Security Conference that inspectors had returned to Iran after the 12-day war but had not been able to visit any of the sites targeted.
Grossi said dialogue with Iran since the inspectors’ return last year had been “imperfect and complicated and extremely difficult, but it’s there”.
The US president’s comments on Friday confirm his earlier indication that he was considering sending the Gerald R Ford, which has a nuclear reactor on board and can hold more than 75 military aircraft, to the region.
Gulf Arab nations have warned any attack could escalate into another regional conflict in a region still reeling from Israel’s genocidal war on Gaza.

Azerbaijan's Aliyev says peace treaty possible 'very next day’ if Armenia amends constitution
President Ilham Aliyev says while peace is de facto achieved following Washington summit, formal signing requires removal of territorial claims from Yerevan's basic law
ISTANBUL
Azerbaijani President Ilham Aliyev said Friday in Germany that Baku is prepared to sign a final peace treaty with Armenia "the very next day" once Yerevan implements constitutional changes to remove territorial claims against Azerbaijan.
"Our position has been communicated to the Armenian side for many years: the necessary amendments must be made to the Armenian Constitution," Aliyev told Azerbaijani journalists on the sidelines of the Munich Security Conference. "Once these amendments are adopted, we can sign a peace treaty the very next day."
The Azerbaijani leader emphasized that peace has already been effectively established following a Washington summit held last August.
He noted that the initialing of the peace treaty and the signing of the Joint Declaration under the mediation of US President Donald Trump signify a de facto end to the decades-long conflict.
Aliyev also clarified that the formal conclusion of the process depends entirely on Armenia's internal legal steps.
He reiterated that Baku does not view the requirement as interference in domestic affairs, but as a necessary measure to ensure that no future Armenian government can revive claims about Azerbaijani territory.

A Slovak fugitive was arrested after 16 years on the run — at the Winter Olympics. The 44-year-old man, whose name was not released, had traveled to Milan to cheer on Slovakia’s national ice hockey team at the Milan-Cortina Winter Games. Instead, he was taken into custody.
The man was wanted by Italian authorities for a series of thefts committed in 2010. Italy’s Carabinieri police located and arrested him Wednesday after he checked into a campsite on the outskirts of Milan. The arrest was triggered by an automatic alert sent from the campsite’s reception desk.
Police said he was transferred to San Vittore prison in the northern Italian city to serve an 11-month sentence previously imposed on him.
As a result, he missed Slovakia’s opening game, a 4-1 victory over Finland. The Slovaks also won their second group-stage match Friday, defeating host Italy 3-2.
The two victories secured Slovakia’s place in the quarterfinals, keeping alive its hopes of winning a second consecutive medal after taking bronze in Beijing in 2022. If that happens, the fugitive will have to follow the achievement from prison rather than from the stands.

Palestinian foreign minister urges Germany, Finland to recognize Palestine
Varsen Aghabekian Shaheen says recognition key to two-state solution, lasting peace
ISTANBUL
Palestinian Foreign Minister Varsen Aghabekian Shaheen urged Germany and Finland on Friday to recognize the state of Palestine, according to a statement from the Palestinian Foreign Ministry.
Shaheen held separate meetings with Finnish Foreign Minister Elina Valtonen and German Minister for Economic Cooperation and Development Reem Alabali‑Radovan on the sidelines of the Munich Security Conference.
Shaheen stressed that recognition of Palestine would represent essential support for the “rules-based international order and contribute to realizing the two-state solution and a just and lasting peace.”
The talks addressed developments in the political and humanitarian situation in Palestine, and ways to strengthen bilateral cooperation.
Discussions also covered Europe’s role in supporting efforts to achieve peace through ending the occupation in accordance with international law and UN resolutions within the framework of a two-state solution, the ministry said.

WASHINGTON, February 14. /TASS/. The US government plans to introduce antidumping duties of 132.83% on palladium imports from Russia, according to Sibanye-Stillwater, a company that earlier requested the US government to take measures against Russian palladium imports.
According to the statement, the US Department of Commerce has issued "a preliminary affirmative determination" which "references antidumping duty rates of 132.83% on imports of unwrought palladium from Russia, which is effective upon the decision’s publication in the Federal Register, which could occur as early as next week."
"This tariff is subject to final determinations by the International Trade Commission (ITC) and Commerce, which are expected to be completed in June 2026. The duties are expected to act as a deterrent to Russian palladium imports entering the US market," the statement reads.

Emirates says last scheduled Algeria flight is Feb. 3, 2027, after Algiers moves to end air pact
Airline says services to, from Algeria continue as scheduled, following Algiers’ move to end air services agreement
ISTANBUL
Emirates said Friday that its last scheduled flight from Algeria is set for Feb. 3, 2027, and operations between the two countries are continuing normally for the time being.
The state-owned carrier said flights to and from Algeria are operating according to approved schedules, with no immediate effect on services.
It advised customers with bookings to proceed with their travel plans as planned, following Algeria’s decision last week to begin procedures to suspend air services between the two countries.
Emirates said it would “fully comply with any directives issued by relevant authorities and would keep customers, staff and partners informed of any changes should the situation evolve.”
The airline said the last flight currently on its schedule is EK757, departing Algeria on Feb. 3, 2027. It apologized for any inconvenience and urged customers whose travel plans may be affected from that date to consider alternative arrangements through their booking agents.
The General Civil Aviation Authority said about a week ago that there would be “no immediate impact” on flights after Algeria announced steps to cancel the bilateral air services agreement.
The authority said it received formal “notification” from Algeria and noted that “the measure follows procedures set out in international agreements,” adding that operations would continue during the legally defined notice period.
Algeria’s state news agency APS said the air services agreement was signed in Abu Dhabi on May 13, 2013, and ratified by presidential decree on Dec. 30, 2014. Algerian authorities did not disclose reasons for the decision.
Under Article 22 of the agreement, either side must notify the other of termination through diplomatic channels, while also informing the secretary-general of the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO).
The agreement allows aviation authorities on both sides to designate one or more carriers to operate agreed routes and provides for suspension or cancellation of operating licenses in case of violations of applicable laws and regulations.

UK PM Starmer urges closer collaboration with Europe on defence
Sign up now: Get ST's newsletters delivered to your inbox
LONDON, Feb 13 - Britain is ready to work more closely with Europe on defence in order to reduce NATO's overreliance on the United States, Prime Minister Keir Starmer will say on Saturday, calling for more integration in Europe's defence industry.
U.S. President Donald Trump has strained the unity of the NATO defence alliance with his desire to acquire Greenland from Denmark, a NATO member. Trump has also consistently called on Europe to spend more on defence.
Addressing the Munich Security Conference, Starmer will say the U.S. is an indispensable ally that has made an unparalleled contribution to Europe's security, but a more European NATO will help the continent shift from overdependence on Washington.
"I'm talking about a vision of European security and greater European autonomy, that does not herald U.S. withdrawal but answers the call for more burden-sharing in full, and remakes the ties that have served us so well," Starmer will say, according to speech extracts released by his office.
He will call for a new approach to defence procurement to avoid unnecessary duplication in the continent's defence industrial base, saying that the current fragmentation meant that Europe was a "sleeping giant".
Starmer has attempted to reset ties with the European Union since coming to office in 2024, four years after Britain exited the EU, and has also taken a leading role in coordinating European support for Ukraine against Russia's invasion.
However, talks for Britain to join the EU's SAFE defence fund broke down last year. Starmer has said that he is open to joining a new version of SAFE, and is looking at other ways to work more closely with Europe on defence.
The Labour Party leader came to office in the wake of successive Conservative governments whose approach to negotiations to take Britain out of the EU sometimes strained relations with Brussels.
Starmer will say that "we are not the Britain of the Brexit years anymore", according to the speech extracts, adding that to turn inward would surrender control of Britain's security.
"There is no British security without Europe, and no European security without Britain," the extracts said. REUTERS

Japan to revise national security strategy this year: Defense chief tells Munich Security Conference
Shinjiro Koizumi says countries surrounding Japan ‘continue opaque military build-up’
ISTANBUL
Japanese Defense Minister Shinjiro Koizumi told the Munich Security Conference on Friday that Tokyo will revise its national security strategy in 2026.
Koizumi said that the “security of the Indo-Pacific and the Euro-Atlantic is inseparable,” noting that Japan does not view the Ukraine war as a “distant European problem.”
“Countries surrounding Japan continue opaque military build-up, and the regional military balance has been greatly and rapidly evolving in the East and the South China Seas,” he said.
“Attempts to change the status quo by force persist in the Western and the Southern Pacific. Provocative military activities are intensifying,” he said.
“Japan itself will become stronger. We are committed to sustaining our efforts to fundamentally reinforce our defense capabilities and increase our defense spending.”
“With last year's supplementary budget, we achieved a level of defense spending at 2% of GDP ahead of the schedule, original schedule. Immediately after taking office last October, Prime Minister Takaichi directed an accelerated revision of Japan's national security strategy. Under her leadership, we will revise it within this year,” he added.
Mentioning that it is “an era of uncertainty where anything can happen,” he called for ensuring “peace and stability in the region.” He said Tokyo “will further strengthen the Japan-US alliance.”
“Let me be clear, Japan keeps the door to dialogue open at all times, even when fundamental differences in stance exist, indeed, precisely because of these differences, we maintain close communication and mutual exchanges, together with like-minded partners, Japan will fulfill its responsibilities to maintain an international order free from aggression,” he added.
Takaichi announced plans to raise defense spending and move toward revising Japan’s pacifist constitution, and has also called for reviews of the country’s three core security documents: the National Security Strategy, the National Defense Strategy and the Defense Buildup Program.

Kremlin amplifies narrative claiming Ukraine runs 'secret prisons' where Russian POWs are tortured
According to Ukrinform, the Center for Countering Disinformation under Ukraine's National Security and Defense Council announced this on Facebook.
In an interview with propagandists, Rodion Miroshnik, the Russian Foreign Ministry's special envoy on so-called "crimes of the Kyiv regime," claimed that "basements" and "secret prisons" allegedly exist where Russian POWs are tortured, including with "electric chairs," and that staged videos are produced.
"Russian propaganda has been injecting such stories into the information space since 2014. However, throughout this time, Russian claims about 'secret prisons' in Ukraine have remained nothing more than loud statements – they have received no confirmation whatsoever," the CCD said.
The Center stressed that these information attacks have an obvious goal: to discredit Ukraine and blur responsibility for Russia's war crimes.
Ukraine adheres to international humanitarian law in its treatment of prisoners of war. Representatives of international organizations have permanent access to detention facilities and have not recorded any violations.
By contrast, numerous documented cases of torture, cruel treatment, and total isolation of Ukrainian prisoners of war concern Russia, the Center said.

Anti-Muslim acts in France surge 88% in 2025 despite overall stable anti-religious incidents
Just under 2,500 anti-religious acts recorded nationwide in 2025, level similar to 2024, Interior Ministry says
ISTANBUL
Anti-Muslim acts in France surged 88% in 2025, marking the sharpest increase among all religious communities, even as the overall number of anti-religious incidents remained broadly stable, according to figures released by the Interior Ministry.
In total, just under 2,500 anti-religious acts were recorded nationwide in 2025, a level similar to 2024, the ministry said Thursday in its annual trends report.
But 326 anti-Muslim acts were registered last year, accounting for 13% of all anti-religious incidents. The ministry said the majority, 64%, involved physical or verbal assaults and online hate speech.
While antisemitic acts remained the largest share of incidents at 1,320 cases, or 53% of the total, they declined 16% compared to 2024. Anti-Christian acts rose 9% to 843 cases, representing 34% of the total.
The ministry stressed that the figures reflect recorded incidents and do not constitute official statistics, but provide an overall trend.
Security forces remain mobilized under the authority of local prefects, conducting patrols and fixed checks around sensitive sites, particularly during religious services and major holidays.
The ministry also highlighted financial support for securing religious sites, noting that nearly €48 million ($52 million) has been allocated in the past decade for measures such as video surveillance systems, reinforced doors and locks.
President Emmanuel Macron announced in January the launch of national and regional forums in the coming months to strengthen efforts to prevent and punish anti-religious acts, with the Interior Ministry tasked with coordinating the initiative.

United Staff for Gaza regrets European ministers' attacks on UN rapporteur
'We appeal for a rectification of these errors and call for an end to personal attacks, threats, and disinformation,' says statement
HAMILTON, Canada
United Staff for Gaza expressed "regret" Friday for attacks by France, Germany and other European countries against the UN special rapporteur, who monitors human rights in the Palestinian territories.
"United Staff for Gaza regrets that the French, German and other Foreign Ministers have, based on evident dis- and misinformation, levelled unwarranted accusations against the United Nations Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in the Palestinian Territory occupied since 1967, Francesca Albanese," a statement said.
The statement said the attacks came after Albanese delivered a pre-recorded speech Jan. 7 at the Al Jazeera Forum in Doha, Qatar.
Speaking on the situation in Palestinian territories, she highlighted "the commission of genocide of Palestinians and the ways in which the international community has, in her view, aided and abetted this genocide," and that the system enabling such crimes has shown itself to be "the common enemy of humanity."
Soon after, fake videos and images began circulating, falsely claiming Albanese said, "Israel is the common enemy of humanity."
On Feb. 10, French parliamentarians repeated the false claims in a letter to the French Foreign Minister Jean-Noel Barrot, urging sanctions against Albanese and asking for her removal from her UN mandate.
Germany, Austria, Italy and the Czech Republic also publicly condemned her remarks, though one Austrian minister later deleted a social media post, according to the statement.
Criticizing the ministers for accepting the distortions without verification, United Staff for Gaza said, "We express alarm that the French, German and other Foreign Ministers appear to have uncritically accepted as fact clear distortions of Special Rapporteur Albanese’s remarks. We encourage them to consider the evidence and retract their statements of condemnation."
The group also condemned "dis- and misinformation and other hostile actions" targeting Albanese, the International Criminal Court (ICC) and the UN agency for Palestinian refugees (UNRWA).
It noted that "the Special Rapporteur, as well as 11 ICC judges and prosecutors, have been sanctioned by the United States of America, and that UNRWA has been subjected, by the Government of Israel, to violence, obstruction, and rampant disinformation."
Calling for international support for Albanese, the ICC, and UNRWA, United Staff for Gaza urged all Human Rights Council members "to maintain their commitment to the integrity of the system of special procedures."
The group also stressed that "the international community must remain seized, and step up its condemnations of the relentlessly inhumane and illegal acts perpetrated by the Government of Israel against the Palestinian people," citing ongoing bombings in Gaza, restrictions on humanitarian aid, and forced displacement from the occupied West Bank.

Keir Starmer to call on UK and Europe to step up commitments to Nato

Keir Starmer will say the UK and Europe need to step up their commitments to Nato and avoid the risk of overdependence on the US for defence, as he sets out one of the main planks of his foreign policy vision on Saturday.
Speaking at the Munich Security Conference, the prime minister will warn against the idea of the UK turning inwards on security, instead calling for a focus on what he will call the “sleeping giant” of shared European defence capabilities.
The speech warns that voters will need to be primed to expect greater spending on defence, and to be told the reasons why, or face the “peddlers of easy answers” such as Reform UK and the Greens risking national security.
Downing Street officials stress that Starmer’s call is not being made over fears that the US is no longer committed to Nato, and is more a response to demands from Washington that European nations commit more to defence.
The speech will, however, be seen in the context of last year’s main US address to the conference in Germany, by Donald Trump’s vice-president, JD Vance. He used his speech to lambast European leaders for supposedly blocking free speech and being soft on migration, questioning whether such values were compatible with a US guarantee of mutual security.
Trump has regularly questioned the value of Nato, including the claim in January that European nations “stayed a little back, a little off the frontlines” while supporting US troops in Afghanistan, comments that prompted a rare direct rebuke from Starmer.
In extracts of the speech released in advance by No 10, Starmer said he was setting out “a vision of European security and greater European autonomy that does not herald US withdrawal, but answers the call for more burden-sharing in full, and remakes the ties that have served us so well”.
In another pushback against the politics of Brexit, he condemned UK politicians who would rather avoid ties with Europe, after the Conservatives expressed scepticism about some defence-based links.
“We are not the Britain of the Brexit years any more,” the speech says. “Because we know that, in dangerous times, we would not take control by turning inward – we would surrender it. And I won’t let that happen.
“There is no British security without Europe, and no European security without Britain. That is the lesson of history – and it is today’s reality too.”
Calling for better cooperation on defence procurement, the speech says the UK should help create a new era for the continent.
“As I see it – Europe is a sleeping giant. Our economies dwarf Russia’s, 10 times over,” Starmer will say.
“We have huge defence capabilities. Yet, too often, all of this has added up to less than the sum of its parts. Across Europe, fragmented industrial planning and long, drawn out procurement mechanisms have led to gaps in some areas – and massive duplication in others.”
Ministers must, he said, “level with the public and build consent for the decisions we will have to take to keep us all safe”.
The PM will go on: “Because, if we don’t, the peddlers of easy answers on the extreme left and the extreme right are ready. They will offer their solutions instead. It’s striking that the different ends of the spectrum share so much. Soft on Russia and weak on Nato – if not outright opposed.
“The future they offer is one of division and then capitulation. The lamps would go out across Europe once again. But we will not let that happen.”

Albanese says ‘no country is more important to Australia’ than Indonesia. Is this really true?

Albanese says ‘no country is more important to Australia’ than Indonesia. Is this really true?
Australia-Indonesia relations are the strongest in 30 years.
So says Anthony Albanese when he, repeatedly, evokes the days of Paul Keating and the late Indonesian leader Suharto, implicitly transposing that uniquely close bond of the mid-1990s to his own budding friendship with Indonesia’s modern-day hardman, Prabowo Subianto.
There is a basis for the prime minister’s enthusiasm. It is called the Treaty on Common Security, a vague agreement inked in Jakarta last week against the geopolitical backdrop of a rising, pugnacious China and a vengeful United States.
In the event of “adverse challenges”, the text says, both nations will “consider measures which might be taken either individually or jointly”. Albanese described it as “historic”. Prabowo couched it as “good neighbourliness”.
The view from some in Indonesia is that it doesn’t go much further than the Lombok Treaty of 2006 and the Defence Co-operation Agreement of 2024; that it was the Australians who wanted it to be called a treaty because it sizzles more than the word “agreement”.
Even so, Albanese has Prabowo engaged and looking south, which is a big deal for an Australian prime minister. Since 1999, when Australia supported East Timor’s independence, the bilateral relationship has been marked by periods of scandal, indifference and frustration.
“The government is right to say that bilateral relations with Indonesia are on a firmer footing than in the past,” says Susannah Patton, a South-East Asia expert at the Lowy Institute.
“What was previously a rollercoaster relationship has been stable for about the past 10 years, without a major crisis.”
But with two such vastly different neighbours and world outlooks, she says: “It’s inevitable that there will be downturns in future.”
Critics accuse Prabowo, an ex-special forces commander once blacklisted by the Americans for human rights abuses, of continuing his predecessor’s “democratic backsliding”.
Meanwhile, Transparency International’s latest corruption perceptions index, released on Tuesday, has Indonesia slipping 10 places since last year to 109th out of a total of 182 nations. None of this can trouble Albanese too much, however, or he would hardly be able to deal with any South-East Asian nation, not to mention the US.
Trade between the two nations is on the agenda and while it is improving, it’s hardly booming. Indonesia’s 290 million citizens are right next door, yet it has only just broken into Australia’s top-10 two-way partners.
Indonesia’s economic fortunes are rising with a bullet. Over the next 15 years or so, it is predicted to rise from being the world’s 17th biggest economy to the top five.
Echoing Keating, Albanese, in his post-signing statement last week, went again to the mantra that “No country is more important to Australia”.
But is this really true? Professor Marcus Mietzner, from the ANU, says it’s not borne out in the statistics.
“Under the surface of the enthusiastic rhetoric, the economic relationship remains structurally underdeveloped,” he says. Indonesia literacy in Australia is the lowest in decades, he says.
“Albanese and Prabowo are both doing a good job in upholding the day-to-day and ceremonial side of the relationship, and they deserve credit for that.
“But the fundamentals – that is, where money is spent and on what – are best reflected in trade, investment and the core of defence relations, which for Australia remains intertwined with the US, not Indonesia.”
The signing comes months after Australia formalised the Pukpuk Treaty – a mutual defence pact – with Papua New Guinea, which, though unlikely, could cause problems with Indonesia.
The simmering conflict between the Indonesian military and separatists just over the porous PNG border spilled into public view just this week when Free Papua Movement rebels attacked a convoy of miner PT Freeport, killing an Indonesian soldier, according to the Indonesian government.
Separately, an Indonesian pilot and a co-pilot were chased into the forest and killed by unknown gunmen this week in Papua only about 100 kilometres from Australia’s newest ally. It is conceivable that clashes involving the Indonesian military could spill into PNG.
Asked about such a scenario at his press conference in Jakarta last week, Albanese deflected, saying Australia respected both Indonesia’s and PNG’s sovereignties.
In some ways, we won’t really know the value of the treaty until there is a crisis.Susannah Patton, South-East Asia expert at the Lowy Institute
The trip to the palace was Albanese’s second since Prabowo’s inauguration in October 2024 and the welcoming ceremony was another grand and expensive gesture reflective of the leaders’ rapport.
Prabowo has what seems a genuine affection for Australia. As a young man, he trained at Duntroon in Canberra. He talks about Australian wharfies’ 1945 boycott of Dutch ships during Indonesia’s fight for independence.
When he was in Sydney last year, Indonesian media were tickled by the fact that he called his Australian counterpart “Albo”.
Still, Australia perhaps should not feel too special about the love. Unlike the previous president Joko Widodo, Prabowo is a globe-trotter testing the limits of Indonesia’s tradition of non-alignment. He likes the line, “1000 friends are too few, and one enemy is too many”, and he has been cultivating deeper ties with nations such as Russia and China at the same time as Australia.
The friend Prabowo really wants to add to his list, however, is Donald Trump. After more than a year trying to curry favour with the US president, and with a tariff deal hanging over his head, Prabowo joined Indonesia to Trump’s Board of Peace, causing problems at home from powerful Islamist groups who view the initiative as a means to Israel’s ends in Gaza.
This week, Indonesia said it could send as many as 8000 peacekeeping troops to Gaza, the only country so far to put forward a number since the board’s formation last month. Prabowo will attend its first meeting in Washington, DC, on February 19. Maybe he’ll finally get his sit-down with Trump.
Prabowo’s relationship with Albanese sits within his broader push to raise Indonesia’s heft to a level befitting the third-largest democracy in the world.
Exactly how the new treaty with Australia, which is not an alliance, might play out in real-world scenarios is not spelled out in the text. This is intentional so that neither country is locked into a move it regrets.
Patton, from Lowy, says it has a “brittle foundation” on the Indonesian side because it comes top-down from Prabowo (as is his style) and lacks strong buy-in from the bureaucracy.
“That could limit efforts to use the treaty to catalyse other co-operation, but it’s still better to have the agreement than not,” she says.
If there were crises over Taiwan or in the South China Sea, she says, Australia could argue it should be at the front of the queue with Indonesia to discuss a common response.
“I think that’s an important consideration, even if we accept that Indonesia is unlikely to respond the same way to these crises as Australia … because there is a risk that Indonesia could make decisions that would be adverse to Australian or US interests,” she says.
“In some ways, we won’t really know the value of the treaty until there is a crisis”.
Thrown together by geography and timing, the lefty raised by a single mum in Sydney council flats and the lectern-thumping military man are solid. At least for now.

Hollywood shaken by Brad Pitt-Tom Cruise fight video made with Chinese AI: ‘over for us’
The viral clip was generated with a two-line prompt on Seedance 2.0, a platform owned by ByteDance, the company behind TikTok
A viral AI-generated video of Brad Pitt and Tom Cruise fighting atop a building is causing a stir online.
The 15-second video comes from the latest AI video-generation platform, Seedance 2.0. The platform was launched this week by its owner, ByteDance, the same Chinese parent that oversees TikTok.
As the video circulates online, the Motion Picture Association and other industry stakeholders have called out the video for its unauthorised use of copyrighted works.
MPA’s CEO, Charles Rivkin, wrote in a statement that the company “should immediately cease its infringing activity”.
“In a single day, the Chinese AI service Seedance 2.0 has engaged in unauthorised use of US copyrighted works on a massive scale,” Rivkin said.
“By launching a service that operates without meaningful safeguards against infringement, ByteDance is disregarding well-established copyright law that protects the rights of creators and underpins millions of American jobs.”

US Justice Department sues Harvard over alleged failure to provide admissions data
'Harvard has failed to disclose the data we need to ensure that its admissions are free of discrimination,' says Attorney General Bondi
WASHINGTON
The US Justice Department on Friday filed a lawsuit against Harvard University accusing it of unlawfully withholding admissions data needed to determine whether it was complying with federal civil rights law following a 2023Supreme Court’s ruling.
“Under President Trump’s leadership, this Department of Justice is demanding better from our nation’s educational institutions,” Attorney General Pam Bondi said in a statement.
"Harvard has failed to disclose the data we need to ensure that its admissions are free of discrimination — we will continue fighting to put merit over DEI (diversity, equity and inclusion)" across America."
According to the complaint, Harvard violated Title VI of the Civil Rights Act by failing to comply with document production requests tied to a compliance review.
The suit alleges that the university “slow-walked” its responses, declined to produce pertinent materials, and failed to provide timely access to applicant-level admissions data.
Harvard has not yet publicly responded to the filing.

Syria appoints governor for Hasakah province under SDF deal
Nour al-Din Ahmad Issa named governor in presidential decree
ISTANBUL
Syrian President Ahmad al-Sharaa issued a presidential decree appointing a governor for Hasakah province.
The Syrian Arab News Agency (SANA) said Nour al-Din Ahmad Issa was appointed governor of the northeastern province.
His appointment comes under a Jan. 18 comprehensive ceasefire and full integration agreement between the Syrian government and the YPG/SDF terrorist organization, outlining sweeping measures to restore state authority in the northeast.
The deal also stipulates the naming of a governor for Hasakah by presidential decree to guarantee political participation and local representation.
Syrian security forces and administrative bodies have entered areas previously controlled by the SDF, including Hasakah, Qamishli and Ayn al-Arab (Kobani), as well as strategic facilities such as airports, oil fields and border crossings.
The agreement provides for the gradual handover of security responsibilities, the deployment of state institutions and the integration of SDF forces into official government structures.
On Jan. 16, Sharaa issued a decree affirming that Syrian Kurds are an integral part of the Syrian people, and their cultural and linguistic identity forms a core component of the country’s unified national identity.
The Syrian Army launched an operation against the SDF on Jan. 16 in areas west of the Euphrates River. The operation later expanded east of the river with the participation of tribal forces, leading to all of the territories previously occupied by the group coming under government control.

Trump hints at Caracas visit as Washington lifts Venezuela oil sanctions

US President Donald Trump said Friday he planned to visit Venezuela and reiterated satisfaction with its interim leader, as his administration authorised five major oil companies to operate in the country.
"I'm going to make a visit to Venezuela," Trump told reporters Friday, while adding that the date had not been decided.
The comments followed a visit to Caracas by Trump's energy secretary earlier this week and came as his administration cleared away additional US sanctions that have blocked oil industry investment in the South American country.
On Friday, the Treasury Department's Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) granted general licenses to BP, Chevron, Eni, Repsol and Shell "authorising transactions related to oil or gas sector operations in Venezuela," with certain conditions.
The oil industry has expressed interest in the petroleum-rich country, while cautioning that the timeframe for investment depended on having clear rules after expropriations by earlier governments.
The two-page general license issued by OFAC requires that any payments in oil and gas royalties go to accounts designated by the US Treasury Department, which is consistent with Trump administration statements that Washington will manage assets in custody for the benefit of Venezuela.
Trump and top appointees like Energy Secretary Chris Wright have been blunt in characterizing Washington as a party controlling Venezuela's oil resources for the foreseeable future.
A second OFAC license issued Friday permits companies to negotiate for potential contracts "for certain investment in Venezuela." However, the US agency will continue to bar participation by several countries, including China, Iran and Russia.
"These general licenses invite American and other aligned companies to play a constructive role in supporting economic recovery and responsible investment," said a Trump administration media note that characterized the OFAC move as part of Trump's commitment to "rapidly" reopen the oil industry.
"The United States is committed to restoring Venezuela's prosperity, safety, and security for the benefit of both the American and Venezuelan people."
Separately, the State Department announced Friday that it has sent more than six tons of medical supplies to Venezuela “to help stabilise the country.”
An 'important step'
On Wednesday, Wright became the highest-ranking US official to visit the country since Trump ordered the seizure of Venezuelan leader Nicolas Maduro on January 3 on allegations of drug trafficking and other crimes.
Wright met with interim leader Delcy Rodriguez, who has won high praise from the Trump administration for her cooperation thus far, which has included a quick passage of legal reforms to the Venezuelan oil sector.
Wright said Wednesday that the US oil embargo on Venezuela, in place since 2019, was "essentially over."
Wright called for a "dramatic increase" in Venezuela's production of oil, natural gas and electricity which would improve "the job opportunities, the wages and the quality of life" of all Venezuelans.
"We welcome the recent actions by the Administration," said a spokesperson for Chevron, which has been the only US company to remain in Venezuela after departures by ExxonMobil and ConocoPhillips.
"The new General Licenses, coupled with recent changes in Venezuela's Hydrocarbons Law, are important steps toward enabling the further development of Venezuela’s resources for its people and for advancing regional energy security."
Eni is "currently assessing the opportunities it opens up, as part of an ongoing and constructive dialogue with the US Authorities," the Italian company told AFP.
Repsol declined to comment.
Venezuela produced 1.2 million oil barrels per day in 2025 -- up from a historic low of about 360,000 in 2020 -- but still far from the 3.0 million bpd it was pumping 25 years ago.

Ilia Malinin misses Olympic podium after falls in free skate

Ilia Malinin misses Olympic medal after falling in free skate, finishes in 8th place
In a shocking twist at the 2026 Winter Olympics, American figure skater Ilia Malinin didn't make it to the podium on Friday, failing to medal after falling twice during the free skate. Kazakhstan's Mikhail Shaidorov took home the gold.
Malinin, known as the "Quad God" for his talent at quadruple jumps, looked visibly emotional after his skate.
The 21-year-old, who led by a comfortable margin after the short program, merely had to deliver a mediocre performance to add individual gold to the gold medal he won in the team event. Instead, he was trying to fight back tears after one of the worst nights of his career, one that left a star-packed crowd inside Milano Ice Arena sitting in stunned silence.
Shaidorov finished with a career-best 291.58 points to give his nation its first gold medal of the Winter Games, while Yuma Kagiyama earned his second consecutive Olympic silver medal and Japanese teammate Shun Sato took bronze.
Then there was Malinin, who fell all the way to eighth place. He finished with 264.49 points, ending a two-plus-year unbeaten streak that covered 14 full competitions, including the past two world championships that he won with ease.
"Honestly, yeah, I was not expecting that," he said. "I felt going into this competition I was so ready. I just felt ready going on that ice. I think maybe that might have been the reason, is I was too confident it was going to go well."
Much of Malinin's journey in Milan had felt a little bit off.
He was beaten by Kagiyama in the short program of the team event, later acknowledging that the pressure of competing in the Olympics had started to get to him. And he still wasn't quite his dominant self despite a head-to-head win against Sato in the team free skate, which clinched the second consecutive gold medal for the Americans in the event.
But by the time of his individual short program Tuesday night, Malinin's fearless swagger and unrivaled spunk was back. He took a five-point lead over Kagiyama and Adam Siao Him Fa of France that seemed insurmountable going into Friday night.
Malinin decided to practice early in the day at U.S. Figure Skating's alternate training base in Bergamo, just outside Milan, allowing him to escape the Olympic bubble and avoid having to sit in the arena all night. And he was the picture of calm throughout his warmup, never once falling in all of his practice jumps while wearing his glittering black and gold ensemble.
Then came a performance that might well haunt Malinin for the rest of his career.
He opened with a quad flip, one of a record-tying seven in his planned program, then appeared to be going after the quad axel only he has ever landed in competition, but had to bail out. He recovered to land a quad lutz — and then the problems really began.
Malinin only did a double instead of a planned quad loop, throwing his timing off. He fell on a quad lutz, preventing him from doing the second half of the quad lutz-triple toe loop combination that would have earned him big points. And in his final jumping pass, which was supposed to be a high-scoring quad salchow-triple axel, Malinin only could muster a double salchow — and he fell on that.
By the time the music stopped, Malinin was left trying to mask the sorrow for a crowd that included Nathan Chen, the 2022 Olympic champion; seven-time Olympic gold medal gymnast Simone Biles, and actor Jeff Goldblum and his wife, Emilie.
Shaidorov was just as shocked as everyone as the realization hit that he had won the gold medal.

Telegram could face total block in Russia, says senior senator
Move follows warnings that all platforms must comply with national laws to avoid potential restrictions by Roskomnadzor
ISTANBUL
A senior Russian lawmaker warned on Friday that the Telegram messaging app could be completely blocked in Russia if it fails to comply with legislative requirements.
"Telegram is a very high-quality platform, and I use it actively myself," Andrey Klishas, the head of the Federation Council Committee on Constitutional Legislation and State Building, told Sputnik Radio.
But he emphasized that all digital platforms operating within the country must adhere to Russian laws, noting that "Telegram is no exception."
Klishas stated that any final decision regarding the status of the app rests with the state communications regulator, suggesting that the public should "wait for the decision of Roskomnadzor," -- the agency responsible for regulating media and communications.
The warning comes as Russian authorities intensify a crackdown on foreign communication tools, having recently restricted WhatsApp after its parent company, Meta, allegedly refused to follow the "norm and letter of Russian law."
In response to the WhatsApp block, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov urged citizens to transition to "Max," a state-developed national messenger that has been mandatory on new devices since 2025.
While Telegram remains a critical tool for communication, including military use, it has faced mounting pressure from Roskomnadzor for data localization and anti-terrorism regulations.
Telegram founder Pavel Durov previously claimed that the restrictions are an attempt to force users onto state-monitored platforms, echoing similar concerns from Meta on political censorship.

Trump says regime change may be ‘best thing’ as US bolsters forces against Iran

The president of the United States is again threatening Iran’s leaders as the Pentagon continues building up forces in the Middle East and preparing for possible war if no agreement is reached. On Friday, when asked about regime change, President Donald Trump said it “would be the best thing that could happen”, arguing that Iran’s leaders have spent 47 years “talking and talking and talking. In the meantime, we’ve lost a lot of lives while they talk.”
At the same time, two senior U.S. officials told Reuters that the U.S. military is preparing for a prolonged operation in Iran that could last weeks if Trump orders a strike. They said that unlike Operation Midnight Hammer, which targeted only Iran’s nuclear facilities, current planning is more complex. One official said an extended campaign could include strikes on Iranian government facilities in addition to security targets and nuclear sites, and noted that Washington expects Tehran to respond, potentially triggering a period of reciprocal retaliation.
Asked at the end of a visit to Fort Bragg in North Carolina what could prevent a strike, Trump said it would require Iran to agree to the deal he believes it should have accepted from the outset. If such an agreement is reached, he said, there would be no attack, but he added that historically Iran has not followed through. He expressed hope that Tehran would engage seriously, arguing that so far it has talked extensively without taking meaningful action.
Earlier, Trump discussed his decision to deploy a second aircraft carrier to the region — the USS Gerald R. Ford, the world’s largest — which is expected to arrive within four weeks from the Caribbean and join the USS Abraham Lincoln already in the Middle East.
He said the United States had sent a major carrier toward Iran and that he would prefer to see Tehran reach an agreement. At the same time, he acknowledged that negotiating with Iran is difficult, noting that he believed a deal had been close previously before the launch of Operation Midnight Hammer. He said the United States has since restored its strength and projected significant power, adding that at times creating a sense of deterrence or fear is necessary to resolve such confrontations.
When Trump threatened last month to strike Iran if its leaders did not agree to curb the nuclear program, the Pentagon was in a relatively weak position to back him. More than 30,000 U.S. troops stationed in the Middle East, including at eight permanent bases, lacked sufficient air defense systems to protect against an expected Iranian retaliation.
Additional fighter jets required for the broad operation Trump described were stationed at U.S. bases in Europe and the United States. According to three senior U.S. officials who spoke to The New York Times, national security officials persuaded Trump to wait while the Pentagon rebuilt its capacity to attack — and, more importantly, to defend — in 11 countries that could be exposed to an Iranian response.
Over the past three weeks, as talks between Iran and the United States have begun, the Pentagon has been preparing for war. The deployed platforms include not only offensive capabilities but defensive ones, amid assessments that Iran would retaliate. Senior administration officials said Trump has not yet decided whether to strike Iran.
According to the officials, the options under consideration include military action against Iran’s nuclear program and its ballistic missile capabilities. Trump is also weighing the possibility of deploying U.S. commandos to strike specific military targets in Iran. “But before the Pentagon can do that, it needs to be more prepared,” the officials said.
That preparation includes deploying air defense systems at bases hosting U.S. forces in the region — not only at Al Udeid Air Base in Qatar, which Iran targeted last year in response to Operation Midnight Hammer, the U.S. strikes on nuclear facilities in Fordo, Natanz and Isfahan — but also at bases in Iraq, Bahrain, Kuwait and Jordan.
The USS Abraham Lincoln, accompanied by three warships equipped with Tomahawk missiles, is at the center of a naval force of 12 vessels in the region. F-35 stealth fighters and F/A-18 strike aircraft aboard the carrier are within range of targets in Iran. The United States has also sent more than a dozen F-15E fighter jets to the area.
B-2 bombers — the aircraft that struck nuclear sites during the war — and other long-range bombers based in the United States are on higher-than-usual alert after the Pentagon raised readiness levels when Trump requested response options to Iran’s violent suppression of protests.
Military experts note that early signs of major operations include the number of aerial refueling aircraft and EA-18 Growler electronic warfare planes in the region. Such aircraft are aboard the Lincoln, and U.S. Central Command recently deployed several to a base in Jordan. Flight tracking data indicate that the United States is also moving additional aircraft — including tankers and reconnaissance planes — closer to the Middle East.
Another sign of serious offensive planning would be if the U.S. Navy moves a ballistic missile submarine from the Mediterranean to the Red Sea or, more likely, the Arabian Sea, where it would be positioned to strike targets in Iran.
In addition to offensive assets, the Pentagon is deploying Patriot and THAAD air defense systems to the region to help protect U.S. forces from Iranian missiles.

Scientists believe Mars was originally warm and wet not icy, contrasting old data
One might not imagine such a time being conducive to the existence of fragile lifeforms, yet it is likely to be the era in which Mars was most habitable
- Bookmark
- CommentsGo to comments
A recent study showed that Mars was warm and wet billions of years ago. The finding contrasts with another theory that this era was mainly cold and icy. The result has implications for the idea that life could have developed on the planet at this time.
Whether Mars was once habitable is a fascinating and intensely researched topic of interest over many decades. Mars, like the Earth, is about 4.5 billion years old and its geological history is divided into different epochs of time.
The latest paper relates to Mars during a time called the Noachian epoch, which extended from about 4.1 to 3.7 billion years ago. This was during a stage in solar system history called the Late Heavy Bombardment (LHB). Evidence for truly cataclysmic meteorite impacts during the LHB are found on many bodies throughout the solar system.
Two obvious scars from this era on Mars are the enormous Hellas and Argyre impact basins; both are well over a thousand miles across and each possesses enough volume to hold all the water in the Mediterranean with room to spare.
One might not imagine such a time being conducive to the existence of fragile lifeforms, yet it is likely to be the era in which Mars was most habitable. Evidence of landforms sculpted by water from this time is plentiful and include dried-up river valleys, lake beds, ancient coastlines and river deltas.
The prevailing climatic conditions of the Noachian are still a matter of intense debate. Two alternative scenarios are typically posited: that this time was cold and icy, with occasional melting of large volumes of frozen water by meteorite impact and volcanic eruptions, or that it was warm, wet and largely ice-free.
Brightening Sun
All stars, including the Sun, brighten with age. In the early solar system, during the Noachian, the Sun was about 30% dimmer than it is today, so less heat was reaching Mars (and all the planets). To sustain a warm, wet climate at this time, the Martian atmosphere would have needed to be very substantial – much thicker than it is today – and abundant in greenhouse gases like CO2.
But when reaching high enough atmospheric pressure, CO2 tends to condense out of the air to form clouds and reduce the greenhouse effect. Given these issues, the cold, icy scenario is perhaps more believable.
One of the main science goals of the Mars 2020 Perseverance Rover, which landed spectacularly in February 2021, is to seek evidence to support either of these two scenarios, and the new paper using data from Perseverance may have done just that.
Perseverance landed at the Martian location of Jezero crater, which was selected as the landing site because it once contained a lake. Views of the crater from orbit show several distinct fan-shaped deposits emanating from channels carved through the crater walls by flowing water. Within these channels are abundant deposits of clay minerals.
The new paper details recent analysis of aluminium-rich clay pebbles, called kaolinite, located within one of the ancient flow channels. The pebbles appear to have been subjected to intense weathering and chemical alteration by water during the Noachian.
While this is perhaps not surprising for a known ancient watery environment, what is interesting is that these clays are strongly depleted in iron and magnesium, and enriched in titanium and aluminium.
This is important because it means these rocks were less likely to have been altered in a hydrothermal environment, where scalding hot water was temporarily released by melting ice caused by volcanism or a meteorite impact.
Instead, they appear to have been altered under modest temperatures and persistent heavy rainfall. The authors found distinct similarities between the chemical composition of these clay pebbles with similar clays found on Earth dating from periods in our planet’s history when the climate was much warmer and wetter.
The paper concludes that these kaolinite pebbles were altered under high rainfall conditions comparable to “past greenhouse climates on Earth” and that they “likely represent some of the wettest intervals and possibly most habitable portions of Mars’ history”.
Furthermore, the paper concludes that these conditions may have persisted over time periods ranging from thousands to millions of years. Perseverance recently made headlines also for the discovery of possible biosignatures in samples it collected last year, also from within Jezero crater.
These precious samples have now been cached in special sealed containers on the rover for collection by a future Mars sample return mission. Unfortunately, the mission has recently been cancelled by Nasa and so what vital evidence they may or may not contain will probably not be examined in an Earth-based laboratory for many years.
Crucial to this future analysis is the so-called “Knoll criterion” – a concept formulated by astrobiologist Andrew Knoll, which states that for something to be evidence of life, an observation has to not just be explicable by biology; it has to be inexplicable without it. Whether these samples ever satisfy the Knoll criterion will only be known if they can be brought to Earth.
Either way, it is quite striking to imagine a time on Mars, billions of years before the first humans walked the Earth, that a tropical climate with – possibly – a living ecosystem once existed in the now desolate and wind-swept landscape of Jezero crater.

US boosts Middle East forces, keeps B-2 bombers on heightened alert amid Iran tensions: Report
Pentagon reinforces regional defenses as Trump weighs military options if diplomacy fails on Iran’s nuclear program
ISTANBUL
B-2 stealth bombers and other long-range US aircraft capable of striking Iran remain on higher-than-usual alert as the Pentagon continues to build military assets in the Middle East, The New York Times reported Friday.
Citing a senior US official who spoke on condition of anonymity, the report said the Pentagon heightened the alert status of the bombers nearly a month ago.
The aircraft, based in the US, could be used in potential strikes targeting Iran’s nuclear or ballistic missile facilities as US President Donald Trump weighs options if diplomacy fails.
Trump warned last month that the US could strike Iran if it refused to agree to curb its nuclear program. But senior national security officials reportedly urged him to delay action until US forces in the region were better positioned offensively and defensively.
The 30,000 to 40,000 American troops scattered around the Middle East, including at eight permanent bases, were low on air defenses to protect them from expected retaliation.
In Iran’s case, the USS Abraham Lincoln aircraft carrier, along with three Tomahawk missile-equipped warships, is leading a group of about a dozen US naval vessels deployed across the Arabian Sea, the Persian Gulf, the Red Sea and the eastern Mediterranean.
The carrier’s stealthy F-35 fighters and F/A-18 attack planes are well within striking distance of targets in Iran. The US has also sent more than a dozen additional F-15E attack planes to the region, according to US officials.
Military analysts said signs of preparations for major operations often include increases in aerial refueling tankers and the deployment of EA-18 Growlers -- radar-jamming aircraft that escort bombers. Growlers are aboard the Lincoln, and US Central Command has recently flown some to a base in Jordan.
Flight-tracking data also suggests the US is moving additional aircraft, including refueling and reconnaissance planes, closer to or into the region.
Another indicator of potential offensive planning, analysts said, would be the repositioning of a ballistic missile submarine that typically operates in the Mediterranean. Moving it to the Red Sea or Arabian Sea would place it in a stronger position to strike targets inside Iran.
The submarine can carry up to 154 Tomahawk cruise missiles, significantly increasing US strike capacity. While the navy does not publicly disclose submarine locations, any vessel transiting from the Mediterranean to eastern waterways would have to surface through the Suez Canal, making it visible to ship trackers. That has not occurred so far, the report said.
White House spokesperson Anna Kelly said Trump “has all options on the table with regard to Iran,” and he will decide based on national security interests.
Iran insists its nuclear program is for civilian purposes. US officials said the buildup is aimed at ensuring readiness and deterring retaliation should diplomatic efforts collapse.

US Department of Homeland Security to go into shutdown due to funding lapse
The impasse comes as Trump’s Democratic rivals demand reforms to immigration operations after deadly shootings in Minnesota.
The United States Department of Homeland Security (DHS) – which includes agencies that oversee immigration enforcement and disaster response – is expected to run out of funds after legislators failed to avert a partial government shutdown.
The Senate adjourned on Friday without reaching a deal to pass budget legislation for DHS. The House of Representatives, meanwhile, had started its weeklong recess on Thursday evening.

- list 3 of 3Trump says planning to ‘make visit’ to Venezuela following Maduro abduction
That leaves a DHS shutdown all but inevitable when the funding expires at midnight in Washington, DC, on Saturday (05:00 GMT).
The impasse was spurred, in part, by the federal immigration crackdown in Minnesota, which resulted in the killing of two US citizens in January.
Reports had emerged of masked immigration agents threatening bystanders and using violence disproportionately.
On February 4, Democratic leaders in Congress issued a list of demands to reform Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), an agency that falls under the DHS.
The demands included banning ICE agents from wearing masks to conceal their identities, prohibiting racial profiling and ending immigration raids on “sensitive locations” like schools and churches.
Without such “common sense reforms”, the Democrats threatened to withhold their votes from any funding legislation for DHS.
But President Donald Trump’s Republican Party has rejected the Democrats’ demands, calling them unreasonable.
Republicans control both the Senate and the House. But a legislative rule in the Senate, known as the filibuster, requires lawmakers to reach a 60-vote threshold to pass major legislation.
On Thursday, the 100-seat Senate only saw 52 votes in favour of the funding legislation, with 47 opposed. Nearly all the chamber’s Democrats, save Pennsylvania’s John Fetterman, stood united to block the bill.
“The Republican bill on the floor allows ICE to smash in doors without warrants, to wear masks and not be identified, to use children as bait for their parents,” top Senate Democrat Chuck Schumer said in a video message before the vote.
“We are keeping our word: No funding for ICE until it is reined in, until the violence ends.”
By Friday, many legislators in both chambers had already left Washington. Some, like Senator Mark Kelly, had travelled to Europe to take part in the Munich Security Conference. Others had returned to their congressional districts.
If the shutdown is prolonged, it could force tens of thousands of federal employees to work without pay. Some agencies may also have to reduce their workforce until funding resumes.
Major travel and hospitality groups in the US, including Airlines for America, issued a joint statement on Friday, warning that the shutdown could lead to travel delays.
The Transportation Security Administration (TSA), which oversees airport security, is part of DHS.
“Travelers and the US economy cannot afford to have essential TSA personnel working without pay, which increases the risk of unscheduled absences and call outs, and ultimately can lead to higher wait times and missed or delayed flights,” the groups said.
But DHS’s immigration operations will be largely unaffected by the shutdown.
ICE and Customs and Border Protection (CBP) have been allocated billions of dollars through Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill Act, which Congress passed last year.
US lawmakers often use government funding as a bargaining chip to secure concessions from their political rivals.
Last year saw the longest government shutdown in US history, lasting 43 days, as Democrats tried and failed to stop Republicans from ending healthcare subsidies.
Earlier this month, lawmakers agreed to a budget to fund the government through the end of September, but it only allocated money to DHS for two weeks.
The DHS shutdown comes a day after the Trump administration announced that it is ending its immigration operation in Minnesota.
The deadlock over DHS funding highlights the Democrats’ growing anger at ICE’s aggressive tactics and Trump’s mass deportation campaign, an issue likely to be key during November’s midterm elections.
A recent poll from the news agencies PBS News and NPR, and the research firm Marist, showed that 65 percent of respondents say that ICE has gone too far in its crackdown.

Newsom tells world leaders Trump’s retreat on the environment will mean economic harm

Click here to listen to this article - Share via
SACRAMENTO — Gov. Gavin Newsom told world leaders Friday that President Trump’s retreat from efforts to combat climate change would decimate the U.S. automobile industry and surrender the future economic viability to China and other nations embracing the transition to renewable energy.
Newsom, appearing at the Munich Security Conference in Germany, urged diplomats, business leaders and policy advocates to forcefully stand up to Trump’s global bullying and loyalty to the oil and coal industry. The California governor said the Trump administration’s massive rollbacks on environmental protection will be short-lived.
“Donald Trump is temporary. He’ll be gone in three years,” Newsom said during a Friday morning panel discussion on climate action. “California is a stable and reliable partner in this space.”
Newsom’s comments came in the wake of the Trump administration’s repeal of the endangerment finding and all federal vehicle emissions regulations. The endangerment finding is the U.S. government’s 2009 affirmation that planet-heating pollution poses a threat to human health and the environment.
Environmental Protection Agency administrator Lee Zeldin said the finding has been regulatory overreach, placing heavy burdens on auto manufacturers, restricting consumer choice and resulting in higher costs for Americans. Its repeal marked the “single largest act of deregulation in the history of the United States of America,” he said.
Scientists and experts were quick to condemn the action, saying it contradicts established science and will put more people in harm’s way. Independent researchers around the world have long concluded that greenhouse gases released by the burning of gasoline, diesel and other fossil fuels are warming the planet and worsening weather disasters.
The move will also threaten the U.S.’s position as a leader in the global clean energy transition, with nations such as China pulling ahead on electric vehicle production and investments in renewables such as solar, batteries and wind, experts said.
Newsom’s trip to Germany is just his latest international jaunt in recent months as he positions himself to lead the Democratic Party’s opposition to Trump and the Republican-led Congress, and to seed a possible run for the White House in 2028. Last month Newsom traveled to the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, and in November to the U.N. climate summit in Belém, Brazil — mocking and condemning Trump’s policies on Greenland, international trade and the environment.
When asked how he would restore the world’s confidence in the United States if he were to become president, Newsom sidestepped. Instead he offered a campaign-like soliloquy on California’s success on fostering Tesla and the nation’s other top electric vehicle manufacturers as well as being a magnet for industries spending billions of dollars on research and development for the global transition away from carbon-based economies.
The purpose of the Munich conference was to open a dialogue among world leaders on global security, military, economic and environmental issues. Along with Friday’s discussion on climate action, Newsom is scheduled to appear at a livestreamed forum on transatlantic cooperation Saturday.
Andrew Forrest, executive chairman of the Australia-based mining company giant Fortescue, said during a panel Friday his company is proof that even the largest energy-consuming companies in the world can thrive without relying on the carbon-based fuels that have driven industries for more than a century. Fortescue, which buys diesel fuel from countries across the world, will transition to a “green grid” this decade, saving the company a billion dollars a year, he said.
“The science is absolutely clear, but so is the economics. I am, and my company Fortescue is, the industrial-grade proof that going renewable is great economics, great business, and if you desert it, then in the end, you’ll be sorted out by your shareholders or by your voters at the ballot box,” Forrest said.
Newsom said California has also shown the world what can be done with innovative government policies that embrace electric vehicles and the transition to a non-carbon-based economy, and continues to do so despite the attacks and regressive mandates being imposed by the Trump administration.
“This is about economic prosperity and competitiveness, and that’s why I’m so infuriated with what Donald Trump has done,” Newsom said. “Remember, Tesla exists for one reason — California’s regulatory market, which created the incentives and the structure and the certainty that allowed Elon Musk and others to invest and build that capacity. We are not walking away from that.”
California has led the nation in the push toward EVs. For more than 50 years, the state enjoyed unique authority from the EPA to set stricter tailpipe emission standards than the federal government, considered critical to the state’s efforts to address its notorious smog and air-quality issues. The authority, which the Trump administration has moved to rescind, was also the basis for California’s plan to ban the sale of new gasoline-powered cars by 2035.
The administration again targeted electric vehicles in its announcement on Thursday.
“The forced transition to electric vehicles is eliminated,” Zeldin said. “No longer will automakers be pressured to shift their fleets toward electric vehicles, vehicles that are still sitting unsold on dealer lots all across America.”
But the efforts to shut down the energy transition may be too little, too late, said Hannah Safford, former director of transportation and resilience at the White House Climate Policy Office under the Biden administration.
“Electric cars make more economic sense for people, more models are becoming available, and the administration can’t necessarily stop that from happening,” said Safford, who is now associate director for climate and environment at the Federation of American Scientists.
Still, some automakers and trade groups supported the EPA’s decision, as did fossil fuel industry groups and those geared toward free markets and regulatory reform. Among them were the Independent Petroleum Assn. of America, which praised the administration for its “efforts to reform and streamline regulations governing greenhouse gas emissions.”
Ford, which has invested in electric vehicles and recently completed a prototype of a $30,000 electric truck, said in a statement to The Times that it appreciated EPA’s move “to address the imbalance between current emissions standards and consumer choice.”
Toyota, meanwhile, deferred to a statement from Alliance for Automotive Innovation president John Bozzella, who said similarly that “automotive emissions regulations finalized in the previous administration are extremely challenging for automakers to achieve given the current marketplace demand for EVs.”

Nine people charged in Paris' Louvre ticket fraud scandal
France

After a break-in and strikes, a ticket fraud scandal and a water leak on Friday, February 13, brought new troubles to France's Louvre museum. The fire brigade had to be called overnight after a pipe burst in the Denon wing, which houses the Mona Lisa painting and other priceless exhibits, according to a statement.
French prosecutors, meanwhile, on Friday charged nine people over ticket fraud that may have cost the museum €10 million ($11.9 million), legal sources said. Investigators believe guides working with Chinese tourists reused tickets to enter several times, bribing security staff to get their compliance.
While the space containing Leonardo da Vinci's masterpiece was not affected by the leak, it damaged a room of 15th-century Italian works and its decorative ceiling, painted by French artist Charles Meynier. "The ceiling artwork shows two tears in the same area, caused by water, and lifting of the paint layer on the ceiling and its arches," a Louvre statement said. A heating-system pipe above the room caused the damage, the statement added. Firefighters intervened shortly after midnight.
The leak adds to a growing collection of structural and maintenance problems at the world's most visited museum, which suffered an embarrassing robbery last October. A water leak in November damaged several hundred works in the Louvre's Egyptian department. And a gallery housing ancient Greek ceramics was closed in October because ceiling beams threatened to give way. The Louvre's chief architect François Chatillon conceded to lawmakers in November that the building was "not in a good state."
Two employees and several tour guides
The blow came just a day after revelations that police had dismantled a ticket fraud network that allegedly includes two museum employees and several tour guides. Nine people were charged Friday after being formally accused of offences ranging from fraud to helping a foreign national enter the country to take part in gang activity to corruption and money laundering, the legal sources said. Police have seized around €1 million in cash and €486,000 from different bank accounts linked to the gang.
The accumulation of problems has piled pressure on museum boss Laurence des Cars, who faced calls to resign after the October 19 robbery, in which thieves stole crown jewels worth more than $100 million. Two intruders used a truck-mounted extendable platform to access a gallery containing the jewels, slicing through a glass door with disk-cutters in front of startled visitors before grabbing eight items.
Disgruntled staff have also launched a wave of strikes since the start of the year, demanding more recruitment and improved salaries, forcing management to shutter the former royal palace on several Mondays. The Louvre welcomed nine million visitors last year.

Merz warns US against going alone at Munich summit

German Chancellor Friedrich Merz told the Munich Security Conference that the rules-based international order “no longer exists” and warned that the United States lacks the strength to act alone in a period of rivalry between major powers.
Opening the annual gathering of security leaders on Friday, Merz addressed remarks to President Donald Trump and senior US officials in the audience.
“In the era of great power rivalry, even the United States will not be powerful enough to go it alone,” he said.
“Being a part of Nato is not only Europe’s competitive advantage. It is also the United States’ competitive advantage.”
Merz said the post-war order had already shifted.
“This order, however imperfect it was even at its best, no longer exists in that form,” he told delegates.
He referred to tensions that have marked transatlantic relations over the past year. US Vice-President JD Vance criticised European policies at the same conference in 2025, triggering disputes over free speech and migration.
Merz said “a deep divide has opened between Europe and the United States” and added that Europe must adjust.
“Our freedom is not guaranteed,” he said. “Firmness and willpower will be needed to assert this freedom.”
He criticised tariffs and protectionism, in remarks seen as directed at Washington after Trump threatened new trade measures against European states and renewed interest in acquiring Greenland from Denmark, a Nato ally.
“The culture war of the Maga movement is not ours,” Merz said. “We do not believe in tariffs and protectionism, but in free trade.”
He called for renewed cooperation with Washington.
“So let’s repair and revive transatlantic trust together,” he said.
Merz also disclosed talks with French President Emmanuel Macron on closer nuclear cooperation. He confirmed that discussions had begun on linking Germany more closely to France’s nuclear deterrent within a European framework tied to Nato.
France and the United Kingdom are Europe’s only nuclear powers. Germany has relied on the US nuclear umbrella under Nato arrangements.
Merz said Germany sought a “strong, self-sustaining pillar” inside the alliance, not a break from it
Macron expanded on that theme in his own address. He urged Europe to “show unwavering commitment to defend our own interests” and called for a reorganisation of the continent’s security architecture.
“If we want to be taken seriously on the European continent and beyond, we must show the world our unwavering commitment to defend our own interests,” Macron said, referring to trade disputes and territorial claims.
“That starts with continuing to extend our support to Ukraine, but it could nicely follow with fending off unjustified tariffs and politely declining unjustified claims on European territory,” he said.
Macron argued that Europe must sit at the table in any future arms control talks with Russia. He said past treaties were negotiated between Washington and Moscow without full European participation.
He confirmed discussions with Germany and the UK on a new generation of long-range missile and nuclear cooperation, and said he would present further details in coming weeks.
On Ukraine, Macron said Europe must increase pressure on Moscow and warned against concessions without guarantees.
President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, speaking on the sidelines, said Russia did not seek to end the war and required stronger sanctions.
“I don’t think that they want to stop the war,” Zelenskyy said. “Under pressure, they can.”
He said Ukraine would hold elections if a ceasefire lasting two to three months were secured with security guarantees.
Around 50 world leaders are attending the summit. The agenda includes the war in Ukraine, tensions with China and negotiations over Iran’s nuclear programme.
Conference chairman Wolfgang Ischinger wrote in a pre-event report that US foreign policy shifts have raised “difficult questions about the future shape of transatlantic and international co-operation”.
Merz described the Munich forum as a measure of the state of US-European ties. He said Europe must turn a “switch in our minds” and make full use of its military and economic strength.
“Autocracies may have followers,” he said. “Democracies have partners and allies.”

A jury has deadlocked in the trial of five current and former Stanford University students charged after pro-Palestinian protests in 2024.
The students faced felony charges for vandalism and conspiracy to trespass after they barricaded themselves inside the university president and provost executive offices.
Santa Clara County prosecutors said demonstrators broke furniture and splattered a red liquid described as fake blood on items throughout the offices.
Defense lawyers said the protest was protected speech and there was no intent to damage property.
The trial in California’s Silicon Valley is a rare instance of demonstrators facing felony charges from the wave of campus protests that year.

Money, threats, abuse: Israeli efforts to block return to Gaza via Rafah
Palestinians trying to return to Gaza through Rafah crossing describe interrogations, detention, humiliation, offers of money to abandon their right of return
ISTANBUL
The journey home for Palestinians returning to the Gaza Strip through the Rafah border crossing with Egypt has turned into a path marked by interrogation, detention and humiliation - and, in some cases, financial inducements not to return or to cooperate with the Israeli army, according to returnee testimonies and human rights reports.
On Wednesday, Gaza’s Government Media Office said only 488 travelers of 1,800 had been able to cross Rafah in both directions since its reopening through Tuesday -- an Israeli compliance rate of about 27%.
In a statement, the office said 275 people left Gaza while 213 entered, and 26 travelers were denied permission to leave for Egypt during the same period.
Israel reopened the Palestinian side of the crossing on Feb. 2 after closing it since May 2024, but only in a very limited manner and under extremely strict conditions.
Documented violations
On Feb. 5, the UN Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights in the Occupied Palestinian Territory said returnees reported after crossing, that they were taken by armed Palestinians, backed by the Israeli army -- identified as members of the Abu Shabab militia -- to an Israeli military checkpoint. There, some were handcuffed, blindfolded, searched, threatened and had personal belongings confiscated.
The same day, Israel’s public broadcaster KAN reported that Israeli authorities had allowed members of the Abu Shabab militia to take part in searches of Palestinians entering and leaving Rafah.
A day later, the Yedioth Ahronoth newspaper reported that Israel was secretly supporting armed militias in Gaza with money, weapons and field protection to counter Hamas, operating in areas where Israeli forces are deployed under a ceasefire agreement.
According to the paper, the Israeli army has used the militias “for limited tactical tasks, including pursuit and arrest operations and searching for Hamas fighters in tunnels or among the rubble.”
The UN human rights office said returnees described a pattern of violence, degrading interrogations and intrusive body searches that violated their privacy. In some cases, people in need were denied medical care or access to toilets, resulting in severe humiliation.
Several returnees said they were asked whether they would accept money to go back to Egypt with their families and never return to Gaza. Others said they were offered money to act as informants for the Israeli army.
Taken together, the testimonies point to a pattern of conduct that violates Palestinians’ rights to personal security and dignity, and their protection from torture and cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment, the office said.
It warned that the reported practices raise serious concerns about coercive measures aimed at discouraging Palestinians from exercising their right to return to areas from which they were forcibly displaced -- a dynamic that could amount to ethnic cleansing in Gaza.
Ajith Sunghay, head of the UN human rights office in the occupied Palestinian territory, said the international community has a responsibility to ensure that all measures related to Gaza comply with international law and fully respect Palestinian human rights.
“After two years of destruction, their ability to return safely and with dignity to their families and whatever remains of their homes is the absolute minimum,” he said.
According to returnees, the crossing process involves passing through five stages: the Egyptian side, the Palestinian Authority, European Union representatives, a militia operating with Israeli backing, and Israeli soldiers.
Calls to stop ‘abuse’
In response to the accounts, two Israeli human rights organizations, Adalah and Gisha, called for an end to “a policy of abuse and unlawful restrictions” imposed on Gaza residents seeking to return through Rafah, warning that the measures amount to “forced displacement.”
In a statement Thursday, the groups said they had sent an urgent letter to Defense Minister Israel Katz, Attorney General Gali Baharav-Miara and the military prosecution.
They demanded an immediate halt to “the policy of abuse and illegal restrictions imposed on Gaza residents seeking to return via the Rafah crossing on the Palestinian-Egyptian border.”
Testimonies collected by the organizations, including from elderly people and children, described harsh Israeli military interrogations, while stressing that returnees remain determined to stay on their land and reject any attempt to displace them.
The groups said the closure of the crossing has prevented wounded and sick Palestinians from leaving for treatment and blocked the return of thousands who had left Gaza or were stranded abroad.
They said all travelers are subject to prior Israeli security approval, with severe restrictions on entry and exit, and that only limited numbers of those who left during the war are allowed to return.
Field reports indicate that only small numbers, mostly women and children, have been permitted back, despite claims of an agreement allowing about 50 people to enter daily, without any clear explanation for the discrepancy.
The testimonies also describe blindfolding, handcuffing and confiscation of personal belongings. Some Palestinians were transported inside Gaza by armed groups coordinating with the Israeli army and subjected to security interrogations involving pressure and threats of arrest.
The organizations said the practices violate international law, which guarantees the right of return without arbitrary restrictions, and warned that preventing return and imposing security conditions could amount to “forcible transfer prohibited under the Geneva Conventions.”
They called for the removal of all obstacles to return, the lifting of security conditions and full compliance with international law.
On-the-ground testimonies
In a widely circulated video, Palestinian returnee Adel Imran said armed men opened the bus door and transferred passengers in military vehicles to the Morag area between Rafah and Khan Younis, where they were searched and handed over to Israeli forces.
In the same video, Amani Imran said the armed men confiscated their luggage before Israeli soldiers summoned passengers one by one for photographing and interrogation about why they left Gaza and why they were returning.
In another recorded testimony, an elderly Palestinian woman said she was interrogated for three hours after returning from a long medical trip to Egypt. She said the bus was surrounded by military vehicles before passengers were taken to an area under Israeli control.
She added that they were handed to an “anti-terror unit,” led by Ghassan al-Deheini, the commander of the Abu Shabab militia inside Gaza, where they were questioned and asked about Palestinians killed during the war in what she said was an attempt to intimidate returnees.
Egyptian and Israeli media had earlier reported that 50 Palestinians would be allowed into Gaza daily, with a similar number exiting to Egypt for medical treatment, but that arrangement has yet to materialize.
Palestinian estimates in Gaza indicate that 22,000 wounded and sick people need to leave the enclave for treatment due to the collapse of the health sector after the war.
Quasi-official figures also show that 80,000 Palestinians have registered to return to Gaza, underscoring widespread refusal of displacement and insistence on returning despite the destruction.
Before the war, hundreds of Palestinians crossed Rafah daily in both directions under a mechanism managed by Gaza’s Interior Ministry and Egyptian authorities, without Israeli involvement.
Under the first phase of the ceasefire agreement, Israel was supposed to fully reopen the crossing when the truce took effect Oct. 10, but it has failed to do so.

Court orders Trump administration to facilitate deported student’s return
Any Lucia Lopez Belloza, 19, was deported after attempting to visit her family for Thanksgiving, despite a court order.
A United States court has ordered the administration of President Donald Trump to facilitate the return of a Babson College student, Any Lucia Lopez Belloza, who was wrongfully deported last year.
In his ruling on Tuesday, US District Judge Richard Stearns gave the government two weeks to take steps to bring Lopez Belloza back.

He framed the order as an opportunity to correct a “mistake” – but he did not rule out holding the government in contempt if it failed to take the necessary actions.
“Wisdom counsels that redemption may be found by acknowledging and fixing our own errors,” Stearns wrote.
“In this unfortunate case, the government commendably admits that it did wrong. Now it is time for the government to make amends.”
A surprise trip turned deportation
Lopez Belloza, 19, was arrested on November 20 by immigration agents at Boston’s Logan airport.
The college freshman had been preparing to board a flight home to her family in Texas to surprise them for the Thanksgiving holiday.
She has since told The Associated Press news agency that she was denied access to a lawyer after her initial detention at the airport. The immigration agent told her she would need to sign a deportation document first, according to Lopez Belloza, who said she denied the offer.
For the next two nights, she said she was kept by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) in a holding room with 17 other women, without enough room to lie down.
Then, she was loaded onto a deportation flight, which took her to Texas, then to her native Honduras, on November 22.
“I was numb the whole plane ride,” Lopez Belloza told the AP. “I just kept questioning myself. Why is it happening to me?”
Her lawyers, however, had obtained during that time a court order barring her removal from Massachusetts for 72 hours. Lopez Belloza’s deportation violated that court order.
She has remained in Honduras for the last two and a half months, while legal challenges over her case proceeded.
A legal battle
In court, the Trump administration has apologised for the error in Lopez Belloza’s case, acknowledging that a mistake was indeed made.
“On behalf of the government, we want to sincerely apologise,” prosecutor Mark Sauter told the court.
But Sauter rejected accusations that the government wilfully defied the 72-hour court order, saying that Lopez Belloza’s deportation was the mistake of one ICE agent and not an act of judicial defiance.
The government has also argued that Lopez Belloza was subject to a removal order before her November 20 arrest and therefore should not be returned to the US.
Lopez Belloza was brought to the US from Honduras when she was eight years old, and in 2016, she and her mother were ordered to be deported.
But the college freshman said she had no knowledge of any deportation order and has told the media that her previous legal representation had assured her there was no removal order against her.
Nevertheless, the Trump administration has rejected efforts to bring Lopez Belloza back to the country, even on a student visa.
In a February 6 court filing, US Attorney Leah B Foley wrote that a student visa “is unfeasible as the Secretary of State lacks authority to adjudicate visa applications and issue visas”.
“In any event,” Foley added, “Petitioner appears ineligible for a student visa.” She explained that Lopez Belloza “would remain subject to detention and removal if returned to the United States”.
The filing ended with a warning to the court to “refrain from ordering Respondents to return Petitioner to the status quo because this Court lacks authority”.
The Trump administration has questioned the authority of federal courts to intervene in immigration-related matters.
A series of mistakes
Critics, meanwhile, have accused the Trump administration of repeatedly failing to heed court orders it disagrees with.
Lopez Belloza’s case is not the first instance of an immigrant being wrongfully deported since the start of Trump’s second term.
Trump had campaigned on a pledge of mass deportation, and he has followed through with that promise, leading a series of controversial immigration crackdowns that have been accused of violating due process rights.
One of the most high-profile cases came in March 2025, when his administration wrongfully deported a Salvadoran father named Kilmar Abrego Garcia, who lived in Maryland with his wife, a US citizen.
Abrego Garcia had been subject to a 2019 court order barring his removal from the US on the basis that he could face gang violence in El Salvador.
But he was nevertheless sent back to the country and was briefly held in El Salvador’s Center for Terrorism Confinement (CECOT), a maximum-security prison.
On April 10, the US Supreme Court ruled that the Trump administration must “facilitate” Abrego Garcia’s return, largely upholding a lower court’s decision.
But the Trump administration initially argued Abrego Garcia was outside of its power. Then, on June 6, it abruptly announced Abrego Garcia had been returned, only to file criminal charges against him and seek his deportation a second time.
Another case involved a Guatemalan man, identified only by his initials OCG.
He had been under a court protection order that barred him from being returned to Guatemala, for fear that his identity as a gay man would subject him to persecution.
But the Trump administration detained and deported him instead to Mexico, which in turn sent him back to Guatemala. He subsequently went into hiding for his safety.
In June, OCG was returned to the US after a court ordered the Trump administration to facilitate his return. It also noted that OCG’s deportation “lacked any semblance of due process”.
Lopez Belloza continues her studies at Babson College remotely from Honduras as she awaits the outcome of her legal proceedings.

Former Norwegian premier’s Epstein links prompt Nobel Committee to review archives
'If we find serious matters in that review, it will also be something the public will know about,' says Nobel Institute director
ISTANBUL
Alleged links between former Norwegian Prime Minister Thorbjorn Jagland and late convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein have prompted Norway’s Nobel Committee to initiate a review of its documentary archives and tighten transparency rules, media reports said Friday.
The move comes after Norway’s economic crime authority, Okokrim, launched an investigation into Jagland on suspicion of aggravated corruption following disclosures in US documents related to Epstein, the Norwegian news broadcaster NRK reported.
Jagland, who chaired the Norwegian Nobel Committee between 2009 and 2015, has denied any criminal wrongdoing and said he is cooperating with authorities.
The committee said it has decided to introduce a new practice requiring publication of current members’ positions, financial interests, gifts, travel and other services that may be relevant to their roles.
At the same time, it announced a review of its archives to assess how ethical questions were handled in the past, including in specific cases.
“If we find serious matters in that review, it will also be something the public will know about,” Nobel Institute Director Kristian Berg Harpviken told NRK.
But the committee said historical documents will not be publicly available due to the 50-year confidentiality rule governing its work.
The developments follow revelations linked to the archives of Epstein, who died in a New York City prison in 2019 while awaiting trial on sex trafficking charges. Epstein had cultivated relationships with high-profile political and business figures worldwide.
According to Norwegian media reports, Jagland’s residence and other properties were searched this week as part of the investigation. His lawyer has said Jagland has provided a detailed explanation to authorities and is confident he has committed no criminal offense.
Red Party MP Bjornar Moxnes called the justification “the world’s worst excuse,” arguing that Alfred Nobel’s will does not mention gift registers or financial disclosures.
“It should be completely unproblematic to disclose previous donations,” Moxnes said.
Per-Willy Amundsen of the Progress Party (Frp) echoed the criticism, saying “maximum transparency” would serve the committee’s credibility, particularly given the corruption allegations involving its former head.
If violations of the committee’s ethics rules are confirmed, there would be no direct consequences for Jagland, as he no longer holds a position within the body. Still, Harpviken emphasized that receiving gifts, travel or other services in breach of regulations would constitute a violation.

Trump deportation surge left Texas with shortage of home builders. Now Republican wants completely new visa to fix that
The U.S. already has special visas for workers in sectors like agriculture and tech
- Bookmark
- CommentsGo to comments
A bipartisan group of lawmakers is pushing to give special visas to construction workers, given that the Trump administration’s deportation campaign is reportedly causing a labor shortage on construction sites in states like Texas.
The Essential Workers for Economic Advancement Act, introduced in September, would offer non-citizens temporary, renewable visas for up to nine years to work in key industries where employers are struggling to hire.
“That would help us protect and get immigrants legally for those in the construction industry,” Rep. Monica De La Cruz (R-TX) told Nexstar.
De La Cruz was part of a group of South Texas leaders who met with House Speaker Mike Johnson this week to discuss the proposal, as home builders in the state warn of slowing construction times and difficulty hiring over fears of immigration raids.
“They hear Monte Cielo and say, ‘No, no. You can pay me whatever you want, but I’m not going to go work there,’” Alejandro Garcia, a home builder at work on a development in Weslaco, Texas, that has been raided multiple times, told The Wall Street Journal last week.
A concrete supplier in the region, meanwhile, told the paper that concrete use fell 60 percent between May and November, as builders lost workers and projects stalled.
“A project that was taking maybe four to five months on an average, starter-type home is now taking eight, nine, 10 months, just because of the delays,” Efrain Gomez, treasurer of the South Texas Builders Association, told NewsNation. “It’s a huge ripple effect.”
Immigrants, legal and otherwise, make up more than half the construction workforce in states like Texas, California, Florida, and New York, according to the National Association of Home Builders.
The Trump administration’s immigration campaign has butted up against key industries like agriculture, hospitality, and construction that rely heavily on the labor of immigrants and undocumented people.
The administration has pushed to expand the H-2A visa for farm workers, and last year, Trump toyed with a pause on raids on hotels, restaurants, and agriculture, only for the administration to insist days later there would be “no safe spaces for industries who harbor violent criminals or purposely try to undermine ICE's efforts."
The administration has faced similar tensions over the H-1B specialist visa program, which is heavily in use by the president’s allies in the tech industry but undercuts his emphasis on hiring American workers.

Trump says regime change in Iran 'would be the best thing that could happen'

US President Donald Trump on Friday signaled support for the idea of regime change in Iran.
“Seems like that would be the best thing that could happen," Trump told reporters after a visit to Fort Bragg in the state of North Carolina.
"For 47 years, they've been talking and talking and talking. In the meantime, we've lost a lot of lives while they talk. Legs blown off, arms blown off, faces blown off. We've been going on for a long time. So let's see what happens," he added.
Trump also reiterated that "tremendous power" has arrived to the region. The US has steadily built up military forces in the region since Trump has threatened strikes against Iran following the eruption of countrywide protests in late December.
"Additional power, as you know, and other carriers going out shortly, so we'll see it now, if we could get it settled for once," he said.
When asked who he wants to "take over" Iran, Trump replied, "I don’t want to talk about that. There are people."
Trump has said the US is prepared to deploy a “very big force” if ongoing negotiations with Iran fail.
"Well, in case we don't make a deal, we'll need it ... If we have a deal, we could cut it short. It'll be leaving. It'll be leaving very soon. We have one out there that just arrived ... We have it ready. A big, a very big force," Trump told reporters when asked why he decided to send a second aircraft carrier to the region.
His remarks came after local media reported that the US will send the USS Gerald R. Ford to the Middle East to back up the USS Abraham Lincoln carrier strike group.
In North Carolina, Trump was asked what Iran could do to avoid a US attack.
"If they give us the right deal, we won't do that — but, you know, historically, they haven't done that. I will say they want to talk. But so far, they do a lot of talking and no action," Trump replied.
The president reiterated that the US does not want any nuclear enrichment by Iran.
The US and Iran held indirect talks in the capital Muscat on Feb. 6 with Omani mediation to discuss Tehran’s nuclear program.
The sit-down marked the end of a roughly eight-month suspension after the US launched strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities during an escalation of the Iran–Israel conflict in June 2025.
Amid the negotiations, the US has significantly increased its military footprint in the region as Trump warns Iran that it must make a deal.
Uranium enrichment remains a central point of dispute. The US demands Iran halt uranium enrichment and transfer highly enriched uranium out of the country.
Washington has also sought to include Iran’s missile program and its support for armed groups in the region in the negotiations, but Tehran has repeatedly said it would not negotiate issues beyond its nuclear program.

Rubio skips Ukraine meeting with European leaders at Munich conference

U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio skipped a Berlin Format meeting on Ukraine held on the sidelines of the Munich Security Conference, the Financial Times reported on Feb. 13.
Rubio was expected to join leaders from a dozen European countries—including Germany, Poland, and Finland—along with officials from the European Commission and NATO. However, the FT reported that he canceled at the last minute, citing scheduling conflicts.
"The secretary won't be attending the Berlin Format meeting on Ukraine given the number of meetings he has happening at the same time," a U.S. official told the outlet. "He's engaging on Russia-Ukraine in many of his meetings here in Munich."
One European official described the last-minute cancellation as "insane," while another told the FT that, without U.S. participation, the meeting lacked substance.
European officials were reportedly concerned by the timing, as the cancellation came amid broader tensions in the transatlantic relationship and growing worries that the United States is distancing itself from Europe.
Rubio separately met with German Chancellor Friedrich Merz to discuss Ukraine, the status of negotiations with Russia, and continued support—including military aid—for Kyiv. They also discussed broader transatlantic issues, including NATO and Europe's role within the alliance.
"In my meeting earlier today with German Chancellor Friedrich Merz, we discussed our shared efforts to secure supply chains, advance efforts to end the Russia–Ukraine war, and strengthen the partnership between the United States and Europe," Rubio wrote on X after the meeting.
Rubio is also expected to meet with President Volodymyr Zelensky on Feb. 14 in Munich before traveling to Budapest to meet Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban.

Witness says Canada shooter attacked school for chilling reason
- A witness of the horrific school shooting in Canada says the shooter, named as Jesse Van Rootselaar, may have come to the school to “finish off” her family.
- Van Rootselaar, 18, fatally shot her mother and step-brother before entering a secondary school in Tumbler Ridge, police said. She opened fire again, killing five students and a teacher before taking her own life.
- Police have not yet determined a motive for the attack but a 17-year-old who was inside the school told The Telegraph that Van Rootselaar’s younger brother and sister were fellow students, and that her brother was in school when gunfire erupted. “I am positive he went to finish off his family,” he said, referring to the suspect who was transgender.
- Another Tumbler Ridge resident reported hearing the same claims, though they could not corroborate them. Van Rootselaar’s relatives at the school were not among the victims who died.
- “We don’t have an idea yet as to motive,” Deputy Commissioner Dwayne McDonald of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police said Wednesday. “It is something that we are certainly passionately pursuing.”

Trump sends second US aircraft carrier to pressure Iran
US President Donald Trump said on Feb 13 he was sending a second aircraft carrier group to the Middle East – warning it would be a “bad day for Iran” if it fails to make a deal on its nuclear programme.
Mr Trump has upped the military threat against the Islamic republic in the wake of Tehran’s deadly crackdown by security forces on protests in January that rights groups say killed thousands.
“In case we don’t make a deal, we’ll need it,” Mr Trump told journalists at the White House, when asked about reports the USS Gerald R. Ford would be moved from the Caribbean to the Middle East.
“It’ll be leaving very soon. We have one out there that just arrived. If we need it we’ll have it ready, a very big force.”
Erratic posts on Bersatu social media after expulsions
Amid the mass expulsion of several party leaders, Parti Pribumi Bersatu Malaysia’s Facebook page on Feb 13 is replete with a series of erratic posts questioning the leadership’s actions.
One post uploaded asked: “Macam mana nak jadi PM? FB pun tak boleh uruskan” (How can you become Prime Minister if you can’t even manage Facebook?).
Another post questioned the rationale behind the sackings, which included former deputy president Hamzah Zainudin.
Dubai’s DP World replaces leader over Epstein ties
Dubai’s DP World named a new chairman and chief executive officer on Feb 13, replacing former leader Sultan Ahmed Bin Sulayem after the Epstein files revealed frequent correspondence between him and the convicted sex offender.
The statement did not mention Mr Bin Sulayem. But his close ties to Jeffrey Epstein were revealed in documents recently released by the US Department of Justice, where he is cited more than 9,400 times – making international headlines and sparking condemnations.
“DP World announced the appointment of His Excellency Essa Kazim as chairman of its board of directors and the appointment of Yuvraj Narayan as group chief executive officer,” the group said, in a statement published by the Dubai media office.
Senators urge Trump to scrap foreign tourist vetting
Two Democratic senators urged the Trump administration on Feb 13 to abandon a proposal to require millions of foreign visitors to provide social media handles used over the past five years.
The proposed policy from US Customs and Border Protection would require travellers from countries in the visa waiver programme to submit the social media data.
“By requiring travellers to disclose their personal social media information, CBP will force people who simply want to visit family in the United States, conduct business with US companies, or attend events such as the upcoming World Cup to submit to sweeping digital surveillance,” said Senators Ed Markey and Ron Wyden. “No doubt many Americans would be outraged if countries such as Great Britain, France, or Australia imposed a similar policy on American tourists.”
Two men jailed for life in UK over ISIS-inspired gun plot
A UK court on Feb jailed two men for life for planning an Islamic State-inspired gun attack on a Jewish gathering in northern England.
Walid Saadaoui, 38, and Amar Hussein, 52, intended to target an anti-Semitism march in Manchester before killing more Jews in the north of the city.
Their deadly plan was thwarted when they revealed it to an undercover operative posing as a like-minded extremist who could help import weapons.

Rupert Lowe launches new political party after controversial Reform UK exit
Restore Britain formally launched on Friday evening
- Bookmark
- CommentsGo to comments
Independent MP Rupert Lowe has announced he has launched a new political party following his fractious exit from Reform UK.
Restore Britain formally launched on Friday evening.
The Great Yarmouth representative's venture is set to operate as an umbrella organisation, partnering with locally-based political groups across the country.
Restore Britain initially emerged as a "political movement" following Mr Lowe's departure from Reform UK.
He plans to contest his Great Yarmouth constituency under the local party Great Yarmouth First, which will align with Restore Britain.
Senior Conservative figures Susan Hall and Sir Gavin Williamson were previously involved in an advisory capacity when Restore Britain was a movement.
However, it remains unclear what Mr Lowe's decision to establish it as a formal political party means for their ongoing involvement.
Both have been contacted for comment.
Mr Lowe was suspended by Reform UK in March 2025 after being accused of threatening violence towards party chairman Zia Yusuf.
At the time, Scotland Yard said a complaint of “verbal threats” made about an alleged incident in December 2024 was being assessed by officers.
In a statement, Reform said it had received evidence of “serious bullying” and “derogatory” remarks made about women in the MP’s offices, with two separate staffers said to have made allegations.
Mr Lowe later said that Nigel Farage “must never become prime minister” after the Reform UK leader allegedly called his behaviour “disgusting” and “contemptible” in leaked private messages.
Mr Lowe denied the claims, describing the statement as “vexatious” and saying the complaint to police “obviously went in just after I asked reasonable questions of Reform’s leadership”.
Mr Farage accused Mr Lowe of “damaging the party just before elections” in a WhatsApp conversation with a member of the Great Yarmouth MP’s staff, the BBC reported.
Mr Farage said that a King’s Counsel had been appointed by the party to look at the bullying complaints made by two separate women working for Mr Lowe.

Trump suggests 'fear' could be key to diplomatic success in nuclear talks with Iran

07:00:37 KST

US President Donald Trump has said Iran has been "difficult" in nuclear negotiations and suggested that instilling "fear" may be necessary to resolve the standoff peacefully, as indirect talks between Washington and Tehran continue.
Speaking to active-duty soldiers at Fort Bragg in North Carolina on Friday, Trump said: "They've been difficult to make a deal."
"Sometimes you have to have fear. That's the only thing that really will get the situation taken care of," he added.
His remarks came after US officials confirmed that a second aircraft carrier was being deployed to the Middle East.
Trump said the move was intended to ensure the United States would be ready should negotiations fail.
Trump also said a change of government in Iran would be the "best thing that could happen."
"Seems like that would be the best thing that could happen," Trump said when a journalist asked if he wanted "regime change" in Iran.
"For 47 years, they've been talking and talking and talking. In the meantime, we've lost a lot of lives while they talk," he told reporters.
Diplomacy amid pressure
Earlier, he described the talks with Iran as ongoing but uncertain.
Last week, Oman facilitated discussions between the two sides.
An Iranian foreign ministry spokesperson said the engagement allowed Tehran to gauge Washington's seriousness and showed enough common ground for diplomacy to continue.
The next round of talks has not yet been announced.
Trump also referenced last June's US bombing of Iranian nuclear sites during his address, framing it as part of a broader strategy of deterrence.
The visit to Fort Bragg included a meeting with special forces involved in the January 3 operation that abducted Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro.
Trump praised the troops and linked their actions to what he described as America's strength abroad.
His speech, however, also included overt political remarks.
Trump criticised his Democratic opponents and warned that they would weaken the military if they won control of Congress in November's elections.
The president's comments reflect the administration's attempt to balance diplomacy with pressure, maintaining negotiations with Tehran while signalling that military options remain on the table.

Japanese paper-cutting art inspires flexible brain implants in China
Stretchable microelectrode arrays aim to overcome limitations of electrode technology, such as Neuralink
The resulting soft microelectrode arrays were implanted into macaque monkeys, where they were able to move or flex with brain tissue to allow for the recording of hundreds of neurons simultaneously, according to the paper which appeared in the February 5 issue.
“The development of brain-computer interfaces requires implantable microelectrode arrays that can interface with numerous neurons across large spatial and temporal scales,” the researchers wrote.
Brain-computer interfaces provide a direct link between brain activity and a computer, using electrodes to record neural signals that are then analysed to perform actions such as controlling robotic arms.

NYC public law school to host event on Hamas tunnels as ‘resistance to colonization’
Talk next month, led by Columbia University academic, advertised as describing Gaza’s underground terror infrastructure as ‘decolonial land use’
Luke Tress is The Times of Israel's New York correspondent.
NEW YORK — New York City’s public law school is set to hold an event nexzt month that brands the Hamas terror tunnel network as “decolonial land use,” highlighting how “resistance” to Israel is packaged in some academic settings.
Students for Justice in Palestine at the City University of New York (CUNY) School of Law announced the event earlier this week.
The gathering, called “The Underground in Gaza,” will feature a talk by the Columbia University academic Dr. Hadeel Assali, advertisements for the event said.
“This anthropologic investigation will examine the history and usage of tunnels in Gaza, focusing on land use and social organization in resistance to colonization,” the advertisements said.
The event will take place in the CUNY Law School’s community room in Manhattan on March 4.
The campus branch of Students for Justice in Palestine is listed as a recognized student group on CUNY Law’s website.
Students for Justice in Palestine is a loosely linked, national network that has been behind some of the vitriolic protests on campuses since the start of the Gaza war. Immediately after the October 2023 Hamas invasion of Israel, National Students for Justice in Palestine hailed the onslaught as a “historic win for Palestinian resistance.”
Hamas built a vast network of tunnels under Gaza population centers, draining the Strip’s resources for more than a decade.
The tunnels were used to attack Israeli soldiers, hide Hamas terrorists and weapons, and hold hostages. Some of the hostages were starved, tortured, sexually assaulted and executed in the tunnels.
The tunnels’ presence in civilian areas contributed to the widespread destruction in Gaza, and Hamas did not allow civilians to take shelter in the underground system. Hamas is a US-designated terrorist group.
CUNY Law is the only publicly funded law school in New York City and its graduates go on to fill many public sector legal jobs in the city, such as serving as public defenders, working in the court system or finding employment at nonprofits.
CUNY did not provide a comment on the event by the time of publication.
Assali is an anthropologist at Columbia’s Center for Science and Society. Her work examines the “ongoing colonial legacies of the discipline of geology” and “anti-colonial ways of knowing and relating to the earth in southern Palestine,” according to the university website.
Assali has written repeatedly about the Hamas tunnel network, saying in 2024 that the underground network was “a space that evades colonial capture, despite Israel’s claims of military prowess.”
“The opacity of the underground is a blind spot for colonial regimes of occupation and surveillance and for settler-colonial states that seek to eliminate the native,” she wrote in 2024, calling the tunnels “an essential form of resistance in Palestine,” without mentioning Hamas.
In her doctoral thesis in 2021, she said the tunnel network “offers us a case study of the potential of subterranean knowledge to rethink the Earth Sciences and their colonial capitalist paradigms.” Her adviser was Mahmood Mamdani, the father of New York City Mayor Zohran Mamdani, who joined anti-Israel protests on the Columbia campus.
Assali teaches a course at Columbia called “Science Underground.”
She has written on social media, “Keep supporting our resistance in ALL its forms,” and “May we see the end of Zionism and the liberation of Palestine.”
A lawsuit filed in 2024 said she had canceled her class sessions during Columbia’s anti-Israel protests and encouraged the students to attend the rallies.
Her positions lean into the settler-colonial paradigm, an academic framework that has become widespread in universities in recent decades and is often used to vilify the Jewish state as a foreign implant bent on oppression, genocide and apartheid.
Critics say the paradigm is a gross misrepresentation of Israel, ignoring Jews’ millennia of history in the land, societal ties to Israel, and Jewish migrants’ history as persecuted refugees fighting for survival in a hostile region.
A growing movement of activist academics says that settler-colonialism is a pillar of anti-Zionist ideology that is often turned against Jews and Jewish peoplehood.
The CUNY law school has been a hotbed of anti-Israel activism for years.
Two prominent anti-Zionist activists delivered inflammatory commencement speeches at the law school in 2022 and 2023, causing a national uproar.
A legal nonprofit at the school, Creating Law Enforcement Accountability and Responsibility (CLEAR), provides legal advice to some of the hardline activist groups in the city, including at Columbia. The two commencement speakers were CLEAR alumni who now head Within Our Lifetime, likely the leading anti-Zionist activist group in the city.
The head of CLEAR, Ramzi Kassem, is Mamdani’s chief counsel, linking the anti-Zionist activist network to City Hall.
Israel’s consul general in New York, Ofir Akunis, sent a letter to CUNY’s leadership on Wednesday demanding the event’s cancellation.
“Support for such an event constitutes the normalization of terror and crosses a moral red line,” Akunis said.
CUNY is a sprawling system with 26 colleges and around 240,000 students spread around the city.
The system has grappled with alleged antisemitism on its campuses for years and has taken measures to rein in discrimination against Jews.
The experience of Jewish students varies widely between the different campuses, and each college has significant autonomy from the central CUNY administration.
A third-party review of antisemitism and discrimination at CUNY last year called for an overhaul of the system’s policies related to antisemitism.

Macron tells Munich conference that Europe must become geopolitical power in its own right
French President Emmanuel Macron on Friday told the Munich Security Conference that it is time for Europe to become a geopolitical power that can provide its own security by rearticulating its nuclear deterrent in the face of an aggressive Russia. “Everyone should take their cue from us,” he said.
Europe must turn its focus to long-term strategic thinking, including creating deep-strike capabilities and assessing how France’s nuclear deterrent can fit into the bloc’s future security architecture, France’s president said on Friday.
Speaking at the Munich Security Conference, President Emmanuel Macron dismissed accusations that Europe was decaying and defended its push to tackle disinformation and the excesses of social media that were harming Western democracies.
“This is the right time for audacity. This is the right time for a strong Europe,” Macron said. “Europe has to learn to become a geopolitical power. It was not part of our DNA.”
“Everyone should take their cue from us, instead of criticising us,” he said.

Macron, who is set to enter his final year in office, said Europe would still face an aggressive Russia even if there were a deal on the Ukraine war and that it could not cave into Russian demands or allow a short-term accord that would not resolve core issues.
“The Europeans must start this work with their own thinking and their own interests. So my proposal today is to launch a series of consultations on this important issue, which we have started to flesh out with our British and German colleagues, but in the broader European consultation with all the colleagues here, with a lot of capacities, a lot of strategic thinking,” Macron said.
Macron, who is scheduled to deliver a speech later this month on how he sees the role of France’s nuclear deterrent within Europe, said he had started those consultations.
“We have to reshuffle and reorganise our architecture of security in Europe. Because the past architecture of security was totally designed and framed during Cold War times. So it’s no longer adapted,” he said.

France plans to cooperate with Germany on nuclear deterrence — Macron

MUNICH, February 14. /TASS/. For the first time in history, Paris plans to cooperate with Berlin on the subject of nuclear deterrence, French President Emmanuel Macron said on the sidelines of the Munich Security Conference.
In the French leader’s words, "we have to re-articulate nuclear deterrence."
"We engage in strategic dialogue, obviously with [German] Chancellor [Friedrich] Merz and with few European leaders in order to see how we can articulate our national doctrine, which is guaranteed and controlled by the constitution, with specific cooperation, common exercises and security interests," Macron continued.
He emphasized that "this is exactly what we are doing, for the first time in history with Germany."
"This dialogue is important by itself, but it’s important because this is a way to articulate nuclear deterrence in a holistic approach to defense and security," Macron added.
In 2020, Macron said that there were less than 300 warheads in France’s nuclear arsenal. In March 2025, he pledged to launch a discussion with allies about the possibility of taking European countries under the French nuclear umbrella. Germany, Denmark, Lithuania and Poland have already signaled that they were open for a discussion on the subject. UK’s Financial Times reported that US allies in Europe and Asia are studying the possibility of creating their own nuclear shield because of the current US administration’s course towards rebuilding ties with Russia.

The Trump administration is urging other nations to press a tiny Pacific island country to withdraw a United Nations draft resolution supporting strong action to prevent climate change, including reparations for damage caused by any nation that fails to take action.
In guidance issued this week to all U.S. embassies and consulates abroad, the State Department said it “strongly objects” to the proposal being discussed by the U.N. General Assembly and that its adoption “could pose a major threat to U.S. industry.”
“President Trump has delivered a very clear message: that the U.N. and many nations of the world have gone wildly off track, exaggerating climate change into the world’s greatest threat,” according to the cable sent Tuesday and obtained by The Associated Press.
It is the latest move by the Trump administration to distance the U.S. from climate change efforts at home and around the world. A day ago, the government revoked a scientific finding that long has been the central basis for U.S. action to regulate greenhouse gas emissions. The U.S. last month also announced plans to withdraw from the U.N. treaty that establishes international climate negotiations.
The draft resolution sponsored by Vanuatu, which like many island nations fears for its survival because of climate change, is being circulated among the 193-member General Assembly and stems from a landmark advisory opinion by the U.N.’s top court last July.
The International Court of Justice said countries could be in violation of international law if they fail to take measures to protect the planet from climate change, and nations harmed by its effects could be entitled to reparations.
All U.N. member states, including major greenhouse gas emitters like the U.S. and China, are parties to the court. The opinion is not legally binding but was hailed as a turning point in international climate law.
The draft resolution expresses determination to translate the ICJ’s findings in to “concrete multinational action” and calls on all nations and regional organizations to comply with their obligations under international law related to climate change.
The proposal says that includes adopting a national climate action plan to limit global temperature rise to below 1.5 degrees Celsius; phasing out subsidies for fossil fuel exploration, production and exploitation; and urging those in violation to “provide full and prompt reparation for damage.” It would establish an International Register of Damage to record evidence and claims.
Vanuatu's U.N. Ambassador Odo Tevi, who said his island country wants a vote on the resolution by the end of March, has stressed that it would ensure that the clarity in the ICJ ruling “strengthens global climate action and multilateral cooperation.”
Louis Charbonneau, U.N. director of Human Rights Watch, urged support for the draft resolution Friday and said “governments should live up to their obligation” to protect human rights around the world by protecting the environment.
“Responsible governments shouldn’t allow themselves to be bullied by those that reject the global scientific consensus and continue to support reliance on harmful fossil fuels,” he said.
While General Assembly resolutions also are not legally binding, the ICJ said taking action to deal with the climate crisis is an international obligation.
“The resolution attempts to turn the ICJ’s interpretation of key legal standards into a practical roadmap for state accountability, which is likely to trigger political pushback from higher income high emitting countries wary of their historical responsibility and financial liability,” Candy Ofime, climate justice researcher and legal adviser at Amnesty International, said in a statement Friday.
The State Department cable outlined plans to tell other countries to urge Vanuatu to withdraw its draft — which the U.S. says is “even more problematic” than the court opinion — from consideration by Friday, when informal consultations began.
It asserted that other Group of 7 economic powers as well as China, Saudi Arabia and Russia have all indicated to the U.S. Mission to the U.N. that they share Americans’ concerns with “aspects” of the draft.
“This UNGA resolution is another example of U.N. overreach, part of a broader pattern of trying to use speculative climate models to fabricate purported legal obligations that seek to assign blame and encourage baseless claims, and to infer human rights obligations to which states have not agreed," according to the cable, which tells U.S. diplomats to use it as a talking point with representatives of other countries.
Many mainstream scientists have continuously warned that climate change is behind increasing instances of deadly and costly extreme weather, including flooding, droughts, wildfires, intense rainfall events and dangerous heat.

Trump aide who spearheaded government cost cutting gets $15M security detail paid for with slashed USAID cash
Russell Vought, the director of the White House’s Office of Management and Budget, will reportedly be protected by the Marshals Service through the end of the year

A top aide of President Donald Trump, who spearheaded massive government cuts, is getting a $15 million security detail paid for with slashed funds from the U.S. Agency for International Development, according to a new report.
Russell Vought, the director of the White House’s Office of Management and Budget, will be protected by the Marshals Service through the end of the year, using what remains of the USAID’s operating expenses, Reuters reported Friday, citing official documents.
The Trump administration dismantled the 60-year-old foreign aid agency early into the president’s second term in the name of government efficiency.
The controversial move left tens of thousands of government workers out of a job and slashed $60 billion in humanitarian aid for millions of vulnerable people around the world, the Associated Press reported.
When asked about the USAID funds, OMB spokesperson Rachel Cauley told Reuters, “We are going to continue to use available funds at the three agencies overseen by the director to protect him,” seemingly referring to the budget office, the foreign aid agency and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.
A person familiar with the matter told Reuters that Vought has more than a dozen Marshals protecting him. While the Marshals Service didn’t specifically identify Vought as under its protection, it told the publication that it "could offer protection to members of the executive branch who face threats or at the direction of the attorney general."
The Independent has reached out to OMB and the Marshals Service for comment.
Vought, who was portrayed in an AI-generated video shared by Trump on social media as the Grim Reaper, was the lead author of Project 2025, a manual produced by the Heritage Foundation in 2023 that advised on conservative policies for the next presidency.
Despite Trump claiming during the 2024 election cycle that he had “nothing to do with Project 2025,” it has served as the blueprint for many of his second administration’s policies.
Vought railed against what he saw as a politically biased, bloated federal government in Project 2025: “A president today assumes office to find a sprawling federal bureaucracy that all too often is carrying out its own policy plans and preferences—or, worse yet, the policy plans and preferences of a radical, supposedly ‘woke’ faction of the country.”
The Reuters source said that Vought has received serious threats, apparently connected to his part in Project 2025. Cauley blamed “The Left” for fueling an “assassination culture against public officials” and then acting shocked “about what it takes to keep them safe.”
There has been an increase in political violence targeting both sides of the political aisle in recent years, including the two assassination attempts on Trump and the shootings of Democratic lawmakers in Minnesota.
Consumer advocacy group Public Citizen bashed Vought following the Reuters reporting.
“Russell Vought has literally taken food out the mouths of hungry children and treatment away from the sick and vulnerable—and now is using the proceeds to pay for what appears to be a platoon of bodyguards. Disgusting,” Robert Weissman, co-president of Public Citizen, said in a statement.

Trump team has spent more than $40 million to send migrants to nations they’ve never lived in, report says
In some cases, the government has spent seven-figure sums to deport a single person, the report claims
- Bookmark

Over the past year, the Trump administration has spent upwards of $40 million to relocate migrants to far-flung countries where they have no connection, according to a new report.
The 35-page analysis — released by Democrats on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee on Friday — alleges that officials undermined U.S. interests by funneling money to corrupt foreign governments in return for their acceptance of migrants.
“This report outlines the troubling practice by the Trump Administration of deporting individuals to third countries…at great expense to the American taxpayer and raises serious questions,” New Hampshire Sen. Jeanne Shaheen said in a statement.
Democrats wrote that since taking office last year, Trump has dramatically expanded the removal of migrants to third countries — nations where they have no citizenship or native ties. Previously, this policy was rarely implemented.
In order to incentivize foreign governments to enter deportation deals with the U.S., the administration has given more than $32 million to five countries: Equatorial Guinea, Rwanda, El Salvador, Eswatini and Palau. Lawmakers said the total amount given to foreign nations is unknown, but that it is probably more than $40 million.
Under these agreements, more than 200 Venezuelan men were deported last spring to a prison in El Salvador — which has faced allegations of human rights abuses — despite federal court orders that blocked the flights and ordered their returns. By July, most of those detainees were released to their home country as part of a U.S.-Venezuela prisoner swap after spending months in lock-up.
That same month, a memo from the acting director of Immigration and Customs Enforcement said that the agency can expedite deportations to third countries with as little as six hours’ notice, The Independent previously reported. It came after the Supreme Court ruled that the government can “immediately” begin deporting immigrants to so-called third countries.
The new Senate report was quickly dismissed by the White House.
“The entire Trump Administration is working to lawfully deliver on President Trump’s mandate to enforce federal immigration law and carry out the largest mass deportation campaign of criminal illegal aliens in history,” Trump spokesperson Abigail Jackson told The Independent.
The Senate Democrats’ analysis outlined several ways that the administration’s use of third-country removals has “undermined” American interests.
Firstly, they labeled the program as “expensive and ineffective,” noting that the government has spent millions of dollars to remove a small number of people — sometimes paying seven-figure sums per person. As of January, the five countries paid $32 million had only accepted about 300 migrants from the U.S.
The report also claims the Trump administration wasted taxpayer dollars, as many migrants sent to third countries have since fled. As of last month, more than 80 percent of those deported under the program had returned to their countries of origin or were in the process of leaving.
Further, Democrats accused the Republican administration of channeling money to corrupt governments without conducting proper oversight. These regimes have records of human rights abuses and human trafficking, the report says, adding that there is no indication the State Department is tracking where the money is being spent.
“The Trump Administration is putting millions of taxpayer dollars into the hands of foreign governments, while turning a blind eye to the human costs and potentially undermining our diplomatic relationships,” Shaheen said. “For an Administration that claims to be reigning in fraud, waste and abuse, this policy is the epitome of all three.”
Lastly, Senate Democrats wrote that the administration may be flouting existing U.S. immigration laws.
“Evidence suggests the Administration is using third countries to carry out removals that U.S. law would otherwise prohibit, such as sending protected individuals onward to countries where they may face persecution or death,” they wrote.

Trump: Regime change in Iran best thing that could happen

Trump signaled confidence that negotiations with the Islamic Republic of Iran would succeed, while making clear that Tehran would face serious consequences if they collapse.
"I think the negotiations will succeed, and if they don't, it will be a very bad day for Iran," Trump said, confirming that an additional aircraft carrier is on its way to the Middle East. He added: "Regime change in Iran? It seems like that could be best thing that could happen."
The president delivered a dual message: hope for a new deal limiting Iran's nuclear program and ballistic missile capabilities, alongside an explicit threat of military action.
"If we don't have a deal, we'll need it. If we have a deal, it will leave very quickly. We already have one that's arrived. If we need it, we'll be ready with very great force," Trump said, referring to the second aircraft carrier.
Asked who might replace Iran's current regime, Trump declined to elaborate. "I don't want to talk about that, but there are people," he said, leaving the matter deliberately vague.
Pentagon ramps up preparations
Behind the scenes, the Pentagon is completing extensive preparations in case of a confrontation. According to a report in The New York Times, when Trump threatened last month to strike Iran, the US military was not fully prepared. Tens of thousands of American troops in the region reportedly lacked sufficient air defense systems, and the fighter jets required for a large-scale operation were not yet deployed to the Middle East. Senior defense officials persuaded the president to wait until both offensive and defensive capabilities were reinforced.
Since then, what officials describe as an actual armada has taken shape. The aircraft carrier USS Abraham Lincoln is at the center of a naval strike group that includes guided missile destroyers capable of intercepting ballistic missiles, submarines able to launch up to 154 Tomahawk cruise missiles, and advanced Patriot and THAAD missile defense systems.
Now the USS Gerald R. Ford is also heading from the eastern Caribbean to the Middle East as part of Trump's pressure on Tehran.
In addition, B-2 stealth bombers and other long-range bombers have been placed on heightened alert in the US, alongside F-35 stealth fighter jets and other strike aircraft already in the region. Military officials stressed that alongside offensive capabilities, significant emphasis is being placed on defense, amid assessments that Iran would retaliate in the event of an attack.
Reference to past strike
Trump also revisited Operation Midnight Hammer, which was carried out last summer against Iranian nuclear facilities. He described receiving word at 1 a.m., "with no moon," that B-2 bombers had entered Iranian airspace.
"Iran's nuclear program was destroyed. Every bomb hit its target," he said, adding that one strike penetrated through a ventilation shaft. "I don't think they'll be building more ventilation shafts. They wanted a little air," he quipped.
According to Trump, the attack led to the "total destruction of Iran's nuclear capabilities," and he does not believe Tehran will be able to rebuild similar facilities. He said he later met the B-2 pilots in the Oval Office and awarded them medals. "I asked if they liked doing things like that. They said they couldn't wait," he recounted.
Senior administration officials stressed that Trump has not yet made a final decision on further military action and is, for now, insisting on continuing diplomatic contacts.
However, according to a report in the Daily Mail, a senior administration source said Netanyahu's meeting with Trump contributed to the president's tougher stance on Iran.
"Netanyahu basically said that Iran is playing games. You don't want to be played. Trump listened," the source said.
The result is a situation in which, even as diplomats continue talking, the US military is preparing for the possibility of war, and Trump is sending Tehran a clear message: a deal is preferable, but if it fails, the US is ready for large-scale action.

Two men jailed in UK for Islamic State-inspired plot to kill hundreds of Jews
Prosecutor says planned attack ‘would likely have been one of the deadliest ever carried out on British soil,’ could have been much worse than Bondi Beach massacre in Australia
LONDON — Two men were jailed on Friday for plotting to kill hundreds in an Islamic State-inspired attack on the Jewish community in England, a plan prosecutors said could have been deadlier than December’s mass shooting at Sydney’s Bondi Beach.
Walid Saadaoui, 38, and Amar Hussein, 52, were both convicted after a trial at Preston Crown Court, which began a week after an unrelated deadly attack on a synagogue in the city of Manchester, in northwest England.
Prosecutors said the pair were Islamist extremists who wanted to use automatic firearms to kill as many Jews as they could in an attack in Manchester.
They were found guilty little more than a week after a mass shooting at a Jewish Hanukkah celebration on Bondi Beach in which 15 people were killed.
Prosecutor Harpreet Sandhu said on Friday that, had Saadaoui and Hussein carried out their plan, it “could have been very much more serious” than the attacks in Australia and Manchester.
Judge Mark Wall sentenced Saadaoui to a minimum term of 37 years and Hussein to a minimum term of 26 years, saying: “You were very close to being ready to carry out this plan.”
Hussein refused to attend his sentencing, having refused to attend most of his trial, which Wall said reflected Hussein’s cowardice, describing him as “brave enough to plan to threaten an unarmed group with an AK-47 but not sufficiently courageous to face up to what he did.”
Potentially one of deadliest attacks on UK soil
Saadaoui had arranged for two assault rifles, an automatic pistol and almost 200 rounds of ammunition to be smuggled into Britain through the port of Dover when he was arrested in May 2024, Sandhu told jurors at the trial.
He added that Saadaoui planned to obtain two more rifles and another pistol, and to collect at least 900 rounds of ammunition.
“This would likely have been one of the deadliest terrorist attacks ever carried out on British soil,” Wall said.
Unbeknownst to Saadaoui, however, a man known as “Farouk,” from whom he was trying to get the weapons, was an undercover operative who helped foil the plot.
Walid Saadaoui’s brother Bilel Saadaoui, 37, was found guilty of failing to disclose information about acts of terrorism. He was sentenced to six years in jail.

Freed Hostage Arbel Yehoud was sexually abused 'almost every day in captivity'

Arbel Yehoud, an Israeli woman held hostage in Gaza for 482 days after being abducted on October 7, revealed that she was sexually assaulted "almost every day in captivity" and attempted to take her own life three times during her ordeal.
Speaking in an interview with Israeli Channel 12's Ulpan Shishi news program, Yehoud, 30, described prolonged physical, psychological and sexual abuse at the hands of her captors in Gaza. She said she was held alone in extended isolation, starved and subjected to repeated mistreatment. During her captivity, she added, two of her ribs were broken.
"I tried to take my life several times. I felt that I couldn't go on," Yehoud said. The abuse, she stressed, was not a one-time incident but an almost daily reality throughout her 482 days in captivity.
Yehoud said she attempted suicide on three separate occasions. "There were moments when I thought that was the only way out," she said.
She credited her partner, Ariel Cunio, who was abducted alongside her on October 7 but later separated from her, with giving her the strength to survive. "Every time I remembered Ariel, it gave me the strength to keep breathing," she said.
In the first months of their captivity, the couple managed to smuggle short love notes to each other through intermediaries, she recounted. That communication was eventually stopped when their captors threatened that if Cunio mentioned her name again, she would be harmed. For more than a year, the two lived in complete uncertainty about each other's fate.
Yehoud was released on January 30, walking alone through a crowd surrounded by armed terrorists. "My mind was trying to understand — am I free? But still surrounded by them?" she recalled. Even at the moment of her release, she said, she feared being abducted again.
After 738 days in captivity, Cunio was also freed. The couple are now trying to rebuild their lives. Yehoud said they are coping with sleepless nights, flashbacks and trauma, but emphasized that their belief they would see each other again is what kept them alive throughout the long months of captivity.

ICE to spend $38 B on massive new detention centres across America

US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) plans to spend $38.3 billion by the end of the year on detention centers to detain and process tens of thousands of immigrants slated for deportation, according to an overview of the plan published by New Hampshire Governor Kelly Ayotte's office.
The document was provided by the Department of Homeland Security after an inquiry Ayotte made following a US Senate hearing on Thursday, her office said in a press release on Friday.
ICE plans to buy 16 existing buildings and renovate them to serve as regional processing centers that can hold 1,000 to 1,500 detainees for average stays of three to seven days, according to the plan.
The agency will also open eight large detention centers capable of holding 7,000 to 10,000 detainees for an average of around 60 days that will serve as the "primary location" for immigrants being deported abroad.
In addition, ICE will acquire an additional 10 "turnkey" facilities where the agency already operates, according to the plan.
The plan states that the centers are necessary as ICE prepares for an expected surge of arrests in 2026 after the hiring of 12,000 more agents.
"This new model will allow ICE to create an efficient detention network by reducing the total number of contracted detention facilities in use while increasing total bed capacity, enhancing custody management, and streamlining removal operations," the document reads.
ICE plans to hire contractors to conduct renovations to the buildings to build detention spaces, medical and dental services, cafeterias, lobbies, recreational areas, dormitories, and courtroom spaces. The facilities will ensure the "safe and humane civil detention of aliens," according to the document.
The detention centers will be paid for with funds from the massive spending package the Republican-controlled Congress passed in July 2025. That package, known as the "One Big Beautiful Bill," included an unprecedented $170 billion for immigration enforcement, including $45 billion for detention.
The 2024 fiscal year budget included $3.4 billion for immigration detention.
A spokesperson for DHS did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
ICE detention
ICE expects the facilities to be in operation by the end of November 2026, and they would increase the agency's total bed capacity to 92,600 beds, according to the document.
The number of people in ICE detention has increased by around 74% since Trump took office in January 2025 to more than 68,000 this month, government data show.
US President Donald Trump has overseen a widespread immigration crackdown since returning to office last year.
The administration has surged immigration agents into major US cities, boosted arrests of immigrants in the US illegally, cracked down on unlawful border crossings, and expanded the pool of people who could be deported by stripping hundreds of thousands of immigrants of temporary legal status.
Despite growing signs of political backlash ahead of next year’s midterm elections, the Trump administration is poised to ramp up immigration enforcement this year with funds Congress gave ICE to hire thousands of agents, detain more than 100,000 migrants at any given time, and expand surveillance to track down possible immigration offenders.

DHS Set to Shut Down With No End In Sight Amid Impasse Over Immigration
Unknown
Unknown Publisher

21:34:30 UTC
06:34:30 KST

The Department of Homeland Security is set to shut down at 12:01 a.m. Saturday with no clear path to reopening, as the White House and congressional Democrats remained at an impasse over immigration enforcement reforms and lawmakers left Washington for a scheduled recess.
The resulting partial government shutdown marks the third funding lapse of the current Congress and the second in less than six months, an increasingly routine outcome in a divided government that once would have been seen as politically perilous.
The standoff centers on Democrats’ demand for new guardrails on agents with Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and Customs and Border Protection (CBP) after the deaths of Renée Good and Alex Pretti in January amid the Trump Administration’s federal immigration enforcement surge in Minneapolis. Democratic leaders have refused to advance the annual Homeland Security funding bill without several measures, including requirements for court-issued warrants before agents enter private property, clear identification and badge numbers for agents, limits on masks, expanded use of body cameras, new use-of-force standards, and ensuring independent investigations of shootings. The White House and many Republicans say the Democrats' demands would hamper agents carrying out President Donald Trump’s deportation agenda.
The confrontation is unfolding as immigration is expected to be a defining issue in the midterm elections this year. Trump has made aggressive immigration enforcement a cornerstone of his second term in office, while Democrats appear emboldened by new polling showing broad support for new restrictions on ICE.
“We’re talking, but we have to protect law enforcement,” Trump said on Friday. “I know what they want, I know what they can live with. The Democrats have gone crazy.”
With talks stalled, lawmakers have left Washington for a scheduled recess, with some senators traveling to the Munich Security Conference in Germany. Leaders in both chambers have said they would recall members if an agreement is reached.
The shutdown is among the narrowest in modern history as only the Department of Homeland Security is impacted. The closest historical parallel dates to 1980, when the Federal Trade Commission briefly became the first agency to close after running out of appropriations. Still, the effects will be felt quickly: Homeland Security oversees about 13% of the federal civilian workforce, including the Transportation Security Administration, the Federal Emergency Management Agency and the Coast Guard. According to the department’s most recent contingency plan, roughly 91% of employees would continue working without pay during a lapse because their roles are deemed essential to public safety or national security. The first missed pay period would arrive in early March if the impasse continues.
Airport travelers could begin to experience strain if TSA officers forced to work without pay begin to call in sick or seek other employment. FEMA’s disaster response capabilities would be curtailed in areas like nonemergency planning and mitigation work. The Coast Guard would continue maritime security operations, but service members would not receive paychecks.

Yet the agencies at the center of the political fight—ICE and CBP—are positioned to continue their enforcement operations largely uninterrupted. Last year, Republicans passed a tax and spending law known as the Big, Beautiful Bill that provided DHS with $170 billion, including $75 billion specifically for ICE, giving the Trump Administration a substantial funding cushion to continue immigration enforcement even in the absence of a new appropriations bill.
Democrats have insisted that they are unwilling to vote for additional ICE funding without significant changes following months of clashes between federal agents and protesters in Minnesota during “Operation Metro Surge.” Viral videos and images showing aggressive tactics, including the detention of a 5-year old boy and the killings of Good and Pretti, have fueled widespread public unease with the enforcement tactics, intensifying pressure on lawmakers to act. A recent survey conducted by Hart Research for a Senate Democrat-aligned group found that 54% of likely midterm voters support blocking Homeland Security funding unless reforms to ICE are adopted, and nearly eight in 10 favor requiring judicial warrants before agents can search private property. The same polling showed 57% of voters disapprove of Trump’s deportation policies and 60% hold an unfavorable view of ICE.
A separate poll by Data for Progress found that 56% of voters support a proposal to fund the TSA, FEMA, and the Coast Guard while conditioning additional ICE money on reforms. Majorities in both surveys backed specific measures such as body cameras, independent investigations of use-of-force incidents, and restrictions on operations near schools and hospitals.
“The American people are tired of seeing these horrific videos,” Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer said Thursday. “I have looked at the polling data… the public is crying out for change.”
For Democrats, those numbers suggest that a shutdown centered on immigration enforcement may not carry the same political risks as past funding lapses. Last fall, during a 43-day shutdown over expiring Affordable Care Act subsidies, Democrats ultimately relented after public frustration mounted and airport travel snarled ahead of Thanksgiving. The promised vote to extend the subsidies failed, as was widely expected.
This time, Democrats argue, the public is more firmly on their side, and the images from Minneapolis have shifted the political terrain. “We’re going to keep pushing back on Donald Trump,” Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts told TIME on Thursday. “Is it really the case that the Trump Administration wants to defend and continue defending ICE agents who gassed little babies, who sweep through neighborhoods and pick up American citizens, and who shoot people in the back in the middle of the day?”
Republicans are less certain that their usual shutdown playbook applies. Some concede that public opinion on ICE has softened in ways that could complicate their messaging. But White House officials have sought to reframe the dispute as a “Democrat-driven shutdown,” arguing that the Trump Administration has already shown flexibility and that Democrats are holding airport security and disaster response hostage to unrelated policy demands. Trump was elected, aides say, on a promise to crack down on illegal immigration, and he has little appetite for curbing agents’ authority in ways Republicans warn could expose them to harassment or violence.
Tom Homan, the Trump Administration’s border czar, announced this week that the enforcement surge in Minnesota would end—a step Republicans hoped would unlock a short-term funding patch. DHS Secretary Kristi Noem also announced last week that her department would begin deploying body cameras to federal law enforcement, starting in Minneapolis, partially satisfying at least one demand from Democrats. But testifying before Congress this week, acting ICE director Todd Lyons acknowledged that despite the announcement, nearly 80% of ICE agents still do not wear cameras.

Trump makes bold claim at Fort Bragg as he honors soldiers who captured Maduro
- President Donald Trump praised special forces for their role in ousting Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro Friday, stating “the entire world saw what the full military might” of the U.S. can do and insisting “we are feared” by enemies around the world.
- During the visit to Fort Bragg with wife Melania, he praised the daring Jan. 3 raid that removed Maduro as “precise” and “incredible” and pledged to maintain the U.S. military as the “most elite fighting force.”
- Addressing soldiers and their families, Trump declared, “Your commander in chief supports you totally. When needed, you're going to fight, fight, fight. You're going to win, win, win.”
- He added, “America's respected again. And, perhaps most importantly, we are feared by the enemies all over the globe.”
- Trump and the first lady met with military families privately before his remarks, and Trump also praised Maduro's replacement, acting Venezuelan President Delcy Rodriguez, and outlined plans for US oil companies to rebuild Venezuela's energy industry.

AOC is pushing the Democrats to take her seriously. Munich could launch her rebirth
Once seen as an insurgent, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez has become a team player for the Democratic Party, Eric Garcia writes. Now, she wants to remake what that team looks like

Many, many years ago, as a young reporter, I covered an event with former Sen. Chris Dodd, who explained to the audience that people could always tell which senators wanted to run for president — they were the ones who joined the Senate Foreign Relations or the Armed Services committees.
It’s a good barometer: Dodd, a former presidential candidate, had sat on the Foreign Relations Committee. John McCain, the 2008 Republican nominee, served as chairman of the Armed Services Committee. Dodd’s friend Joe Biden served as chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee before becoming the running mate of fellow committee member Barack Obama in 2008.
While New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez is not a senator — yet — that might be why, during a panel on global populism at the Munich Security Conference, moderator Katrin Bennhold of The New York Times asked her, “So when you run for president, are you going to impose a wealth tax or a billionaire's tax?”
Ocasio-Cortez responded coyly.
“I don't think that anyone ... we don't have to wait for any one president to impose a wealth tax. I think that it needs to be done expeditiously,” she said, never acknowledging the thinly veiled effort at a pronouncement about her future aspirations.
Denying a potential bid for president is usually part of testing the waters — for running for president. But Ocasio-Cortez is more likely to run for Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer’s seat, either in a primary challenge fueled by progressive anger or if Schumer retires.
Still, AOC, as she is better known — initially a progressive insurgent who knocked off a Democratic incumbent — is now seeking to become a major power player, both in the 2026 midterms and in 2028.
The four-term, self-described democratic socialist from the Bronx and Queens occupies a peculiar spot. She holds formal leadership role in the House Democratic Caucus. In fact, after Trump’s victory, she attempted to become the top Democrat on the House Oversight Committee, but Democratic leadership elbowed her out.
But she’s become the leading voice for Democrats on pushing back against the cruelty and brutality exhibited by Immigration and Customs Enforcement and U.S. Customs and Border Protection agents in Trump-ordered enforcement operations.
A video interview withThe Independent where she was asked about ICE and said, “The cuts to your healthcare are what’s paying for this” and “You get screwed over to pay a bunch of thugs in the street that are shooting mothers in the face,” went viral and would later be circulated by the Democratic National Committee’s official X account.
She has yet to pass any major legislation with her name on it, though she’s on the precipice of passing a crackdown on deepfake AI porn with the help of Republicans and celebrities like Paris Hilton. Even House Speaker Mike Johnson, a Trump stalwart, has endorsed it.
Ocasio-Cortez initially came to Washington when she knocked off entrenched House Democratic Caucus Chairman Joe Crowley in a primary. During her talk, she spoke about how many in her party leadership elbowed her out because her ideas about tuition-free college, Medicare for all and a $15 per hour minimum wage were deemed unrealistic.
“And these are all the things that I, as a waitress, had campaigned on and had been major pain points in my life, and then they said, ‘We have to listen to working class people more,’”” she said.
No clearer example of this came than in the 2020 Democratic primary when many working-class voters rejected her political ally Sen. Elizabeth Warren’s candidacy for president, while Latino voters embraced her endorsed candidate, Sen. Bernie Sanders. But the party still elected Biden.
In the wake of Democrats shedding House seats, some moderates like Abigail Spanberger famously denounced slogans from AOC and her far-left allies in Congress — collectively known as The Squad — such as “Defund the Police.”
But times have changed. Ocasio-Cortez used her massive fundraising prowess to raise money for Spanberger’s run for governor last year, and her leadership PAC sent $5,000 to Sen. Jon Ossoff’s re-election campaign in Georgia.
But she’s also seeking to remake what the party looks like.
Her endorsement of Zohran Mamdani played a key role in his support among Hispanic voters in the New York City mayoral primary. And she endorsed Analilia Mejia for Gov. Mikie Sherrill’s former House seat in New Jersey’s 11th district.
Last week, Mejia pulled off a shocking win after the American Israeli Public Affairs Committee poured in millions of dollars worth of ads against former congressman Tom Malinowski.
All of this makes her an important player in those hallowed halls within Democratic Party leadership that once tut-tutted her.
Even if she doesn’t run for the White House, whom she endorses in a Democratic presidential primary will be an important weathervane for both left-wing and Latino voters.
And among the potential 2028 contenders in Germany this weekend? None other than frontrunner and California Gov. Gavin Newsom.

Indian man pleads guilty in assassination plot against prominent Sikh separatist leader in New York
A man from India has pleaded guilty to federal conspiracy charges, admitting sending $15,000 to a supposed hitman to assassinate a prominent Sikh separatist leader living in New York City

A man from India admitted Friday that he conspired to hire a hitman to assassinate a prominent Sikh separatist leader living in New York City, prompting a top federal prosecutor to warn anyone abroad against plotting to kill Americans in the United States.
“Our message to nefarious foreign actors should be clear: steer clear of the United States and our people,” U.S. Attorney Jay Clayton said in a release after Nikhil Gupta pleaded guilty to three conspiracy charges in Manhattan federal court.
James C. Barnacle Jr., the head of New York's FBI office, said Gupta coordinated with an Indian government employee, who directed him to carry out the killing, “facilitating a foreign adversary's unlawful effort to silence a vocal critic of the Indian government.”
Gupta, 54, told Magistrate Judge Sarah Netburn that he was in India when he paid $15,000 online in 2023 to someone he thought could carry out the killing of Gurpatwant Singh Pannun, who is an American citizen. Gupta was unwittingly communicating, though, with an undercover law enforcement officer posing as a hitman.
The guilty plea occurred in a courtroom packed with about two dozen Sikhs from across the United States and Canada who share Pannun's desire to win independence for Punjab, a state in northwest India, which they hope to someday rename the Democratic Republic of Khalistan.
The men briefly chanted a victory slogan in the courtroom after the proceeding ended and then held a prayer service outside the courthouse, waving yellow flags that had "Khalistan" in blue ink printed across them. American flags were carried as well.
Pannun, who advocates for the creation of the sovereign Sikh state and is considered a terrorist by the Indian government, said in a phone interview afterward that he planned to continue his activism “even if I have to face a bullet.”
“I'm not a terrorist,” he said, describing himself as a Sikh who as a human rights lawyer is campaigning to turn Punjab into a place where "all religions will have equal rights." He urged the U.S. to go after officials in India who directed Gupta.
Gupta has been held without bail since he was extradited to the United States in June 2023, from the Czech Republic, where he was arrested in Prague. A plea agreement called for him to serve at least two decades in prison. Sentencing was set for May 29.
According to court papers, Gupta suggested to the undercover officer with the Drug Enforcement Agency that he thought he was hiring to be a hitman that the June 2023 killing of Hardeep Singh Nijjar outside a Sikh temple in British Columbia, Canada, was the work of the same individuals planning the assassination of Pannun.
Gupta told the officer that Nijjar “was also the target” and "we have so many targets” as he instructed the officer to proceed with Pannun's killing now that Nijjar was dead, according to court papers.
Pannun described Gupta as “just a foot soldier.”
“The Indian government cannot shield itself behind this operational foot soldier because the command, the direction and the funds are authorized by the Indian government,” he said.
“I am ready to take India's bullet rather than take a step back and live like a slave. Working toward the independence of the Sikh state of Khalistan is my life's mission, until either I am killed or Punjab becomes an independent country,” Pannun added.

New conspiracy theories hold that Jeffrey Epstein is alive and well
A number of social media users are claiming that late convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein is actually still alive and well. Their supposed proof? Some have shared images they claim show Epstein walking in Tel Aviv, while others have claimed that he’s been playing Fortnite. Turns out the images were doctored, and the Fortnite account belongs to another user entirely. We take a look.
The publication of the Epstein files by the US Department of Justice on January 30 has shone a light on the troubling links between the financier convicted of sex crimes and a number of well-known political figures and business leaders. The release of these documents has also sparked conspiracy theories that Jeffrey Epstein is still alive. Despite the fact that Epstein was discovered dead in his cell in a New York correctional centre on August 10, 2019, some social media users are sharing what they say is proof of life. Turns out, however, there is no basis to this “proof”.
-
Is Epstein alive and well in Israel? Nope, those images were generated by AI
“Israel faked his death,” claimed a social media user on February 5 in a post on X that has since garnered more than six million views. The post features what he claims is a photo of Epstein, alive, sporting white hair and a shaggy beard and walking the streets of Tel Aviv in Israel.
However, the image is entirely fake: it was generated by artificial intelligence (AI). If you run the image through a reverse image search (click here to check out our handy guide), it leads you to the original version of the image posted on the Reddit forum “hardaiimages”, which shares AI-generated images.
The AI-generated image on Reddit features the people’s full bodies, while the X image is cropped at the waistline. This crop was likely made to cut out the indication that the image was generated by artificial intelligence.
If you look closely, there is a diamond shape on the bottom-right corner of the original image posted on Reddit: it’s the logo of Nano Banana, Google’s artificial image generator which is integrated into Gemini, Google’s AI chatbot.
Google Lens also indicates that the image posted on Reddit was “created with Google’s AI”. Images generated by Nano Banana also have an invisible watermark that can be read by SynthID, the tool for detecting AI-generated content in Google Lens.
Social media users also took to X on February 7, 2026 to share another image purported to show Epstein, garnering more than 2.4 million views. In it, Epstein has long hair and a shaggy beard and is wearing a black hoodie. Behind him, you can see a car with red taillights.
Journalist Henk van Ess reported that the image was based on a real photo that had been doctored using AI.
If you run this image through Tineye, a tool for carrying out reverse image searches, then you’ll find the original photo was published on May 27, 2020 – after Epstein’s death – by British tabloid The Sun. The image was taken from a Netflix documentary released in 2020. The car with the red taillights that appears in the image on X also appears in this image, and Epstein is wearing the same clothes in both images.
In the original photo, Epstein is clean-shaven with short hair. The image that circulated on X was doctored, probably using AI, to make his hair and beard long.
-
Is Epstein still playing Fortnite? No – Fortnite claims that the account belongs to someone else
Social media users took to X on February 5 to share an even more incongruous so-called "proof of life" for Epstein. They claimed that the financier was playing the video game Fortnite in August 2025, six years after the announcement of his death. A post featuring this claim garnered more than 7.8 million views on X.
As proof, these social media users shared a screengrab of a Fortnite user with the handle “littlestjeffl1”. They argue the profile is based in Israel, pointing to the presence of an Israeli flag on the avatar.
However, there is no basis to this claim. It does appear that, at one time, Epstein did use the handle “littlestjeffl1” (you can see this on the US Department of Justice website if you search the keywords “littlestjeffl1”). However, the documents posted by the department indicate that he used this handle for his YouTube account. There is no mention of a Fortnite account with the handle littlestjeffl1 in the Epstein files.
A Fortnite official took to X to say that the account littlestjeffl1 did not belong to Jeffrey Epstein. An existing account owner changed his name to this handle:
“A few days ago, an existing Fortnite account owner changed their username from something totally unrelated to littlestjeff1, following the revelation of littlestjeff1 as a name on YouTube.”
The Fortnite official added that there was no sign of the email addresses mentioned in the Epstein files in Epic, the platform that supports the Fortnite game.
“Since the public document releases [of the Epstein files], people have created Fortnite accounts with similar-looking email addresses and user names,” reads the X post from Fortnite.

Opinion | Takaichi’s anti-China stance won’t bolster Japan’s security
As the US-led order unravels, the Japanese prime minister’s militaristic approach goes against the global shift towards cooperation with China
Reading Time:3 minutes
Why you can trust SCMP

Japanese Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi’s landslide electoral victory on Sunday signals a troubling shift: Japan’s unsettling turn to the right. In a post-US-led world order, safeguarding Japan’s security will require reaffirming, not abandoning, its post-war pacifist constitution.
At the recent World Economic Forum annual meeting at Davos, Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney made a telling admission about the US-led international rules-based order: it was never truly fair. Canada benefited from it and tolerated it, but now that it no longer serves Canada’s interests, Ottawa is reassessing its place within it.
This long-overdue critique echoes decades of protest from the developing world, which has consistently challenged this system as unfair and Western-centric. Over the past decade, China, alongside partners in the Global South, has worked to construct alternative frameworks for cooperation – exemplified by the Belt and Road Initiative – that aspire to greater fairness and mutual benefit.

Now, the tide is turning. As leaders from France, the United Kingdom and Canada made their way to Beijing, a new reality became clear: parts of the Global North are starting to align with the vision of a fairer order as a hedge against US President Donald Trump’s imperialistic ambitions.
One non-Western country that benefited from the Western-centric order is Japan. Like the European Union, Japan is recalibrating in response to Trump’s “America first” policy. However, unlike some partners in the West, Tokyo is not hedging towards Beijing. Instead, it is doubling down on a high-stakes strategic confrontation with China.

At the heart of the stand-off are unresolved issues from World War II. Beijing interprets Takaichi’s recent remarks on Taiwan as evidence that Japan is chipping away at the constraints imposed by its wartime surrender. Meanwhile, Tokyo sees China’s rise, shaped by historical grievances and growing assertiveness, as a direct threat to its security and well-being.

Don Lemon pleads not guilty to civil rights charges after covering a Minnesota church protest for his online channel
France
Unknown Publisher

Former CNN host turned independent journalist Don Lemon pleaded not guilty to federal civil rights charges on Friday, February 13, following a protest at a Minnesota church where an Immigration and Customs Enforcement official is a pastor. Four others also pleaded not guilty in the case.
Lemon insists he was at the Cities Church in St. Paul to chronicle the January 18 protest but was not a participant. The veteran journalist vowed to fight what he called "baseless charges" and protect his free speech rights.
"For more than 30 years, I've been a journalist, and the power and protection of the First Amendment has been the underpinning of my work. The First Amendment, the freedom of the press, are the bedrock of our democracy," Lemon said outside the courthouse after his arraignment. "And like all of you here in Minnesota, the great people of Minnesota, I will not be intimidated, I will not back down." Dozens of supporters gathered outside the courthouse, chanting "Pam Bondi has got to go" and "Protect the press."
'We the people have to stand for our rights'
Civil rights attorney Nekima Levy Armstrong was among the other defendants who pleaded not guilty Friday. The prominent local activist was the subject of a doctored photo posted on the official White House social media that falsely showed her crying during her arrest. The picture is part of a deluge of AI-altered imagery that has circulated since the fatal shootings of Renee Good and Alex Pretti by federal officers in Minneapolis amid the Trump administration's immigration crackdown.
Levy Armstrong echoed Lemon's defiant words after the hearing. "We the people have to stand for our rights. We have to stand for the Constitution. We have to stand for our First Amendment rights to freedom of the speech, some freedom of assembly, and freedom of the press," she said.
"Today we have the federal government trying to weaponize the Department of Justice in order to silence us, in order to prevent us from speaking the truth," Levy Armstrong said. "They are trying to prevent us from calling out a manifest injustice."
Protesters interrupted a service at the Southern Baptist church last month, chanting "ICE out" and "Justice for Renee Good," referring to the 37-year-old mother of three who was fatally shot by an ICE officer in Minneapolis.
In total, nine people have been charged under the 1994 Freedom of Access to Clinic Entrances Act in relation to the church protest. The FACE Act prohibits interference or intimidation of "any person by force, threat of force, or physical obstruction exercising or seeking to exercise the First Amendment right of religious freedom at a place of religious worship."
Two more defendants accused in the protest are scheduled for arraignment next week, including another independent journalist, Georgia Fort. Penalties can range up to a year in prison and up to a $10,000 fine.
Serious concerns
Lawyers for Lemon and Fort filed a joint motion with the court on Friday seeking transcripts of the normally secret grand jury proceedings that resulted in the indictments against the nine defendants. They maintained that Lemon and Fort were at the church protest in their capacity as journalists covering the story.
The defense attorneys noted that several judges – including the chief federal judge for Minnesota – found no probable cause to support the complaints that prosecutors first tried to file against the two journalists, so they refused to sign arrest warrants for Lemon or Fort before the government turned to the grand jury.
They said those refusals raise serious concerns about whether the government made misleading or inaccurate statements of law and/or facts to the grand jury. And they expressed concern that President Donald Trump, Attorney General Pam Bondi and other Justice Department officials put undue pressure on prosecutors to charge them. "In the United States of America, we do not prosecute journalists for doing their job. That happens in Russia, China, Iran and other authoritarian regimes. And yet the government sold this unconstitutional mess to the grand jury," they wrote. "Disclosure of the grand jury proceedings is necessary to ensure the government did not mislead or mis-instruct it."
The attorneys also said prosecutors told them they will oppose the motion.
'No 'press pass' to trespass'
Renee Carlson, an attorney with True North Legal, which is representing Cities Church, said in a statement that by pleading not guilty, Lemon and others are "doubling down on their claim that the press can do whatever they want under the auspices of journalism." "The First Amendment does not protect premeditated schemes to violate the sanctity of a sanctuary, disrupt worship services, or intimidate children," Carlson said. "There is no 'press pass' to trespass on church property or conspire to invade religious worship."
The church protest drew sharp complaints from conservative religious and political leaders. White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt warned in a social media post at the time: "President Trump will not tolerate the intimidation and harassment of Christians in their sacred places of worship." Even clergy who oppose the administration's immigration enforcement tactics expressed discomfort.
Another of Lemon's attorneys who was in court Friday is Joe Thompson, one of several former prosecutors who have left the Minnesota U.S. Attorney's Office in recent weeks, citing frustration with the Trump administration's immigration enforcement crackdown in the state and the Justice Department's response to the killing of Good and Pretti.
Thompson had led the sprawling investigation of major public program fraud cases for the prosecutors' office until he resigned last month. The Trump administration has cited the fraud cases, in which most defendants have come from the state's large Somali community, as justification for its immigration crackdown.

Americans are getting chronic illnesses more often and earlier in life, report finds
The cost of health care is also growing more expensive, with two-thirds of U.S. adults worrying about paying the bills
- Bookmark
- CommentsGo to comments
Americans are getting sick more often and earlier in life, according to a new report from health insurance group UnitedHealthcare and the non-profit Health Action Council.
The number of health care claims for Millennials and Gen Zers are rising, leading to a year-over-year growth rate that is nearly double that of Baby Boomers as more young Americans develop chronic conditions earlier in life than other generations.
The report also found that major health events with medical claims exceeding $100,000 a year – such as heart attacks or strokes – are now about twice as common as they were just five years ago, with average monthly claims rising by 40 percent since 2020.
The findings come as rates of multiple cancers have risen in young Americans, and researchers have tied Americans’ ultraprocessed food-heavy diets to premature death and other illnesses.
UnitedHealthcare also highlighted that the cost of health care benefits is outpacing wage growth, as the price of living in America rises and citizens struggle to pay their bills.
“These trends highlight why employers need deeper, more actionable insights to identify emerging risks and gaps in care,” Craig Kurtzweil, the chief data and analytics officer for UnitedHealthcare Employer & Individual, explained in a statement.
“By analyzing claims data alongside geographic and community health factors, we can help employers identify at-risk populations sooner and take targeted steps to help improve outcomes and lower costs.”
A different America
Millennials and Gen Zers have grown up in a different eating environment than Baby Boomers.
Generation X – born between 1965 and 1980 – were the first generation to grow up around ultraprocessed food. Now, the foods, such as frozen pizza and cookies, make up around 60 percent of the U.S. diet.
In an effort to reverse some of the health impacts of ultraprocessed foods, Trump administration health leaders have moved to eliminate synthetic food dyes added to make products more enticing for consumers, as well as changed the food pyramid, placing an emphasis on protein.
Ultraprocessed foods, typically high in bad fats, sodium and sugar, have been linked to increasing rates of obesity that is a risk factor for diabetes, heart disease and cancer.
Still, doctors don’t know exactly what’s behind increasing rates of cancer in young people, although younger screening ages have played a part.
“We have yet to identify any singular reason, although it’s likely related to a multitude of factors — possibly including lifestyle or environmental ones,” UChicago Medicine oncologist Dr. Adam DuVall explained in a statement.
A need for solutions
The report also found other worrisome trends when it comes to Americans’ health.
Health care spending rose by 7.5 percent between 2022 and 2023 and by 7.2 percent between 2023 and 2024, according to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services.
A recent poll of more than 1,400 U.S. adults found that the cost of health care is now the most worrying issue for Americans, with two-thirds concerned about paying for health insurance and out-of-pocket costs.
This comes as the cost of living has remained high, with consumer prices over 24 percent more expensive since the Covid pandemic, according to an August 2025 analysis of Bureau of Labor Statistics data from the personal finance website Bankrate.
UnitedHealthcare proposes two solutions for the problems it highlights that seek to "identify and address rising health risks and make care more affordable."
First, it encourages expanded access to primary care and regular checkups and screenings for younger Americans, to stop small concerns from ballooning into major problems for their health.
Second, the report advises using early intervention programs and predictive analytics to identify people who are the most at risk of health complications.
“When someone shows early signs of a high-risk condition, encourage use of digital health tools, condition support programs and care management outreach that can engage an employee when early indicators of rising risk appear,” UnitedHealthcare says.

DEA quietly resumes anti-drug coordination with Bolivia almost 20 years since its expulsion
A top Bolivian official says the United States has resumed intelligence coordination on counternarcotics efforts with Bolivia under its new president
- Bookmark
The United States has resumed intelligence coordination on counternarcotics efforts with Bolivia under its conservative president, a high-ranking Bolivian official said, reviving a sensitive relationship nearly 20 years after left-wing former President Evo Morales expelled U.S. anti-drug agents from the world’s third-biggest producer of cocaine.
While officials finalize the details of a deal that will see the Drug Enforcement Administration return to the Andean nation, the U.S. has started sharing information on transnational criminal networks with Bolivian law enforcement and helping vet and train officers, Bolivia’s Vice Minister of Social Defense and Controlled Substances Ernesto Justiniano told The Associated Press in an interview late Thursday.
“We are already receiving support in various ways, in the training and integrity analysis of personnel,” Justiniano said. “There is a lot of intelligence, resources, they can provide us, and we need it.”
The DEA did not respond to a request for comment on Justiniano's remarks, his first to foreign media on the U.S. counternarcotics assistance already underway in Bolivia.
The quiet resumption of coordination comes as Bolivian President Rodrigo Paz, a centrist former senator who took office last November, restores full diplomatic relations with Washington after nearly two decades in which Morales’ Movement Toward Socialism party, or MAS, shunned the West in favor of China, Russia, Cuba and Iran.
U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio has praised Paz’s election as a “transformative opportunity for both nations” as the Trump administration overhauls decades of U.S. policy to try to make Washington the dominant world power in the Western Hemisphere.
The exact details of the DEA’s renewed presence in Bolivia are still being hammered out, with Justiniano saying that there were “still a couple more meetings to be held, an agreement to be finalized by the foreign ministry.”
But experts say the agency's return marks an important foreign policy achievement for the U.S. in Latin America, where President Donald Trump's deployment of military force against cartels smuggling drugs galls traditional allies like Colombia and Mexico.
“We have little idea what’s been going on these past 20 years, so having the DEA back there can open a lot of other doors for the U.S.,” said retired U.S. diplomat Daniel Foote, who served in the Peace Corps in Bolivia during the cocaine heyday and later worked on counternarcotics policy in the country. “This is as much about helping Bolivia as it is keeping the U.S. safe.”
Bitter memories of US intervention
Justiniano was equivocal when asked if this renewed U.S. assistance would look like a return to the heavy-handed policies of the late 1990s, when DEA-backed Bolivian forces got into deadly clashes with farmers as they moved in to burn crops that had sustained Indigenous communities for centuries.
He acknowledged the sensitivities, particularly in the coca leaf-growing jungle region near Bolivia's central city of Cochabamba where resentment lingers over Washington's militarized approach. National backlash in 2006 vaulted Morales, a charismatic former coca growers ’ union leader, to power and helped sustain his popularity for an unprecedented three consecutive terms.
“In Bolivia, when it comes to language, you have to be very careful,” Justiniano said. “Are we going to have bases full of gringos here? No, that’s not going to happen.”
But Bolivia “would welcome” the DEA, along with other regional forces, playing a direct role in its interdiction operations on the ground, he said, adding: “We do need to conduct joint operations."
Farmers in the tropical Chapare region are girding for harder-line policies that could impede legal production of coca, the mild stimulant chewed and revered for millennia among Indigenous communities but stigmatized abroad as the raw material for cocaine.
“We will not allow the establishment of any military base in the Cochabamba tropics,” coca growers’ leader Aquilardo Caricari said at a recent press conference, citing the arrests and killings of farmers in the 1990s.
Morales, for his part, has been hiding out in the Chapare for months evading an arrest warrant linked to allegations of statutory rape that he denies. He has not appeared publicly since the Jan. 3 U.S. seizure of his ally, former Venezuelan president Nicolás Maduro amid speculation he may have slipped out of the country.
Bolivia became a 'blind spot'
As the first Indigenous president of majority-Indigenous Bolivia, Morales made coca leaves central to his agenda of resisting foreign meddling and promoting Andean heritage.
Decriminalizing the leaf and extolling its medicinal benefits, he allotted coca plots of 1,600 square meters (1,913 square yards) to farming families and empowered unions to stop excess production.
But the legal market for the plant's traditional use didn't put off the illicit one for its processing into cocaine, officials say, where the prices offered are much higher.
Justiniano claimed that over 90% of the coca grown in the Chapare is now diverted into the cocaine trade, but that obtaining data about drug trafficking in Bolivia has been almost impossible since Morales kicked out U.S. anti-narcotics agents in 2008.
At the time of its expulsion, the DEA had about 100 agents in four offices across the country — the agency’s second-biggest foreign footprint outside Colombia.
Ever since, Foote said, “Bolivia has been a blind spot.”
The once-sleepy city of Santa Cruz in eastern Bolivia is now a thriving hub for traffickers who live in modern, gated suburbs, drawn from as far afield as Albania and China.
Questions linger over DEA return
In an echo of history, Paz is seeking to reclaim Bolivia's place as U.S. ally in the fight against drugs nearly four decades after his father, former President Jaime Paz Zamora, did the same.
By the time Paz Zamora took office in 1989, Colombia's Medellin and Cali cartels had been using Bolivia as an air bridge for years, purchasing semi-processed coca paste for conversion into cocaine powder to distribute globally.
Paz Zamora invited the U.S. military to train Bolivia’s security forces, extradited cocaine kingpins to face charges in the U.S. and dismissed members of his own government accused of taking drug money, remembers Robert Gelbard, the U.S. ambassador to Bolivia at the time.
While the efforts successfully drove down cocaine production, Gelbard said he hoped that this time, under the younger Paz, the DEA wouldn't take “the sort of aggressive approach we followed in the 1990s."
Even if Bolivia wanted the DEA to return with guns blazing, it might not get much cooperation from Washington. The agency ordered the closure of more than a dozen offices worldwide during the Biden administration.
Jaime Aparicio, the former Bolivian ambassador to Washington, expects Trump to be different.
“Drugs are his main enemy in this region,” he said.

ICE to spend $38.3 billion on detention centers across US, document shows

Feb 13 - U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement plans to spend $38.3 billion by the end of the year on detention centers to detain and process tens of thousands of immigrants slated for deportation, according to an overview of the plan published by New Hampshire Governor Kelly Ayotte's office on Thursday.
The document was provided by the Department of Homeland Security after an inquiry Ayotte made following a U.S. Senate hearing on Thursday, her office said in a press release.
ICE plans to buy 16 existing buildings and renovate them to serve as regional processing centers that can hold 1,000 to 1,500 detainees for average stays of three to seven days, according to the plan.
The agency will also open eight large detention centers capable of holding 7,000 to 10,000 detainees for an average of around 60 days that will serve as the "primary location" for immigrants being deported abroad.
In addition, ICE will acquire an additional 10 "turnkey" facilities where the agency already operates, according to the plan.
The plan states that the centers are necessary as ICE prepares for an expected surge of arrests in 2026 after the hiring of 12,000 more agents.
"This new model will allow ICE to create an efficient detention network by reducing the total number of contracted detention facilities in use while increasing total bed capacity, enhancing custody management, and streamlining removal operations," the document reads.
ICE plans to hire contractors to conduct renovations to the buildings to build detention spaces, medical and dental services, cafeterias, lobbies, recreational areas, dormitories, and courtroom spaces. The facilities will ensure the "safe and humane civil detention of aliens," according to the document.
The detention centers will be paid for with funds from the massive spending package the Republican-controlled Congress passed in July 2025. That package, known as the "One Big Beautiful Bill," included an unprecedented $170 billion for immigration enforcement, including $45 billion for detention. The 2024 fiscal year budget included $3.4 billion for immigration detention.
A spokesperson for DHS did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
FACILITIES TO INCREASE ICE DETENTION CAPACITY
ICE expects the facilities to be in operation by the end of November 2026, and they would increase the agency's total bed capacity to 92,600 beds, according to the document.
The number of people in ICE detention has increased by around 74% since Trump took office in January 2025 to more than 68,000 this month, government data show.
U.S. President Donald Trump has overseen a widespread immigration crackdown since returning to office last year. The administration has surged immigration agents into major U.S. cities, boosted arrests of immigrants in the U.S. illegally, cracked down on unlawful border crossings and expanded the pool of people who could be deported by stripping hundreds of thousands of immigrants of temporary legal status.
Despite growing signs of political backlash ahead of next year’s midterm elections, the Trump administration is poised to ramp up immigration enforcement this year with funds Congress gave ICE to hire thousands of agents, detain more than 100,000 migrants at any given time and expand surveillance to track down possible immigration offenders.

UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres has urged the international community "to bridge divides, deliver help and hope to those in need," in a message ahead of the Islamic holy month of Ramadan.
"In a message marking the start of the holy month of Ramadan, the secretary general says this month is a sacred period of reflection and prayer, representing a noble vision of hope and peace," Guterres' spokesperson Stephane Dujarric said during a news conference on Friday.
Secretary-General Antonio Guterres says the Islamic holy month is a sacred period of reflection and prayer, "representing a noble vision of hope and peace."
"Yet, for too many members of the human family, this vision remains distant."
Pointing to war-torn countries from "Afghanistan to Yemen, from Gaza to Sudan and beyond," Dujarric said that "people continue to suffer from conflict, hunger, displacement and discrimination."
"In these difficult and divided times, the secretary-general calls on all to heed Ramadan's enduring message, to bridge divides, deliver help and hope to those in need, and safeguard the rights and dignity of every person," he noted.
The Muslim holy month of Ramadan begins next week.
Fasting from sunrise to sunset during Ramadan is one of Islam's five main pillars.

Bondi attack stories and memories to be preserved in new digital project

Australians are being urged to share their stories of "tragedy, grief, love and support" in a digital project to preserve memories of the Bondi massacre.
Fifteen people were killed in the Bondi Beach attack that targeted a Hanukkah festival on 14 December, shocking Australia and sparking a national focus on antisemitism.
The Sydney Jewish Museum, in a bid to collect the memories of those affected, has launched "Remembering Bondi" — an online resource to share items linked to the attack.
The museum said the project was for local Jews, residents, witnesses and victims' families to read and reflect, as well as to add photos, videos, thoughts and recollections.
"There's been such an outpouring of emotion, certainly a lot of beautiful support and grief but also a lot of love in the weeks following Bondi," museum spokesperson Geoff Sirmai said.
"From the museum's point of view it behoves us to collect everything about it from a historical point of view, to be able to tell the story archivally, curatorially so that the events are preserved for the future."
Launched on Friday, the site had already received many responses, helping to ensure memories endured for future generations, he said.
"People are putting up words, pictures, videos even, they're creating poems, stories and we expect it to be many more."
He said the project would be transferred to a permanent exhibition in mid-2027 at the museum, currently under renovation.
The attack, allegedly carried out by a father and son inspired by the ideology of the self-proclaimed Islamic State group, prompted an outpouring of grief at Bondi, resulting in a large memorial.
The museum said its project continued work that was done to preserve the memorial's "countless tributes", including thousands of flowers, in order to capture the "trauma and tragedy, grief, love and support" that followed the attack.
"With 'Remembering Bondi' we hope to amplify the healing that has already begun through wide community support," head curator Roslyn Sugarman said in a statement.
The project's launch comes after Israeli President Isaac Herzog visited Australia for four days to show solidarity with the Jewish community.
The Israeli head of state's visit sparked large protests in Sydney and Melbourne.

MUNICH, Germany — U.S. officials have countered Europe’s push for technology sovereignty from America with a clear message: It’s China you should worry about, not us.
The European Union is rolling out a strategy to reduce its reliance on foreign technology suppliers. Donald Trump’s return to office has put the focus on American cloud giants, companies like Elon Musk’s Starlink and X and others — with European officials increasingly concerned that Washington has too much control over Europe’s digital infrastructure.
As political leaders and security and intelligence officials met in Germany for the Munich Security Conference, Washington sought to calm nerves. The idea that Trump can pull the plug on the internet is not “a credible argument,” the United States’ National Cyber Director Sean Cairncross told an audience Thursday.

Board of Peace envoy: Technocrats can’t enter Gaza if ceasefire violations persist
In rare public comments since taking on role, Mladenov says Palestinian committee being set up for ’embarrassment’ if proper conditions aren’t in place before it begins operating
Jacob Magid is The Times of Israel's US bureau chief
The Board of Peace’s High Representative for Gaza Nickolay Mladenov said at the Munich Security Conference on Friday that the Palestinian technocratic committee tasked with governing Gaza in place of Hamas cannot enter the Strip if violations of the ceasefire continue.
“We need to make sure that what is happening now with the violations of the ceasefire stops,” said Mladenov, without placing blame on either Israel or Hamas. “If you put the committee tomorrow in Gaza and the violations of the ceasefire continue the way they are now. We’re only embarrassing the committee and ultimately making it ineffective.”
Under US President Donald Trump’s Gaza ceasefire plan, the National Committee for the Administration of Gaza (NCAG), a committee of Palestinian technocrats unaffiliated with Hamas or the Palestinian Authority, is supposed to oversee the reconstruction of the devastated Strip, with backing from the US-led Board of Peace. Mladenov, a former Bulgarian minister and UN envoy to the Mideast, took on his central role on the Board last month.
Mladenov’s comments came as IDF Chief of Staff Lt. Gen. Eyal Zamir said on Friday the military would “respond to any violation” and would not give up on the war objectives of demilitarizing the Strip and disarming Hamas. Zamir, who was visiting Gaza, confirmed that the army has such plans ready to go if the government orders it.
Israel has carried out daily strikes on what it says are terror operatives in Gaza. According to the Hamas-run Gaza health ministry, the death toll since the October ceasefire stands at nearly 600 and includes scores of women and children.
On Friday, the IDF said it had carried out an airstrike against two terror operatives who entered a building on the Israeli-controlled side of the ceasefire line in northern Gaza Thursday night. The air force struck the building “to remove the threat” after the operatives were identified by reservists of the Alexandroni Brigade,” the IDF said.
Also on Friday, a Hamas delegation headed by the terror group’s top negotiator Khalil al-Hayya arrived in Cairo for talks slated to focus on disarmament, an Arab diplomat told The Times of Israel.
Such talks have been taking place for months, but have been largely theoretical since the US has yet to put together a proposal on the decommissioning of weapons that can be formally presented to Hamas.
A US official told The Times of Israel earlier this week that Washington is expected to present its disarmament plan in the coming weeks, but no exact date has been set. In the meantime, Mideast mediating countries Egypt, Qatar and Turkey have been holding talks with Hamas officials to get an understanding of what the group would be willing to accept.
In the absence of an alternative governing body, Hamas has managed to bolster its control on its side of the Yellow Line, to which Israel retreated under the October 9 Gaza ceasefire agreement.
The US took until January to unveil the members of the NCAG, after Israel dragged its feet on approving the names of potential participants, said the Arab diplomat who spoke with The Times of Israel.
Hamas must cede control and disarm, says Mladenov
In the rare public comments since he took on his role, Mladenov, speaking on a panel at the Munich conference, warned against “cementing” the status quo in which the Strip is divided between Israeli- and Hamas-controlled sides.
The way to prevent this was to let the NCAG enter Gaza and take the reins from Hamas, said Mladenov, adding that five conditions had to be met for that to happen.
The first condition, he said, was that Hamas must transfer control over civilian institutions to the NCAG. While the terror group has said it is in the process of doing this, Mladenov stressed that the process is complicated and “requires a little bit more careful planning and verification” — a possible nod to concerns that Hamas would quietly keep controlling government offices behind the scenes.
The second condition for the NCAG to be able to govern in Gaza is that ceasefire violations in Gaza must end, said Mladenov.
The third condition, he said, was that there be “a radical increase in the aid going into Gaza — materials that have been long needed: temporary housing, tents, caravans, medicine, food — everything that is required… so people can quickly see some basic change in their lives.”
Israel maintains a strict ban on dual-use items that it deems capable of being turned into weapons, even as humanitarian organizations have warned that the ban covers life-saving items such as viable shelters from the wind and rain for hundreds of thousands of displaced Palestinians.
The fourth condition cited by Mladenov for NCAG governance is that adequate resources must be procured for the committee. The Board of Peace is slated to host a fundraising meeting in Washington on Thursday, where the US plans to announce several billion dollars in donations, largely from the Gulf countries of the United Arab Emirates, Kuwait and Qatar, Arab diplomats told The Times of Israel this week.
The fifth and final condition is that “we need to make sure that we have an agreed framework in place on the decommissioning of weapons in Gaza,” said Mladenov. Hamas has publicly rejected calls to disarm, but Arab diplomats say the group has privately expressed more flexibility.
New Gaza police expected to play greater role
Mladenov indicated that the new Palestinian police force set to be deployed in Gaza will play a greater role in the decommissioning process than will the still-unestablished International Stabilization Force that is also meant to deploy in Gaza, under Trump’s plan.
The police force “should be able to secure the ground, with the assistance of the ISF. Because if we are relying on international troops — no matter where they come from — to police Gaza, we have a very wrong approach,” Mladenov said.
Earlier this week, two Arab diplomats told The Times of Israel that after initial plans for the NCAG to enter Gaza in late January and early February, those involved now recognize that a specific timeline for the entry cannot be given because the technocratic body doesn’t yet have the tools necessary to govern the enclave.
Asked about the financial priorities of the Board of Peace once it secures its funding, Mladenov said the first aim will be to expand humanitarian aid, the second will be emergency recovery and the third will be security.
“For Gaza to be reconstructed in a way that is sustainable — one, we need to have the [NCAG] inside effectively governing; two, we need to have the process of decommissioning of weapons; and three, we need Israeli withdrawal,” Mladenov said.
Trump’s Gaza peace plan envisions Israel withdrawing from the Yellow Line in tandem with Hamas’s disarmament. However, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has insisted that Israel will maintain overarching security control of the Strip, and Defense Minister Israel Katz has claimed the IDF will also maintain a physical presence in the enclave.
Pressed on where he sees Gaza one year from now, Mladenov said he hopes the NCAG will govern the Strip in cooperation with the Palestinian Authority.
“I hope that we will be significantly advanced on deploying a new security force of Palestinians inside Gaza and Hamas would have given up a significant part of its weapons so that… Israel can withdraw from the Yellow Line,” he said — suggesting Hamas will not have given up all its weapons by then.
Two sources familiar with discussions about the US decommissioning plan for Hamas told The Times of Israel earlier this week that its fundamental principle will be stripping Hamas of weapons that can be used to threaten Israel.
The plan envisions Hamas handing over heavy weaponry and destroying manufacturing sites in addition to incentivizing the handover of lighter weapons by offering funds, jobs and amnesty to those who cooperate, the sources said.
The proposal will focus on one section of Gaza at a time, rather than the entire Strip at once. Accordingly, it will take months to finish, the sources added.
While this may not lead to the recovery of every single weapon belonging to terror groups in the Strip, the US thinks enough pressure from mediators Egypt, Qatar and Turkey can prevent Hamas from holding on to power, keeping its weapons and carrying out attacks.
Focus on immediate aid to Gazans
NCAG’s governance in Gaza, Hamas disarmament and Israel’s withdrawal “are critical if we are ever to return back to the political resolution of the Palestinian question,” said Mladenov. “Because the political resolution of the Palestinian question requires negotiation. It requires one Palestinian leadership over the entire occupied territory, and it requires a dialogue that is facilitated by the United States, Europe and others.”
Mladenov also noted that the November UN Security Council resolution mandating the Board of Peace to oversee Gaza includes a requirement for the PA to undergo significant reforms so that it can replace the NCAG in Gaza “at the end of the transition period.”
Meanwhile, he pushed back on the notion that the Board of Peace and its executive boards will be overseeing the NCAG, arguing that those bodies will instead provide “support, guidance and assistance” to the technocratic committee.
Mladenov said he is focused on getting immediate relief to Gazans.
“Our focus needs to be on making sure that the people of Gaza receive the aid that they require right now, that we put in transparent institutions of governance in Gaza that they have not had for 20 years, and that we make sure that there are no weapons beyond the control of the transitional authority in Gaza.”
He argued that solving the broader Israeli-Palestinian conflict cannot be done if the more immediate issues in Gaza are not addressed.
“Under the current conditions, with Hamas still in Gaza and Gaza divided into two, we’re setting ourselves up for complete and utter failure if we don’t address that. And the price of that daily failure will be paid both by Palestinians and Israelis down the line,” Mladenov said.
Also participating in the panel was senior Emirati official Anwar Gargash, who laid out the framework of Abu Dhabi’s involvement in Gaza.
While the UAE will not contribute troops to the ISF, it will continue leading the humanitarian efforts and leveraging its ties with Israel so that Jerusalem can “see the other perspective,” Gargash said.
He argued that while the immediate focus in Gaza must be on surging humanitarian aid into Gaza, advancing such a response would be futile without a political horizon for Palestinians.
Asked about the absence of a Palestinian representative on the Board of Peace, Gargash said that this should be changed.
“A more equal situation will be for the Palestinians to have their voice — not only on the Board of Peace, but everywhere. Because they are one of the principles, as much as the Israelis are,” he said.
PA President Mahmoud Abbas was not invited by the US to attend the inaugural Board of Peace meeting in Gaza. An Arab diplomat told The Times of Israel that the PA has sought to recruit its allies to convince the US to offer it a spot on the Board of Peace, but Washington has held off on including Abbas. Instead of Abbas, the US has invited NCAG chief commissioner Ali Shaath to attend the Washington event.

Federal agency flags safety shortcomings that 'exposed' workers to explosion at US Steel plant
A federal safety agency investigating an August blast at a U.S. Steel plant near Pittsburgh that left two workers dead says it found safety shortcomings that “exposed” employees to the explosion
- Bookmark
A federal safety agency investigating an August blast at a U.S. Steel plant near Pittsburgh that left two workers dead said it found a series of incomplete, outdated or inadequate procedures and practices that “exposed” employees to the explosion, which happened as workers were flushing a gas valve.
The Occupational Safety and Health Administration fined the company a total of $118,214 and issued 10 citations.
The blast also injured 11 others, including contractors, according to the Chemical Safety Board, a federal agency investigating the explosion.
Before the August blast, Clairton Coke Works had a history of accidents and explosions, and some current and former workers there say poor management and underinvestment have exacerbated air pollution and undermined workplace safety, Pittsburgh’s Public Source and The Associated Press have found.
U.S. Steel has said the explosion happened when workers were flushing a gas valve in preparation for routine planned maintenance at the sprawling riverside industrial facility, the largest of its kind in the Western Hemisphere.
The valve ruptured and released combustible coke oven gas, OSHA said.
In the 16-page report dated Monday, OSHA said that U.S. Steel's written procedures, practices and training to safely maintain equipment and flush the gas valve were incomplete, outdated or inadequate.
Those shortcomings, it said, “exposed” employees to an explosion or explosion hazard when the valve ruptured. Another citation said the U.S. Steel didn't provide required records within a specified time frame after the explosion.
U.S. Steel, in a statement, said it was reviewing the OSHA report. It did not say whether it agreed or disagreed with the findings, or whether it would dispute them.
“We will continue our dialogue with OSHA and other agencies involved,” it said.
The company has said that safety is a core value and shapes its culture.
OSHA gave U.S. Steel deadlines to fix the perceived shortcomings. The agency lets a company contest the findings in an informal conference.
In a statement, the United Steelworkers' district director, Bernie Hall, said the union was “grateful to OSHA for thoroughly investigating the tragic incident that cost two lives and impacted many others.”
“We are dedicated to working with management to implement OSHA’s recommendations — especially those that incorporate process safety management — and continue our mission to make our workplaces safer,” Hall said.
The Chemical Safety Board has said it continues to investigate.
Kurt Barshick, U.S. Steel’s vice president of the Mon Valley Works, said during an October presentation to area residents that workers trapped “3,000 PSI water inside of a valve that’s rated for 50 PSI.” The valve cracked and gas filled the area, Barshick added.
The blast came on top of a string of other accidents at the Clairton plant over time, as well as a long history of legal battles between U.S. Steel and Allegheny County regulators, who regularly accuse the company of flouting environmental rules at the facility.

Roku stock surges on earnings beat, record quarter for premium subscriptions

Shares of Roku jumped 8% on Friday after the video streaming company posted fourth-quarter results that trounced analysts' expectations and offered strong guidance.
Here's how the company did based on analysts' estimates compiled by LSEG:
- Earnings per share: 53 cents vs. 28 cents
- Revenue: $1.39 billion vs. $1.35 billion
"The biggest driver of our subscriptions business is just the secular trend of more and more services moving into a service like premium subscriptions instead of just doing their own app," Roku CEO Anthony Wood told CNBC's Julia Boorstin on Friday. "That's really, I think, the core driver."
Roku executives said in their shareholder letter that the fourth quarter was the "biggest quarter ever" for net adds to premium subscriptions. The program lets users subscribe to different streaming services, like HBO Max and Paramount+, using a single login on the Roku platform.
The company said it expects to roll out premium subscription bundles this year.
Revenue grew 18% from $1.03 billion a year ago. Net income totaled $80.5 million, or 53 cents per share, compared with a loss of $35.5 million, or 24 cents a share, one year earlier.
For the current period, Roku said it expects to report $1.2 billion in revenue, which is higher than the $1.16 billion expected by analysts, according to StreetAccount. It also projected full-year revenue of $5.5 billion, surpassing analyst estimates of $5.34 billion, according to StreetAccount.
Last May, Roku acquired Frndly, a live TV subscription streaming service, for $185 million. The company also recently launched an ad-free streaming service, called Howdy, that costs $2.99 a month.
Wood told investors on the company's earnings call that Howdy has the potential to become a "very large service" over time. Roku also said it's on track to surpass 100 million streaming households this year.
Analysts at Rosenblatt Securities on Friday upgraded Roku's stock to buy from neutral, citing the strong fourth-quarter results and several potential growth levers for the company in the near term.
"Big picture — Roku has built a formidable gatekeeper presence for U.S. streaming — half of all streaming in the U.S. on TVs goes through their devices," the analysts wrote.
Rosenblatt noted the improved ability to monetize streaming with its partnership with Amazon, a new ad tool for small and mid-sized businesses and tweaks made to the front page for advanced ads.
Correction: Roku reported fourth-quarter earnings of 53 cents per share. An earlier version mischaracterized the figure.

Safran Ready to Localize AASM Hammer Production in Other European Countries

French company Safran is open to localizing the production of high-precision AASM Hammer air bombs in other European countries.
This was reported by Vincent Lamigeon, chief reporter for Challenges, citing Olivier Andries, Safran’s chief executive officer.
According to the journalist, Olivier Andries said that he is “completely open” to placing AASM assembly lines in European countries that place large orders for this weapon.
He also confirmed an order for AASM guided bombs by Norway for Ukraine. According to him, “several hundred” high-precision bombs will be delivered as part of this order.
It should be recalled that in November 2025, India and France signed an agreement on the joint production of AASM Hammer high-precision bombs. The agreement to establish a joint venture was officially signed on November 24 in New Delhi by Bharat Electronics Limited (BEL) and Safran Electronics & Defense.
The agreement formalizes a memorandum signed in Liutyi at the Aero India exhibition. The joint venture will be a privately owned company with equal shares and will be based in India.
The venture’s mission is to manufacture, adapt, and provide operational support for AASM Hammer precision-guided bombs for the Indian Air Force and Navy, with a gradual increase in localization to nearly 60%.
AASM is a modular kit that is installed on conventional free-fall bombs. The kit consists of a front section with a guidance system and a rear section with an accelerator designed to increase the flight range.
There are two types of kits: Hammer-250 for 227 kg Mk.82 bombs and Hammer-1000 for 908 kg Mk.84 bombs. The maximum range is from 15 km when used from low altitudes to 70 km when launched from high altitudes.
In June 2025, Safran presented a new modification with increased range at the Paris Air Show — AASM Hammer XLR.

The new version of the AASM XLR has a small turbojet engine installed in the rear, while the previous version used a solid-fuel rocket booster.
It is claimed that this has increased the maximum range from 70 kilometers to 150-200 kilometers when launched from high altitude. In addition to simply increasing the flight range, the use of a jet engine will likely allow the bomb to fly at low altitudes, making it more difficult for enemy air defense systems to intercept.

Breaking Down the Twisty Ending of The Art of Sarah

“If you can’t tell the fake from the real, is it really fake?” This rich line captures the class-infused theme at the heart of The Art of Sarah, Netflix’s latest K-drama offering. Titled 레이디 두아, or “Lady Doir” in Korean, the eight-episode drama follows a woman who will do anything to break out of her working class hell and ascend to the upper class. A non-linear story of revenge, social inequity, and the power of performed identity, The Art of Sarah keeps viewers guessing until the very end.
The Art of Sarah begins with the discovery of a body in the Seoul sewers. Detective Park Mu-gyeong (Love Scout’s Lee Joon-huk), our audience surrogate character, is professionally committed to getting to the bottom of the apparent murder. However, the more he and his team investigate, the less they seem to know. Initially, they verify the identity of the victim using an ankle tattoo and a one-of-a-kind bag. Both point towards Sarah Kim (Dear Hyeri’s Shin Hye-sun), a member of the Seoul elite who just celebrated the Korean launch of the luxury bag brand Boudoir.
However, while trying to determine who might want Sarah Kim dead, Mu-gyeong quickly discovers that Sarah Kim had secrets of her own—in fact, her entire identity was built on them. Then, mid-way through the series, Sarah Kim walks into the police station alive and well, throwing the case into a completely different direction. Let’s break down the twists and turns that lead to The Art of Sarah’s big ending.
Who is Mok Ga-hui?
The character we are introduced to as Sarah Kim did not begin life as Sarah Kim. As we learn through a series of flashbacks told through the testimony of various witnesses to Sarah Kim’s many cons, and from Sarah Kim herself, the persona was created by a working class woman named Mok Ga-hui, a shop girl at Samwol Department Store, selling luxury bags to the uber wealthy and getting drawn toward the high class status the bags represented.
Ga-hui dreams of a better life, one where she could have the means to own a luxury bag herself. But everything goes wrong one night when she takes a bathroom break during a long shift, leaving the shop open for ransacking. Though she has far less money than Choi Chae-u (Bae Jong-ok), the chaebol who runs Samwol Department Store, Ga-hui is the one who must pay the price. She doesn’t lose her job, but she is told she must pay back the cost of the stolen bags: a 50 million won (roughly $34,650) debt.
A struggling Ga-hui turns to the secondhand luxury bag market to make up the debt. She steals the identity badges of other Samwol Department Store workers in order to attend as many employee sales as possible, where she buys the bags at a discount and then resells them for a profit on resale sites. In order to get enough money to continue the hustle at scale, she borrows money from a loan shark.
But these systems weren’t made to be exploited by the working class, and the loopholes soon close. The department store puts a cap on how much one person can buy at employee sales, and Ga-hui is unable to pay the interest on her loan. Rather than allow Ga-hui to pay back the principal, the loan sharks physically force Ga-hui to sign a new loan with a much higher interest rate. Meanwhile, the police start to investigate the luxury bag reseller known as Cheongdam Queen (for the affluent Cheongdam neighborhood associated with luxury shopping), who has been posing as various rich influencers to sell bags.
Convinced she has no way out of the situation, Ga-hui writes a suicide note and throws herself off of a bridge and into a reservoir. Mok Ga-hui is presumed dead in 2018, and the loan sharks and police stop looking for her.
Who is Kim Eun-jae?
But Ga-hui survives and emerges from the reservoir determined to live and do whatever it takes to get the kind of status and money-driven power wielded by those who carelessly caused her suffering. She is reborn as Kim Eun-jae, and takes a job at a hostess club, where she is paid to entertain men. There, she finds her next target: Hong Seong-sin (Queen of Tears’ Jung Jin-young).
Seong-sin is a rich loan shark who is dying of kidney failure. Eun-jae approaches him with a deal. She will give him her kidney in exchange for Seong-sin marrying her and paying her 500 million won (roughly $346,000). He agrees and the two are married. Because spouses must wait a year after marriage before they can donate an organ, Eun-jae moves into Seong-sin’s home.
Over the next year, Seong-sin teaches Eun-jae the ways of the rich. The two begin to truly care about one another. However, that doesn’t mean Eun-jae doesn’t have another con going. She manipulates Kang Ji-hwon (Hierarchy's Kim Jae-won), a handsome man working at a host bar, into caring for her. She insinuates that Seong-sin is a controlling and abusive husband, and that she needs protecting. She sneaks out of her house and the two have clandestine tteokbokki dates around Seoul. Soon, Ji-hwon will do anything she asks.
Meanwhile, Eun-jae begins to lay the foundation for the launch of her luxury bag brand Boudoir. She tells the wealthy women around her about the company used exclusively by European royalty for the past century, and how it hopes to launch in Korea. She calls herself the regional head of the brand, and has Ji-hwon and his host bar colleagues tell all of their clients about Boudoir.
Still, Eun-jae must secure the starting funds. She convinces Ji-hwon to stab Seong-sin, but steps in front of her husband at the last moment. The sacrifice lands Eun-jae in the hospital, but also earns her Seong-sin’s complete trust and devotion. He decides to leave his entire fortune to her.
But we learn that Eun-jae didn’t con Seong-sin just for his fortune. She conned him for the role he played in her darkest moment. Seong-sin owns the loan shark company that forced Eun-jae, when she was Mok Ga-hui, into the inescapable debt that drove her to want to take her own life. In approaching Seong-sin, she planned to give the dying man the hope of a new kidney, only to snatch it away at the last minute.
When Eun-jae disappears before the transplant, Seong-sin sends his men to kill her, but cancels the order at the last second. “I haven’t lost anything. I was the one who agreed to be fooled from the start, so how is that a con?” he tells his goons and Eun-jae over speakerphone, from his hospital bed. Seemingly moved by Seong-sin’s uncharacteristic display of mercy, Eun-jae decides to give Seong-sin her kidney. Following her recovery, she uproots the 500 million won pine tree growing in his garden, and disappears once again. When the world sees her again, she will be Sarah Kim, and she will finish building Boudoir from the ground up.
Who is Kim Mi-jeong, and why does Sarah Kim kill her?
Kim Mi-jeong is the artisan behind the Boudoir bags that would make Sarah Kim millions. After re-inventing herself as American-born, Oxford-educated Sarah Kim, our protagonist needed someone to make the actual goods for the brand she planned on launching. She found Kim Mi-jeong, a runaway working in the sweatshot-like conditions of a knockoff shop. Mi-jeong, who didn’t have the ID necessary to get a legal job, worked alongside immigrants to make the knock-off bags sold at markets across Seoul—and she was really good at it.
After being recruited by Sarah Kim, Mi-jeong also gets a taste of the affluent life and wants more. After successfully impersonating Sarah Kim as a customer in luxury shops across the city, Mi-jeong hatches a plan to kill Sarah Kim and take her place. She gets the same ankle tattoo, and makes sure they both wear the same “one-of-a-kind” dress to the big Boudoir launch party.
When Mi-jeong lures Sarah Kim away and tries to kill her, Sarah Kim gets the upper hand. Mi-jeong hits her head on a table corner, and Sarah Kim soon realizes that it would be better if she could tie up the loose end that is Mi-jeong once and for all. At the party, she agrees to a deal with Choi Chae-u to launch a Boudoir at Samwol Department Store, and has the party’s inventory—including an unconscious Mi-jeong stuffed inside of a case—transported to the store.
Once there, Sarah Kim uses her knowledge of the store’s layout from her time working there as Mok Ga-hui to dispose of Mi-jeong. She sends her down the trash chute and then into the sewer. It would have been the perfect plan, if Mi-jeong were already dead. An injured Mi-jeong wakes up and crawls to a sewer ladder. She dies of exposure before someone can find her, but makes it far enough for Sarah Kim’s crime to be discovered.
The Art of Sarah ending, explained
Detective Park Mu-gyeong manages to piece this all together, but his theory means nothing without evidence. He probably has enough to prove that Kim Mi-jeong planned to kill Sarah Kim, but not enough to prove that Sarah Kim killed Kim Mi-jeong. Mu-gyeong wants the truth to will out and Sarah Kim wants Boudoir to survive no matter what. Boudoir was the dream that kept her alive when she was literally drowning. It is the meticulously crafted, hard-won status she prioritized above all else.
To that end, Sarah Kim realizes her best chance to protect Boudoir is to pretend that she is Mi-jeong and to confess to killing Sarah Kim. Because Sarah Kim is not a real person and Mi-jeong was undocumented, it is impossible to prove who is who. Without a Sarah Kim to prosecute as a scam artist, Boudoir will likely survive.
Detective Park is forced to decide between telling the truth and risk letting a killer go free, and going along with a lie that will lead to that killer’s likely imprisonment. He goes with the latter, and the gambit works for Sarah Kim. Pretending to be Mi-jeong, she is found guilty of murdering Sarah Kim. She is sentenced to 10 years in prison. While there, she is visited by Detective Park, who has since been promoted for his work in “solving” the case. He tells Sarah that Boudoir is doing well without her, and she seems to be happy with how things turned out.
Before they part ways, Detective Park asks her what her name is. Kim Mi-jeong or Sarah Kim or Kim Eun-jae or Mok Ga-hui smiles and stays silent. More than any of those names, her identity was Boudoir. It is why she went to such lengths to maintain the brand’s legitimacy—because it represents her own elite legitimacy, and a victory over all of those who tried to claim it was not something she could build for herself. And, if she can be legitimate, then perhaps the status of the elite-born means nothing at all. Our Lady Doir valued that philosophical victory more than her freedom, more than her wealth, more than any name.

Three men charged after £1M worth of weight loss drugs stolen
Police are urging anyone not to use illegitimate weight-loss products
- Bookmark
Three men have been charged after £1 million worth of weight loss drugs was stolen in St Albans last month.
Phoenix Healthcare Distribution was broken into shortly before 6.40pm on 24 January and large amounts of the medication were stolen from the store, Hertfordshire Police said.
Mark Harding, 55, from Feltham, Peter Costello, 44, and Robert Townsend, 58 from Sutton, were all charged with burglary and acquiring, using or possessing criminal property.
Hertfordshire Police detective chief inspector Tony Fontenelle said: “Thanks to diligent work from officers, we have now successfully secured three charges and the case will now progress through the court system.”
A woman in her 40s from Sutton was arrested on suspicion of assisting an offender and fraud by false representation, and she has been released on bail as police make further enquiries.
Police are urging anyone who has been given weight-loss products at unusually low prices, or by unfamiliar companies or individuals, to get in contact with them.
“I would also like to issue a reminder that these weight loss drugs must be stored correctly and are dangerous if they are not administered in the right way,” Mr Fontenelle said.
“These, along with other pharmaceutical items, should only be prescribed via a healthcare professional or bought through registered companies.”
The three men charged were due to appear at Hatfield Magistrates’ Court on Friday morning, and were remanded ahead of a hearing at St Albans Crown Court on 17 March.
Phoenix Healthcare Distribution centre, where the drugs were allegedly stolen from, delivers medicine to more than 6,700 pharmacies across the UK.

Surprising reason Waymo needs the help of DoorDash drivers
- Waymo has begun paying DoorDash drivers and towing companies to close the doors of its driverless robotaxis, which passengers frequently leave ajar.
- The automated vehicles are unable to move if their doors remain open, causing potential traffic disruption and necessitating human assistance.
- DoorDash drivers have reportedly been offered up to $11 for closing a vehicle′s door, while workers partnered with the towing service Honk can earn up to $20 for the same job.
- Waymo and DoorDash confirmed this arrangement is part of a pilot scheme, with Waymo indicating plans to install technology for automatic door closure in the future.
- Beyond door issues, Waymo robotaxis also face operational challenges during power outages, struggling to navigate non-functional traffic signals, though the company aims to expand to several new US cities by 2026.

Standoff over masked agents fuels the latest partial government shutdown
-
Click here to listen to this article - Share via
- Democrats and Republican leaders are deadlocked over funding for the Department of Homeland Security.
- Negotiations stalled as Democrats push for immigration enforcement reforms, including banning federal officers from wearing masks.
WASHINGTON — A dispute over whether federal immigration agents should be allowed to wear masks during enforcement operations has become one of the biggest obstacles to keeping the Department of Homeland Security funded, pushing the government toward a partial shutdown early Saturday.
Democrats have described the practice as corrosive to public trust, arguing that masked agents create the appearance of a “secret police” force. Republican lawmakers, President Trump and his top advisors, meanwhile, have drawn a hard line against requiring officers to remove their face coverings, insisting that doing so would expose them to harassment, threats and online doxxing.
“They want our law enforcement to be totally vulnerable and put them in a lot of danger,” Trump said at a White House event Thursday. He added that it would be “very, very hard to approve” Democrats’ demands, such as unmasking federal officers.
The standoff over masking stalled negotiations as lawmakers raced to meet a funding deadline for the Department of Homeland Security at midnight Friday. Without a deal, key agency functions — from airport security to disaster relief coordination — could be affected if the shutdown drags on.
As with every shutdown, the agency’s essential functions will continue to operate, Tricia McLaughlin, assistant Homeland Security secretary for public affairs, said in a statement. But employees performing those functions at agencies such as the Federal Emergency Management Agency, the Coast Guard, and the Transportation Security Administration could go without pay if the shutdown stretches for weeks.
The report, commissioned by L.A. County officials, found that 82% of businesses surveyed reported negative impacts from immigration enforcement, with 44% losing more than half their revenue.
The heads of those agencies told the House Homeland Security Appropriations Subcommittee on Wednesday that the shutdown is expected to create severe and lasting challenges.
Vice Adm. Thomas Allan, the acting vice commandant of the Coast Guard, said a shutdown would delay maintenance for boats and aircraft, and halt pay for 56,000 active-duty reserve and civilian personnel. Ha Nguyen McNeill, acting administrator of TSA, recounted how the last government shutdown affected her workers and spiked wait times at airports.
“We heard reports of officers sleeping in their cars at airports to save money on gas, selling their blood and plasma and taking on second jobs to make ends meet,” she said, adding that some are still recovering from the financial impact.
Operations within U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement and Customs and Border Protection — the agencies that are central to the budget impasse — are likely to be the least affected. That’s because both agencies still have access to $75 billion in funding approved last year as part of Trump’s “big, beautiful bill.”
By midday Friday, it remained unclear when the partial shutdown would end, as lawmakers left Washington for a security conference in Munich and progress between Democratic and White House negotiators remained nebulous.
“We’ll see what happens,” Trump told reporters on Friday when asked about cutting a deal. “We always have to protect our law enforcement.”
The partial government shutdown comes at a moment of acute public anger at the agency’s approach to immigration enforcement, which has included the fatal shootings of two U.S. citizens, Renee Good and Alex Pretti, in Minneapolis.
Since the shootings, the Trump administration has tried to quell tensions. Border policy advisor Tom Homan said Thursday that the administration was ending its immigration crackdown in Minneapolis. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem announced earlier this month that the agency would be acquiring and issuing body cameras to federal agents. Trump also said he wants to employ a “softer touch” to immigration enforcement after the killings of Good and Pretti.
But Democrats maintain that they need reforms written into law. Among their demands is requiring officers to wear and turn on body cameras, banning them from wearing masks, and ending the practice of “roving patrols” and instead requiring that they carry out only targeted operations.
“We will not support an extension of the status quo, a status quo that permits masked secret police to barge into people’s homes without warrants, no guardrails and zero oversight from independent authorities,” Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said on the Senate floor Thursday.
Todd M. Lyons, the acting director of ICE, told a Senate panel Thursday that he does not want to see federal agents masked either, but said he is hesitant to bar face coverings because the threats to agents are too severe.
“I would work with this committee and any committee to work with holding individuals accountable that doxx ICE agents, because ICE agents don’t want to be masked,” Lyons said. “They’re honorable men and women, but the threats against their family are real.”
Federal immigration officials are more supportive of body cameras.
U.S. Customs and Border Protection Commissioner Rodney Scott told a House committee on Tuesday that he supports expanding the use of body cameras, but said more funding is needed to hire personnel to oversee the rollout.
“Fund the entire program so that we can be transparent and that we can make sure America knows what we’re doing, because that trust is critically important,” he said.
Ben Johnson, executive director of the American Immigration Lawyers Assn., said that while the White House has made some “tweaks around oversight,” its actions continue to fall short.
The bill, called the Safeguard American Voter Eligibility, or SAVE America Act, would require Americans to prove they are citizens when they register to vote, mostly through a valid U.S. passport or birth certificate. It would also require a valid photo identification to vote.
The association, which represents 18,000 immigration attorneys, has urged Congress to refuse more funding for ICE and CBP before implementing reforms.
“The American public wants and deserves real, meaningful guardrails that are written into law that ensure this administration — and, quite frankly, any administration — will abide by the Constitution and respect fundamental principles of due process,” Johnson said Wednesday on a call with reporters.
“Congress has a critical opportunity right now to meet that demand,” he added.
So far, Democrats maintain they will continue to block funding bills without accountability measures in place.
California’s two Democratic U.S. senators, Adam Schiff and Alex Padilla, were among the Senate Democrats who helped block passage of funding bills Thursday that would have averted a shutdown because they lacked accountability measures.
“I will not support more funding for ICE until there are new guardrails to rein in its lawless conduct,” Schiff wrote on X. “I’m a no on anything but real reform.”
Padilla said he would be a “firm no” until lawmakers agree that federal immigration officers need to be held accountable.
“Donald Trump and Republicans want Americans to forget about their lawless immigration roundup, but we won’t,” Padilla said.

French and German foreign ministers revive talks with Beijing counterpart to respond to US-China divide-and-rule tactics and bolster European unity
In what was described as part of a larger effort to prevent the world’s superpowers from picking Europe apart, France’s Jean-Noel Barrot and Germany’s Johann Wadephul hosted Wang, reviving a configuration not seen since the days of French President Emmanuel Macron’s first term.
“If we do not stick together, then we are screwed,” said one official, explaining the decision.
“They look at which country has which sector, be it French brandy or German cars, and they find it very easy to divide us. We need to stop this and start thinking about this together.”
Wang said the meeting – the first trilateral talks by these ministers – was “both an innovative move in response to the changing circumstances and an important opportunity to conduct strategic communication”.

Ukrainian top diplomat says ending Ukraine war ‘unrealistic’ without Trump, rules out territorial concessions
Foreign Minister tells Munich Security Conference that Kyiv has ‘feasible proposals;’ rejects peace deal at expense of sovereignty
ISTANBUL
Ukrainian Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha said Friday at the Munich Security Conference that ending the Russia-Ukraine war is “unrealistic” without US President Donald Trump.
He stressed that Kyiv has feasible proposals for peace but will not compromise its territorial integrity.
Speaking at a panel titled, “In Focus – Security Guarantees for Ukraine,” Sybiha said three rounds of talks were held in Abu Dhabi in a trilateral format involving Ukraine, the US and Russia.
“We are making progress. And we are grateful to our American friends, because without Trump it is unrealistic to end this war. Under American leadership, we can make progress, but at the same time, we need to continue to put pressure on Russia. We still have the tools; we have to recognize this, this leverage,” he said.
Sybiha added that Moscow shows no willingness to engage in serious negotiations.
“Instead, the Ukrainian side has feasible proposals. What we have now: the Americans are in the process, which is great. Under Trump’s personal leadership, we have a chance to accelerate our peace efforts. And Ukraine is ready with our feasible proposals. Naturally, no peace agreements at the expense of our territorial integrity and sovereignty,” he said.
Referring to a reported 20-point peace framework, Sybiha said only three issues remain at the level of leaders, reiterating that Kyiv is prepared for concrete steps.
He also voiced hope that the next round of talks would focus on action rather than rhetoric. “This is not about the process, it’s just that now is the time for action and for concrete steps,” he said.

Trump hails US ‘discombobulator’ weapon as he meets Maduro op troops
The US president made his first public comments on a device that he boasted could block Russian and Chinese defence systems
President Donald Trump boasted on Friday about a secret US “discombobulator” weapon that can block Russian and Chinese defence systems, as he met the elite troops who captured Venezuelan leader Nicolas Maduro.
Trump’s comments at the Fort Bragg military base in North Carolina marked the first time he has talked about the mysterious device at a public event, after previously letting some details slip in interviews.
“They even talk about the discombobulator, because they never got a shot off,” Trump told soldiers at the base, referring to the suppression of much of Venezuela’s defensive systems during the January 3 raid.
“The Russian equipment didn’t work. The Chinese equipment didn’t work. Everyone’s trying to figure out why it didn’t work. Someday you’re going to find out, but it didn’t work.”
Trump, who was accompanied by his wife, Melania, addressed soldiers and military families before meeting the special forces troops involved in the raid.
That night, the entire world saw what the full military might [of] the US military is capable” of, the president said. “It was so precise, so incredible.”

Breezy Johnson on Winning Olympic Gold and Getting Engaged in the Same Week

Other athletes have won more gold medals at these Milano Cortina Olympics than American ski racer Breezy Johnson, who finished first in the women’s Olympic downhill competition on Feb. 8. For example, her counterpart on the men’s side—Switzerland’s Franjo von Allmen—has three: he swept the downhill, team combined, and super-G.
Still, has anyone had a better Olympics than Johnson? The Jackson Hole native won one of the most prestigious races at the Games, as the downhill is sort of like the 100-m dash at the Summer Games. What’s more, Johnson, 30, won her Olympic title on the same mountain in Cortina d’Ampezzo, Italy, where she crashed before the Beijing Games: she tore her ACL and missed those Olympics. Two days after her downhill victory, Johnson skied the fastest time on the downhill portion of the team combined competition (Mikaela Shiffrin's subpar slalom run cost the Johnson-Shiffrin pairing a medal).
On Thursday, Johnson crashed out of the super-G race. But her day ended on the highest of notes. Her boyfriend, Connor Watkins, proposed to her at the bottom of the Cortina slope. Johnson said yes.
The morning after her whirlwind day, Johnson talked to TIME about her life-changing Games, the mixed emotions of winning a downhill on the same day teammate Lindsey Vonn broke her leg in a scary crash, and her ski-racing future.
(This interview has been edited and condensed for clarity).
We’re speaking at 9 a.m. Italy time the morning after your now-fiancé proposed. Your Olympics ended yesterday. You have a gold medal and now an engagement ring. Weren’t you up late celebrating? Shouldn’t we be having this conversation at 2 in the afternoon?
My family knows I am early to bed, early to rise. I would have loved to have stayed up superlate. We stayed up until what I thought was late, which was like 10, talking.
How did you celebrate?
We did an Italian tradition. You bring a bunch of your family and friends together and you have a little party. And so we got the team together. Connor had the whole thing already set up. We had some champagne, we cut a cake, and then we went and had some pizza.
Were you surprised the proposal happened in the way that it happened?
I mean, you don't get engaged to somebody in front of the whole world at the Olympics without them telling you a little bit. When we started getting really serious, I was like, “I always kind of had this concept of getting engaged at the Olympics.” I hadn't really had somebody to talk seriously about it with.
A year ago, he goes, “Are you serious about that?” Growing up, you love the idea of winning the Olympics. But there is something really special about those moments where people share it with the people that they love. And I was like, “What better way than to combine the two loves of my life?”
Then it was on him to plan it. In the end, the Italian President almost ruined the whole thing. He was coming down to the stadium, and then it was like, “Well, you can't move. The Italian President's moving.’”
Connor’s words were just so sweet. I just started crying. I had no idea that it was going to go as viral as it did. The whole thing definitely grew legs and ran.
The two of you met on Bumble. He didn’t know you were a professional ski racer. Was that a good thing?
When you’re on dating apps, you want to get to know other people. And it's kind of hard when the first thing they hear is that you're an Olympian. Because that’s all they want to know about. I had one ski picture. Because I like to ski and I like people that ski. But I was trying not to be overtly, “Oh my gosh, I'm this big deal.”
We started talking. Then, it's like, “Well, what do you do?” And I was like, “Oh, I'm a skier.’ And then he goes, “Are you a ski instructor?’” “No, for the U.S. team.” At that point, people's eyes kind of turn into big washers. They're like, “Oh my God.” But he was good about it.
Watkins also gave you a piece of wood carved with words from Taylor’s Swift’s song “The Alchemy.” Then Swift congratulated you in the comments of your Instagram post about the engagement, adding another lyric from that song: “Where’s the trophy? He just comes running over to me.” What was your reaction to that?
We were at dinner and somebody said, “Oh my God, Taylor Swift commented.” I was like, “On what?” They said, “Your post.” Then I was like, “I have to find this. I have to see this with my own eyes.” Incredible. I never expected that. It was so cute. We started dating at a similar time as she and Travis Kelce. Then “The Alchemy” came out. We were just moving in together at that point. It's one of our favorites.
Well, I guess we have to talk about Olympic skiing?
[Laughs]
During your winning downhill run, are you thinking to yourself, “I can feel my speed and know I can win this thing”? Or are you more thinking about trying to get to the finish line safely?
You feel the speed. I also knew that I was a little bit wild in certain places. I got a little bit twisted up. I knew that there's still terrain all the way to the finish. It wasn't going to matter that I skied the top well. Once I came across the line, I saw the time, and I was like, “I think that's for sure good enough for a medal. And it might be gold.” I was definitely pretty psyched.
You were in the leader’s chair when Lindsey crashed. What was that experience like?
I watched her go into that uphill double, and she was really clean and charging. And I was like, “Oh sh-t, this could be a good run.” And then it was immediately over. There’s a speaker. I thought I could hear her screaming in pain. That's just never something you want as a human being or as a teammate or as a friend. That was hard to hear.
Have you gotten a chance to talk to her?
She texted me the morning after. So we talked a little bit. In my experience, two weeks after is when things get really hard. And so I'm going to wait for things to die down a little bit on her side and then reach out and see how she's doing.
After you and Mikaela finished fourth in the team combined, you both seemed genuinely happy your teammates Jackie Wiles and Paula Moltzan came away with a bronze. You and Mikaela are close childhood friends. How is she doing before she competes in the giant slalom on Feb. 15 and the slalom on Feb. 18?
It's hard to lose an Olympic medal. But as an athlete, you can't go into any event with the expectation that you're just going to win. I talked to her afterwards, because she felt really bad. She felt like she hadn't lived up to her side of the bargain. And I was like, “You didn't go out there being ‘I'm just gonna chill because it should hopefully be fine.’ I could see that you were trying. You're skiing in really tough conditions. It didn't work out. In many ways, I felt worse for her. Because I felt like I had the way easier half. Which was basically, just don’t DNF. Mikaela can make up almost any deficit.
She had the much harder challenge. You have the lead. Everybody expects that you should not only be able to win this but dominate it. So I have continued to talk to her and been, “Your process has made you a champ.” The media has been very tough on her. I wanted to jump in there with some of those outlets and say, “Hey, we go out every day and we try. Just because she's the winningest skier of all time doesn't mean she wins every day.”
It sucks for you guys that that happens at the Olympics. It feels like that shouldn't happen, but that is just the reality of the sport. That's one of the things that makes the sport so amazing. It's not ever guaranteed.
I just want her to be able to go get her flowers. And it sort of hurts me to see people who use my performance as a means to tear her down more.
There’s an unbelievable stat about you: your only race wins are at last year’s world championships and at this year’s Olympics. You’ve never won a World Cup race. That’s like a golfer never winning a weekly tour stop in Connecticut or Hilton Head, S.C., but then winning a couple of Masters. What makes you rise to the occasion in big moments? Where does Big Game Breezy come from?
In many ways, I just continue to try to do my same plan and try to keep the Olympic Games small. I'm out there every day in the World Cup trying to win. It's just a testament to how competitive the sport is. I was doing some interviews before the Olympics, and people were like, “You don't have a podium yet this season.” [Johnson did finish third in a World Cup super-G on Jan. 31]. Blah, blah, blah. Everything has so many variables that all have to come together. They finally did. And hopefully, we can take that ball rolling and show that Big Game Breezy can be Small Game Breezy in the next World Cup.
We’ve spoken about how tough it was to sit out the 2024-2025 season due to suspension for three missed drug tests. You’ve attributed the “whereabouts” violations to human error and said you’ve never intentionally dodged a test. Some critics have knocked your explanation. Do you think this performance erases all questions about what happened?
That's more for other people to decide. I made an excellent comeback from everything. I was still having anxiety attacks right after the downhill. That because I won Olympic gold, people from WADA were going to see that and be like, like, “There's no way. We have to figure out how to ban her again. We can't have this success story after everything that happened.” I'm just grateful to have so many impressive results and things for people to be proud of in front of that suspension.
How long do you plan on skiing? Do your Olympic gold and engagement change the calculus at all?
I have no plans of stopping. Lindsey showed that people can do it a lot longer than anybody thought. I'm going to keep skiing. I definitely would love to do at least another quad. Obviously, the Salt Lake Olympics would be crazy. I have my little cat family. I don’t have any baby fever yet. The cat family is really, very fulfilling to me.
OK, in one word, please describe the Milan Cortina Olympic experience for you.
I’m going to go two. I’m going to go “full circle.” Full circle of family. Full circle of redemption, with the Cortina slope. Yeah. Full circle.

Climate inaction poses growing economic, security risks, leaders warn at Munich Security Conference
California governor criticizes Trump’s climate - US governor criticizes Trump’s climate rollbacks as leaders urge faster global action
ISTANBUL
Political and business leaders warned that climate inaction poses mounting economic and security risks during a panel Friday at the Munich Security Conference.
Speaking at a discussion titled. “Playing With Fire: The Need for Decisive Climate Action,” California Gov. Gavin Newsom criticized US federal environmental rollbacks and urged accelerated clean energy investment.
Newsom accused US President Donald Trump of dismantling key federal climate regulations, including rules tied to the endangerment finding that underpins limits on greenhouse gas emissions.
“It is Code Red in terms of American leadership,” Newsom said, adding that the state of California is evidence that cutting emissions can coincide with economic growth.
Describing the state as the world’s fourth-largest economy if it were a country, Newsom said California ran on 100% clean electricity nine out of 10 days last year, with renewables providing about two-thirds of its power mix.
Since 2000, the state’s economy has grown 81% while greenhouse gas emissions have declined 21%, he said, adding that clean energy jobs outnumber fossil fuel jobs seven to one.
Andrew Forrest, executive chairman of Australian mining company Fortescue, framed climate action as a financial imperative. He said his company, which burns roughly 1 billion liters of diesel annually, will begin switching to a fully green energy grid next year -- a move he said will save about $1 billion annually.
“I love organic life, and where the hardcore proof that what we're seeing with climate denialism, with rolling back the clock to oil and gas only is very bad economics, and that's my only argument,” he said.
Lidia Pereira, a Portuguese member of the European Parliament, cited severe storms in her country as evidence of worsening climate effects and called for greater investment in clean technologies across Europe.
Ralph Regenvanu, Vanuatu climate minister, emphasized the role of international law, referencing a recent advisory opinion from the International Court of Justice affirming that states have obligations to address climate change.
Panelists agreed that climate change is no longer body_abstract, pointing to wildfires, floods and rising financial risks as evidence that faster and more coordinated global action is needed.

What to do if you bought the now bankrupt gift cards from Costco
- Gift card vendor Synergy World has declared bankruptcy, leading to the discontinuation of its restaurant gift card program across six US states.
- The San Diego-based company, which had operated for 19 years and sold cards through Costco, cited bankruptcy as the reason for its closure.
- Synergy World initially set a redemption deadline of Jan. 31 for cardholders, but the program was discontinued earlier due to an overwhelming rush of customers.
- The abrupt shutdown caused confusion among cardholders and restaurants, with some restaurant owners reporting that Synergy stopped communicating and cards ceased to work.
- Costco is reportedly offering refunds or store credit for unused Synergy gift cards, while some local restaurants have swapped them for their own gift cards.

United States President Donald Trump's administration has ended temporary protected status for Yemeni people, Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem said on Friday.
The decision to end humanitarian protections that grant deportation relief and work permits to more than a thousand Yemeni nationals was taken after determining that it was against the US "national interest," Noem said.
TPS provides relief to people already in the US if their home countries experience a natural disaster, armed conflict, or other extraordinary event. The Trump administration has sought to end most enrollment in the program, saying it runs counter to US interests.
Yemenis 'no longer meet requirement'
"After reviewing conditions in the country and consulting with appropriate US government agencies, I determined that Yemen no longer meets the law's requirements to be designated for Temporary Protected Status," she said.
Around 1,380 Yemeni nationals were covered by the temporary protected status as of March 31, 2025, according to the US Citizenship and Immigration Services. The status was last extended in 2024 and was set to expire on March 3 this year.

Israel’s bobsled team is chasing more than medals in its first Olympic outing in Milan
Unknown

No matter what happens when Israel’s bobsled team hits the ice next week at the 2026 Winter Olympics, team captain Adam “AJ” Edelman has already had a year for the history books.
The 34-year-old Brookline, Massachusetts, native is the first Orthodox Jewish athlete to compete at the Winter Olympics, and now the first Israeli to qualify for the Games in two sports. He placed 28th in skeleton at the 2018 Olympics in PyeongChang, South Korea.
But for Edelman, the 12-year journey that culminated in Israel’s first-ever Olympic bobsled appearance - which he has nicknamed “Shul Runnings,” a spin on the 1993 movie about Jamaica’s bobsled team - is about more than success on the track.
“The Olympics were never a goal,” Edelman told the Jewish Telegraphic Agency in an interview prior to the Games.
“The Olympics were the tool, or the stepping stone, to get to the goal, which was to fundamentally redefine, or change, how our community, both the Israeli and the Jewish one, views investment into and the role of sport.”
Edelman’s journey began in 2013, when Israel attempted to recruit him to play for its national hockey team. Hockey had been Edelman’s first sport, which he played through college at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, where he was the first Shabbat-observant player in program history.
Edelman discussed the idea with the long-time alumni director of his Jewish day school, Brookline’s Maimonides School. Mike Rosenberg pointed something out to Edelman that ultimately sparked a calling.
“AJ, no one from this school has ever gotten to the level of sport beyond high school that you’ve gotten to that didn’t go to, let’s say, [Yeshiva University] or Brandeis,” Edelman recalls Rosenberg, who died last year, telling him about the two historically Jewish colleges.
Edelman couldn’t believe that. Out of thousands of Maimonides alumni (including his older brother, Emmy award-winning comedian Alex Edelman), only Edelman, who called himself “not a very gifted athlete,” had reached that level? He had a theory as to why that might be.
“I came to the conclusion that it had to be a self-selection process,” Edelman explained. “That people were selecting out of sport as a journey before they got to that level. And why were they doing it? Because there was no priority placed on sport. It wasn’t something people in our community aspired to do or invest in.”
Edelman said the lack of investment in sports led to a lack of infrastructure and a dearth of role models for Jewish kids to look up to. He set out to change that - to “be the change.”
“The only way to do that was a certificate, so to speak, of excellence in sport, and that’s the Games,” he said. “The Games are essentially the certificate of, ‘you did something.’ So in that way, the Olympics became very, very much the tool for which I wanted to make the change.”
Edelman began training in skeleton after graduating from MIT in 2014. His initial scouting report was not promising: he was told he was “not athletic, would never make the Olympics, and would never be competitive in sliding sport.”
That did not deter him. Edelman moved to Israel in 2016, where he kept training, teaching himself the sport on YouTube when he couldn’t afford a coach. He ultimately clinched Israel’s first sliding sport Olympic appearance in 2018.
Then the pandemic hit. Edelman was pursuing an MBA at Yale University when classes were suspended. Edelman was visiting Jordana Balsam, a close friend who is an attorney in New York City, when the Olympics came up.
“He was telling me about his history with skeleton, and how he competed in the 2018 Games, and how he was actually really intrigued by bobsled,” Balsam recalled. “And in an offhand comment, I’m like, ‘Well, why don’t you pursue that, since you have this time off from Yale?’ And I guess something clicked in his brain, where he was just like, ‘Yes, I’m gonna do that.’ And the rest is history.”
Edelman began working toward bringing Israel to the Olympics in bobsled. Again, there were hurdles. He had to recruit a team from scratch. Israel’s own athletic authorities were skeptical - its Olympic committee almost didn’t accept an invitation to the 2026 Games. Funding was practically non-existent. Still, the team continued training, ultimately missing out on Olympic qualification for the 2022 Games by 0.1 seconds.
Then came October 7, 2023, and the subsequent Gaza war, in which five members of the team were called into combat and multiple team sponsors backed out. Still, Edelman kept his eye trained on the 2026 Games. He used Instagram DMs to recruit a new team, most of whom play other sports and had never been in a bobsled, which also features Israel’s first Druze Olympian, Ward Farwasy.
Israel ultimately qualified in late January at an event in Lake Placid, the same location where Edelman had been told 12 years ago that he’d never make it. The team often trains there, as well as in Park City, Utah, British Columbia, and elsewhere. Edelman said he is rarely in the same place for more than a few weeks at a time.
“Once he had something in his head - an idea, a concept, a goal that he has - he dives into it 200%, and it’s something that I admire greatly,” Balsam said. “I’ve never seen anyone so dedicated to their craft, to their sport, to their goal. It really is inspirational.”
Olympic-sized obstacles
But even qualifying for the Games didn’t end the obstacles. Due to Olympic security, Edelman said his team’s training time in Cortina was limited. Then the team’s apartment in the Czech Republic, where they were training prior to leaving for Italy, was robbed on February 7. Edelman said thousands of dollars in personal belongings, including passports, were stolen.
Throughout the process, Edelman said the wave of support, particularly from American Jews, has been “pleasantly surprising” - especially compared to the reaction after he qualified in 2018, which he called more of a “blip.”
That support has manifested through donations and merchandise sales, with Edelman fundraising to support the team’s Olympic costs. There has also been ample news and social media coverage, inside the Jewish and Israeli communities and out. US Ambassador to Israel Mike Huckabee has given the team a shoutout, too.
Edelman said the positive response has been all the validation he needed.
“There was a constant question of, at the end of the road, you’re doing this for a reason, right?” he said. “ And the only reason to do this is for the goal, the goal of making a change. Of people caring about sport. Of being the change. So if the change doesn’t come and it doesn’t make an impact, then all of it is irrelevant… I think that, from what we’ve seen in the last [several weeks], the answer is an unequivocal yes. It was 100% worth it.”
In Israel, sports fans are proud of the historic nature of the bobsled team’s Olympic appearance, but the story has not broken through to the same extent, according to David Wiseman, who lives in Jerusalem and runs the popular “Follow Team Israel” Facebook page that tracks Israeli sports.
“The media are very football [soccer] and basketball-centric, so they get all the headlines,” Wiseman said. “Someone like Deni Avdija gets significantly more coverage. They know of him being the first Israeli to play in the [NBA] All-Star game far more so than this. They think it’s cool that [Edelman] made it, but they don’t devote any more thought to it. Independent of Israel, bobsled is a niche, niche sport.”
Still, Edelman and some of his supporters have seized on the narrative draw of Israel’s underdog bobsled story, not to mention the apartment break-in and other obstacles, to amplify an almost muscular form of pro-Israel advocacy. Edelman commonly uses the phrase “victors, not victims,” in reference to his team and to Israel’s spirit more broadly.
Jared Firestone, who is representing Israel in skeleton in Italy, said there was “no chance I’d be here without AJ’s guidance.” Edelman helped coach Firestone in skeleton after he made aliyah in 2019, and the pair co-founded the nonprofit Advancing Jewish Athletes to support other Jews in sports.
“I think it means so much to Israelis and to the Jewish community at large to see, with a little investment, how much can be accomplished,” Firestone said. “Unfortunately for me and AJ, we’ve had to dedicate so much of our time that could’ve gone to training and progressing on the ice to fundraising, but hopefully we’ll be inspiring people who could help to create that infrastructure so the next AJ and Jared could just focus on sport and being even better than we are.”
Balsam, who also serves as a director of Advancing Jewish Athletes, said it’s hard to articulate how meaningful Edelman’s achievement of making the Olympics is to him and to her.
“AJ has been very, very passionate about trying to cultivate the idea that sports can be a career path for Jewish kids,” she said. “He wanted to make it to the Olympics. He wanted to show that this is possible. So for him to combine both of his passions and achieve his dream, I think, is something that he can’t put into words, that I can’t put into words, but it’s just immense pride.”
Now comes the actual tournament. Israel will compete in the two-man races on February 16 and 17 and in the four-man races on February 21 and 22, with Edelman piloting the sleds. His Shiba Inu Lulu, the team’s mascot, is staying with Balsam in New York, where they’ll be cheering him on.
But no matter where Israel places, Edelman has one more box to check to fully accomplish his mission to change Israeli sports.
“There is one thing that I wish beyond anything, and it’s that I’m not the only one to do it,” he said. “ What I really wanted to accomplish through it was that someone else saw it and decided to do it themselves. That they saw that pathway opened by someone who was less than stellar, who was not, like, a God-gifted athlete, and went, ‘You know what? I’m pretty good at what I do. I can do that.’
“You have to leave it better than you found it, and it has to be for a purpose, and that purpose is always going to be to inspire someone to do it better than you did.”

Adir Miller's Reset: A midlife crisis comedy falls short of expectations

Adir Miller is Israel’s best-loved stand-up comedian, and there has been much fanfare about Reset, his new series on Keshet 12, which debuted on Tuesday night, so I went into it with high expectations but left disappointed.
Miller has had two previous hit comic series, Ramzor (aka Stoplight), about three buddies at various stages of maturity, and Miller’s Crossing, in which he played a version of himself. Now that he’s in his 50s, he’s made a series about a guy in his 50s, and his biggest fans will probably enjoy this one as much as his previous sitcoms, but those who aren’t into his stand-up humor will want to give this a pass.
In Reset, he plays Gidi, an underappreciated army intelligence officer who discovers that middle age brings with it a slew of narcissistic insults. His younger colleagues barely listen to him and his boss is obsessed with him tucking in his shirt; his wife (Miri Mesika) doesn’t want to have sex anymore but does want to talk about their more mundane problems in pointless couples therapy; his aspiring influencer daughter only speaks to him when she wants money or a ride; his father is in a coma; and his doctor wants him to have a colonoscopy – what more could go wrong? Well, his doctor tells him that he doesn’t need a colonoscopy after all, because it turns out he has only a few weeks to live.
This brings his simmering midlife crisis front and center, and he tells off everyone and lashes out in various ways, borrows money to buy a sports car, and heads off to the airport to go to Thailand, when he gets a call saying it was all a mistake, he’s fine (this isn’t a spoiler, Miller has talked about it in all the interviews about the show). To say he has burned his bridges is an understatement. I am curious as to where the show goes from there, but given all the bathroom humor and glib one-liners in the first episode, I’m not optimistic.
Reset reminded me in many ways of a movie from a decade ago, Mr. Predictable (Yeled Tov Yerushalayim in Hebrew), starring Amos Tamam of Srugim as an unhappy middle-aged man with a job he hates, a wife who is cheating on him, and a spoiled kid, who got the same devastating news that turned out to be false, although it took a little longer. That movie was about how the misdiagnosis led the hero to fall in love with a woman he would have overlooked otherwise, and although it was formulaic, it was touching. It’s hard to imagine Miller going from his first episode to something touching or fresh, but we’ll have to wait and see.
With everything that is available on HBO Max, I have found myself re-watching The Wire, and, like a great novel, it deepens with each viewing. But it wasn’t the only great series that David Simon, a former newspaper reporter, created, and you can see most of his other work on the service.
Show Me a Hero
The 2015 series, Show Me a Hero, wasn’t as celebrated as The Wire but is still fascinating. It takes a subject that doesn’t sound that interesting – the desegregation of Yonkers, New York, through court-mandated building of low-income public housing in the late 1980s – and makes it compelling. The title refers to a quote by F. Scott Fitzgerald, “Show me a hero and I’ll write you a tragedy.”
It’s based on a non-fiction book by Lisa Belkin, and the hero here is Nick Wasicsko (Oscar Isaac, who starred in the Coen brothers’ Inside Llewyn Davis), a 28-year-old Yonkers city councilman who becomes mayor as a controversy is raging over court-ordered public housing in the racially mixed city. It’s clear that the former mayor, Angelo Martinelli (James Belushi), knows exactly what he is doing when he doesn’t fight hard to stay in office.
Any mayor of the city will have to comply with the court order, or the city will be found in contempt and will lose its bond rating. This means that whoever is in office when the housing is built will alienate white, middle-class voters and have to deal with integrating the minority residents into new communities.
Nick, who lacks confidence but tries to present himself as a consummate politician, doesn’t anticipate what the fight will take out of him. He loves listening to Bruce Springsteen’s music to get himself in a fighting mood, and he is the kind of man “the Boss” would have written songs about. Isaac is brilliant in the role, showing the politician’s vanity but also making us care about him. There is a great supporting cast that includes Bob Balaban, Jon Bernthal, Catherine Keener, Alfred Molina, Peter Riegert, and Winona Ryder, who was just at the beginning of her very welcome comeback.
Since we lost Matti Caspi, one of Israel’s greatest musicians, this week, many radio stations have been playing a lot of classic Israeli music, and it might put you in the mood for a new documentary about David Broza, also an amazing musician. It’s called The Spanish Connection: David Broza, and it will be shown February 15 at 9:15 p.m. on Hot 8, and will also be available on Hot VOD and Next TV.
It focuses on Broza’s deep connections to Spanish music and culture, and through interviews and archival footage, tells the story of how his family suddenly moved to Spain when he was 11. Although he was upset about the move at first, he fell in love with the music he heard there. Spanish guitar music has had a huge influence on him, and he has translated many Spanish songs to Hebrew. The filmed performances are beautiful. The documentary was directed by Avida Livni, who has made several acclaimed documentaries about music, including A Standard Love Song: Arik Einstein.

UN chief calls for bridging 'divides' as Ramadan nears
'This month is a sacred period of reflection and prayer, representing a noble vision of hope and peace,' says Antonio Guterres
HAMILTON, Canada
UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres on Friday marked the approaching Islamic holy month of Ramadan, urging all "to bridge divides, deliver help and hope to those in need."
"In a message marking the start of the holy month of Ramadan, the secretary-general says this month is a sacred period of reflection and prayer, representing a noble vision of hope and peace," Guterres' spokesperson Stephane Dujarric said during a news conference, adding: "Yet, for too many members of the human family, this vision remains distant."
Pointing to war-torn countries from "Afghanistan to Yemen, from Gaza to Sudan and beyond," Dujarric said that "people continue to suffer from conflict, hunger, displacement and discrimination."
"In these difficult and divided times, the secretary-general calls on all to heed Ramadan's enduring message, to bridge divides, deliver help and hope to those in need, and safeguard the rights and dignity of every person," he noted.
The Muslim holy month of Ramadan begins next week. Fasting from sunrise to sunset during Ramadan is one of Islam's five main pillars.

What We Know About the Suspect in Nancy Guthrie’s Disappearance

As the search for Nancy Guthrie, the 84-year-old mother of “Today” show host Savannah Guthrie, approaches its third week, federal authorities—who have described the case as a potential kidnapping—have released further information on a suspect in her disappearance.
After reviewing doorbell camera footage of Guthrie’s home in Tucson, Arizona, and conducting a forensic analysis, the Federal Bureau of Investigation on Thursday shared “new identifying” details on the suspect’s appearance, including a backpack the individual was wearing.
“The suspect is described as a male, approximately 5’9” - 5’10” tall, with an average build. In the video, he is wearing a black, 25-liter ‘Ozark Trail Hiker Pack’ backpack,” the FBI’s Phoenix office wrote.
The FBI also announced that it was increasing the reward “for information leading to the location of Nancy Guthrie and/or the arrest and conviction of anyone involved in her disappearance” to $100,000.
The previous day, authorities released new photos and videos from Guthrie’s doorbell camera, showing what appears to be a man wearing a ski mask, a backpack, black gloves, and a holstered weapon approaching the door. The man attempts to cover the camera, first with his hand and then, after turning around and grabbing a fistfull of branches from a nearby bush, with the torn-off pieces of the plant.
The recovery of the footage marked perhaps the biggest development in the case since Guthrie was reported missing on Feb. 1. In that time, purported ransom notes have also been sent to media outlets, a man was taken in for questioning and released hours later, and both law enforcement and Guthrie’s family have appealed to the public for information. (Tips can be submitted to 1-800-CALL-FBI or tips.fbi.gov.) But weeks on, many questions remain unanswered.
Here’s what we do know so far.
The timeline of Guthrie’s disappearance and the investigation
On Jan. 31, Guthrie left in an Uber to visit her family for dinner around 5:30 p.m., and was later dropped off at home by a family member shortly before 10:00 p.m., when her garage door was opened and then closed, according to Pima County Sheriff Chris Nanos.
Guthrie’s doorbell camera was disconnected around 1:45 a.m. on Feb. 1. The camera’s software detected movement about half an hour later, but no video is available. Then, just before 2:30 a.m., Guthrie’s pacemaker was disconnected from her phone, according to an app for the device.
Guthrie’s family called 911 just after noon that day to report her missing after going to check on her at her home. Deputies from the Pima County Sheriff’s Department arrived at Guthrie’s home at 12:15 p.m., and investigators found blood on the front porch, which was later confirmed to be Guthrie’s.
Authorities announced the following day, Feb. 2, that they believed Guthrie was taken against her will.
On Feb. 3, several media outlets reported they had received alleged ransom letters that demanded millions of dollars in bitcoin in exchange for Guthrie’s safe return. The veracity of the ransom notes has not been confirmed, but one included two deadlines of 5:00 p.m. on Thursday, Feb. 5 and the following Monday, Feb. 9.
In the note, according to outlets that received it, including CNN affiliate KGUN, Guthrie’s purported abductor demanded $6 million and threatened her life if the first deadline was not met.
The Pima County Sheriff’s Department announced a $50,000 reward for information leading to Guthrie’s discovery on Feb. 5. The FBI is working jointly with the sheriff’s department and has brought in agents from the agency’s Phoenix office to analyze social media, bank information, and other resources, Heith Janke, the agent leading the FBI’s Phoenix division, said that day.
The FBI released the first images of Guthrie’s suspected abductor from the doorbell camera five days later, on Feb. 10, which FBI Director Kash Patel described in an X post as showing “an armed individual appearing to have tampered with the camera at Nancy Guthrie’s front door the morning of her disappearance.”
Later that day, the Pima County Sheriff’s office announced that it had detained a “subject” during a traffic stop in Rio Rico, Arizona, about 60 miles south of Tucson, who was being questioned in connection to Guthrie’s disappearance. The man was released the following morning.
Patel told Fox News’ Sean Hannity Tuesday night that his agency was investigating more than one “person of interest” in the case.
On Friday, the Pima County Sheriff’s office said that DNA had been collected from Guthrie's home = that did not belong to her or anyone in “close contact with her” and had been sent for testing.
Guthrie’s children issue pleas for her return
Savannah Guthrie, along with her siblings Annie and Camron, released an emotional video on Feb. 4, directly addressing their mother’s alleged abductor. “We need to know without a doubt that she’s alive and that you have her,” Guthrie said. “We want to hear from you and we are ready to listen.”
Camron Guthrie posted a video on Feb. 5, around the time of the first purported ransom note’s deadline, asking on behalf of his family for a way to communicate with their mother’s possible kidnapper.
“Whoever is out there holding our mother, we want to hear from you. We haven’t heard anything directly,” he said in the video. “We need you to reach out and we need a way to communicate with you so we move forward.”
On Feb. 7, a week after Guthrie was reported missing, her children released another video addressed to their mother’s possible abductor in which they offered to pay for her release. Two days later, Savannah Guthrie posted a video that asked the public for help finding her mother. At 5:00 p.m. that day, the second deadline in the alleged ransom note passed.
“We are at an hour of desperation, and we need your help,” Savannah Guthrie said.
Savannah Guthrie on Thursday shared a tribute to her mother on her Instagram account with the caption: “our lovely mom. we will never give up on her. thank you for your prayers and hope.”
The video includes footage of Nancy Guthrie with her daughters as children and a black and white photo of her and her three children.
Unknowns remain
The FBI has received over 13,000 tips to a command post that is monitored 24/7 since Guthrie was reported missing on Feb. 1, the bureau’s Phoenix office said Thursday.
But Guthrie remains missing. And a number of key details regarding the case are still unknown, or have not been shared with the public.
These include the possible method used to break into Guthrie’s home; the location of Guthrie’s doorbell camera, which was removed, according to authorities; and whether the ransom notes were in fact sent by Guthrie’s alleged abductor.

Two Brits among three killed in avalanche at French Alps ski resort
The Brits were reportedly part of a group of five people accompanied by an instructor
- Bookmark
Two British men are among three people who were killed in an avalanche in the French Alps Friday.
The avalanche struck at around 11:30am (10.30am GMT) in the Val d’Isère ski resort in southeastern France.
A spokesperson from the slope management department at the resort confirmed that the third victim is a French national who was skiing alone.
The Brits were reportedly part of a group of five people accompanied by an instructor who were off-piste skiing, according to the BBC.
The cause of the avalanche wasn’t immediately known.
A red avalanche warning was issued Thursday across the Savoie region by Meteo-France, which is the national weather service.
The Val d’Isère ski resort’s website said off-piste skiing is “strongly discouraged” due to a “very high avalanche risk”.
An FCDO Spokesperson said: “We are aware of an accident in which two British men have died in France.
“We are in contact with the local authorities and stand ready to offer consular assistance”.

US withdraws newly updated list of firms allegedly aiding China's military

The United States withdrew an updated list of Chinese firms allegedly aiding Beijing's military shortly after it was posted earlier on Friday, with the addition of some of China's biggest companies, including Alibaba and Baidu.
The link to the US government's Federal Register, where the Pentagon's 1260H list had been posted, was replaced with a "withdrawn" notice about an hour after being published.
"An agency letter requesting withdrawal of this document was received after placement on public inspection," the Federal Register posted in an editorial note, without providing a reason.
The Pentagon could not be reached immediately for comment.
Informal sanctions on listed companies
Though the list does not formally impose sanctions on Chinese firms, under a new law, the department will be prevented in the coming years from contracting and procuring from companies on the list.
Updating the list could antagonize Beijing following a trade truce reached by China's Xi Jinping and US President Donald Trump in October. Trump is expected to travel to China in April, though dates for the visit have yet to be set.
Other additions on Friday included automaker BYD, biotech firm WuXi AppTec, and AI-driven robotics technology company RoboSense Technology Co Ltd, while chip memory maker YMTC was removed.
Being added to the list also sends a message to Pentagon suppliers and other US government agencies about the US military's opinion of the firms, some of which have sued the US over their inclusion.
An Alibaba spokesperson said there was no basis for their inclusion and threatened legal action. "Alibaba is not a Chinese military company nor part of any military-civil fusion strategy."
The list already includes major Chinese firms such as Tencent Holdings, one of China's largest tech companies, and CATL, a major battery maker in the electric vehicle industry.

German defence minister warns Russia cannot sustain war in Ukraine economically for long
German Defence Minister Boris Pistorius has said there are signs that Russia will not be able to economically sustain its war against Ukraine for much longer.
Source: European Pravda, citing an interview with ntv
Details: "It would be very surprising if Russia were able to maintain this for a very, very long time."
"We need to stop the flow of money from gas and oil sales as quickly, completely and decisively as possible, because this is the funding source for this terrible war – the funds that Russia needs," he added.
Previously: French President Emmanuel Macron recently noted that sending troops to Ukraine at this stage would risk escalation and a loss of control over the situation.
"I believe our main priority in the coming weeks should be to restore cooperation with the US so that together we recognise there is no room for short-term negotiations. Additional sanctions and measures against the shadow fleet should be imposed and pressure on the Russian economy increased to stop this war, but under much more favourable conditions," Macron explained.
Background: German Chancellor Friedrich Merz urged the US to reject isolationist ideas and work with Europe on global challenges.

Situation in Southeast Asian region not ‘zero-sum game’: Munich Security Conference discusses challenges in region
Singapore defense chief, ASEAN bloc chief respond to questions on disputed South China Sea 2026 edition at Munich Security Conference
ISTANBUL
Senior officials at the Munich Security Conference discussed challenges Friday in the Southeast Asian region, including how maritime disputes can turn into areas of cooperation without engaging in a zero-sum game.
Singapore’s Defense Minister Chan Chun Sing and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) Secretary General Kao Kim Hourn were fielding questions during a panel on maritime safety at the three-day conference, which began Friday.
On the disputed South China Sea, Kao said the bloc and China have been negotiating for a code of conduct “because we want to make sure” the vast waterbody becomes a “sea of peace, stability and cooperation.”
The mineral-rich disputed waters have seen persistent tensions between China and the Philippines, one of ASEAN's members.
Whether increased deployment of naval ships by China and the US to the region was making the disputed waters “more dangerous,” Kao said both powers were “comprehensive strategic partners” of the bloc.
“We have been engaging both superpowers through the ASEAN mechanisms,” Kao said.
Singaporean Defense Minister Chan Chun Sing said the island nation “does not see the situation in the region as a zero-sum game.”
“It's not in our interest to see this as a zero-sum game. In fact, if we think about it logically, the interests of both China and the US converge in Southeast Asia. Both countries have a shared interest to make sure that the safety and security of the ships going through this part of the region is well taken care of,” he said.
“From our perspective, we think the US, China and other stakeholders that use the straits of Malacca in the South China Sea have a shared interest to contribute, and they can contribute positively provided we have the shared understanding of the framework,” he added.

Macron calls for 'audacious' Europe, warns continent must shape its own security future
'We will live with Russia at the same place… and I don’t want this negotiation to be organized by somebody else,' says French president
ISTANBUL
French President Emmanuel Macron on Friday called for a more “audacious” and self-confident Europe, warning that the continent must take responsibility for its own security architecture rather than allow others to define it.
Addressing the Munich Security Conference, Macron said Europe faces a historic turning point driven by the war in Ukraine, shifting transatlantic dynamics and a more unstable global order.
“This is the right time for audacity. This is the right time for a strong Europe,” he said.
Macron stressed that Europe must “learn to become a geopolitical power,” arguing that the European Union can no longer rely solely on its economic weight while security decisions are shaped elsewhere.
“Our geography will not change,” he said, referring to Russia. “We will live with Russia at the same place… and I don’t want this negotiation to be organized by somebody else.”
While voicing support for US-led efforts to reach a negotiated settlement in Ukraine, Macron insisted Europe must play a central role in any outcome.
“No peace without the Europeans,” he said. “You can negotiate without Europeans if you prefer, but it will not bring peace to the table.”
Macron described Russia as “a weakened country” whose invasion of Ukraine had become “a strategic, an economic and even a military failure,” rejecting claims that Kyiv has already lost the war as “a huge strategic mistake.”
He warned that Europe must prepare not only for the end of hostilities but for long-term coexistence with what he called “an unreconstructed aggressive Russia on our borders,” raising questions about missile deployments, arms control and future deterrence arrangements.
Turning inward, Macron criticized narratives portraying Europe as declining or divided.
“Europe is inherently strong and can be made even stronger yet,” he said, adding that Europeans are “starting not to believe in ourselves, which is a huge mistake.”
He called for deeper defense integration and common financing mechanisms, cautioning that fragmented national rearmament would undermine credibility.
“If this time of rearmament is a time of separation on national power, it would be a huge mistake,” he said. “Credibility is not only a question of missiles. It is in large part a question of determination.”

Family told it must remove brothers’ gravestone after it was deemed ‘inappropriate’
The family of brothers Timothy and Ryan Geschke says they do not plan to alter or remove the tombstone
- Bookmark
- CommentsGo to comments
A Colorado cemetery is forcing a family to remove an "inappropriate" headstone bearing images of upraised middle fingers.
The headstone has been in Evergreen Cemetery in Colorado Springs for five years, marking the final resting place of brothers Timothy and Ryan Geschke. The sisters of the interred, Heidi and Holly Geschke, were recently informed that the headstone designer was told to cover up images of raised middle fingers on the gravestone with black tape.
"This is a symbol of love and Geschke blood through and through," Holly Geschke told KOAA.
Now, the cemetery's manager is telling the family that the headstone must be removed.
According to the cemetery's rules, headstones cannot be profane or offensive to the general public. "No words or images may be engraved on a memorial that would be considered profane or offensive to the general public," the cemetery's current rules state.
Holly Geschke told The Independent that she was not asked to sign a contract when the tombstone was erected and was not told by anyone at that time that the design violated any of the cemetery’s rules.
She said the only instructions her family was given at the time were that the middle finger engravings could not be facing a nearby street.
When KOAA reporters asked the cemetery's manager, Cheryl Godbout, how many complaints she’d received, she said the number of complaints was "irrelevant, because once I was made aware of it, then I had to do something."
“It would not have been right of me to know about it, knowing it violates our rules and to ignore our rules," she said.
The Geschke sisters do not agree that the images are offensive enough to warrant removal.
“This was created with so much love and respect and loyalty to our brothers,” Holly Geschke told KOAA. “This is speaking to the character of not who they were, but who we are as a family.”
The manager said the family does not need to remove the headstone themselves and that the cemetery will store the marker for the family.
The sisters told KOAA that they don't plan on removing or remaking the headstone to bring it into compliance with the cemetery's rules.
"They're in a resting place and now here we are being asked to disturb their resting place," Holly Greschke said. "It's mind-boggling,"
She said her family plans to fight the removal order, and if necessary, move her brothers out of the cemetery entirely.
“These are my brothers, I'm not going to let this go,” she told The Independent. “Whether this ends in our favor or not we're not backing down on this. We're making noise for the boys.”

DOJ investigating if ICE agents lied under oath after judge drops assault charges against Venezuelan men
Felony cases tied to Trump’s mass deportation efforts are falling apart in court
- Bookmark
- CommentsGo to comments
The Department of Justice is opening a criminal investigation into whether federal immigration agents lied under oath after prosecutors dropped charges against two Venezuelan men accused of assaulting an officer in Minnesota.
A federal judge in Minneapolis agreed to dismiss the case Friday after evidence emerged showing the government’s version of events was “materially inconsistent with the allegations” against Alfredo Alejandro Aljorna and Julio Cesar Sosa-Celis, according to Minnesota’s top federal prosecutor.
The abrupt reversal follows an aggressive effort to prosecute the two men, who were accused of attacking an officer with a snow shovel and a broom handle, which Homeland Security secretary Kristi Noem called “attempted murder.” The officer, who was not named in court documents, fired his handgun and hit Sosa-Ceclis in the leg.
The one-page motion from Donald Trump-appointed U.S. Attorney Daniel Rosen said the government was backing off that case entirely, and dismissed the charges with prejudice, meaning they can’t be refiled.
In a statement Friday, Immigration and Customs Enforcement acting director Todd Lyons said sworn testimony about the incident from two officers appears to include “untruthful statements.”
“Both officers have been immediately placed on administrative leave pending the completion of a thorough internal investigation,” he added.
“Lying under oath is a serious federal offense. The U.S. Attorney’s Office is actively investigating these false statements. Upon conclusion of the investigation, the officers may face termination of employment, as well as potential criminal prosecution,” according to Lyons.
After the shooting, Noem accused Minnesota Governor Tim Walz and Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey of “encouraging impeding and assault against our law enforcement which is a federal crime, a felony.”
“What we saw last night in Minneapolis was an attempted murder of federal law enforcement,” Noem said January 15, the day after the incident. “Our officer was ambushed and attacked by three individuals who beat him with snow shovels and the handles of brooms. Fearing for his life, the officer fired a defensive shot.”
In court hearings, the ICE officer’s account of the moments leading up to him firing his weapons appeared to be significantly different from testimony from the two defendants and three eyewitnesses.
His account that he was assaulted with a broom and snow shovel was also not backed up by video evidence or testimony from eyewitnesses.
In the FBI affidavit in support of the criminal complaint against the men, an ICE officer accused Sosa-Celis of using a broom to hit him “in his face” while he saw another man “approach him with a snow shovel” and “began striking” him.
After “tussling” with Aljorna, the officer said he was “alone, in the dark, facing the males” by himself, according to the affidavit. After breaking free, Aljorna looked back at the officer “with a scowl on his face,” Sosa-Celis handed him the broom, Aljorna “repeatedly struck” the officer, according to his testimony in the affidavit.
After the officer drew a pistol and fired one round, the men ran into a nearby apartment complex.
Officers then fired tear gas towards the building to draw them out, and the men surrendered over feared that young children inside would be hurt.
A third Venezuelan man, Gabriel Alejandro Hernandez Ledezma, who lived in the apartment downstairs, was also arrested, though he was never charged.
He filed a petition seeking his release from ICE custody, arguing that he was unlawfully detained without a warrant and flown to an immigration detention center in Texas to prevent him from serving as a material eyewitness who could contradict the government’s claims.
A judge in Texas ordered his immediate return to Minnesota February 9.
The 19-year-old partner of one of the two men was also detained by immigration agents and transferred from Minnesota to El Paso and then New Mexico, where a judge ordered her release.
District Judge Paul Magnuson in Minneapolis had previously ordered Aljorna and Sosa released from pretrial detention and ordered ICE not to deport any witnesses before they could testify.
It remains unclear whether ICE will still seek to deport the two men.
The collapse of the case is the latest in a streak of losses for ICE and the Justice Department as the Trump administration seeks to rapidly deport thousands of people while failing to account for due process protections, according to federal judges across the country.
Dozens of felony cases against protesters accused of assaulting or impeding federal officers have also fallen apart in recent weeks, after Attorney General Pam Bondi promised “severe consequences.”
But an Associated Press review of 100 felony assault cases brought against demonstrators in Democratic-led cities over the last year found that 55 people had their cases reduced or dismissed altogether. At least 23 pleaded guilty to avoid trial, and most of them had charges reduced in plea deals that resulted in little or no jail time.
All five defendants whose cases went to trial so far have been acquitted.

UN says Israel blocked several humanitarian missions in Gaza

UN says Israel blocked several humanitarian missions in Gaza
'To provide more durable solutions, restrictions on entry of essential construction materials and equipment must be lifted,' says spokesperson
HAMILTON, Canada
The UN on Friday said that Israeli authorities blocked several humanitarian missions in the Gaza Strip, including one aimed at reaching a wastewater treatment plant in Khan Younis, limiting aid to civilians in urgent need.
Citing the Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA), UN spokesperson Stephane Dujarric said during a news conference that the UN teams "attempted to coordinate eight humanitarian missions, five of which were fully facilitated."
"The three other missions, including one to reach a wastewater treatment plant in Khan Younis, were denied by the Israeli authorities," he said, adding that the missions that proceeded collected food and medical supplies at Kerem Shalom and Karem Abu Salem, while monitoring humanitarian cargo at Kerem Shalom and Kissufim crossings.
"Four months since the ceasefire agreement came into effect, the humanitarian scale-up has saved countless lives and pushed back famine in Gaza," Dujarric said.
"Many people in Gaza, however, remain living in extremely harsh conditions, and the humanitarian response faces significant obstacles, especially to the entry of goods and the ability of humanitarian partners to operate," he said, adding that nearly 1.5 million people, or two in every three Palestinians in Gaza, "are staying in 1,000 displacement sites that are often overcrowded, and in tents that offer no privacy and little protection from the weather."
While UN partners provided tents, bedding, and clothing to more than 85,000 families in January, Dujarric warned that "to provide more durable solutions, restrictions on the entry of essential construction materials and equipment must be lifted."
An Oct. 10 ceasefire agreement ended Israel’s two-year war that began on Oct. 8, 2023. Palestinian authorities say the conflict killed more than 72,000 Palestinians, wounded over 171,000 others, and caused widespread destruction affecting 90% of civilian infrastructure. The UN estimates reconstruction costs at approximately $70 billion.
At least 591 Palestinians have been killed and over 1,578 others injured in Israeli attacks since the ceasefire, according to Gaza’s Health Ministry.

MOSCOW, February 13. /TASS/. European leaders will remain outside the negotiating process on Ukraine until they acknowledge the reality of the conflict, a senior Russian lawmaker said.
"European hawks are unwilling to acknowledge the reality of the conflict in Ukraine and the failure of the Banderite regime. <…> With such an approach, the Europeans will remain outsiders of the negotiating process on Ukraine for a long time," Leonid Slutsky, chairman of the international committee of the Russian State Duma, or lower house of parliament, and leader of the Liberal Democratic Party of Russia (LDPR), wrote on his Telegram channel, commenting on the statements by the EU leaders at the Munich Security Conference, which runs from February 13 through 15.
He advised Western leaders to take note of US President Donald Trump’s remarks that Vladimir Zelensky "is going to have to get moving" toward a peace deal. "And all those who keep on fanning anti-Russian hysteria and promise support for Ukrainian fascists should better get moving this way too," Slutsky added.

Shakira’s 5-show El Salvador residency fuels Bukele’s push to remake the country’s image
Shakira’s five-show run in El Salvador highlights President Nayib Bukele’s push to rebrand the country through big events and tighter security
- Bookmark
A five-concert “residency” by singer-songwriter and superstar Shakira in El Salvador’s capital builds on President Nayib Bukele ’s yearslong effort to remake the Central American country’s international image from one of the world's most violent countries into one of the safest.
The sold-out shows in the country’s National Stadium Jorge “El Magico” González this week follow international surfing tournaments and the Miss Universe competition two years ago. El Salvador has seen big name performers in recent years, but like Bad Bunny in 2022 and Karol G in 2024, they typically play one concert and move on.
Shakira initially scheduled three dates of her “Las Mujeres Ya No Lloran World Tour” in El Salvador, but when the tickets went fast, Bukele wrote on X: “El Salvador is changing and Central America too. Shakira sold out all the tickets for her 3 dates in less than 24 hours. I know the enormous effort the producers are making to extend this impressive Central American residency, based in our country.”
The Colombian singer replied almost immediately: “Thank you, El Salvador and Central America. We’re going with two more dates!”
Gang crackdown
What Salvadorans and many of the tens of thousands of foreigners who the organizers say bought tickets attribute the spectacle to is the country’s security turnaround.
That has been achieved with a crackdown on criminal gangs under a state of emergency that is nearly four years old, under which some constitutional rights like access to a lawyer are suspended. The extraordinary powers have enabled the government to lock up more than 91,000 people often without due process. Hundreds have died in prison without being convicted of a crime.
The measures have been criticized by human rights organizations in El Salvador and abroad, but the success against El Salvador’s gangs has won praise from Salvadorans and admiration from neighboring countries struggling to control gang violence.
Tourism Minister Morena Valdez said Thursday that hotels in the capital were at capacity, some tourists were booking at nearby beaches or outlying cities and it was all expected to generate about a $55 million economic impact.
“It’s our first time in El Salvador, but we are going to return because El Salvador and its security are fashionable now,” said Roy Mora who traveled from Cartago, Costa Rica for Thursday night’s concert.
“We’re amazed by the security, it’s true what they say and you have to see it,” said María José De Mora, his wife, standing outside the stadium.
Security that draws fans
Last month, Bukele visited Costa Rica at the invitation of President Rodrigo Chaves for the groundbreaking of a new prison inspired by the massive lockup Bukele built for gang suspects early in the state of emergency.
Bukele has lashed out at critics of his methods, trusting in the results that have made him extremely popular at home.
“I don’t care that they call me dictator,” he said in an address to the nation last June. “I prefer they call me dictator than see how they kill Salvadorans in the streets. I prefer they call me dictator, but Salvadorans can finally live in peace. Let them keep arguing semantics and we’re going to continue to be focused on results.”
Outside the stadium Thursday, Fidel Pérez and his family said they had traveled from Guatemala City to see the show and planned to stay three days to also take in the beach and a nearby volcano.
“We’re going to take advantage that there aren’t any gangs,” Pérez said. “We’re not afraid of being assaulted or killed and we’re going to go everywhere without problems.”

Trump quips about where he might move after White House as smiling Melania nods her approval
Trump abandoned his longtime home state of New York in 2019 amid multiple civil and criminal probes into his conduct
- Bookmark
- CommentsGo to comments
President Donald Trump on Friday suggested that he could make his post-presidency home near a North Carolina military base instead of the gilded Florida social club where he’s lived since leaving his longtime New York home to avoid various investigations into his conduct.
Trump was winding his way through remarks to soldiers at Fort Bragg that were little different from his usual political stump speech when he began boasting about the “billions” his administration is purportedly investing into improvements to housing and other facilities on the sprawling military base.
He also claimed his administration would similarly spend “billions of dollars” on improvements “here and around the area” to “make it great” because “people in this area have been so incredible.”
“In fact, I'm thinking about moving here someday. Maybe I'll, maybe I'll move here with our great movie star ... with our First Lady,” he said, referring to first lady Melania Trump, who had also traveled to the base in a rare joint appearance with her husband.
Turning to his wife, he said: “We'll move to Fort. Bragg. Would you like that, darling?”
The first lady, who seemed to be there as much to promote her documentary as to ride along on to Mar-a-Lago afterward, laughed and seemed to nod, at which point Trump resumed speaking, telling the assembled soldiers: “She loves you.”
“It’s a possibility — actually, it's not a bad idea, because we love it,” he said.
While the president’s remarks were made in jest, he does have some family ties to the Tar Heel State through his daughter-in-law, Lara Trump, a North Carolina native who has twice considered but rejected chances to run for open Senate seats there.
Trump and his wife previously changed their primary residence in 2019, when they filed documents to officially shift their domicile from the eponymous New York skyscraper where he’d lived since 1983 to Mar-a-Lago, the Palm Beach, Florida mansion where he maintains quarters while using the gilded age-era residence as a social club for dues-paying members.
At the time, he claimed to “cherish” the Empire State, where he lived from birth through the start of his first term in the White House in 2018 but complained that he’d been “treated very badly by the political leaders of both the city and state” amid multiple civil and criminal investigations into his conduct there.
The first lady’s appearance alongside her husband — only one of a select few speaking engagements she’s had with him since his return to the White House — comes weeks after the premier of a hagiographic documentary about her preparations for his January 2025 inauguration that was purchased by Amazon for $40 million in what critics derided as a blatant payoff to her and her husband.
Amazon also reportedly spent $35 million to market the film, which thus far has brought in just over $13 million in box office revenues since it was released in theaters last month.
Trump referenced the documentary’s box office performance in his remarks to the troops, telling them that the United States “is truly blessed to have such a phenomenal First Lady.”
“And now she’s a movie star,” he said.

A healthy Shohei Ohtani eyes the one major award he hasn't won — a Cy Young Award

Shohei Ohtani is a five-time All-Star, a four-time Most Valuable Player, a two-time World Series winner and a World Baseball Classic champion, giving him a sparkling baseball resume that no current player can touch.
The only major honor he hasn't won? A Cy Young Award.
Given his track record, it wouldn't be a surprise to see the two-way Japanese star add that trophy to his collection in 2026.
“I think it’s fair to say he expects to be in the Cy Young conversation,” Dodgers manager Dave Roberts said Friday. "We just want him to be healthy, make starts, and all the numbers and statistics will take care of themselves.
“But, man, this guy is such a disciplined worker and expects the most from himself.”
Just 105 days after the Dodgers became MLB's first back-to-back champs in a quarter century — beating the Toronto Blue Jays in a thrilling Game 7 — Ohtani, Yoshinobu Yamamoto and the rest of the team's pitchers and catchers went through their first spring training workout at Camelback Ranch on Friday.
Ohtani is expecting to be a full-time, two-way player for the first time since 2023. An elbow injury kept him off the mound for the 2024 season and he returned to pitching midway though last year, going 3-0 with a 4.43 ERA in the postseason to help the Dodgers capture their second straight World Series title.
Roberts said an injury-free offseason — where he could focus on rest, recovery and strength — should make him even more formidable on the mound this season.
“He just looks strong, but not too much mass,” Roberts said. “Watching him throw, watching him run, his body is moving well. I think he's in a sweet spot.”
The 31-year-old Ohtani munched on breakfast and laughed with teammates in the clubhouse before his bullpen session, fully comfortable in what are now familiar surroundings. He's entering his third season with the franchise that has helped him blossom into the biggest baseball phenomenon in decades.
“I was finally able to have a normal offseason,” Ohtani said. “Although the offseason was pretty short, I thought it was a good thing.”
Ohtani said he arrived at Camelback Ranch at the beginning of the month and Friday's bullpen — which he said went well — was his third of the spring. The goal is to throw live batting practice next week before he leaves to join Team Japan in Tokyo, where it will be playing in the World Baseball Classic.
He won't be pitching for Japan in the WBC — focusing solely on his work at the plate.
Roberts said keeping Ohtani off the mound in the WBC was a collaborative decision that focused on his long-term health.
“As much as people think that he’s not human, he’s still a human being who has had two major surgeries,” Roberts said. “He’s got a long career ahead of him.”
The timeline and schedule of the WBC — Team Japan could be playing from March 6-17 on two different continents — makes Ohtani's preparation for the Dodgers' opening day game against the Arizona Diamondbacks on March 26 a challenge. Neither Roberts or Ohtani were sure what his throwing schedule would look like in Japan.
Roberts said he's sure Ohtani will want to be ready to pitch at the beginning of the season, but the team would be flexible.
“It's delicate,” Roberts said. “We'll know more in the next couple weeks and see where the progression is at. But for us, there's not going to be any timeline or endline or finish line where he has to be ready.”
The Dodgers enter the season as World Series favorites. They were big spenders on the free agent market once again, landing four-time All-Star outfielder Kyle Tucker on a $240 million, four-year deal that further exacerbated the divide between baseball's haves and have nots. Los Angeles also nabbed star reliever Edwin Díaz on a $69 million, three-year deal.
Díaz also threw a bullpen on Friday. He had a 1.63 ERA and 28 saves for the New York Mets last season.
“Guys are anxious,” Roberts said. “We've got a long camp, longer than we've had in recent years. We're trying to get guys to start slow and be intentional and methodical. That's kind of the message.”

A Friday Night Concert in Kyiv to ‘Warm Souls’

Between two air raid alerts, the Kyiv Classic Orchestra on Friday gave travellers at the city’s main railway station an hour-long concert, to raise spirits during the war with Russia.
Pieces by 19th-century Ukrainian composer Semen Hulak-Artemovsky and excerpts of Mozart and Gershwin rang out across the vast waiting room hall.

The station has for several weeks been transformed into a “point of invincibility,” providing a place of warmth for the population and for them to recharge their mobiles.
Immaculately dressed in a fur-collared coat and white scarf, conductor Herman Makarenko led nine string players before dozens of people, some of whom had stopped by chance.
To draw in travellers, the orchestra first played an opening piece at the top of the station’s vast staircase.
Organised as part of a US-Ukrainian solidarity project, the concert is expected to be the first in a series in the weeks to come, said Tetiana Marozova, one of the organisers.
“We think this initiative is very important because we need to take care not only of our bodies in these difficult situations without heating, without electricity,” she said.
“But we can bring a little bit of joy to Ukrainians and warm their souls.”
Intensive Russian bombardment on Ukrainian energy infrastructure in recent months has left hundreds of thousands of households without heating and electricity in the depths of a particularly bitter winter.
Makarenko called music “medicine for the soul” and said Ukraine was now fighting on the “cultural front,” nearly four years after Russia’s full-scale invasion.
“That’s very important,” he said, “to show that we, Ukrainians, are unbreakable.”
Some exhausted travellers seemed not to be paying attention to the music but dozens of others filmed or happily listened to it.
“Classical music is what we need at this time,” smiled Zinaida Yarmolenko, 76, who came across the concert by accident after hearing the first few notes.
“I’m really happy,” she added.

Top US diplomat skips Ukraine meeting with European leaders in Munich — newspaper

LONDON, February 13. /TASS/. US Secretary of State Marco Rubio did not attend a meeting with European leaders on the sidelines of the Munich Security Conference, where the conflict in Ukraine was discussed, The Financial Times reported, citing an American official.
"The secretary won’t be attending the Berlin Format meeting on Ukraine given the number of meetings he has happening at the same time," the source told the newspaper before the talks began. He assured that Rubio "is engaging on Russia-Ukraine in many of his meetings here in Munich."
However, one European official called the top US diplomat’s absence from the meeting "insane," The Financial Times noted. Another European source told the newspaper that without American participation, the talks "lacked substance."
According to The Financial Times, Rubio's absence from the talks was seen in European capitals as evidence of "Washington’s waning interest in involving them in its efforts to solve the conflict" in Ukraine.
In turn, Germany’s Deutsche Welle radio company (DW, recognized in Russia as a foreign agent), German Chancellor Friedrich Merz, UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer, NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte, and Vladimir Zelensky took part in the meeting on Ukraine in the so-called Berlin format.

Nvidia's stock is down and AMD is up. The culprit may be Arista.

Shares of Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices moved in opposite directions on Friday, after the CEO of Arista Networks told investors that her company is seeing some deployment shifting to AMD.
Nvidia's stock fell almost 3%, while AMD gained close to 1%.
"A year ago, it was pretty much 99% Nvidia, right?" Ullal said on Arista's earnings call late Thursday, when asked by an analyst about the company's work with AMD. "Today, when we look at our deployments, we see about 20%, maybe a little more, 20% to 25%, where AMD is becoming the preferred accelerator of choice."
The stock moves weren't dramatic, but Ullal's comments are notable because Nvidia has dominated the market for graphics processing units (GPUs) in AI since the industry started taking off a little over three years ago with the launch of OpenAI's ChatGPT.
Nvidia currently has roughly 90% of the the market for AI chips, with challenges potentially coming from AMD as well as Google, which is seeing increased traction for its tensor processing units. Nvidia is the most valuable U.S. company, with a market cap of over $4.5 trillion. AMD is worth about $335 billion after an 85% jump in its stock price in the past 12 months.
Arista's role in the AI infrastructure boom is in providing the Ethernet switching technology that connects powerful chips together. AMD announced late last year that it was partnering with Arista to build customized AI clusters that could be used for training and inference.
But for Arista, much of the diversification in its deployments is coming out of necessity.
Nvidia has diminished its need for Arista's technology by building its own networking technology to link together its powerful GPUs. In October, Nvidia said that Meta and Oracle would be adopting the chipmaker's networking technology in their ecosystems, an announcement that contributed to a 10% drop in Arista's stock over two days.
It's "not the end of the world but obviously being designed in with Nvidia helps, and they are being designed out, if not fully, to a degree," Ben Bajarin, an analyst covering chips at Creative Strategies, told CNBC by email on Friday.
Nvidia launched its Spectrum-X Ethernet platform in 2023, and the following year Arista lost more than half its value. The stock bounced back some last year, climbing 19%, and is now up 6% in 2026.
An Nvidia spokesperson declined to comment. AMD didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.

Putin’s ‘Temple of War’ was just the beginning. Russia is building churches, mosques, and even underground chapels to convince the nation that the invasion of Ukraine is sacred.
”The Temple of War: People and Ideas That Made the Russian Invasion Possible,” by historian Ilia Venyavkin, profiles the figures who helped Vladimir Putin prime Russians for the attack on Ukraine. Venyavkin cites a visit to the Main Cathedral of the Russian Armed Forces in Patriot Park as a primary catalyst for the book. The cathedral, as Venyavkin writes in the preface, was built on Putin’s orders but “had been developing in Russian political culture for many years.” The historian draws a parallel to the Russian–Ukrainian war: Putin personally gave the order for the invasion, but the heroes of Moscow’s “Temple of War” — from Army General Sergey Surovikin to RT propagandist Margarita Simonyan — manufactured the public consent that made it possible.
That cultural foundation extends beyond the capital: The Main Cathedral is hardly the country’s only church dedicated to war and Russian soldiers. Since 2022, new churches have appeared nationwide to commemorate not only World War II casualties but also Russian troops killed in Ukraine. From mosques honoring the “fallen heroes of the Special Military Operation” to underground chapels in active war zones, Meduza examines the expanding legacy of Russia’s military places of worship.

Ukraine to launch over 10 joint weapons factories by year’s end

Ukraine to launch over 10 joint weapons factories by year’s end
This was stated in a comment to Ukrinform by Ihor Fedirko, Executive Director of the Ukrainian Arms Manufacturers Council.
“I very much hope that by the end of the year we will be able to launch more than 10 such joint ventures, where we essentially combine German and broader European manufacturing culture with our combat-proven experience. When we merge these two very important mechanisms, we will see something absolutely new being born – technological and European,” Fedirko said, adding that Ukraine wants to be part of the pan-European defense industry and doctrine.
He drew attention to three signed memorandums on the creation of joint ventures, under which contracts have already been signed and are backed by the German government.
“In this way, we reduce pressure on our budget and obtain Ukrainian-made weapons for the Ukrainian army,” the Executive Director of the Ukrainian Arms Manufacturers Council noted.
At the same time, Fedirko emphasized that the primary focus is on establishing joint ventures rather than selling weapons, as this approach provides far greater opportunities for cooperation and for supplying the Armed Forces of Ukraine.
“First and foremost, supplying the army is what matters to us – contracts come second. But there is a unique element here: 10,000 drones that will be jointly produced in Germany will be transferred to the Ukrainian army as a donation, paid for by the German government,” Fedirko stressed, noting that Ukraine is seeking precisely this kind of cooperation.
Fedirko recalled that the Ukrainian-German company Quantum Frontline Industries GmbH, which on February 13 handed over its first drone to President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelensky, is the first such joint production venture. He expressed satisfaction that key processes had been unblocked and exports opened. Production at Quantum Frontline Industries GmbH began once the company received authorization to export intellectual property.
“We do not transfer intellectual property directly; we demonstrate how we assemble the systems. Finalization of these drones is carried out by a Ukrainian team on the Ukrainian side, meaning that critical components and critical intellectual property remain with Ukraine,” Fedirko explained.
Thus, the main components and core intellectual property remain in Ukraine, he assured.
As reported, on February 13 three memorandums on the establishment of joint ventures were signed between Airlogix and Auterion, Tencore and Fernride, as well as Tafindustries and Windcopter. The agreements were concluded in the presence of President Zelensky and German Defense Minister Boris Pistorius.

Here’s why Valentine’s Day might be harder on your wallet this year
- Valentine's Day chocolate prices in the US have risen significantly, with boxed assortments up 11.8 percent on average, despite a recent sharp drop in global cocoa prices.
- Major chocolate makers, such as Mondelez and Hershey, hedge their cocoa purchases months in advance, meaning they are still paying for cocoa acquired at previously record-high rates.
- This lag prevents current savings from falling cocoa prices from being passed on to consumers immediately, with relief potentially not seen until future seasons, possibly by 2027.
- Trade policies, including tariffs implemented by the Trump administration, have also contributed to increased costs for some chocolate manufacturers, particularly impacting imported brands.
- Despite the higher prices, consumer demand for chocolate remains robust, with Valentine's Day spending projected to increase, indicating strong market resilience.

Trump says planning to ‘make visit’ to Venezuela following Maduro abduction
Trump did not give a timeline for trip, which would make him the first US president to visit the country since 1997.
Donald Trump has said he plans to become the first sitting United States president to visit Venezuela in nearly three decades.
Trump made the statement to reporters on Friday as he departed White House for the Fort Bragg military base in North Carolina, where he met soldiers involved in the US abduction of Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro on January 3.

“I’m going to make a visit to Venezuela,” Trump said. He offered few details on the planned visit, telling reporters “we haven’t decided” on a date.
Still, the trip would make Trump the first sitting US president since Bill Clinton in 1997 to visit the South American country, which Trump had targeted with crippling sanctions from his first term of 2017 to 2021.
Earlier this week, US Energy Secretary Chris Wright became the first member of Trump’s cabinet to visit Venezuela and meet the government led by Maduro’s replacement, Delcy Rodriguez.
Trump has repeatedly praised Rodriguez, Maduro’s former deputy, while downplaying the prospect of supporting an opposition figure in the wake of Maduro’s abduction.
“They’ve done a great job,” Trump again said on Friday. “The oil is coming out, and a lot of money is being paid.”
For her part, Rodriguez has overseen several concessions to the US, including freezing oil shipments to Cuba, supporting a law to open the state-controlled oil industry to foreign companies, and releasing hundreds of political prisoners.
On Thursday, lawmakers in Venezuela’s parliament debated a bill that would grant amnesty to political prisoners, although it had not passed by Friday.
Easing of sanctions
Also on Friday, the US Department of the Treasury announced it was easing some sanctions on Venezuela’s energy sector, the largest reprieve since Maduro’s abduction.
The department issued two general licences, including one that allows Chevron, BP, Eni, Shell, and Repsol to conduct further oil and gas operations in Venezuela. The companies identified already have offices in the country and are among the main partners of state-run oil company PDVSA.
The second licence allows foreign companies to enter new oil and gas investment contracts with PDVSA in Venezuela.
Any contracts would be contingent on separate approval from the Treasury Department’s Office of Foreign Assets Control and do not extend to Russia, Iran, China or entities owned by nationals of those countries.
Trump has said he is seeking $100bn in foreign investments in Venezuela, while Energy Secretary Wright said early this week that Venezuelan oil sales since Maduro’s capture had hit $1bn and would reach $5bn in months.
Wright said the US will control the proceeds from the sales until a “representative government” in Venezuela is established.
UN experts have criticised US influence over the country’s natural resources as a violation of citizens’ right to self-determination.
Speaking during his address on Fort Bragg, Trump also took time to praise the operation to abduct Maduro.
Legal experts have called it a flagrant violation of international law and Venezuela’s sovereignty, regardless of whether Washington viewed Maduro as the country’s legitimate elected leader following disputed elections in 2024.
“Everybody was running for the hills,” Trump said of the January 3 attack, which killed more than 100 Cuban and Venezuelan security personnel, “and that’s what we have. We have the strongest military in the world by far.”

MUNICH, Germany — Europe’s pivot to spend more on defense is bringing America back in from the cold, NATO chief Mark Rutte said in an interview with POLITICO.
Just weeks after Donald Trump brought the alliance to the brink of collapse by threatening to annex Greenland, Rutte lavished praise on the U.S. president for pressing European countries to boost military outlays — while dodging questions about the appropriateness of the U.S. threatening the sovereignty of a fellow NATO member.
“I would argue that NATO is the strongest it has been since the fall of the Berlin Wall,” Rutte said in an interview at the POLITICO Pub at the Munich Security Conference.

NSW Waratahs defeat Queensland Reds 36-12 in opening round of Super Rugby Pacific
In short:
The NSW Waratahs have defeated the Queensland Reds 36-12 to begin the Super Rugby Pacific season.
The victory for the Tahs snaps a four-match losing streak against their rivals.
What's next?
The Western Force host the ACT Brumbies in Perth this evening.
The NSW Waratahs are in celebration mode after breaking the shackles to open the Super Rugby Pacific season with a rousing 36-12 derby win over the Queensland Reds in Sydney.
Wallabies wonder winger Max Jorgensen dazzled with a double, but it was NSW's new-look forward pack that caused most of the carnage as the Waratahs snapped a four-match losing streak against their arch rivals.
After losing experienced Test stars Taniela Tupou, Angus Bell, Dave Porecki, Rob Leota and Langi Gleeson from their engine room this season, inspirational newcomers Pete Samu and Clem Halaholo and naughty boy lock Miles Amatosero provided the Waratahs' grunt last night.
Replacement half Teddy Wilson added the icing to the cake with NSW's fifth try in the penultimate minute to secure a precious bonus point in front of delirious home fans at the Sydney Football Stadium.
The 36-12 triumph, also featuring five goals from as many attempts from flyhalf Lawson Creighton, was only the Waratahs' second win from their past 10 matches against the Reds.
"It's an awesome feeling," Samu, who joined the Waratahs after starring for the Union Bordeaux Begles in last year's European Cup final, said.
"Good to get out there and play with the boys, also with some good debutants out there as well tonight.
"So, yeah, awesome feeling to get the win as well."
In reality, the Waratahs could have won by much more.
After spurning multiple opportunities at penalty goals, the Waratahs' confidence paid off when powerhouse flanker Clem Halaholo bulldozed over on debut for the opening try of the night in the seventh minute.
Halaholo turned culprit, though, when his loose pass near halfway landed in the hands of Reds flanker Joe Brial, who toed the ball ahead for lightning winger Tim Ryan to score Queensland's first try in the 20th minute.
Returning from a two-game suspension for laying out teammate Angus Scott-Young in an infamous training bust-up last month, Amatosero looked a man on a mission.
After finding himself in open space for a 30-metre burst, Amatosero dived over a ruck in search of NSW's second strike.
The referee wouldn't allow it, but sin-binned Queensland number eight Vaiuta Latu for offside at the ruck as new Reds captain Fraser McReight pulled off two miraculous try savers on Joseph-Aukuso Suaalii and Halaholo in the space of 20 seconds to keep the Tahs at bay.
Making his NSW debut at age 31, new Sydney-born skipper Matt Philip decided enough was enough and instructed Creighton to finally take the three points on offer to nudge his side ahead 10-5.
Jorgensen lit up the stadium when he burnt Reds fullback Jock Campbell with a huge sidestep, then out-paced the cover defence of flyhalf Louis Werchon in an electrifying play a minute before half-time.
"He's unreal to play footy with," debutant fullback James Hendren said of Jorgensen after having a hand in the lead-up for the winger's first five-pointer.
"Just get him early and he'll make some magic happen."
Just when the Tahs figured they'd take a 12-point lead into the break, the Reds stole possession after the halftime siren had sounded and Brial somehow crossed in the left corner.
Queensland would have been delighted to only trail 17-12 entering the second half after the home side dominated much of the opening 40 minutes.
The second half was a scoreless affair until replacement prop Isaac Kailea forced his way over in the 65th minute to give the Tahs some breathing space.
When Jack Debreczeni's pinpoint cross-field kick found the fingertips of flanker Charlie Gamble loitering on the wing, the flanker conjured a magical offload off the deck for Jorgensen to bag his second of the night and seal victory.
Wilson's late try sparked joyous celebrations for the home team and fans.

From thrilling performances to hard-earned medal wins, the Milano Cortina Winter Olympics has already delivered moments that will go down in sporting history.
Unfolding against a backdrop of global uncertainty, the Games are bringing together more than 3,500 athletes from 93 countries.
And there have been plenty of wins for Team USA.
Skier Breezy Johnson flashed the first U.S. gold medal before reporters at the base of the mountain at Tofane Alpine Skiing Centre in Cortina d’Ampezzo, while Alysa Liu returned from a two-year retirement to help the U.S. team secure gold in the figure skating competition.
Speedskater Jordan Stolz set a new Olympic record in his first Milano Cortina race, earning gold after he crossed the finish line of the 1000m event in 1 min., 6.28 sec. Figure skater Maxim Naumov received loud cheers as he made his poignant Olympic debut a year after his parents and former coaches, Evgenia Shishkova and Vadim Naumov, died in a plane crash over the Potomac River.
And figure skater Ilia Malinin continued redefining the sport, performing a jaw-dropping backflip.
There have also been less celebratory moments.
Ukrainian skeleton racer Vladyslav Heraskevych was disqualified from the Games over wearing a helmet that depicted the war dead. And in a scene that concerned onlookers, American skier Lindsey Vonn was airlifted to hospital after crashing during a race.

Macron says Europe must redesign its security independently, citing 'holistic' nuclear deterrence

French President says Europe will have to define its own security parameters independently in the future and says Paris holding strategic nuclear talks with allies for common deterrence. 'It's a holistic approach'.
Emmanuel Macron told the Munich Security Conference on Friday that Europe will have to redesign its security architecture on its own terms as it faces an aggressive Russia.
The French president said the current security framework won't hold in the future and Europeans must set out new parameters in their own terms. Macron said that it may include a more "holistic" approach to nuclear deterrence among European allies.
Macron said plans for "a day after" implying a future coexistence with Russia must be drafted by Europeans independently due to their geographical reality and a "bloated" Russian army on what the French leader described as a belligerent "sugar high."
"We have to be the ones to negotiate this new architecture of security for Europe for the day after because our geography will not change," he said.
"We will live with Russia in the same place, and the Europeans at the same place, and I don't want this negotiation to be organised by someone else," he said in an apparent reference to the United States and their direct talks with Moscow.
Macron told the gathering in Munich, which focuses on security and brings together world leaders, future parameters of security may include a new, more holistic nuclear deterrence among European allies. Until now, deterrence has been a strictly national domain and a highly delicate issue because of its implications on sovereignty.
The French leader teased a "new strategic dialogue" on nuclear arms.
"We have engaged a strategic dialogue with Chancelor Merz and (other) European leaders in order to see how we can articulate our national doctrine" with special cooperation and common security interests in some key countries, he said.
"This dialogue is important because it's a way to articulate nuclear deterrence in a holistic approach of defence and security. This is a way to create convergence in our strategic approach between Germany and France," he added.
Earlier, Merz had told the conference he had engaged in "confidential talks" on European nuclear deterrence.
"We Germans are adhering to our legal obligations. We consider this strictly within the context of our nuclear sharing within NATO and we will not allow zones of differing security to emerge in Europe," Merz said.
The comments are significant as it shows Europeans are beginning to think of a future security that relies on their own capabilities, becoming less dependent on the US umbrella for the first time since the end of the Cold War.
The French president said he would deliver more details in the coming weeks.
'Europe is vilified, but it should be proud'
Macron sought to rally support for a stronger and proud Europe, which often lacks self-confidence despite its many strengths, according to the French President, who suggested Europeans are being vilified through false claims amplified on social media.
"We need a much more positive mindset. There has been a tendency in this place and beyond to overlook Europe and sometimes to criticise it outright," Macron said.
"Caricatures have been made, Europe has been vilified as an aging, slow, fragmented construct sidelined by history. As an overregulated economy that shuts innovation, as a society preyed by migration that would corruption its precious traditions.
"And most curiously yet, in some quarters, as a repressive continent," he added.
In his remarks, Macron appeared to push back at the US administration which urged Europe to reverse course or face "civilisational erasure" citing excessive regulation, illegal migration and repressive social media policies curtailing free speech.
"Everyone should take a cue from us, instead of trying to divide us," he said.

MUNICH, February 13. /TASS/. The deployment of European troops to Ukraine would mean an escalation of the conflict, French President Emmanuel Macron said at the Munich Security Conference.
The French leader pointed out that there is no consensus on this issue in Europe.
According to him, the formula is the following: Europe helps Ukraine but does not directly involve itself in hostilities and will continue to do so.
Earlier, Russian Foreign Ministry Spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said that the deployment of Western troops in Ukraine is unacceptable for Russia and that they will be considered legitimate military targets.

The Melbourne Storm has been accused by the Parramatta Eels of asking the NRL head office to apply pressure and force the acquisition of player Zac Lomax.
Lomax was released from the Eels just one year into his deal, allowing him to join a now-delayed rugby union competition.
The Eels have refused to let Lomax sign for the Storm due to a clause in his release, which is the subject of court action.
Melbourne has been accused of asking NRL chief executive Andrew Abdo to "apply a blowtorch" to Parramatta as part of a desperate bid to sign Zac Lomax to the Storm.
Lomax's battle to join Melbourne for 2026 is set to go before the NSW Supreme Court on March 2, with Parramatta refusing to grant him permission to link with the Storm.
The Eels are adamant Lomax knew he would need their permission to play for another NRL club before the end of 2028 when he was released from his $700,000-a-year contract last November in support of his bid to join R360, before the breakaway rugby competition's launch was postponed.
Melbourne has since made three separate offers to Parramatta to try to free him to play this season, all of which have been rejected.
The most recent of those came this week, when Melbourne offered Parramatta $300,000 for Lomax to play for it this season, with $211,000 of that in salary-cap relief.
The courtroom battle has left Lomax with next to no chance of playing for Melbourne against the Eels in round one, given he is also unable to train with the Storm.
Court documents obtained by AAP show the nature of the ongoing feud between Lomax and Parramatta, following his November release from the club.
The most telling passages contain claims from Parramatta that Melbourne chairman Matt Tripp last month raised with his Eels counterpart Matthew Beach the possibility of salary-cap sanctions if the clubs could not reach an agreement.
Parramatta have also accused Melbourne CEO Justin Rodski of messaging Abdo on January 21, asking for head office to apply pressure to Parramatta.
In court documents viewed by AAP on Friday, the Eels claim Rodski sent the following message to Abdo:
"Hi Andrew, not getting anywhere at this point, can you apply the blow torch and get this done," the message is said to have read.
"Lomax staying in the NRL is obviously a win for the game."
That prompted the Eels to write to Abdo the following morning to ask whether sanctions would be imposed if an agreement was not reached.
According to the documents, Abdo is said to have responded, denying the NRL "had made any such statement to the Storm".
The documents also show Lomax will claim his release from Parramatta included a clause that the Eels "would not unreasonably" withhold their consent for him to join another team, and that there was an "implied term of good faith".
The 26-year-old will also argue that Parramatta always knew there was a prospect he could want to return to the NRL with it or another club before the end of 2028.
In turn, he says Parramatta is restraining him from playing in the most competitive rugby league competition in the world, and the most lucrative available.
In response, the Eels said Lomax's exit had impacted their football department, given they could not sign another player of the winger's calibre on a three-season deal that late in the year.
Under the terms of Lomax's exit, the NSW State of Origin representative was not blocked from playing rugby union or signing with rugby league clubs outside of the NRL.
Lomax confirms in the court documents that he received offers from Rugby Australia on December 19 and 23 to play Super Rugby, but it was worth less than his previous rugby league deal.
He also claims that the Storm then made an "unsolicited" approach to him, before the two parties entered a "non-binding agreement" for him to join them.
Parramatta says that then prompted train-and-trial deals to be sent from the Storm to Lomax in early January. Lomax contests certain details of that allegation.

After 800 episodes, ‘The Simpsons’ creators look back — and ahead

After 800 episodes, ‘The Simpsons’ creators look back — and ahead
“The Simpsons” is reaching the 800-episode milestone
- Bookmark
Eight hundred episodes, 37 seasons, and one four-fingered family that refuses to age.
As “The Simpsons” hits a milestone few series have ever glimpsed this weekend, the architects behind Springfield are reflecting on the choices that turned crude 1987 shorts from “The Tracey Ullman Show” into a cultural juggernaut.
“We’ve done 800 episodes, and I’m really glad we didn’t do a big overarching story,” said Al Jean, executive producer and former showrunner. “You always return to square one at the end of the show. And there’s no question that was a big influence on the longevity.”
For Matt Selman, the current showrunner, the Simpsons’ refusal to age is a liberation that simultaneously raises questions about the weight of their long history: “Do these characters have the emotional memory of the 800 things that have happened to them? ... I don’t really know the answer to that.”
Meanwhile, show creator Matt Groening views reaching nearly four decades' worth of production as a triumph tinged with perfectionism.
“I’ve spent 38 years now trying to get them to draw the characters correctly,” Groening said. “We’ve got to figure out how to shift perspective and do it more cinematically and we’re always trying to improve.”
Episode 800, “Irrational Treasure,” airs Sunday on Fox.
The voices behind Springfield
Nancy Cartwright arrived at her 1987 audition expecting to read for Lisa Simpson. She had other ideas.
“Hi Matt. Nice to meet you. I was out there and I noticed that there’s Lisa, that’s fine, 8-year-old middle child, but then there’s this Bart,” Cartwright recalled saying. “I’d kind of like to do him.”
Groening agreed to the “switcheroo” immediately. “She completely channeled him,” he said.
Nearly four decades later, Cartwright notes that “there are still people that yet don’t know that it’s a woman that does the voice.”
The role has become inseparable from her identity. “It’s become such a part of my lifestyle. I’m used to doing it all the time, and I’m not looking forward to the day when we’re done,” she said.
Lisa Simpson’s defining characteristic emerged just as spontaneously. Animator David Silverman, who drew the original outline for the show’s iconic opening sequence, recalled a production meeting where the middle Simpson child lacked a signature moment.
“We don’t have a gag for Lisa, we have a gag for everybody else. What should we do for Lisa?” Silverman reflects. “And I suggested, ‘Well, maybe she’s in the band and maybe she plays a tuba.’ And so Jim (James L. Brooks) said, ‘Well, I don’t know about the tuba but what if she played the baritone saxophone? In fact, what if she played it really well? That could be her character, she could be the genius kid of the family that nobody appreciates.’”
From controversy to institution
The show’s path to becoming a global institution was paved with early outrage. Groening remembers when Bart Simpson was deemed a threat to American classrooms — he relished every moment of it.
“That was the best move ever when the culture decided ‘The Simpsons’ was too outrageous,” Groening said. “And if you wear a Bart Simpson ‘Underachiever’ T-shirt to school, you got kicked out. That was the best thing for us.”
When Fox executives asked whether the show targeted kids or adults, Groening said the creative team made an immediate choice that defined everything that followed. “We said it’s for adults,” he recalled. “And that was the best instantaneous decision that we made because it meant that we could do a wide range of jokes.”
As the internet arrived, so did a new breed of critic. Groening admits the “Comic Book Guy” character — Springfield’s perpetually dissatisfied nerd — was created as a direct response to early online fans declaring every new episode the “worst episode ever.”
“I like analysis and I like criticism,” Groening said. “But ‘That’s not funny’ and ‘That’s boring,’ that annoys me. Those are to me the laziest reactions you can get.”
His prediction for the show’s future carries characteristic sarcasm. “Well, I can tell you this because we are time travelers,” Groening joked. “The Simpsons will be on in a thousand years. Still on. Unfortunately, fans are going to say the show’s been going downhill for the last 500 years.”
Predictions, presidents and pop stars
The show’s supposed ability to predict the future — including a 2000 episode where Lisa inherits the presidency from “President Trump” — has become internet legend.
Jean offered a simple explanation: “Well, the predictions are accidental. We’re not from the future.”
But modern technology has turned prophecy into fraud, according to Selman.
“The predictions are all fake now,” Selman said. “They’re just done by AI. And people all go, ‘Oh my God, how do they do it?’ I throw up my hands in despair for the gullibility of mankind.”
Guest stars have become a hallmark of the series, from Michael Jackson to Lady Gaga to the Rolling Stones. Jackson’s 1991 appearance in “Stark Raving Dad” came after he cold-called Groening.
“I was working late in my office at 10 p.m. My phone rang … ‘Hi, this is Michael Jackson.’ And I hung up because, you know, it was obviously a prank. And he called back, ‘No, really, don’t hang up,’” Groening recalled.
While the show secured the King of Pop in Season 3, one prestigious group has consistently declined invitations to Springfield. “The ones that never said yes were U.S. presidents and I don’t think we’re ever going to do that,” Jean said.
‘The Simpsons’ in the streaming era
Disney’s 2019 acquisition of 21st Century Fox brought “The Simpsons” to Disney+, introducing the show to new generations — and generating some exclusives not factored into the 800-episode count.
“The fact that ‘The Simpsons’ is on Disney+ has really exposed us to a new generation,” said Selman. “If it’s an 8- to 12-year-old’s favorite show for two or three years of their life before they move on to something else, that’s a big win for us.”
Streaming has also liberated the show from commercial constraints. “The thing that’s loosened up for us is the time, because things are tied to commercial breaks,” Groening said. “We still do three acts, or sometimes four acts, because we’re on the Fox network. But for the stuff for Disney, we go wild. And we can stretch out a little bit.”
No end in sight for ‘The Simpsons’
For Jean, the show’s greatest achievement is in the personal connections forged over decades. “I’ll have people come up to me and say, ‘My parents were splitting up. I was going through a bad time as a kid and your show got me through it.’ And I just would go, ‘Oh, this couldn’t mean more.’”
Silverman sees that same impact as the fulfillment of a lifelong ambition. “People often asked me when I wanted to be a cartoonist and animator and said, ‘What goals do you have?’ And I said, ‘I don’t know. The only goal that I would love to see happen is to be involved in some animation project that makes a difference to people.’ So I guess I can check that one off.”
“There’s no end in sight,” Jean said. “We’re gonna go to Season 40, at least. Full steam ahead.”
For Groening, the future remains as open-ended as the series itself: “Believe it or not, there’s still stories that we haven’t gotten around to that are just in my head that I want us to do.”

The Office of the President of Ukraine reported this, according to Ukrinform.
It is noted that particular attention was paid to security guarantees for Ukraine and all of Europe. The President emphasized that Ukrainians, along with all other Europeans, must feel secure in their future and assured that Russian aggression will never occur again.
The sides also discussed the importance of continuing support for Ukraine. Zelensky thanked partners for the productive meeting in the Ramstein format and for new contributions to the PURL initiative. The Head of State called on partners to support PURL and to fully unlock the potential of the SAFE initiative for joint weapons production with Ukraine.
The parties aligned their joint positions, coordinated further steps, and agreed on upcoming contacts in a broader format. Ukraine will compile and send all partners a list of needs to support the energy infrastructure and the military sector.
“We will also work separately on air defense missiles and other measures to strengthen our armed forces. We will be developing it now – our diplomats and military advisers. We want, within 10–11 days, by February 24, and with all partners’ agreement, to secure the maximum support packages for Ukraine. We also want both packages and decisions in place,” the President said following the meeting.
The Head of State also briefed partners on meetings between the Ukrainian, U.S., and Russian delegations in Abu Dhabi, the most important outcome of which was the return home of 157 Ukrainians from Russian captivity. In addition, the parties discussed political and military issues and agreed to hold further talks in the near future.
The Munich meeting was attended by Chancellor of Germany Friedrich Merz, President of France Emmanuel Macron, President of Finland Alexander Stubb, Prime Minister of the United Kingdom Keir Starmer, Prime Minister of Denmark Mette Frederiksen, Prime Minister of Poland Donald Tusk, Prime Minister of Sweden Ulf Kristersson, Prime Minister of Norway Jonas Gahr Støre, Prime Minister of the Netherlands Dik Schoof, Prime Minister of Estonia Kristen Michal, NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte, President of the European Council António Costa, President of the European Commission Ursula von der Leyen, Deputy Prime Minister – Minister of Foreign Affairs of Italy Antonio Tajani, and Minister of Foreign Affairs of Canada Anita Anand.

The Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) on Friday ruled against Ukrainian skeleton racer Vladyslav Heraskevych, who had appealed against his disqualification from the Winter Olympics.
CAS was Heraskevych’s final chance to be reinstated after he was barred from competing for his refusal not to wear a helmet honoring 24 Ukrainian athletes and children killed by Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine.

According to AFP, CAS Secretary-General Matthieu Reeb told reporters waiting outside the appeal hearing “that freedom of expression is guaranteed at the Olympic Games, but not on the field of play, which is a sacred principle.”
The Olympic Charter includes an explicit commitment to peacebuilding through sport. The International Olympic Committee (IOC) argues that, in order to meet this commitment, the competition – and competitors – must remain apolitical.
Reeb said that Annett Rombach, the German arbitrator who ruled against Heraskevych, was, “fully sympathetic” to his aims despite having no choice but to find that his helmet did violate the IOC’s Athlete Expression Guidelines.
However, Heraskevych stands by his actions – late Friday evening, he called his disqualification a “purely discriminatory decision” by the IOC.
President Volodymyr Zelensky, too, criticized the ruling. Writing on X, he said that “no rule has been broken.”

“Sport shouldn’t mean amnesia, and the Olympic movement should help stop wars, not play into the hands of aggressors,” he continued, adding that 660 Ukrainian athletes and coaches have been killed by Russia since the full-scale invasion began.
“We are proud of Vladyslav and of what he did. Having courage is worth more than any medal,” Zelensky said.
The president also hit out at the inclusion of 19 Russian athletes in the games under a “neutral” banner.
“They compete under ‘neutral’ flags at the Games, while in real life publicly supporting Russian aggression against Ukraine and the occupation of our territories. And they are the ones who deserve disqualification,” he said.
However, the ban on Russian and Belarusian athletes participating has itself been challenged in recent weeks. Both FIFA head Gianni Infantino and International Ice Hockey Federation chief Luc Tardif have called for their inclusion since the beginning of February.

Trump sending second US aircraft carrier to pile pressure on Iran

- US President Trump sent a second aircraft carrier group to the Middle East, warning Iran of a "bad day" if no nuclear deal is made.
- US and Iran held nuclear talks in Oman, but an accord is "terribly difficult." Israel expressed scepticism, wanting missile/proxy issues addressed.
- Iran's deadly crackdown on protests killed thousands and arrested over 53,000 people. Calls for new protests persist amid potential death sentences.
AI generated
WASHINGTON - US President Donald Trump said on Feb 13 he was sending a second aircraft carrier group to the Middle East – warning it would be a “bad day for Iran” if it fails to make a deal on its nuclear programme.
Mr Trump has upped the military threat against the Islamic republic in the wake of Tehran’s deadly crackdown protests in January
“In case we don’t make a deal, we’ll need it,” Mr Trump told journalists at the White House, when asked about reports the USS Gerald R. Ford would be moved from the Caribbean to the Middle East.
“It’ll be leaving very soon. We have one out there that just arrived. If we need it we’ll have it ready, a very big force.”
Mr Trump said he believed the talks with Iran would be “successful” but added: “If they’re not, it’s going to be a bad day for Iran, very bad.”
The US leader had already sent one aircraft carrier, the USS Abraham Lincoln, to the Middle East, as part of a fleet of 12 US Navy ships in the region.
The four vessels led by the Ford - the world’s largest aircraft carrier - have been in the Caribbean, where US forces captured Venezuelan president Nicolas Maduro
They are not expected to return to their home ports until late April or early May, The New York Times said.
‘Terribly difficult’
While the protests have subsided for now, US-based Mr Reza Pahlavi, the son of the shah ousted by the 1979 Islamic revolution, urged Iranians to chant slogans against the clerical establishment in the coming days to coincide with demonstrations abroad.
Rather than pointing to the crackdown – which has seen tens of thousands arrested and hundreds facing possible execution, according to rights groups – Mr Trump has recently focused his military threats on Iran’s nuclear programme.
The West fears the programme is aimed at making a bomb, which Tehran denies.
The head of the UN nuclear watchdog, Mr Rafael Grossi, said on Feb 13 that reaching an accord with Iran on inspections of its processing facilities was possible but “terribly difficult”.
Iran and the US, who have had no diplomatic relations since shortly after the revolution, held talks on the nuclear issue last week in Oman. No dates have been set for new talks yet.
The US joined Israel’s 12-day war against the Islamic republic in June, carrying out strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities.
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said after meeting Mr Trump in Washington
But the Israeli prime minister himself expressed scepticism at the quality of any agreement if it didn’t also cover Iran’s ballistic missiles and support for regional proxies.
Reformists released
There is no consensus on what Washington would target in new strikes or whether it would seek to slacken Iranian supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei’s grip on power.
Mr Pahlavi, in a post on X, urged Iranians inside the country to add their voices to protests planned abroad on Feb 14 by chanting slogans from their homes and rooftops.
Videos verified by AFP showed people in Iran this week chanting anti-government slogans as the clerical leadership celebrated the anniversary of the Islamic revolution.
According to the US-based Human Rights Activists News Agency, 7,005 people, mostly protesters, were killed in the recent crackdown, although rights groups warn the toll is likely far higher.
More than 53,000 people have also been arrested, it added.
The Norway-based Iran Human Rights (IHR) NGO said “hundreds” of people were facing charges linked to the protests that could see them sentenced to death.
It said one protester, Saleh Mohammadi, 18, had already been sentenced to death on charges of killing a policeman, although the Iranian judiciary said no final and “enforceable” verdict had been issued in the case.
Figures working within the Iranian system have also been arrested, with three politicians detained this week from the so-called reformist wing of Iranian politics supportive of President Masoud Pezeshkian.
The three – Azar Mansouri, Javad Emam and Ebrahim Asgharzadeh – were released on bail on Feb 12 and 13, their lawyer Hojjat Kermani told the ISNA news agency. AFP

International Olympic Committee secures big win on athlete speech limits ahead of 2028 LA Games
The International Olympic Committee secured a victory for itself when a Ukrainian skeleton athlete lost his appeal against disqualification from the Milan Cortina Games
- Bookmark
The International Olympic Committee secured a major victory for its rules on athlete speech and expression Friday when a Ukrainian skeleton athlete lost his appeal against disqualification from the Milan Cortina Games.
Vladyslav Heraskevych, who had been a medal contender heading into his sliding event, wanted to compete while wearing a “helmet of memory” covered with portraits of more than 20 Ukrainian athletes and coaches killed during four years of war with Russia.
The IOC said no and eventually disqualified Heraskevych. The Ukrainian appealed the decision to the Court of Arbitration for Sport but he was denied again.
The verdict reinforces limits on how much the IOC will tolerate athletes seeking to make statements in the field of play that go beyond sports.
Heraskevych did win sympathy and respect from IOC President Kirsty Coventry, who was in tears after their early-morning trackside meeting Thursday in Cortina d’Ampezzo. But his courtroom loss on Friday eases the IOC’s legal path with the Los Angeles Summer Games looming in two years and beyond.
Olympic rules
The helmet, which had no words or slogans, seemed designed to comply with Rule 50 of the Olympic Charter, which bans political statements on the field of play and medals podium.
The IOC let Heraskevych wear the helmet for training runs but insisted he could not wear it during his four scheduled competition runs. He was told he could display the helmet in media interview areas and was offered the compromise of wearing a black armband at all times.
Heraskevych refused and took his disqualification to CAS, an IOC-backed sports court based in Switzerland that has special tribunals set up at each Olympics.
The IOC, however, did not invoke Rule 50. That could have been harder to prove when Heraskevych’s helmet did not explicitly criticize or even name Russia.
Instead, the IOC pivoted to its Athlete Expression Guidelines, which are covered by Rule 40 in the charter and were drafted in consultation with athlete groups. The guidelines seek to regulate freedom of speech at the Olympic s.
“The focus at the Olympic Games must remain on athletes’ performances, sport and the international unity and harmony that the Olympic Games seek to advance,” the five-page document states.
The IOC repeatedly said this week the guidelines also protect athletes who might otherwise be pressured in their home countries to carry political messaging against their beliefs into Olympic arenas.
The CAS ruling
Details of the ruling, written by a single judge, were published five hours after the hearing. Judge Annett Rombach of Germany completely upheld the IOC's legal position that Heraskevych was in breach of expression guidelines for insisting to wear the helmet during his competition.
She found "these limitations reasonable and proportionate,” the court said.
The IOC guidelines “provide a reasonable balance between athletes’ interests to express their views, and athletes’ interests to receive undivided attention for their sporting performance on the field of play,” the court said.
Rombach “is bound by such proportionate rules and has no means to override them,” the court said, adding she was “fully sympathetic to Mr. Heraskevych’s commemoration.”
She also supported the decision of the IOC to give back the athlete’s accreditation and not expel him from the Olympics. The 27-year-old Heraskevych was instead expected to head to Munich and meet with Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy, who on Thursday awarded him a state honor.
An attorney for Heraskevych, Yevhen Pronin, wrote in his Telegram channel that “this case was much broader than an individual dispute.”
“It concerned the freedom of expression of athletes, the limits of discretion of sports bodies, and the very understanding of Olympic values,” he wrote.

Don Lemon pleads not guilty to civil rights charges after Minnesota anti-ICE protest
Unknown

05:15:36 KST

Former CNN host turned independent journalist Don Lemon pleaded not guilty on Friday to federal civil rights charges connected to his coverage of a protest at a Minnesota church where an Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) official is a pastor. Four others also pleaded not guilty in the case.
Lemon did not comment to reporters as he entered the courthouse accompanied by his attorney Joe Thompson, but he later issued a statement stating his refusal to be intimidated by the Trump administration and vowing to “fight these baseless charges”.
“For more than 30 years, I have been a journalist – and the power and protection of the first amendment has been the underpinning of my work,” Lemon said, referring to the US constitutional right to a free press. “The events before my arrest, and what’s happened since, show that people are finally realizing what this administration is all about.
“For them, the process is the punishment. Like all of you here in Minnesota, I will not be intimidated, I will not back down, and I will fight these baseless charges.”
Roughly two dozen protesters stood outside the building, chanting “Pam Bondi has got to go” and “Protect the press”. They held signs with slogans including “Lemon was just doing his job” and “ICE out”.
The veteran journalist’s attorney Abbe David Lowell told the judge that he will raise first amendment issues in the case. Lemon, 59, has said he was at the Southern Baptist church in St Paul to chronicle the protest but was not a participant.
Lowell also asked for Lemon’s phone to be returned after it was taken from him during his arrest in Los Angeles, saying its seizure was a possible “over-execution”. Prosecutors said the phone was in Department of Homeland Security custody, and that the search warrant for it was under seal. The phone could not be returned until the search process was completed, they said.
The civil rights attorney Nekima Levy Armstrong was among the other defendants to plead not guilty. The prominent local activist was the subject of a doctored photo posted on official White House social media that falsely showed her crying during her arrest. The picture is part of a deluge of AI-altered imagery that has circulated since the fatal shootings of Renee Good and Alex Pretti by federal officers in Minneapolis amid the Trump administration’s immigration crackdown.
Two more defendants accused in the church protest are scheduled for arraignment next week, including another independent journalist, Georgia Fort. Nine people have been charged in the case.
Protesters interrupted a service at the Cities church on 18 January by chanting “ICE out” and “Justice for Renee Good”, referring to the 37-year-old mother of three who had been fatally shot by an ICE officer in Minneapolis 11 days prior.
A federal grand jury in Minnesota indicted Lemon on charges of conspiracy and interfering with congregants’ constitutional rights to freely exercise their religion during the protest. He has said he is not affiliated with the protest group and that he was there as a journalist to chronicle the event for his livestream show.
“I have spent my entire career covering the news. I will not stop now. In fact, there is no more important time than right now, this very moment for a free and independent media that shines a light on the truth and holds those in power accountable,” Lemon told reporters after his arrest.
The National Association of Black Journalists (NABJ) called the arrests of Lemon and fellow freelancer Georgia Fort part of “the government’s escalating effort and actions to criminalize and threaten press freedom under the guise of law enforcement”.
“A government that responds to scrutiny by targeting the messenger is not protecting the public,” the NABJ said in a statement. “It is attempting to intimidate it, and considering recent incidents regarding federal agents, it is attempting to distract it.”
The church protest drew sharp complaints from conservative religious and political leaders. The US attorney general, Pam Bondi, called the demonstration a “coordinated attack” on the church. Meanwhile, the White House press secretary, Karoline Leavitt, warned in a social media post: “President Trump will not tolerate the intimidation and harassment of Christians in their sacred places of worship.” Even clergy who oppose the administration’s immigration enforcement tactics expressed discomfort with the protest.
All nine are charged under the 1994 Freedom of Access to Clinic Entrances Act, which prohibits interference or intimidation of “any person by force, threat of force, or physical obstruction exercising or seeking to exercise the right of religious freedom at a place of religious worship”. Penalties can range up to a year in prison and up to a $10,000 fine.
Thompson is one of several former prosecutors who have left the US attorney’s office in Minnesota in recent weeks citing frustration with the Trump administration’s immigration enforcement crackdown in the state and the justice department’s response to the killing of Good and Pretti.
One of four lawyers registered to represent Lemon, Thompson had led the sprawling investigation of major public program fraud cases for the prosecutor’s office until he resigned last month. The Trump administration has cited the fraud cases, in which most defendants have come from the state’s large Somali community, as justification for its immigration crackdown.

MOSCOW, February 13. /TASS/. Iran and the United State can reach an agreement on the Iranian nuclear dossier if Washington drops its attempts to impose its vision of the talks’ outcome, Iranian Ambassador to Russia Kazem Jalali said.
"I think it is possible to reach an agreement. But only if no one dictates the results of the talks before these talks begin. You know, such a situation has nothing to do with talks. This is imposing of one’s position," he said in an interview with the Rossiya-24 television channel.
He stressed that in exchange for inspections and agreements, the United States must lift its sanctions.
Iran and the US held another round of talks on Tehran’s nuclear program in Oman on February 6. Tehran’s delegation was led by Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi, and the US delegation was headed by Special Presidential Envoy Steve Witkoff. Earlier, the White House said that it was seriously considering the use of force against Iran.

Zelensky has to 'get moving' on peace deal, Trump says

U.S. President Donald Trump said Feb. 13 that President Volodymyr Zelensky needs to "get moving" to secure a peace deal with Russia.
When asked by a reporter whether there had been progress in Ukraine-Russia negotiations — and whether he was still demanding that Ukraine hold elections by the summer — Trump did not answer directly. Instead, he said Zelensky "is going to have to get moving."
"Russia wants to make a deal and Zelensky is going to have to get moving, otherwise he's going to miss a great opportunity," Trump claimed. "He has to move."
Trump's comments come as the United States intensifies diplomatic efforts aimed at brokering an end to Russia's war in Ukraine, which is nearing its fourth anniversary.
As part of these efforts, U.S., Ukrainian, and Russian officials held trilateral talks in January and again in early February, with another round expected next week.
Russia, however, has not indicated publicly that it is ready to "make a deal." In recent days, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said that "there is still a long way to go" in the ongoing negotiations.
He has also reiterated Moscow's hardline position that Ukraine should cede territory without a fight.
Lavrov is not the only senior Russian official to minimize the progress Washington has described in the talks. In a Feb. 2 interview, former Russian President Dmitry Medvedev said that Russia's objectives in the war remain fundamentally unchanged.
The remarks from Lavrov and Medvedev appear to undermine Trump's assertion that Ukraine and Russia are "closer than ever before" to a peace agreement — and, in particular, his claim that Russia is prepared to reach a deal.
Zelensky, meanwhile, has emphasized that Ukraine is not an obstacle to peace. In a recent interview with The Atlantic, he said Kyiv has sought to negotiate in good faith by backing U.S. proposals aimed at moving negotiations forward.
At the same time, Zelensky also said that he would rather accept no deal than pressure Ukrainians into a bad one, arguing that any settlement must ensure a dignified, lasting peace for his country — and include clear security guarantees to prevent Russia from attacking again.

The seventh edition of the TRT World Citizen Awards brought together remarkable individuals whose work has left a profound humanitarian imprint across continents, with a deeply emotional moment unfolding when First Lady Emine Erdogan hugged slain Gaza journalist Yahya Barzaq’s mother during the ceremony.
Hosted by TRT on Friday, the ceremony celebrated educators, youth leaders, communicators, architects and advocates whose efforts have improved lives and defended human dignity in some of the world’s most challenging contexts.
Among those in attendance was Turkish First Lady Emine Erdogan, who expressed her pleasure at participating in what she described as a meaningful gathering that transcended language, colour and geography.
In a message shared on her official X account, she emphasised that the event served as a reminder that humanity knows no borders, and that countless unsung heroes continue to strive for a more just world.
This year’s awards highlighted diverse forms of impact.
The Educator Award was presented to Rudayna Abdo, Founder and CEO of the Thaki platform, whose innovative approach to digital learning has enabled tens of thousands of refugee and disadvantaged children in Lebanon and Jordan to access quality education.
By repurposing donated computers and equipping them with offline educational content, Abdo has established a sustainable, rights-based model that expands educational opportunity where it is most needed.
The Youth Award recognised Nigerian activist Amara Nwuneli, whose creative environmental initiatives have transformed waste-filled spaces into safe playgrounds constructed from recycled materials.
Her work not only promotes sustainability but also upholds children’s right to play, reaching thousands and offering a replicable model for communities facing similar challenges.
In the realm of ethical communication, the Communicator Award was jointly presented to software engineers Ibtihal Abousaad and Vaniya Agrawal.
Their principled stance against linking artificial intelligence and cloud technologies to human rights violations underscored a powerful message: communication, particularly in the digital age, carries ethical responsibility.
By taking a public position, they reinforced the idea that technology must serve humanity rather than harm it.
Yahya Barzaq
The most poignant moment of the evening came during the presentation of the World Citizen of the Year Award, dedicated to the slain Gaza journalist Yahya Barzaq.
Barzaq was killed by an Israeli strike on September 30 while reporting from Gaza, documenting the experiences of civilians amid Israeli genocide.
Through his lens, he conveyed the quiet resilience, dignity and suffering of ordinary people, leaving behind a legacy of truth-telling that resonated far beyond the region.
In her remarks, Emine Erdogan paid tribute to Barzaq and to all Palestinians who were killed by Israel
She described him as a brother who had been martyred while bringing the realities of Gaza to the world’s attention.
She offered prayers for him and for all Palestinian martyrs, honouring their memory and reaffirming solidarity with those enduring hardship.
Emotional moment
A deeply emotional moment unfolded when Emine Erdogan embraced Yahya Barzaq’s mother during the ceremony.
The embrace symbolised shared grief and compassion, transcending formal protocol. It was a gesture that reflected not only personal condolence but also a broader message of empathy and unity in the face of loss.
Observers described the moment as one of the most moving scenes of the evening, capturing the human essence of the awards.
The Lifetime Achievement Award was presented to Italian architect Raul Pantaleo, whose humanitarian architecture has delivered free healthcare facilities in crisis and conflict zones. By designing structures that provide life-saving services, Pantaleo has demonstrated that architecture can function as an instrument of social justice and solidarity.
Meanwhile, the Accessibility Award was awarded to Joohi Tahir for her pioneering efforts to advance the inclusion of persons with disabilities within Muslim communities. Through MUHSEN, the organisation she co-founded, Tahir has championed accessibility standards in places of worship, fostering dignified and equal participation and creating a systematic model for inclusive communities.
Reflecting on the stories of each laureate, Emine Erdogan remarked that their experiences demonstrated humanity’s refusal to surrender to despair. She noted that in different corners of the world, countless individuals continue to stand on the side of justice in what she described as the enduring struggle between right and wrong. Their determination, she said, offers strength and inspiration to all who seek fairness and compassion.
She also extended heartfelt congratulations to all award recipients, wishing that their courage and achievements would endure.
In closing, she thanked the TRT family and everyone who contributed to the organisation of the programme, acknowledging their role in amplifying voices that might otherwise go unheard.

Mexican officials feared El Paso airspace closure signaled U.S. incursion into Mexico

Click here to listen to this article - Share via
- Mexican security officials wondered if the closure of El Paso airspace meant the U.S. was preparing to strike a drug kingpin in the border state of Chihuahua.
- U.S. officials said the closure was prompted by a cartel-operated drone that had flown into U.S. airspace.
- President Trump has repeatedly suggested that the U.S. should strike cartels in Mexico. Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum has called such an operation unacceptable.
MEXICO CITY — Members of Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum’s Cabinet woke up on Wednesday morning to news that U.S. aviation officials had shut down airspace over El Paso, the Texas city opposite the border metropolis of Ciudad Juárez.
Coming just weeks after the closure of airspace over Venezuela cleared the way for the capture of Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro, the move triggered alarm among Cabinet members tasked with maintaining national security and raised fear of a possible incursion by U.S. forces, according to people familiar with the conversations. They spoke on condition of anonymity to disclose high-level discussions.
Officials suspected the El Paso airspace was closed in preparation for a unilateral raid against a drug kingpin in Chihuahua state, just across the border in Mexico. U.S. officials described the closure as a matter of national security and said it would last 10 days.
Omar García Harfuch, Mexico’s security minister, called high-ranking officials in the U.S. early Wednesday and was told that the closure was not related to a raid on Mexico, according to an official familiar with the conversations.
No floodlights illuminate the night sky when the citizens of Mexico’s Gotham need a hand.
He informed security Cabinet officials at a daily morning briefing held by Sheinbaum, which included the ministers of defense and navy, of his call with U.S. officials.
Hours later, the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration reopened the El Paso airspace. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy posted on X that “the threat had been neutralized.”
Officially, U.S. officials said a cartel-operated drone had violated U.S. airspace and that it was neutralized by a powerful anti-drone laser. A source in the U.S. government who requested anonymity to discuss internal matters said the object was not a drone but a Mylar party balloon.
Over the last year, President Trump has threatened to send U.S. special forces after Mexican drug cartel kingpins. Trump has said he’s repeatedly asked Sheinbaum to allow the U.S. military to operate in Mexico, an offer she has rejected as unacceptable and a violation of Mexican sovereignty.
For Mexican officials, this week’s closure was especially startling — and worrying — because it came just weeks after the U.S. special forces captured Maduro in Caracas on Jan. 3.
Mexican officials had watched with alarm as the U.S. ramped up pressure on Maduro in the weeks before his arrest, amassing warships off the Venezuelan coast before capturing him and his wife and bringing them to New York to face drug-trafficking charges in U.S. federal court.
The Federal Aviation Administration reopened the airspace around El Paso International Airport in Texas.
This week, Mexican officials thought the U.S. was preparing such a strike in Mexico, people familiar with the conversations said.
“The concern was that there was a target they wanted on the Juárez side,” one person familiar with the talks said.
Sheinbaum, meanwhile, has steadily increased security cooperation with the U.S., in an effort to assuage Trump and stave off unilateral U.S. action inside Mexico. In an unprecedented move, the Sheinbaum administration circumvented Mexican extradition law and delivered nearly 100 imprisoned drug lords to U.S. authorities in the last year.
But those prisoner transfers have not eased tensions on the U.S.-Mexico border where cartel drones regularly fly into U.S. airspace, according to the Department of Homeland Security.
Reports of airspace closure spread quickly in El Paso on Wednesday morning.
“I thought they were moving a high-value target in or out of the area,” said El Paso resident Narada Johnson.
“This unnecessary decision has caused chaos and confusion in the El Paso community,” said the city’s mayor, Renard Johnson, in a news conference after the restriction was lifted. “This should never have happened.”
The closure came after the Department of Homeland Security prepared to fire a powerful counter-drone laser. Use of the weapon was confirmed by The Times. The agency targeted what was thought to be a cartel-controlled “dark drone,” which does not emit a radio signal or broadcast its identification, according to one person familiar with the operation who requested anonymity to discuss internal matters.
In recent months, the U.S. government has ramped up counter-drone operations on the southern border. Criminal groups often use the drones to traffic fentanyl and surveil U.S. law enforcement operations, said Steven Willoughby, director of the counter-drone program at the Department of Homeland Security, at a congressional hearing last July.
Willoughby said that in 2023 law enforcement seized one such drone carrying 3.6 pounds of fentanyl. Willoughby said the Department of Homeland Security counted some 27,000 drones flying within 500 meters (almost 550 yards) of the U.S. border, just in the last half of 2024.
Mexican Security Minister Omar García Harfuch wrote in a social media post on X that the people transferred were “high impact criminals” that “represented a real threat to the country’s security.”
At her daily news conference Wednesday, Sheinbaum appeared to dismiss the presence of cartel-operated drones in the border region.
“There is no information related to the use of drones at the border,” Sheinbaum said.
However, cartel drone incursions topped the agenda of the most recent bilateral security meeting in Mexico City late last year, according to people familiar with the talks. At the meeting, U.S. officials stressed the need for greater coordination to stop drone incursions into U.S. airspace. The Mexican government said it would create a working group on the topic.

How Israel is eroding life for Palestinians in the West Bank
Unknown
Unknown Publisher
2026-02-13

05:11:11 KST

Today, a quiet transformation is advancing in the West Bank. It isn’t the same spectacular form of violence that once commanded the global news cycle in Gaza, but it is more methodical and durable — and more difficult to interrupt.
It unfolds in three seemingly unrelated processes: financial warfare against Palestinian economic life, state-backed settler terror, and the legalization of annexation. What binds these processes together isn’t simply their occurrence in the same territory at the same time, but their shared architecture: they are part of a regime of compression that doesn’t outright destroy Palestinian life, but systematically constrains it.
Each mechanism operates through a different register — one through liquidity, one through violence, one through law — but all converge on the same objective: to narrow the field for Palestinian life to continue.
All of this takes place under the radar, as the world appears to be moving away from Palestine. The global movements were, after all, convoked by the horror of daily massacres, yet everything in the West Bank appears unchanging on the surface. The daily passage through checkpoints has hardened into a ritual. Over 42,000 Palestinian refugees from the camps in Jenin and Tulkarem remain displaced, inhabiting a suspended tension that refuses resolution.
As the massacres in Gaza change form and lose their most spectacular force, the movements protesting them falter, and solidarity reveals its dependence on blood and catastrophe. When horror becomes less televisable, attention disperses — a grim reflection of the state of the global attention economy.
This endless churn has done more than exhaust attention: it is laying the groundwork for other violence to proceed in the West Bank unnoticed.
This is how the Israeli regime of compression continues to erode the conditions for Palestinian existence.
Financial blockages
The West Bank is facing a severe banking and liquidity crisis driven by long-standing Israeli limits on currency exchanges under the 1994 Paris Protocol. For nearly three decades, Israel has informally capped the annual conversion of shekels from Palestinian banks at NIS 18 billion, a figure that has not kept pace with Palestinian economic growth. The result is that Palestinian banks have accumulated large surpluses of Israeli shekels they are unable to convert into foreign currencies such as U.S. dollars or Jordanian dinars. In May of 2024, the Palestinian Monetary Authority halted banks from accepting additional shekels, leading to widespread disruptions: individuals have struggled to deposit checks, businesses have been unable to deposit revenues, and some residents have been pushed into overdraft.
The shortage of convertible currency has also fueled a black market where shekels are exchanged at rates significantly below the official rate. The crisis has been compounded by reduced Palestinian labor access to Israel since October 2023, which has curtailed the flow of wages that once provided a steady source of foreign currency.
In recent months, Israeli Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich has taken additional steps that Palestinians view as attempts to further weaken economic coordination: he has opposed increasing the shekel conversion cap and ordered the cancellation of an Israeli government bank guarantee (an “indemnity” letter of sorts) that protects Israeli banks when working with Palestinian banking institutions. Although this revocation has not yet formally taken effect, it reflects a broader shift in Israeli policy aimed at limiting financial cooperation with the Palestinian Authority and creating the conditions for a sustained crisis in the Palestinian banking system.
What the manufactured banking crisis reveals is not an aberration but a governing logic: blockage as method. The threatened withdrawal of correspondent banking safeguards was not simply a financial maneuver; it exposed the structural chokehold embedded in the Palestinian economy. Because Palestinian banks rely on Israeli counterparts to clear shekels and process cross-border transactions, the entire monetary system remains externally mediated. The refusal to absorb surplus shekels, the freezing or delay of clearance mechanisms, and the periodic threat to sever indemnified banking ties together form a regime of controlled interruption. Like physical checkpoints, this system establishes financial ones.
Blockage operates by constricting the circulation of currency, liquidity, and credit, until economic life slows to the edge of asphyxiation. This is not a collapse in the dramatic sense, but something more calculated. Financial systems depend on confidence: the expectation that deposits are secure, that liquidity will be available, that correspondent channels will remain open. By repeatedly threatening to terminate safeguards and disrupt clearance processes, Israel injects uncertainty into the bloodstream of Palestinian finance. Banks continue operating, but under permanent duress. Depositors remain, but with mounting anxiety. The Palestinian Monetary Authority reassures, yet reassurance itself becomes part of the crisis management cycle.
Blockage thus produces chronic precarity rather than immediate implosion. It hollows institutions from within, eroding trust while maintaining the façade of normalcy. As a settler-colonial strategy, blockage precedes demolition. It prepares the ground. The Palestinian banking sector — once portrayed as a pillar of relative stability — becomes the site where sovereignty’s absence is felt most acutely.
The capacity to restrict circulation transforms economic dependency into political leverage. Blockage is the first movement in a sequence aimed at dismantling the Palestinian world: not by spectacular destruction alone, but by quietly closing the channels through which that world sustains itself. It pushes Palestinians — traders, merchants, businesses, and laborers alike — toward the brink, where economic life narrows into mere survival and the edge becomes not an exception, but a condition.
Settler terror
What began as the solitary steps of a settler descending from the Nahal Adasha farm into Khirbet al-Halawa unfolded into a coordinated spectacle of domination across Masafer Yatta in the southern West Bank. After an altercation with residents, the settler summoned reinforcements; dozens arrived, some armed, soon joined by Israeli soldiers. For hours, according to Palestinian eyewitnesses, settlers beat residents, stole dozens of sheep, torched property and firewood reserves, shattered windows and sprayed homes with pepper spray. Men were detained and forced to sit on the ground, women and children assaulted, and ambulances obstructed.
In nearby Khirbet al-Fakhit, a 48-year-old man was left hospitalized with a fractured skull and cerebral hemorrhage as his elderly mother was injured beside him. Sheep were driven toward outposts and settlements as night fell, the violence stretching from one hamlet to the next in what residents described as a pre-planned raid.
Throughout much of the six-hour episode, Israeli forces were present. Villagers recount soldiers standing by as livestock were taken and, at points, restricting the movement of medics attempting to reach the wounded. Two Palestinian women were arrested and later released without charge. What Palestinians experienced was not merely mob violence, but a choreography of impunity in which the architecture of occupation — civilian outposts, armed settlers and uniformed soldiers — converged to produce dispossession in real time.
This scene is not new. It is the grammar of life in Area C, the 60 percent of the West Bank under full Israeli control. In these marginal expanses, Palestinian construction is reduced to the minimum, and permanence is treated as provocation. Life follows seasonal rhythms: the olive harvest, the tending of flocks, the slow movement across open land. These are not empty spaces. They are lived geographies, sustained by grazing routes, footpaths, and inherited care. Yet their openness makes them vulnerable. They are exposed to encroachment and choreographed intimidation, to a regime that reads mobility itself as a claim.
The violence is multi-directional. The settler both mimics the Palestinian and burns the land; he imitates the grazing even as he slaughters the flock; he sets fire to the olive trees and tears up the very soil from which they draw their stubborn life. The attack on Masafer Yatta was not an isolated eruption. Similar incidents have been documented across the West Bank with increasing frequency since October 2023: in al-Tuwani, where settlers blocked farmers from accessing their land during the olive harvest; in Susiya, where outpost expansion has pushed families off grazing areas they’ve used for generations; in Jinba, where military “firing zone” designations have been weaponized to facilitate displacement. The pattern is consistent: violence creates facts on the ground that administrative measures then consolidate.
But more than anything, settler terror is meant to confine, to demolish, and to render life unlivable — to compress existence into ever-narrower enclosures where departure begins to appear as the only remaining horizon. What distinguishes the current moment is not the invention of these tactics but their intensification and coordination.
Settler terror has always been a feature of the occupation, but it now operates with a brazenness that also means official sanction. Israeli ministers openly celebrate attacks. Police investigations are perfunctory or nonexistent. The message is clear: Palestinian presence is provisional, subject to revocation through a combination of legal restriction and physical intimidation.
Annexation and legalization
What has unfolded is not a dramatic proclamation of sovereignty, but something far more insidious: a quiet tightening of the grip. In recent months, the Israeli government has advanced a series of measures that function as instruments of territorial absorption. In January, the Knesset passed legislation effectively legalizing dozens of settlement outposts built on private Palestinian land, retroactively granting them official status. The law allows settlers to claim ownership of land they have occupied, often for years, by asserting that their presence was authorized, even when no such authorization existed. Palestinian landowners are entitled to compensation in theory, but the mechanism for securing it is cumbersome, requires navigating Israeli courts, and offers no guarantee of success.
Simultaneously, the government has moved to ease restrictions on settlement expansion. Planning committees that once required coordination with the Civil Administration — the Israeli military body that governs Area C — can now approve construction more rapidly. Environmental review processes have been streamlined. Archaeological assessments, which previously delayed some projects, are now fast-tracked or waived. The cumulative effect is to remove bureaucratic friction that had, at times, slowed settlement growth. What was once incremental becomes accelerated.
These measures are presented as administrative adjustments, yet they function as instruments of territorial absorption. Annexation here is not declared; it is sedimented — layer by layer, permit by permit, registry by registry.
By opening land records and stripping away safeguards, the state transforms the landscape into a marketplace in which power, capital, and coercion converge. The violence is bureaucratic, its language technical, but its effect unmistakably political: the steady erasure of Palestinian spatial presence in favor of a sovereign claim that advances without ever naming itself.
These measures also hollow out what remains of Palestinian administrative autonomy. The Oslo framework — already fractured and unequal — rested on the fiction of delegated authority in designated areas of the West Bank, what are called Areas A and B. Now, even that fiction is being methodically dismantled.
By extending Israeli enforcement powers into spheres once managed by Palestinian institutions — planning, environmental regulation, heritage — the architecture of limited self-rule collapses inward. The Palestinian Authority is not confronted in open rupture, but bypassed, rendered irrelevant, and quietly displaced by a regime of direct oversight. What appears to be governance reform is, in fact, the reconfiguration of sovereignty on the ground.
The seriousness of these steps lies not only in their immediate impact but in their temporal ambition. This is not policy as reaction, but policy as permanence. It seeks to foreclose the future by reshaping the present — embedding Israeli control so deeply into the territory’s legal and administrative fabric that reversal becomes unimaginable.
The Western backers of Israel may issue condemnations, but the machinery of consolidation proceeds with procedural calm. Each regulatory adjustment, each planning approval, each land registration incrementally transforms the status quo into something international law no longer has the vocabulary to challenge.
The logic of compression
Blockage constricts economic circulation. Terror renders physical space dangerous and uncertain. Law forecloses legal recourse and administrative autonomy. The banking crisis means that even those with capital cannot reliably access it. Settler violence means that even those with land cannot safely work it. Legal annexation means that even those with title cannot defend it.
Together, they produce a condition in which protection recedes, and exposure becomes ordinary.
The aim here is not to eliminate the Palestinian population yet—such a project would invite international condemnation and organized resistance—but to manage it at the threshold of viability. Palestinians remain, but their capacity for autonomous social, economic, and political reproduction continues to contract. Businesses operate, but under conditions that prevent expansion. Farmers cultivate, but on ever-smaller parcels. Institutions function, but without the resources or authority to serve their populations effectively. Life continues, but in narrowed corridors.
What makes this regime particularly effective is its diffusion of responsibility. No single actor bears sole accountability. The correspondent bank cites regulatory compliance. The settler claims self-defense or biblical entitlement. The planning committee invokes zoning regulations. The soldier follows orders. Each decision is defensible within its own domain, justified by precedent or necessity or external pressure. Yet the pattern, invisible at the level of individual actions, becomes legible in aggregate. What appears as administrative friction, security imperative, or market risk reveals itself, over time, as organized constriction.
The experiential reality for those subjected to this regime is one of chronic adjustment. The merchant in Ramallah who once planned five years ahead now calculates in quarters, uncertain whether his bank will honor withdrawals or whether new restrictions will sever his supply chain. The shepherd in Masafer Yatta who once grazed across hillsides his family has worked for generations now confines his flock to valleys within sight of the village, his children learning caution before they learn confidence. The municipal planner in Bethlehem who once designed expansions now spends his time navigating permit rejections and negotiating demolition orders, his professional training reduced to crisis management. Time becomes reactive rather than projective. Planning extends only as far as the next permit.
This logic is not unique to the West Bank. Across disparate geographies, we encounter similar patterns: the scaling down of rights, the shrinking of public goods, the contraction of political possibility, the normalization of emergency as structure. In Gaza, the blockade has operated for nearly two decades as a laboratory of controlled diminishment, maintaining a population above the threshold of humanitarian catastrophe while preventing economic development or political autonomy. And with the destruction of Gaza, life is diminished into narrower space and managed calorie intakes.
Shock politics and bureaucratic attrition are not opposites; they are complementary tempos within a single order. Spectacle destabilizes perception, announcing transformation and rupture, while administrative measures quietly recalibrate what is livable. The Trump administration’s executive blitz—orders issued in rapid succession, policies reversed and reinstated, norms violated and defended in the same breath—generates disorientation. Attention scatters. What seemed outrageous yesterday becomes backdrop today. Meanwhile, the less visible work proceeds: regulations rewritten, courts reshaped, enforcement discretion expanded. The spectacular and the procedural collaborate, one exhausting the capacity for outrage, the other embedding constraint into institutional architecture.
What is being constructed, then, is not a temporary crisis but a durable condition. The banking blockage in the West Bank is not designed to be resolved, but managed. Settler violence is not an aberration to be corrected, but calibrated. Legal annexation is not a deviation from international norms, but part of it is the new normal.
The question is not whether these processes will intensify—they already are intensifying—but whether those subjected to them will recognize the pattern in time to interrupt it, whether global attention can be sustained in the absence of spectacular violence, whether solidarity can attach itself to the slow grind of compression as fiercely as it once responded to the sudden shock of massacre.
For now, the logic of compression proceeds with the confidence of a project that has calculated the limits of resistance. It bets that populations kept below the threshold of rupture will adapt rather than revolt, will exhaust themselves in navigation rather than organize for transformation.
Whether this wager holds depends not on the ingenuity of the mechanisms — those are already operational — but on the capacity of those subjected to it to refuse the terms, to find in the very condition of compression the grounds for collective refusal.

Germany’s Auterion and Ukraine’s Airlogix to Jointly Produce Autonomous Strike Drones

Auterion and Airlogix have established a joint German-Ukrainian venture to produce autonomous strike drones for Ukraine and NATO allies.
The companies announced this in a press release.
German company Auterion, a global leader in operating systems for autonomous drones, and Ukrainian defense technology company Airlogix announced at the Munich Security Conference the creation of a joint venture to produce AI-guided UAVs for Ukraine and allied countries.
Ukraine has already ordered thousands of German-made systems from the joint venture and confirmed its readiness for a long-term partnership with the German Ministry of Defense to supply autonomous strike drones to the Ukrainian Armed Forces.
According to the companies, this is one of the largest European commitments to produce drones for Ukraine to date. The systems also meet the requirements for the procurement of ammunition for the German armed forces.
Auterion Airlogix Joint Venture was established with the support of the German and Ukrainian governments as part of broader efforts to strengthen European defense industry cooperation and ensure the sustainable maintenance of Ukraine’s defense capabilities.
Production will take place in Germany, which should ensure the stability of supply chains and enable rapid ramp-up in line with operational requirements. The first deliveries are scheduled for 2026.
It should be recalled that in January 2026, during tests, Auterion demonstrated the operation of an autonomous swarm of drones. At a test site in the US, a single operator controlling a swarm of three FPV drones hit three different targets.
During the tests, a single operator simultaneously controlled three autonomous strike drones, which hit three separate targets using “strike core” warheads provided by Kraken Kinetics.
Auterion’s Skynode module and Nemyx control system allowed the operator to simply assign targets and authorize strikes, while the software autonomously performed navigation, swarm control, trajectory separation, and terminal guidance.
Nemyx enables multiple drones to act as a single coordinated unit, performing AI-controlled operations at high speed.
The demonstration was an early preview of the US Department of Defense’s Swarm Forge program, which aims to identify, test, and scale new ways of conducting combat operations using artificial intelligence capabilities.

Reported by
Three people identified by U.S. congressional leaders as “powerful” accomplices of infamous financier Jeffrey Epstein appear to be ordinary New York area residents who said they’ve never met or worked with Epstein or his network.
The three have spoken to OCCRP and partners. They live and or work in the New York City area, and were publicly identified earlier this week when the two congressional leaders who fought to make the Epstein files public went to see the unredacted files held at the U.S. Justice Department.
Speaking on the floor of the House of Representatives on Wednesday, Rep. Ro Khanna, a California Democrat, said Justice Department officials had improperly redacted names of six individuals. The officials, he said, “had acknowledged their mistake and now they have revealed the identity of these six powerful men.”
While two of the six men identified by Khanna and Kentucky Republican Rep. Thomas Massie were in fact powerful figures, they were already widely named in the documents and known to be associates of Epstein. One, Sultan Ahmed bin Sulayem, resigned abruptly on Friday as chairman of Dubai-based DP World, the global ports and logistics giant.
But several others men appear far from powerful and influential. Three of them identified by OCCRP and partners are a home improvement specialist, a systems engineer, and a mechanic, all without a record of serious crimes or involvement in major lawsuits.
“I watched a congressman’s speech where my surname and first name were mentioned. Although there are 10 people with my name and surname, someone posted a photo somewhere, and that makes it more complicated,” said Zurab Mikeladze, one of the men publicly named by Massie and Khanna, who has had his photograph widely disseminated online since the congressmen made their announcement.
“That photo was taken recently. The T-shirt is mine, the sweater is mine, it’s not Photoshopped or anything. But I don’t understand how that photo ended up there.”
An immigrant from the South Caucasus nation of Georgia, Mikeladze told OCCRP and its reporting partner, Georgian media outlet Monitori, that he had been a car mechanic in the U.S. for the past 27 years.
“Many things could be said about me except pedophilia,” he said, “I can’t imagine it.”
His name appears just once in New York court records, as a plaintiff in a minor insurance case in 2001.
A headshot of Mikeladze appears in the Epstein files as part of a largely redacted document. While confirming that he was depicted in the photograph, he said he had no idea who had taken it or how it ended up in the files,
“I’m looking into it. I’ve never heard anything like this about this person, Epstein. I’ve never met him. I just found out that they found him dead in prison,” Mikeladze said.
Another of the men, Leonid Leonov, appears in the same document, although the congressmen wrongly identified him as Leonic Leonov.
Reached by reporters, Leonov also expressed surprise and concern about being identified as a powerful person protected by redaction in the Epstein files. Leonov’s LinkedIn profile says he is an information technology professional, and he did not respond to follow-up requests for more information.
A third man identified by the congressmen, Salvatore Nuara, has an Instagram page showing he runs or ran a small home improvements business in Ozone Park, a working-class neighborhood in the borough of Queens. He too expressed surprise at being identified as a powerful person in the Epstein files.
The files contain several versions of the same document featuring the New York men, redacted to varying degrees. They were matched with their dates of birth in the documents, helping to mitigate the chance of mistaking them for someone with the same name.
OCCRP and partners reached out to Massie and Khanna, asking why these men were publicly named as “powerful” people protected by the Justice Department.
Massie’s office referred one of the collaborating reporters to a post he made earlier on the social media platform X, defending his identification of a fourth person, Nicola Caputo, who shares a name with a European politician. (That Nicola Caputa posted on X this week that he was aghast at having been associated with Epstein. “I categorically deny ever having had any type of contact with Mr. Epstein and or with his circle,” he wrote.)
“Inevitably, people who are not in the Epstein files will share names with people who are in the Epstein files,” Massie posted on February 12. “I have good reason to believe the Nicola Caputo in (file number) EFTA00077895 is NOT the same Nicola Caputo who served as a Member of European Parliament from Italy.”
His office did not respond to specific questions about the others identified.
Khanna’s office also did not respond to questions from OCCRP. Instead he referred reporters to a post on his social media account on X soon afterwards, defending the identification of the six men, which include the former owner of retailer Victoria’s Secret, Leslie Wexner, and Sultan Ahmed bin Sulayem, chairman of maritime and logistics giant DP World.
“The other men I mentioned should not have been redacted, and, while there is speculation, we do not know who they are or their background,” Khanna posted on Friday morning. “But there should be transparency, no redactions except to protect survivors.”
The release of a huge trove of some 3.5 million Epstein documents on January 30 came after years of civil lawsuits, a law passed by Congress, and campaign promises by President Donald J. Trump. But critics in Congress have seized on the large amount of redacted information in the files, while the Justice Department has defended the redactions as necessary to protect victims, or to avoid adversely affecting ongoing litigation.
Epstein was arrested in July 2019 by federal authorities on allegations that he had run a sex trafficking network. He died the following month in a New York jail awaiting trial in what a coroner’s report called suicide by hanging.

Saudi Arabia downscales flagship Red Sea giga-project
Saudi Arabia is scaling back plans to build 81 luxury resorts on the Red Sea by 2030, seven sources told AFP, as the kingdom rethinks the multi-billion-dollar mega-projects meant to reshape its oil-reliant economy.
Stubbornly low oil prices and patchy demand have forced a rethink of the flamboyant "giga-projects", centrepieces of Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman's Vision 2030 programme to diversify Saudi Arabia's economy.
Red Sea Global (RSG) denied plans to downsize, saying the project would continue after the initial phase of 27 resorts is completed this year.
But sources with knowledge of the plans said construction would halt at the end of 2026, costing dozens of jobs at RSG and hundreds at contracting firms.
The sources spoke on condition of anonymity due to the sensitivity of the matter.
"A decision was taken to stop work on Phase Two of the Red Sea projects," a senior RSG source told AFP.
"Current operating costs exceed revenues in a way that has become unsustainable," another source at the company added.
Seven sources at RSG, other giga-projects and related companies and consultancies said the Red Sea construction would be put on pause.
However, RSG insisted that it was pressing on with phase two of construction, including on the residential development of Laheq Island.
"As with any large-scale, long-term destination, Phase Two is being delivered through a sequenced approach," RSG said in a statement to AFP.
"Several projects are currently in design development, approvals, and commercial structuring, which is exactly where they should be at this stage."
The multi-billion multi-task
Government officials acknowledge a pullback in the sprawling giga-projects after Saudi Arabia also took on board the large-scale infrastructure commitments of Expo 2030 in Riyadh and the 2034 World Cup.
"Some (giga-projects) will be scaled down. Some will be delayed," Finance Minister Mohammed al-Jadaan told AFP last month in Davos.
Low oil prices are also impacting Saudi budgets. Profits have fallen for 11 straight quarters at Saudi Aramco, the world's top oil exporter and the country's main earner.
"The consensus is that it's impossible to work on all these projects at the same time," a source at a company backed by the country's wealth fund told AFP.
"It was believed that the Red Sea project would attract more capital and generate huge returns, and that it would eventually become financially sustainable," another source working with a government project added.
"But this never happened."
The Red Sea developments include Amaala, envisaged to stretch along 68 kilometres (42 miles) of coast and cover 4,155 square kilometres (2,582 square miles), with 30 resorts and a yacht club all powered by renewable energy.
Further south, the Red Sea Project has an international airport and plans for 50 resorts, some of them on three islands.
Just north of the two sites lies another giga-project: Neom, the futuristic new city whose ambitious design is reported to have hit major problems.
The downscaling could deal a blow to Saudi hopes of transforming its Red Sea coast into a top destination for wealthy tourists, competing with the likes of the Maldives.
'Mostly sitting empty'
RSG sources said dozens of staff will lose their jobs when work stops at year's end. Dozens more are being transferred to the Diriyah and Qiddiya giga-projects in Riyadh, according to sources at those projects.
A senior employee at a project management company affiliated with the Public Investment Fund, which backs the giga-projects, said the Saudi sovereign wealth fund is "re-evaluating the whole Red Sea project".
"No more construction is approved. They are holding work on Phase Two and treating Phase One as 'proof of concept'," the source said.
RSG did not reveal occupancy rates at the 10 resorts completed so far. However, one consultant said they were "mostly sitting empty".
"The lack of alcohol played a role, but it wasn't the main factor," the consultant said.
"High pricing and the enormous scale of the projects was a problem. They massively overestimated how many people would pay these prices."
Problems have been seen with other giga-projects. In Riyadh, work has halted on Mukaab, a cuboid skyscraper 400 metres (1,300 feet) high and wide, an architect on the project told AFP.
"From the very start, this project was unrealistic. It was just a fantasy," he said.
Neom has also pulled out of hosting the 2029 Asian Winter Games at Trojena, its under-construction ski resort, after reported problems in building it.
However, RSG said it was in "strong operational and commercial shape". The company hired more than 3,000 people in 2025, including over 900 in the last four months of the year, it said.

Trump tells troops 'fear' is powerful motivator in difficult Iran talks
Sign up now: Get ST's newsletters delivered to your inbox
FORT BRAGG, North Carolina, Feb 13 - President Donald Trump told U.S. troops on Friday that Iran has been “difficult” in nuclear negotiations and suggested that instilling fear in Tehran may be necessary to resolve the standoff peacefully.
"They've been difficult to make a deal," Trump said of the Iranians before an audience of active-duty soldiers at Fort Bragg Army base in North Carolina after U.S. officials said they were sending a second aircraft carrier to the Middle East.
"Sometimes you have to have fear. That's the only thing that really will get the situation taken care of."
During his address Trump also referenced the U.S. bombing of Iran's nuclear sites last June.
Earlier, he said the deployment of the world's largest aircraft carrier was being made so "we'll have it ready" should negotiations with Iran fail.
Oman facilitated talks between Iran and the U.S. last week, which a spokesperson for Iran's foreign ministry said had allowed Tehran to gauge Washington's seriousness and showed enough consensus for diplomacy to continue. The date and venue of the next round of U.S.-Iran talks have yet to be announced.
The president traveled to Fort Bragg to meet special forces troops involved in the audacious January 3 operation to seize Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro.
Maduro, who faces narco-terrorism and drug trafficking charges in U.S. court, denies wrongdoing and maintains he is the rightful leader of Venezuela. In the weeks since the Venezuelan leader's capture, Trump has worked with Maduro's interim successor Delcy Rodriguez and sought broad control over the country's oil industry.
Fort Bragg is home to some 50,000 active-duty soldiers. It also sits in one of the country's more competitive political states.
North Carolina is expected to host closely fought races for both the Senate and House of Representatives in November's congressional election. The state will be one of the biggest prizes in the 2028 presidential election.
During the visit, Trump broke with presidential norms and delivered an openly political speech to the troops, blasting his political opponents and warning that Democrats would undermine the military if they won control of Congress in the elections.
Trump's public approval ratings have slid since his January 2025 inauguration, with voters mainly concerned about the high cost of living. Aides have said the president will eventually travel weekly to competitive states to speak with voters. REUTERS

ICE to spend $38bn turning warehouses into detention centers, documents show

US Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) expects to spend an estimated $38.3bn on a plan to acquire warehouses across the country and retrofit them into new immigration detention centers with capacity for tens of thousands of detainees, according to documents the agency sent to the governor of New Hampshire.
The documents, published on the state’s website on Thursday, disclose that the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) estimates it will spend $158m retrofitting a new detention facility in Merrimack, New Hampshire, and an additional estimated $146m to operate the facility in the first three years.
According to an overview of the plans, which were first reported by the Washington Post, Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) would buy and convert 16 buildings across the US into regional processing centers, each holding between 1,000 and 1,500 people at a time. Another eight large-scale detention centers would hold 7,000 to 10,000 people at a time and serve as “the primary locations” for deportations. Detainees would spend an average of three to seven days at the processing sites before being transported to the larger facilities, where they would be held about 60 days before being deported.
The new model for increasing detention space is needed, according to the document, due to a surge in ICE hires and an anticipated rise in arrests. The number of people in ICE detention has hit records in the second Trump administration.
These facilities will “ensure the safe and humane civil detention of aliens in ICE custody, while helping ICE effectuate mass deportations”, the documents said. The effort will rely on the billions of dollars appropriated by Congress in the One Big Beautiful Bill Act to “fully implement a new detention model by the end of Fiscal Year 2026”, according to the documents.
Together, the records provide the clearest view so far of the Trump administration’s strategy to reshape immigrant detention by converting buildings initially built for industrial use – a broad undertaking intended to strengthen ICE’s capacity to apprehend more immigrants and remove them more quickly.
Instead of transferring detainees around the country based on open bed space, the redesigned system would channel individuals into a network of large centralized facilities where they would remain until deportation, according to ICE’s planning documents.
There appear to be conflicting statements about when the economic impact analysis for the proposed Merrimack facility was delivered to New Hampshire’s governor, Kelly Ayotte.
Ayotte, a Republican, said in a press release that DHS provided the documents to her office for the first time on Thursday. Her remarks seemed to conflict with testimony from Todd Lyons, ICE’s acting director, who told a Senate hearing earlier that same day that DHS representatives had already discussed the project with the governor and supplied “an economic impact summary” to her.
The Massachusetts governor, Maura Healey, issued a statement opposing the creation of an ICE agency detention center in Merrimack, calling it “outrageous and absolutely the wrong move”.
“ICE is shooting people dead on the street. Mothers have been ripped from cars and separated from children,” the statement said. “US Citizens have been stopped, detained and even killed. Peaceful protesters have been assaulted. Parents are afraid to send kids to school, to go to church, to seek healthcare and report crimes. None of this makes people safer – it makes us all less safe.”
It continued: “We should be opposing ICE’s tactics, not allowing them to expand. We certainly should not be allowing ICE to build new human warehouses when they can’t be trusted to keep people safe and protect due process.”

‘That’s not a knife’: Australian scramjet to launch in US this month

‘That’s not a knife’: Australian scramjet to launch in US this month
A Brisbane-based hypersonics start-up is preparing to go suborbital, with a launch window later this month to test its scramjet technology over the Atlantic Ocean.
Hypersonix Launch Systems, with its origins in the University of Queensland’s Centre for Hypersonics, has designed an engine with no moving parts capable of propelling a vehicle up to 12 times the speed of sound.
The company will face its moment of truth late this month in the United States, when its Dart AE is launched 50 kilometres into the atmosphere from NASA’s Wallops Flight Facility in Virginia, about 175 kilometres south-east of Washington, DC.
From there, it will demonstrate its potential to the United States’ Defence Innovation Unit, which selected the Queensland-based company from a field of more than 60 for the program.
If successful, the NASA-backed test flight would mark the world’s first sustained hypersonic flight using green hydrogen. Along with the defence and travel applications, the technology could also be used as part of staged payload deliveries to Earth’s orbit.
But getting the 3.5-metre Dart AE to the launch site proved more challenging than Dr Michael Smart, the co-founder of Hypersonix, had anticipated.
“We shipped the vehicle and all its equipment over here to the US, and then it got caught in that snowstorm that was here two weeks ago,” he said.
“It sat at an airport on the west coast at some sort of import-export place for a week – we couldn’t get it on a flight, so we had to truck it across the States.”
The exact timing of the launch would not be known until about 24 hours beforehand, allowing for weather, but it was expected to lift off in late February.
And once it is launched, Smart and his crew will never see this particular Dart AE again.
“It is just a sacrificial lamb,” he said.
“It’s too small to have a parachute or a or landing gear. Our next vehicles, which are more than twice as big, they’ll be able to land on a runway and be reusable.”
While the vehicle was destined for the bottom of the Atlantic Ocean, the test flight would help inform the further development of the technology.
And the mission and launch names contain a touch of home. The mission will be known as “Cassowary Vex”, while the launch will be “That’s Not a Knife”.
“It really appealed to the Americans, actually,” Smart said.
“When they think of Australia, they still think of Paul Hogan and Crocodile Dundee, so that was a bit of fun.”
A hypersonic arms race has broken out among military powers, with Russia deploying such weapons in its years-long war with Ukraine in 2024.
But while the scramjet’s military applications were clear, civil aviation would also reap the long-term benefits – with two-hour flights between Australia’s east coast and London a real possibility.

MUNICH, February 13. /TASS/. French President Emmanuel Macron announced his decision to establish a direct channel of communication with Russia.
Speaking at the Munich Security Conference, the French leader emphasized the importance of ensuring that there is "no peace without the Europeans." "It is for the same reason that I have decided to establish a direct channel of communication with Russia, in full transparency with Ukraine, our European partners, and our American allies," the French leader said.
According to him, Europe "will be part of the solution, and we should be part of the discussion." "And we have our own European interests to defend in this, especially when it comes to the future of strategic stability on our continent," he said.
Macron added that he intends to start discussions with France's partners about the future architecture of European security.
The French president also called on Western partners to increase pressure on the Russian economy. "We are preparing a 20th sanctions package in the EU, focusing on energy and financial services actors, and we should continue to hit harder the Russian ‘shadow fleet’," the president said.
Earlier, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov noted that if Macron is ready to talk, Russian President Vladimir Putin has repeatedly emphasized that he is always open to contact.

Trump claims Russia wants peace deal, urges Zelenskyy to “move”
As reported by an Ukrinform correspondent, Trump made the remarks on the grounds of the White House before departing for North Carolina.
Asked by a reporter about progress in peace negotiations, Trump said that the Ukrainian leader needs to “move” in order not to miss the chance to conclude a peace agreement.
“Russia wants to make a deal, and Zelensky is going to have to get moving. Otherwise, he is going to miss a great opportunity. He has to move,” Trump stressed.
As previously reported by Ukrinform, during recent meetings in Abu Dhabi, the U.S. side pushed for an accelerated timeline for reaching peace agreements between Ukraine and Russia and also discussed the possibility of holding a nationwide referendum in Ukraine in the coming months.

Top Hungarian diplomat calls on EU to stop hindering peace efforts in Ukraine

BUDAPEST, February 13. /TASS/. Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto has called on the European Union to stop hindering peaceful settlement efforts in Ukraine and do everything it can to end the conflict.
"Regrettably, I have to inform every day about Hungarian casualties in Transcarpathia. It’s time to end this war," he said in a televised address following the death of another ethnic Hungarian in Ukraine.
"Brussels must ultimately stop its actions to create minefields on the path of America’s peace efforts," he stressed.
According to the top Hungarian diplomat, by now nearly a hundred Transcarpathian Hungarians, who had dual Ukrainian and Hungarian citizenship, have been killed as a result of the conflict. The Hungarian government provides their families with material support.
He recalled that deaths of Hungarians have been reported in Transcarpathia for the second day in a row. He did not disclose the circumstances of these deaths, saying only that these were men aged from 36 and 45.
In late January, he reported the death of an ethnic Hungarian in Transcarpathia who had been caught by local authorities to be forcibly sent to the frontline. In July 2025, a Hungarian reportedly died in a hospital after being beaten at a recruitment office.
Hungary imposed sanctions on three Ukrainian military commanders responsible for human rights violations during the forced mobilization campaign and officially called on the EU to do the same. Budapest pointed out to Brussels that evidence of the Ukrainian authorities’ brutal forced conscription was available in Council of Europe Commissioner for Human Rights Michael O'Flaherty’s 2025 report on the situation in Ukraine.

New Jersey man found guilty of killing brother and his family, then lighting fires to cover it up

New Jersey man found guilty of killing brother and his family, then lighting fires to cover it up
A New Jersey man has been convicted on all counts in the deaths of four relatives
- Bookmark
A New Jersey man was convicted Friday of killing four relatives in what prosecutors said was a murder and arson plot spawned by a soured business relationship between the man and his younger brother.
Paul Caneiro, 59, was found guilty on four counts of murder, two counts of aggravated arson, and two weapons counts in the 2018 killing of his brother, Keith Caneiro, 50; Keith’s wife, Jennifer, 45, and their two young children. A Monmouth County jury handed down the verdict after deliberating Friday for about five hours.
Caneiro now faces a potential life term when he's sentenced May 12.
Monmouth County prosecutors said during the two-month trial that Caneiro killed the relatives because his brother had discovered he was stealing money from their businesses and from him personally. He then set their mansion on fire — and also his own home in an attempt to cover it up, authorities said.
Caneiro’s attorney had told jurors he did not murder anyone, saying the brothers — who owned a computer systems company and a pest control business — “deeply loved each other and were best friends” and that his client would not harm his nephew and niece who he “cherished and adored."
Emergency crews had responded to fires reported at both brothers' homes on Nov. 20, 2018.
Paul Caneiro’s wife and children escaped safely from their home in Ocean Township.
But Keith Caneiro was found dead outside his burning Colts Neck mansion, shot numerous times. His wife and kids were found inside — Jennifer Caneiro had been stabbed and shot, while 11-year-old Jesse and 8-year-old Sophia were both stabbed.
Prosecutors told jurors that Paul Caneiro had sneaked up on his brother's family while they slept in the middle of the night, then set both fires to make it appear the entire family was being targeted, the Asbury Park Press and NJ.com reported.
Monika Mastellone, Caneiro's attorney, told jurors that authorities developed tunnel vision around her client and "did not investigate any other suspects, even obvious ones.” She noted that authorities didn’t investigate a third Caneiro brother or take a sample of his DNA, even though he would have benefited financially from Keith Caneiro’s death as well.
The third Caneiro brother has denied any involvement in the deaths, and prosecutors noted in their closing that Paul Caneiro was the only one Keith Caneiro called the day before he and his family were killed, demanding information about his life insurance trust account.
During her closing argument, Mastellone also floated the idea that two people reportedly seen at Keith Caneiro’s home shortly before police and emergency responders arrived may have been involved. Prosecutors dismissed that suggestion, saying the two men were first responders and that neighbors were wrong about the time they were spotted at the residence.
Paul Caneiro's trial had been delayed several times, first by the coronavirus pandemic and then by legal wrangling in recent years over what evidence could be presented in court, including arguments before the state Supreme Court.

Two Britons among three dead after avalanche in French Alps

Two Britons are among three skiers to have been killed in an avalanche in the French Alps.
The pair were part of a group of five people, accompanied by an instructor, off-piste skiing in Val d’Isère, in south-east France. A French national, who was skiing alone, was also killed.
Albertville prosecutor Benoît Bachelet said the ski instructor, who avoided injury, tested negative after taking blood and drug tests. He added that another British person had sustained minor injuries.
A manslaughter investigation was launched by the Albertville public prosecutor’s office and will be carried out by CRS Alpes mountain rescue police.
France’s national weather service had issued a red alert for avalanche risk for the area on Thursday.
In the Italian Alps, avalanches recently claimed the lives of 11 people in the space of seven days as a result of exceptionally unstable snow conditions.
Those killed included a 70-year-old hiker, who was found dead last Sunday in the Veneto region of the country, which is hosting the Milano Cortina Winter Olympics.
Italy’s rescue service said the risk of avalanches was present across most of the Alpine range from west to east.
With fresh snow accumulating on older and unstable layers, even the movement of a single skier can trigger an avalanche, the rescue service said in a statement to Reuters.

Europe must learn to become a geopolitical power — Macron

Europe must turn its focus to long-term strategic thinking, including creating deep-strike capabilities and assessing how France's nuclear deterrent can fit into the bloc's future security architecture, France's president has said.
Speaking at the Munich Security Conference on Friday, President Emmanuel Macron dismissed accusations that Europe was decaying and defended its push to tackle disinformation and the excesses of social media that were harming Western countries.
"This is the right time for audacity. This is the right time for a strong Europe," Macron said. "Europe has to learn to become a geopolitical power. It was not part of our DNA."
In an apparent swipe at the US trade and foreign policy towards Europe, Macron said that Europeans must show the world “our unwavering commitment to defend our own interests.”
“It starts, of course, with continuing to extend our support to Ukraine, but it could nicely follow with fanning off unjustified tariffs and politely declining unjustified claims on European territory. This is what we did and this is what we will [continue to] do,” he added.
“Reshuffle and reorganise”
The French President added that Europeans must start this work with their own thinking and their own interests.
“So my proposal today is to launch a series of consultations on this important issue, which we have started to flesh out with our British and German colleagues, but in the broader European consultation with all the colleagues here, with a lot of capacities, a lot of strategic thinking," he said.
Macron, who is scheduled to deliver a speech later this month on how he sees the role of France's nuclear deterrent within Europe, said he had started those consultations.
"We have to reshuffle and reorganise our architecture of security in Europe. Because the past architecture of security was totally designed and framed during Cold War times. So it's no longer adapted," he said.
"We have to rearticulate nuclear deterrence in this approach," he said.

French police shot a knife-wielding man under the Arc de Triomphe on Friday, February 13, after he allegedly threatened officers carrying out a ceremonial duty at the famed Paris landmark, according to several sources.
France's national anti-terrorism prosecutor's office announced it has taken charge of the case and opened an investigation.
The suspect was hospitalized after being shot several times by police as he threatened officers during the ceremony to rekindle the flame at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier, a police source told Agence France-Presse.
The man, who is registered as a resident of the northern Paris suburb of Seine-Saint-Denis, was known to authorities, said a source close to the case, who spoke on the condition of anonymity.
One of the officers on honor guard duty sustained slight injuries from a knife blow before another officer opened fire on the attacker, according to the gendarmerie police force.

And those images — from the suspect’s gloves to his flashlight — could be what’s needed to break the case.
“There’s a tremendous amount of information that this guy left,” said former FBI profiler Clint Van Zandt.
The FBI already has analyzed the videos from Guthrie’s doorbell camera to identify the suspect’s backpack, posting an alert on Thursday with a photo of the brand and model in hopes of narrowing down tips flooding the agency.
It has been nearly two weeks since the mother of “Today” show host Savannah Guthrie was believed to have been abducted.
Former criminal investigators say it’s almost certain that authorities are building a physical and psychological profile of the suspect, using the footage released publicly on Tuesday that totals less than a minute.
Whether authorities recovered more footage isn’t known, but technology will allow them to see more than meets the eye.
“Every single thing that is in the video is being digitally enhanced. Everything from the mask to backpack to the jacket,” said Ed Davis, the former Boston police commissioner during the marathon bombing and manhunt in 2013.
Here’s what was captured in the footage and what clues each might yield:
The backpack
It probably didn’t take long to pinpoint the type of backpack the suspect was wearing, Davis said.
Technology available today allows investigators to break down photos and videos to the pixel, he said, giving them images of the stitching and maybe the manufacturer or brand name.
The FBI described the backpack as a black, 25-liter “Ozark Trail Hiker Pack.”
The holster
The FBI says the man on Nancy Guthrie’s porch was armed.
But the video shows he had an unusual holster setup, hanging over the middle of his waist and not on the side. It might be an indication that whoever it was has little experience with firearms.
“I’ve never seen anything like that,” Davis said.
The gloves
The footage gives a close-up view of the suspect trying to cover Guthrie’s doorbell camera, first with a gloved hand and then with part of a plant ripped from the yard.
The black gloves appear to be thicker than most and shimmered in the light.
“I spend a lot of time in Home Depot, and I’ve never seen those gloves,” Davis said. “They’re not very common.”
The clothes
The suspect’s zip-up jacket, pants, shoes and mask don’t immediately stand out. But identifying one or more of those items could be a key.
Because once that happens, investigators can start looking at where those items are sold and combing through receipts and store surveillance cameras, starting with stores in the Tucson area closest to Guthrie’s home, said Van Zandt, who spent 25 years with the FBI.
Going through mounds of receipts and footage will take time and isn’t something that would be done on most cases, but there’s no shortage of people assigned to this one, he said. The Pima County Sheriff’s Department earlier this week said several hundred detective and agents have been assigned to the case.
“If all of the stars line up properly — and they rarely do — I find someone who was in there two weeks prior who bought the jacket, the shoes, the backpack all at the same time,” Van Zandt said.
The flashlight
In one of the videos, the suspect appeared to be holding a small flashlight in his mouth while in front of Guthrie’s door.
Figuring out the type of flashlight might be difficult, but there’s something else to look at there, said David Lyons, a former homicide detective and police commander in Lexington, Kentucky.
Not many people instinctively hold a flashlight in their mouth, but those who work in the trades might — such as an electrician or a plumber, he said.
“That’s a small thing,” he said. “But at the same time, down the road, it could be something.”
The movements
Every step and movement the suspect made on the porch is worth a close look — from the way he walked, to how he seemed unhurried and how he grabbed the plant from the yard, Lyons said.
All of that will likely be used by behavioral analysts to create a profile of the suspect, he said.
“That’s what this will come down to,” Lyons said. “Those small aspects added all together.”

Gifts and soup from ‘Uncle Jeffrey“: The Epstein ties that ended Kathy Ruemmler’s run at Goldman

Gifts and soup from ‘Uncle Jeffrey': The Epstein ties that ended Kathy Ruemmler’s run at Goldman
Gifts and soup from ‘Uncle Jeffrey': The Epstein ties that ended Kathy Ruemmler’s run at Goldman
NEW YORK (AP) — Goldman Sachs general counsel Kathy Ruemmler has had a storied legal career. As a federal prosecutor, she helped successfully prosecute Enron executives including Ken Lay and Jeffrey Skilling. She was part of President Barack Obama’s administration, working in various roles for much of his two terms in office, including as White House Counsel.
She was even briefly considered by President Obama as a candidate for attorney general.
On Thursday, Ruemmler, 54, announced that she plans to resign from the top legal post at Goldman after a trove of emails and correspondence between her and disgraced financier Jeffrey Epstein showed the two individuals were especially close, years after Epstein’s 2008 conviction on sex crimes charges, when he became a registered sex offender.
Ruemmler previously downplayed her relationship with Epstein. She called him a “monster” and said she regretted ever knowing him. Ruemmler has repeatedly described their relationship as professional, citing her job as a private defense attorney before she ever joined Goldman Sachs.
But documents released in recent weeks and reviewed by The Associated Press depict a deeper relationship than had previously been characterized by Ruemmler and Goldman Sachs. These included intimate email exchanges, social plans and gifts that went beyond formal legal work.
Roughly 8,400 documents involved Ruemmler or referenced her. Some correspondence shows that Ruemmler was aware of the extent of the allegations that Epstein had faced involving underage girls in Florida. In some instances, she advised Epstein on how he might go about trying to repair his image and defend himself publicly against new claims of misconduct.
The gifts Epstein gave to Ruemmler have been documented in news reports: the spa treatments, the handbags from Hermes, an Apple Watch, a Fendi coat, among many others. But some of the interactions between Epstein and Ruemmler described throughout their correspondence indicates that Epstein and Ruemmler did not simply have a lawyer-client transactional relationship, as Ruemmler previously attested to.
“It makes him happy to see you happy,” Epstein’s assistant wrote to Ruemmler in 2016, after Epstein prepaid for a spa treatment for her.
In October 2018, Epstein directed one of his assistants to send flowers and chicken soup to Ruemmler because she has “not been feeling well.” It would not be the first time that Epstein would send her a small token of appreciation when she was sick. They talked about dating issues, made jokes about both the wealthy and everyday people, and shared laments about their careers and dating lives.
They would message each other about mundane things like their mutual distaste for seeing babies in business class on flights and would repeatedly plan to have dinner or drinks in various places. Epstein even had Ruemmler as a backup executor of his will at one point.
Setting aside the immense wealth and privilege and Epstein’s legal troubles, many of the emails between the two would look no different from the banter that many Americans would share to in their own text messages, emails or group chats.
“Well, I adore him. It’s like having another older brother!” she wrote in an email in 2015.
During her time in private practice after she left the White House in 2014, Ruemmler received several expensive gifts from Epstein, including luxury handbags and a fur coat. The gifts were given after Epstein had already been convicted of sex crimes in 2008 and was registered as a sex offender. Ruemmler was also involved in Epstein’s legal defense efforts after he was arrested a second time for sex crimes in 2019 and later killed himself in a Manhattan jail.
“So lovely and thoughtful! Thank you to Uncle Jeffrey!!!” Ruemmler wrote to Epstein in 2018.
She later joined Goldman Sachs in 2020 and became the investment bank’s top lawyer in 2021.
The firm’s leadership backed her publicly amid the revelations. But the embarrassing emails raised questions about Ruemmler’s judgment. Historically, Wall Street frowns on gift-giving between clients and bankers or Wall Street lawyers, particularly high-end gifts that could pose a conflict of interest. Goldman Sachs requires its employees to get pre-approval before receiving gifts from or giving them to clients, according to the company’s code of conduct, partly in order to not run afoul of anti-bribery laws.
Bloomberg News, The Wall Street Journal and other media outlets reported that Goldman’s partners, who are the firm’s most senior and well-regarded members going back to when the investment bank was privately held, had begun to question why the firm was holding Ruemmler in such high regard when other lawyers were just as qualified to hold the top legal job.
In her statement Thursday, Ruemmler said: “Since I joined Goldman Sachs six years ago, it has been my privilege to help oversee the firm’s legal, reputational, and regulatory matters; to enhance our strong risk management processes; and to ensure that we live by our core value of integrity in everything we do. My responsibility is to put Goldman Sachs’ interests first.”
Goldman CEO David Solomon he respected Ruemmler’s decision to resign. The firm isn’t rushing Ruemmler out the door, saying in a statement that she would wind down her work at the bank “to ensure a smooth transition,” before her last day on June 30.

Iran’s military degraded by 12-day war with Israel, but still has significant capabilities

Iran’s military degraded by 12-day war with Israel, but still has significant capabilities
Despite its losses to Israel and US, Tehran retains missiles, manpower and regional reach
BANGKOK (AP) — With one American carrier strike group already in the Middle East and another apparently on its way as US President Donald Trump ramps up pressure on Iran to give up its nuclear program, fears are rising of the outbreak of another war that could spread into a regional conflict.
The 12-day Israel-Iran war last year appeared to cripple key elements of Iran’s military, yet left its capabilities far from neutralized — a distinction that looms large as tensions rise again.
If hostilities erupt again, the risk of a broader protracted conflict returns, especially if Iran’s leadership sees the fight as one for its existence.
Open skies
The June 13-24 war started when Israel launched strikes targeting Iran’s nuclear program and top military officials, saying it was responding to an existential threat posed by the nuclear program as well as Iran’s massive ballistic missile array. The United States joined the conflict, hitting three nuclear sites with massive “bunker-buster” bombs dropped from B-2 stealth bombers that flew their mission from their home base in Missouri.
It was a risky move for Trump, who has criticized his predecessors for involving the US in “stupid wars,” but Iran responded weakly to the US attack, with a limited missile attack on an American military base in Qatar that it warned Washington of in advance, and which caused no casualties. Tehran and Israel then both agreed to a ceasefire.
Israel was able to significantly degrade Iran’s air defenses with airstrikes and covert attacks from teams on the ground. Iran, presumably aware that its older F-14 and MiG-29 fighters were no match for the fifth-generation American F-35 stealth fighters and other aircraft flown by Israel, also never sent its air force into action.
That left the skies clear for Israel to carry out waves of attacks, and for the US to hit Iran’s nuclear facilities and get out of Iranian airspace without the B-2 bombers ever being fired upon.
If hostilities resume, that scenario is likely to repeat, said Sascha Bruchmann, a defense analyst with the International Institute for Strategic Studies in Bahrain.
“In practical terms, in reductionist terms, the sky is open for American and Israeli planes,” he said. “The problem is how to defend the region from the retaliation.”
Bruchmann said in the case of an expanded war, Iran would most likely hit back by targeting US bases in the region, but could also attack oil infrastructure and mine the Strait of Hormuz, which links the Persian Gulf to the Gulf of Oman, through which about a fifth of the world’s oil is transported.
They could also attempt to hit the American aircraft carriers, though they’re well defended by the destroyers in their strike groups, Bruchmann said.
“If the regime itself believes its survival is at stake, which it did not believe in June last year, I think the game is different,” he said. “If you have a … regime that thinks it’s about to go down, then why would you hold back with retaliation?”
Iran’s missile cupboard
Iran fired hundreds of missiles during the 12-day war and used more than 1,000 attack drones, killing nearly three dozen Israeli civilians and wounding thousands.
Danny Citrinowicz, a researcher at Israel’s Institute for National Security Studies and a former Iran specialist in Israel’s military and intelligence services, said that it remains unclear how much missile capacity Iran has rebuilt.
“You can see through satellite imagery, attempts to restart manufacturing,” he said, adding that government leaks in Israeli media suggest that Israel assumes Iran still retains a substantial number of short-range ballistic missiles.
Israeli strikes last year focused on what officials saw as the most immediate threats — Iran’s medium- and long-range missiles — leaving Tehran with a reduced but far from eliminated ability to threaten Israel. Its ability to hit nearby US bases with short-range missiles seems barely diminished.
“The short-range ballistic missiles did not suffer any significant hit whatsoever in the 12-day war,” Citrinowicz said.
Iran’s exact capabilities aren’t known, but it’s thought to still have more than 1,000 long-range missiles that could hit Israel, and several thousand of the shorter-range missiles that could be used to hit American bases or other targets nearby, Bruchmann said.
Missile stockpiles matter only if a country retains the systems to launch them. Israel also took out many of Iran’s launchers, but wasn’t able to destroy them completely, and it seems likely that Iran will have been working hard to rebuild that capacity.
Very different stakes
Iran’s military vastly outnumbers that of Israel, with about 600,000 regular troops and 200,000 in the paramilitary Revolutionary Guard, including the elite Quds Force.
Despite this, the Israeli Defense Forces is considered a superior army. Israel has around 170,000 members of active duty forces and another 400,000 reserves. But even though the military is smaller, it has been battle-hardened by regional conflicts and possesses the latest US and European equipment as well as a robust domestic defense industry.
It also has the support of the US, both with its naval assets and multiple bases in the Middle East, including Al Udeid Air Base in Qatar, which hosts thousands of American troops and is the forward headquarters for US Central Command.
In the past, Iran has also relied on proxy forces. Those include Hamas, Hezbollah and the Houthi rebels in Yemen. But each has been so degraded by recent fighting that it’s an open question whether they would be able — or willing — to come to Iran’s assistance from Gaza, Lebanon or Yemen.
A bigger threat might come from Iran-linked militias in Iraq, which could threaten US forces on the ground there.
But beyond comparing numbers and capabilities, Bruchmann said that when thinking about a possible all-out conflict, one has to look at what the sides are willing to risk.
“My assumption is that Americans are trying to plan for zero casualties,” he said. “We’re talking regime survival versus a zero casualty intervention — so just phenomenally different stakes.”
If so, we have a request.
Every day during the past two years of war and rising global anti-Zionism and antisemitism, our journalists kept you abreast of the most important developments that merit your attention. Millions of people rely on ToI for fact-based coverage of Israel and the Jewish world.

Gifts and soup from 'Uncle Jeffrey': The Epstein ties that ended Kathy Ruemmler’s run at Goldman
Kathy Ruemmler's resignation as Goldman Sachs’ top lawyer comes after emails show she stayed close with Jeffrey Epstein long after his conviction on sex crimes

The return of millions of Afghans from Pakistan and Iran pushes Afghanistan to the brink, UN warns
The U.N. refugee agency says the return of millions of Afghans from neighboring Pakistan and Iran is pushing Afghanistan to the brink
- Bookmark
The return of millions of Afghans from neighboring Pakistan and Iran is pushing Afghanistan to the brink, the U.N. refugee agency said on Friday, describing an unprecedented scale of returns.
A total of 5.4 million people have returned to Afghanistan since October 2023, mostly from the two neighboring countries, UNHCR’s Afghanistan representative Arafat Jamal said, speaking to a U.N. briefing in Geneva via video link from Kabul, the Afghan capital.
“This is massive, and the speed and scale of these returns has pushed Afghanistan nearly to the brink,” Jamal said.
Pakistan launched a sweeping crackdown in Oct. 2023 to expel migrants without documents, urging those in the country to leave of their own accord to avoid arrest and forcible deportation and forcibly expelling others. Iran also began a crackdown on migrants at around the same time.
Since then, millions have streamed across the border into Afghanistan, including people who were born in Pakistan decades ago and had built lives and created businesses there.
Last year alone, 2.9 million people returned to Afghanistan, Jamal said, noting it was “the largest number of returns that we have witnessed to any single country.”
Afghanistan’s Taliban rulers have criticized the mass expulsions.
Afghanistan was already struggling with a dire humanitarian situation and a poor human rights record, particularly relating to women and girls, and the massive influx of people amounting to 12% of the population has put the country under severe strain, Jamal said.
Already in just the month and a half since the start of this year, about 150,000 people had returned to Afghanistan, he added.
Afghan authorities provide care packages for those returning that include some food aid, cash, a telephone SIM card and transportation to parts of the country where they might have family. But the returns have strained resources in a country that was already struggling to cope with a weak economy and the effects of a severe drought and two devastating earthquakes.
In November, the U.N. development program said nine out of 10 families in areas of Afghanistan with high rates of return were resorting to what are known as negative coping mechanisms — either skipping meals, falling into debt or selling their belongings to survive.
“We are deeply concerned about the sustainability of these returns,” Jamal said, noting that while 5% of those who return say they will leave Afghanistan again, more than 10% say they know of someone who has already left.
“These decisions, I would underscore, to undertake dangerous journeys, are not driven by a lack of a desire to remain in the country, on the contrary, but the reality that many are unable to rebuild their viable and dignified lives,” he said.

US lawmakers ask Mandelson to testify to Congress over Epstein relationship

Peter Mandelson has been asked to testify to the US Congress over his relationship with the convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.
Robert Garcia, ranking member of the committee on oversight and government reform, and congressman Suhas Subramanyam have written to Mandelson requesting he be questioned as part of the investigation into Epstein.
The letter said: “While you no longer serve as British ambassador to the United States and have stepped down from the House of Lords, it is clear that you possessed extensive social and business ties to Jeffrey Epstein and hold critical information pertaining to our investigation of Epstein’s operations.
“Given the appalling allegations regarding Epstein’s conduct, we request that you make yourself available for a transcribed interview with Committee staff regarding the crimes of Jeffrey Epstein and his co-conspirators.”
In the letter, the members point out instances where Mandelson was photographed or mentioned in the 3.5m Epstein files released in the past fortnight.
The former UK ambassador to the US has been given until the end of the month to respond.
Mandelson is also being investigated by the Metropolitan police for alleged misconduct in a public office after allegations that he passed market-sensitive information to Epstein when he was business secretary in Gordon Brown’s government in 2009.
Officers have searched two properties connected to the former member of the House of Lords as part of its investigation. Mandelson has denied any criminal wrongdoing.
Garcia and Subramanyam made a similar request to Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor to testify last year. Andrew has consistently denied any wrongdoing.
The former prince failed to respond to an interview request from the committee in November, prompting Keir Starmer to say those with “relevant information” should share it.
Mandelson resigned from the House of Lords and relinquished his membership of the Labour party earlier this month over his links to the late convicted child sex offender Epstein.
The former cabinet minister was sacked as US ambassador in September because of his past connections to the disgraced financier.

Trump administration sues Harvard over admissions data, demands to see it

- The US Justice Department sued Harvard for student admissions data, investigating potential racial discrimination against white applicants, despite not directly accusing Harvard.
- Donald Trump demanded US$1 billion from Harvard for inadequate protection of Jewish students during protests, leading the Pentagon to cut academic ties.
- These actions are part of the Trump administration's long-running battle with Harvard, including past attempts to cut US$2.6 billion in federal funding.
AI generated
WASHINGTON -The US Justice Department sued Harvard on Feb 13 demanding its student admissions data, in the Trump administration’s latest salvo in its long-running battle with the elite university.
“Harvard has failed to disclose the data we need to ensure that its admissions are free of discrimination,” Attorney-General Pam Bondi said in a statement.
In a 2023 ruling, the Supreme Court barred consideration of race in college admissions and Mr Trump’s Justice Department is investigating whether any US schools are discriminating against white applicants.
The Justice Department said the lawsuit “seeks only to compel Harvard to produce documents related to any consideration of race in admissions and does not accuse Harvard of racial discrimination.”
“If Harvard has stopped discriminating, it should happily share the data necessary to prove it,” Assistant Attorney-General Harmeet Dhillon said.
US President Donald Trump recently demanded that Harvard pay US$1 billion (S$1.26 billion) in damages
“We are now seeking One Billion Dollars in damages, and want nothing further to do, into the future, with Harvard University,” Mr Trump wrote on his Truth Social platform.
Just days later, the Pentagon cut all academic ties with Harvard.
Mr Trump has previously sought to cut more than US$2.6 billion of federal funding to Harvard, and has moved to block entry of international students – a quarter of its student body.
Those moves have largely been temporarily blocked by the courts.

Türkiye slams European Parliament's 'baseless' resolution

Türkiye has strongly rejected recent European Parliament resolutions, calling the claims baseless and an attempt to interfere in its internal affairs.
In a statement on Friday, the Turkish Foreign Ministry said it “categorically rejects” allegations targeting Türkiye in resolutions adopted by the European Parliament on February 12.
The ministry said a resolution on the situation in northeast Syria ignored Türkiye’s role in the country’s recovery and stabilisation, urging EU lawmakers to better understand realities on the ground and the aspirations of the Syrian people rather than adopting what it described as misguided and ill-intentioned measures.
“The resolution on ‘Situation in Northeast Syria’ disregards Türkiye’s role in Syria’s recovery and stabilisation,” the statement said.
It also rejected claims in a separate resolution concerning freedom of expression and religion, saying they contradicted facts.
“We advise the EU Parliament to exert greater effort to understand realities on the ground and aspirations of Syria and its people, rather than adopting misguided and ill-intentioned resolutions.”
The ministry stressed that no foreign institution, including the European Parliament, could interfere in Türkiye’s judicial processes.
Ankara warned that the resolutions risk undermining efforts to improve ties with the European Union and called on the European Parliament to take constructive steps to strengthen relations rather than being used for initiatives against the country.
“We call upon the EU Parliament to take constructive steps for Türkiye-EU relations, rather than being instrumentalised for efforts against our country and attempting to interfere in our internal affairs.”

The US acting alone has reached the limits of its power and may already have lost its role as global leader, Friedrich Merz, the German chancellor, warned Donald Trump at the opening of the Munich Security Conference.
Merz also disclosed he had held initial talks with the French president, Emmanuel Macron, over the possibility of joining France’s nuclear umbrella, underlining his call for Europe to develop a stronger self-standing security strategy.
In a speech on Friday designed to set a firm yet conciliatory tone about the future of the transatlantic partnership, Merz argued the old order had ended and in this new age of superpowers even the US was reaching the limits of going it alone.
Referring to those that warned the international rules-based order was about to be destroyed, Merz said: “I fear we must put it even more bluntly. This order, however imperfect it was even at its best, no longer exists in that form.”
Switching to English to ram home his message, Merz said: “In the era of great power rivalry, even the United States will not be powerful enough to go it alone. Dear friends, being a part of Nato is not only Europe’s competitive advantage. It is also the United States’ competitive advantage.”
“So let’s repair and revive transatlantic trust together,” he added.
The German chancellor’s speech opened the annual gathering of top global security figures including many European leaders and the US secretary of state, Marco Rubio.
At last year’s conference, held a few weeks into Trump’s second term, the US vice-president, JD Vance, stunned European leaders by lecturing them about the state of democracy and freedom of speech on the continent – a moment that set the tone for the last year.
A series of statements and moves from the Trump administration targeting allies has followed, including Trump’s threat last month to impose new tariffs on several European countries in a move to secure US control of Greenland, a semi-autonomous territory of Denmark, a Nato ally.
Merz drew most applause from an audience brimming with hostility toward US unilateralism when he directly criticised the current American administration, saying: “The culture war of the Maga movement is not ours. Freedom of speech ends here with us when that speech is directed against human dignity and the basic law. We do not believe in tariffs and protectionism, but in free trade. We stand by climate agreements and the World Health Organization.”
“In the age of great powers, our freedom is no longer a given. It is threatened,” he said, adding that “firmness and willpower will be needed to assert this freedom”. Challenging Trump’s unilateral style, Merz added: “Autocracies may have followers, democracies have partners and allies.”
At the same time, he said Europe must cast off its excessive dependence on the US, emphasising: “We won’t do that by writing off Nato.”
He also urged the US president to recognise it was still possible to exhaust Russia economically and militarily, to the point where it was willing to come to the negotiating table over Ukraine.
With Germany one of the European countries doing the most to boost its own defence spending, Merz clearly felt in a strong enough position to insist the US needed to do more to listen to European concerns about its security and the legitimacy of a sustained European pillar of Nato.
Describing the Munich conference as a seismograph for the state of US-European relations, he said the Ukraine war “had forced Europe to return from a vacation from world history. Together we have entered an era that is once again marked by power and big-power politics.”
These big powers, Merz said, “make their own rules. It is fast, harsh and often unpredictable. These powers exploit natural resources, technologies and supply chains using them as bargaining tools.”
Merz was speaking as the fourth anniversary of the Russian invasion of Ukraine approaches and one year after Vance used his speech in the same hall to criticise Europeans for not taking enough control of their own defence arrangements and ignoring the demands of their electorates.
Merz responded by saying it was crucial for the continent to change its mindset and fully exploit the “enormous” military, political, economic and technological potential of a “sovereign Europe”. Germany was striving for “partnership-based leadership” in Europe but retained no “hegemonic fantasies”.
Merz said he had begun talks with Macron about a European nuclear deterrent. This, he said, must be firmly integrated into Nato’s nuclear arsenal and would not result in some parts of Europe being more defended than others. The chancellor stated that Germany was not abandoning Nato but wanted to establish a “strong, self-sustaining pillar” within the alliance.
In his speech Macron insisted Europe must be at the table to negotiate a new arms control settlement with Russia covering ballistic missiles, deep strike capacity, defence technology and nuclear weapons.
The French president said previous arms control treaties such as the now defunct INF Treaty were negotiated only by the US and this could not be repeated if Europe was to be taken seriously as a geopolitical power.
He said initial talks about new European security architecture had already been held with the UK and Germany, but it was now time to broaden the consultations across Europe.
Macron warned a Ukrainian peace settlement required applying extra pressure, but even if an agreement was reached Europe faced the challenge of how to “coexist with an unreconstructed aggressive Russia on our borders” that has “a bloated army and a defence industry on a sugar high”.
Calling for a transparent independent European channel of communication with Russia, he said the post second world war security architecture had been “totally designed and framed during the cold war times” and needed a new articulation.
Addressing the criticisms directed at Europe last year by Vance, Macron said “Europe has been vilified … as a repressive continent where speech is not free and where alternative facts cannot claim the same right of citizenship as truth itself – that outdated and cumbersome concept.”

Trump wants more access to your personal data. Will our government hand it over?

As White House officials in the US defend the country's violent crackdown on immigration at the hands of its Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agency, experts are warning against the covert use of surveillance tools by ICE officers.
Beneath the masks and bulletproof gear is an array of technologies, including facial recognition and hacking tools built by Israeli tech company Paragon, which allow agents to take control of phones or remotely access messages and location data.
With a budget larger than most militaries, ICE also has access to state-of-the-art biometric trackers and looser restrictions on their use, enabling the tracking of not only undocumented immigrants but also citizens protesting against immigration raids.
Now, reports are emerging that the Australian government may be compelled to share Australians' biometric data and other information with the US and its agencies, including ICE, as part of a compliance measure to vet travellers entering the country under its Visa Waiver Program (VWP).
The Australian government, via the Department of Home Affairs, has so far declined to confirm whether it is currently complying with the demands or has plans to negotiate a data-sharing agreement. That’s despite the US setting a deadline of 31 December for finalising agreements with countries participating in its visa-free travel arrangement, including Australia.
If enacted, the changes would allow US agencies to access the personal data of any Australian travelling to the US — including their passport and ID information, facial images, fingerprints and police and immigration records. Some experts have warned that it may also extend to non-travellers.
What is biometric data, and why does the US want it?
Under the Migration Act, the Department of Home Affairs is permitted to capture biometric data from travellers who apply for certain visa subclasses — namely those that are either part of its biometrics program or issued by a country or jurisdiction that is subject to it.
This typically includes fingerprints and facial images.
Biometric data is useful because it captures traits that "cannot realistically be replaced", explains Tess Rooney, a lecturer focused on AI and data governance at the University of Canberra.
"So, unlike a credit card or password — once that's compromised, it can be changed."
Biometric data can also expose and infer a broad range of details about a person, Rooney says.
"Certain biometrics can expose health information, genetic traits, inferences about racial or ethnic origin, disability, sometimes even emotional state.
It's categorised as sensitive information for that reason.
The proposed changes to the US' vetting processes would primarily affect Australians eligible for the ESTA visa waiver program, which allows travellers from 42 countries to visit the US for up to 90 days visa-free, provided they first obtain an electronic travel authorisation.
Reporting by Crikey this month noted that the changes could also enable US agencies to access data on Australians who are not seeking to travel to the US and those who have interactions with immigration or law enforcement.
Sherwin Noorian, an Australian-based US immigration lawyer, tells SBS News the reports are concerning.
"It's important to note that there is already a level of information-sharing between the Australian government and the US government," he says.
"But this seems to be a new system where the US is approaching various different countries... So it remains to be seen exactly what they're looking for, but it sounds like at the negotiations, they're coming in looking for pretty much all they can get, and then it's up to the two countries to negotiate what they will indeed offer in this scheme."
Expanded sharing agreement
The changes to the VWP were first announced in 2022 by then-US President Joe Biden, who said countries participating in the program would have to agree to an Enhanced Border Security Partnership (EBSP), under which the US would be granted access to countries' biometric and ID databases.
In 2025, ahead of the December deadline set for all EBSPs to be finalised, the Trump administration expanded the scope of the partnership.
As well as extensive biometric data, including DNA, the proposal requests that inbound travellers to the US provide five years of social media history, five years of personal and work contact details, extensive personal information on family members, and even the IP address and metadata of any photos uploaded as part of their application.
So far, the United Kingdom has signed onto the agreement, and the European Union is in negotiations.
SBS News reached out to the Department of Home Affairs to ask whether such negotiations are underway in Australia, but a spokesperson declined to confirm, saying: "The Australian Government does not comment on matters specific to United States Government policy and we respect the sovereign jurisdiction of the US Government."
The spokesperson did not address SBS News' specific questions about whether US agencies would have a right to access Australian databases with or without an EBPS in place or whether the government is already facilitating access to such databases. They also declined to comment on whether Australia would be forced to opt out of visa-free travel with the US if an EBPS is not negotiated before the deadline.
"Visa requirements and policies are a matter for the countries that issue them," the spokesperson said.
What are the risks in sharing biometric data?
While the proposed data sharing is intended for vetting purposes, Rooney says it could be accessed by US agencies for other reasons.
"While the official justification for the EBSP is pre-travel vetting, the reality is that once Australian biometric data is in US systems, it becomes accessible for a much broader range of enforcement purposes," she says.
"The political context matters here. We're seeing a significant expansion of ICE and Border Patrol operations under the Trump administration, and that may be circumventing a whole range of protections, both Australian and American.
"So when we think about what they want the data for, there's that stated purpose, securing the Visa Waiver Program, and then there's the operational reality of how biometric data actually gets used once it's in the system."
With no clear guardrails in place, Rooney says this agreement could see Australians' personal data — including that of those not travelling to the US — enter the databases of the US government departments and agencies, such as ICE.
"Databases get hacked on an almost regular basis," she says.
There's a fundamental privacy right here for people to control and maintain their own data, particularly when it's biometric data.
According to Noorian, there could also be financial consequences for travellers who may be knocked back during the vetting process.
"The risk is to travellers who may be planning holidays to the US at considerable cost to themselves, and then something pops up when they go to apply for that ESTA," he says.
"We don't know if that's going to include political views or not, or if it's simply criminal histories and watch lists, things like that.
"But something could pop up that would result in their ESTA being denied, and then, all of a sudden, they need to go and apply for a visa and get more clarity."
Rooney says that, however the data is used, the Australian government remains accountable for it.
"Under the Privacy Act, unless a clear exemption applies, the Australian government remains accountable for how those US agencies choose to use that data."

Former NYPD official charged with taking bribes from company selling 'panic button' to city schools

Former NYPD official charged with taking bribes from company selling 'panic button' to city schools
A former NYPD school safety commander has been charged with taking bribes to push a panic alert system into city schools

A former high-ranking official in the New York Police Department has been charged with accepting $35,000 in cash, luxury travel perks and other bribes from a Florida businessman seeking to sell panic buttons to the city’s public schools and police.
In an indictment Thursday, federal prosecutors said Kevin Taylor attempted to steer an $11 million contract toward the company, SaferWatch, while serving as the commanding officer of the NYPD’s School Safety Division. The company markets its product as a “mobile panic alert system” used for mass shootings and other emergencies.
In exchange, the company’s founder, Gene Roefaro, showered Taylor and his romantic partner with gifts — including luxury hotels and airfare to the Bahamas and Las Vegas, helicopter tours, tickets to Broadway musicals and a “medieval-themed dinner theater” — along with multiple cash payments, prosecutors said.
Taylor pleaded not guilty to bribery and wire fraud charges on Thursday. An emailed inquiry to his attorney was not returned.
Roefaro is also facing charges, including bribery and wire fraud. He has not yet entered a plea. An attorney for Roefaro said it was “puzzling and deeply concerning that the United States Attorney’s Office has chosen to pursue charges against Geno, while at the very same time, alleging — and seeking to prove — that he was the victim of an extortionate shakedown."
The charges are the latest allegations of corruption and favor-trading lodged against officials appointed by the city’s former mayor, Eric Adams, who faced his own indictment in a separate bribery scheme that also involved luxury travel gifts.
While the case against Adams was later abandoned by the Trump administration, at least some of the probes into his inner circle remain active, including an ongoing bribery case involving his former chief advisor. In recent weeks, federal prosecutors have announced bribery charges against two other NYPD officers and a former housing official under Adams.
The investigation into SaferWatch first emerged in September 2024 as part of a sprawling federal probe into the Adams administration. The company was one of several to hire a consulting firm run by the brother of two top Adams officials, both of whom resigned after their homes were searched by federal authorities.
Federal prosecutors allege that in 2023 Taylor helped secured a no-bid contract to pilot Roefaro’s products within the command center of the NYPD’s school safety division. But as the police official struggled to expand the program, Roefaro grew frustrated, at times describing himself as a “sugar daddy” who had “made a MAJOR investment and zero return,” according to the indictment.
“It’s been fun, but it’s not fun or funny anymore,” Roefaro allegedly texted Taylor in late 2023. “Our company (ME) needs to report something real and significant that is in place prior to end of year.”
Days later, Taylor tried to put together a press conference to announce his division would be procuring a tip line from Roefaro's company, prosecutors said. But that event was later cancelled.
During roughly the same time, Taylor was also attempting to solicit $75,000 in bribes from two businessmen involved in a company that sold bullet-resistant vests to police, according to the indictment. Both men declined his solicitations, prosecutors said.

‘Dangerous’ sexual predator who manipulated women to abuse children jailed
Elliot Jones faced 17 charges of sexual offences against children, three counts of making indecent photographs of children and a charge of blackmail
- Bookmark
A "dangerous sexual predator" who "coerced, pressured and manipulated" three women into sending him child abuse videos has been jailed for 26 years.
Elliot Jones, 49, of Necton, Norfolk, was sentenced at Winchester Crown Court.
He faced 17 charges of sexual offences against children, three counts of making indecent photographs of children, and a blackmail charge.
Jones, who also abused some of the victims, will serve an eight-year extended licence period after his prison term.
Sarah Johnson, 57, of Andover, Hampshire, was sentenced to 11 years in prison with an extended licence period of one year for 12 charges of sexual offences against children, three of taking indecent photographs of children and three of distributing indecent photographs.
Heidi Ludbrook, 45, of King’s Lynn, Norfolk, was jailed for seven years for two counts of conspiracy to cause a child to engage in sexual activity, two counts of causing a child to engage in sexual activity, three counts of taking indecent photos of children and three of distributing indecent images of children.
Catarina Araujo, 46, of Dereham, Norfolk, was sentenced to 12 months in prison suspended for a year for one count of taking indecent photographs of children and one count of distributing indecent photographs of children.
Barry McElduff KC, prosecuting, said that the abuse first came to light after one of the victims revealed sexual assaults they had suffered from Johnson.
He said that Jones then blackmailed Johnson into continuing the abuse, which involved her performing sex acts on herself and on the young victims which included the use of sex toys.
He said that the victims described being in “obvious pain and distress”, with one saying that the abuse, which happened on a “weekly basis for six to 12 months”, had “broken” them.
Mr McElduff said that Jones also contacted other women through dating apps in a bid to target more children during a six-year period.
The court heard that the eight victims included both boys and girls.
He said: “He had been in contact with many other women in which a clear strategy is evident.
“He would befriend a woman online, start speaking with them, push effectively at boundaries, talk in a sexual way, share sexual images and chats and move on eventually to the topic of abuse of children to see how far it would go.
“Heidi Ludbrook and Catarina Araujo were two women who had engaged in conversation with Mr Jones to varying degrees, he was provided with material.”
Judge Adam Feest KC said that Jones had “coerced, pressured and manipulated” the other defendants into taking part in the abuse, which had caused the victims “severe psychological harm”, with one saying they had considered suicide.
He told Jones: “You deliberately and effectively manipulated and coerced your co-defendants.
“Your targeted, repeated and sustained actions have been a corrupting and destructive influence on your victims and co-defendants alike.”
He added: “I am quite satisfied the risk you pose to others, particularly children, is of the highest order. I am also quite satisfied this risk is unlikely to diminish over time.”
Bartholomew O’Toole, defending Jones, said: “He does fully acknowledge the seriousness of these matters and he very much regrets everything he has done.
“He regrets the hurt and the damage he has caused.”
Adrienne Knight, representing Johnson, said that her client suffered from “underlying mental health difficulties” including ADHD, borderline personality disorder, autism, depression and anxiety which she said made her “more vulnerable and susceptible than others”.
Ms Knight said that Johnson was “manipulated” by Jones and added: “She was almost hypnotised, he was able to control and coerce her into things she would never have done, she is overwhelmed with remorse.”
Helen Easterbrook, representing Ludbrook, said that her client was “incredibly sorry” for her actions and added: “There was a lot of clever manipulation in this, but for Mr Jones this would never have happened. She allowed herself to fall under that pressure.”
John Montague, of the Crown Prosecution Service, said: “Elliot Jones is a dangerous sexual predator who tactically befriended women online to engage in discussions about child abuse for his own sexual gratification.
“His horrifying and persistent offending, enabled by the women he met online, resulted in profound and lasting harm to numerous children over many years.”

Somali ports minister says direct sea link with Türkiye ‘strategic necessity’ as trade expands

Somali ports minister says direct sea link with Türkiye ‘strategic necessity’ as trade expands
Direct sea routes between Türkiye and Somalia would cut costs, boost trade and strengthen regional connectivity, says Abdulkadir Mohamed Nur
ISTANBUL
Somalia’s ports minister said Thursday that establishing direct maritime shipping routes with Türkiye has become a strategic necessity amid expanding trade and deepening bilateral ties.
Speaking to Anadolu on the sidelines of the 2nd Transport Ministers Conference of the Organization of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) in Istanbul, Somali Minister of Ports and Maritime Transport Abdulkadir Mohamed Nur said commercial exchanges between the two countries have exceeded the capacity of current logistics arrangements.
“The current level of trade between Somalia and Türkiye has moved beyond the present logistics structure,” Nur said, adding that direct sea lines would reduce costs, shorten delivery times and increase overall trade volume.
The conference brought together transport ministers from OIC member states to discuss connectivity and infrastructure cooperation. Nur said it was meaningful to address transport links in a city that has historically connected continents, civilizations and trade routes.
He said the conference theme extends beyond technical infrastructure to focus on solidarity, shared prosperity and strategic resilience at a time when global supply chains remain fragile and alternative trade corridors are being reshaped.
Ports and logistics networks, he said, have become central elements of economic security.
-Somalia’s geostrategic role
Highlighting Somalia’s geostrategic position, Nur said the country serves as a natural bridge between Africa, the Arabian Peninsula, South Asia and the Indian Ocean basin.
“The security of global trade is directly linked to the security of Somalia’s coasts,” he said, noting that stability in the Horn of Africa is essential to ensuring security in the Red Sea and Indian Ocean regions.
Nur said Somalia’s ports play not only a national role but also serve landlocked countries in East Africa. Expanding port capacity, he added, is strategically important for Somalia’s development as well as for regional economic integration and supply chain resilience.
He said feasibility studies for the New Mogadishu Port Project have been completed and that the initiative has entered the tender phase. The project aims to transform regional logistics capacity, and he invited investors and private sector representatives to contribute to Somalia’s port development.
-Expanding strategic partnership with Türkiye
On bilateral ties, Nur said relations with Türkiye have evolved from humanitarian cooperation into a strategic partnership covering defense, energy, education, infrastructure, fisheries, space and maritime sectors.
He described President Recep Tayyip Erdogan’s 2011 visit to Mogadishu as a historic turning point, calling it a strong expression of solidarity during a difficult period for Somalia.
Nur said that beyond increasing trade, direct maritime links with Türkiye would also facilitate Ankara’s access to landlocked countries in East Africa. He said technical and diplomatic efforts toward this goal are ongoing.
Somalia seeks to act as a complementary, rather than competing, player in global trade, Nur said, outlining a maritime and transport vision focused on enhancing connectivity, strengthening resilience and promoting regional prosperity.

Olga Kryvogub hoped her baby daughter would one day see an end to Russia’s invasion, so she named her Myroslava – meaning “one who celebrates peace.”
Myroslava was instead laid to rest on Friday, alongside her brothers, twins Ivan and Vladislav, and their father, Grigory, all of whom died in a Russian drone strike on their home in a town close to the Russian border three days earlier.

“Everything collapsed in one fell swoop,” Natalia Kryvogub, a 32-year-old relative, told AFP.
Olga, 34, is eight months pregnant.
She survived the attack on Tuesday but sustained a brain injury and burns.
“She is in a lot of pain,” 24-year-old relative Oleksandra told AFP.
“Her whole world was taken away from her, all the warmth, leaving her with pain and disappointment.”
Grigory and the children were sleeping when the drone hit, Oleksandra said.
At their funeral, relatives placed soft toys and flowers on the coffins.
“We named her Myroslava, so that the war would end. But the war took her away,” Oleksandra told AFP.
US-led efforts to end Europe’s deadliest conflict since World War II have accelerated in recent weeks, but Moscow and Kyiv remain far apart on key issues including territory.
Ukraine and its European allies say Russia -- which denies targeting civilians – is not interested in peace.

- President Macron urged Europe to become a strong geopolitical power, dismissing decay accusations and advocating for audacity and strategic thinking.
- Europe faces an aggressive Russia, even post-Ukraine war. It must not yield to Russian demands or accept short-term deals.
- Macron proposed reorganising Europe's security architecture, including deep-strike capabilities and integrating France's nuclear deterrent.

MUNICH, Germany - Europe must turn its focus to long-term strategic thinking, including creating deep-strike capabilities and assessing how France’s nuclear deterrent can fit into the bloc’s future security architecture, France’s president said on Feb 13.
Speaking at the Munich Security Conference, President Emmanuel Macron dismissed accusations that Europe was decaying and defended its push to tackle disinformation and the excesses of social media that were harming Western democracies.
“This is the right time for audacity. This is the right time for a strong Europe,” Mr Macron said.
“Europe has to learn to become a geopolitical power. It was not part of our DNA.”
Mr Macron, who is set to enter his final year in office, said Europe would still face an aggressive Russia even if there were a deal on the Ukraine war, and that it could not cave into Russian demands or allow a short-term accord that would not resolve core issues.
“The Europeans must start this work with their own thinking and their own interests. So my proposal today is to launch a series of consultations on this important issue, which we have started to flesh out with our British and German colleagues, but in the broader European consultation with all the colleagues here, with a lot of capacities, a lot of strategic thinking,” Mr Macron said.
Mr Macron, who is scheduled to deliver a speech later this month on how he sees the role of France’s nuclear deterrent within Europe, said he had started those consultations.
“We have to reshuffle and reorganise our architecture of security in Europe. Because the past architecture of security was totally designed and framed during Cold War times. So it’s no longer adapted,” he said.
“We have to rearticulate nuclear deterrence in this approach. And this is why we are conceiving, and in a few weeks’ time I will detail that, but we engaged a strategic dialogue, obviously with Chancellor (Angela) Merkel, but with a few European leaders, in order to see how we can articulate our national doctrine, which is guaranteed and controlled by the Constitution,” he said.

Defense tech, air defense, and win-win partnerships: Fedorov summarizes Ramstein meetings
According to Ukrinform, Fedorov shared details of the meetings on Facebook following the Ramstein talks.
“In addition to the Ramstein-format meeting, I held a number of bilateral talks with colleagues. I presented my priorities as defense minister, our vision, and concrete projects aimed at building win-win partnerships,” he said.
Among other meetings, Fedorov held talks with Alexus Grynkewich, Supreme Allied Commander Europe (SACEUR).
“Ukraine is developing some of the most affordable and effective defense tech solutions and is ready to share this experience. At the same time, we need partners’ assistance to counter ballistic threats. We discussed the PURL program as a key mechanism for providing Ukraine with critically needed missiles,” Fedorov noted.
In talks with UK Defense Secretary John Healey, the sides discussed implementation of the cooperation roadmap under the century-long partnership, as well as delivery timelines and volumes for Octopus interceptors.
Discussions with German Defense Minister Boris Pistorius focused on contributions to strengthening drone assault units, the development of mid-strike capabilities, and counter-drone measures. The sides also reviewed possibilities for replacing Mavic drones with Ukrainian-made solutions in cooperation with partners.
A separate focus was placed on cooperation within the “Patriot for Ukraine” program.
Fedorov also held talks with Belgian Defense Minister Theo Francken, Latvian Defense Minister Andris Spruds, Norwegian Defense Minister Tore Sandvik, Australian Defense Minister Richard Marles, and Canadian Minister of National Defence David McGuinty.
“The key topic of all meetings was military assistance to Ukraine, first and foremost strengthening air defense. This is a priority task set by the President,” the defense minister emphasized.
The talks also covered promising areas of cooperation, including the search for low-cost and effective solutions to counter Shahed-type drones, the supply of long-range artillery, the launch of joint production projects, and additional partner contributions to the PURL program.
Fedorov thanked partners for their strong and consistent support for Ukraine.
As reported by Ukrinform, agreements reached following the Ramstein-format meeting include $38 billion in partner support for Ukraine in 2026.

Macron criticises "defeating speech" on Ukraine and says Russia has been weakened
French President Emmanuel Macron has criticised pessimistic statements about Ukraine, arguing that the war has in fact weakened Russia.
Source: Macron at the Munich Security Conference, as reported by European Pravda
Details: Macron expressed support for US President Donald Trump's efforts to achieve a peace settlement.
"I fully support President Trump's drive towards a negotiated peace, one that should be just lasting and robust. And I want to believe that we're getting closer. But as discussions are taking shape, Russia keeps bombing civilians and destroying energy facilities, with the obvious aim of freezing Ukrainians into submission. The answer cannot be to cave in to Russia demands, but to increase pressure on Russia instead," he said.
Macron also urged observers to look at the bigger picture, noting that after four years of full-scale war Russia has become a weakened country.
"It squandered inordinate amounts of money on a senseless war and has now entered recession. It is isolated economically. It is completely dependent on China. While the country already had a severe demographic problem, it lost hundreds of thousands of young lives to an illusion. It meant to fight NATO expansion – Sweden and Finland joined NATO. It meant to weaken Europe – Europe is massively rearming," the French president said.
"And when I hear some defeating speech about Ukraine, when I hear some, some leaders urging Ukraine to accept they are defeated, overpricing Russia in this war, this is a huge strategic mistake, because this is not a reality," Macron stressed.
He believes it is essential to ensure that any peace settlement preserves European security, deters Russia from further attempts at aggression and does not set a dangerous example for the rest of the world.
"So the Europeans have a direct take as main actors of the support to Ukraine, as members of the Coalition of the Willing, as fellow inhabitants of the same continent, and because of the European destiny of Ukraine," Macron concluded.
Background:
- Dmytro Lytvyn, an advisor to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy confirmed to journalists that the next round of negotiations between Ukraine, Russia and the United States will take place on 17-18 February in Geneva.
- On 10 February, Kaja Kallas, EU High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, said she would initiate a discussion with EU member states regarding a list of the concessions that Europe should demand from Russia as part of a potential agreement to end Russia's war against Ukraine.

Munich, Epstein, Confessions of Love Cheat
Issued on: Modified:
This Friday in The World This Week, we talk about the unravelling of the Epstein Files, the end of the Old World Order and the Olympic Helmet Dilemma.
Epstein Files Unravelling
In a week where the names of those listed in the Epstein Files have continued to feel the consequences, at least on this side of the channel. Resignations and investigations underway now in France, and Norway. The British Prime Minister narrowly survived, for now. And while Keir Starmer was fighting for his political life, the US Attorney General Pam Bondi was in combative mode as she was pressed for five hours by the House Judiciary Committee on alleged mishandling of the Epstein files release, and for redacting the wrong names, and asked why the Department of Justice hadn’t pursued more indictments…
Out With the Old World Order
It’s been a week of existential talk over Europe’s place in the world, President Macron spoke of the dangerous squeeze between the US and China, and the risk of being swept aside unless the EU unties its regulations, reforms its rules, and builds economic sovereignty. To protect without protectionism, he suggested, raising the eyebrows of some fellow leaders who’ve long cherished an open market. Europe’s detachment issues is a key theme at this week’s global gathering at the Munich Security Conference, the so-called ‘Davos for the Defence industry’.
The Olympic Helmet Dilemma
The Ukraine war will be another focal point, as it was too at the Winter Olympics as the athlete Vladyslav Heraskevych was disqualified for breaching non-political rules for wearing a helmet honouring 24 Ukrainian athletes, victims of the war. It was clearly not a comfortable decision for the Olympic Committee chief…
Canada in Shock
It’s been a week of shock and mourning in Canada after a mass school shooting in in British Colombia. At least 10 people died, including children as young as 12. Police say the suspect 18-year-old Jesse Van Rootselaar, a biological male identifying as female, had previous mental health concerns, with police having been called out two years ago to seize firearms, though officers say they had quote, “no idea of the motive for the killings”.
West Bank settlement expansion
And it’s been a week that’s seen the occupied West Bank return to the headlines. The Israeli Security Cabinet approved a set of measures that make it easier for Jewish settlers to aquire land, shifting the power from the Palestinian Authority to Israeli authorities when it comes to laws around planning, construction, property law and enforcement. Critics including many Arab states, argue that it is de facto annexation on the quiet, while world attention is on extraordinary events elsewhere. While President Trump has previously stated his opposition to any Israeli annexation, little was said as he met Benjamin Netanyahu at the White House on Wednesday, the focus was on how to deal with Iran, by diplomacy or military force: there’s still nothing definitive at least publicly.

Macron defends European model at Munich Security Conference

France's President Emmanuel Macron on Friday, February 13, defended Europe as an example to follow, as the continent seeks to rebuild strained ties with the United States. "Everyone should take their cue from us, instead of criticizing us," he said at the Munich Security Conference, after US Vice President JD Vance used his address at the annual gathering last year to attack European policies on immigration and free speech.
Macron said there had been a tendency "to overlook Europe, and sometimes, to criticize it outright," to vilify it "as an aging, slow, fragmented construct," as "a society prey to barbaric migrations," and even "as a repressive continent where speech would not be free." But "Europe is a radically original political construction of free sovereign states" that gave up centuries of rivalry and war "to institutionalize peace through economic interdependence," he said. Now, "Europe has to learn to become a geopolitical power," he added.
Macron said France supported US President Donald Trump's "drive toward a negotiated peace" to end Russia's war in Ukraine that started in February 2022. But if a settlement is reached to end Europe's worst conflict since World War II, the continent would need to "define rules of coexistence that limit the risk of escalation," Macron warned.
"We should articulate among Europeans our real long-term security interests in our region, and give ourselves the metal and the clout to prosecute them, and at the same time fortify ourselves as confident democracies," the French president said. "This Europe will be a good ally and partner for the United States of America," he added. "Because it will be a partner taking its fair share of the burden. It will be a partner being respected."
Macron last month said France preferred "respect to bullies" after Trump's vow to impose levies on countries opposing his threat to seize Greenland, an autonomous Danish territory. The US leader has since backed down and started talks with Denmark.

Trump says Nancy Guthrie sheriff ‘didn’t want to let go’ of case delaying FBI action
Trump’s remarks came amid growing scrutiny of the Pima County Sheriff’s Department
- Bookmark
President Trump said Friday that the investigation into the disappearance of Nancy Guthrie was slowed because the local sheriff’s department “didn’t want to let go” of the case – but that “progress has been made” now that the FBI is involved.
“Well, they took it over originally, that was a local case originally,” Trump told reporters at the White House.
“They didn’t want to let go of it, which is fine; it’s up to them. It’s really up to the community. But ultimately, when the FBI got involved, I think, you know, progress has been made.” “Complicated,” he added.
When asked by reporters if he believes Mexican cartels or a foreign country is involved in Guthrie’s disappearance, he said: “You can’t say that yet; it’s a little bit early, but it’s, uh, somebody either knew what they were doing very well or they were rank amateurs. Either way, it’s not a good situation.”
Trump’s remarks came amid growing scrutiny of the Pima County Sheriff’s Department, after reports suggested federal investigators were delayed in gaining access to key evidence in the high-profile case involving the mother of Today co-host Savannah Guthrie. Pima County Sheriff Chris Nanos denied these allegations.
A law enforcement official told Reuters that the FBI requested a glove and DNA collected from Guthrie’s to be processed at the bureau’s national crime lab in Quantico, Virginia.
However, Nanos has instead insisted on using a private Florida lab, effectively denying the FBI access to crucial evidence, the official said.
The sheriff has primary jurisdiction over the case and FBI assistance must be officially requested by the county, otherwise the FBI is legally precluded from taking part in the investigation. The official said that the county has spent some $200,000 so far to send evidence in the Guthrie case to the Florida lab.
“It risks further slowing a case that grows more urgent by the minute,” the official argued, citing unspecified “earlier setbacks” in the investigation.
The official also criticized the sheriff for not seeking FBI assistance in the investigation sooner.
“It’s clear the fastest path to answers is leveraging federal resources and technology. Anything less only prolongs the Guthrie family’s grief and the community’s wait for justice,” the official said.
In an interview with KVOA, Nanos pushed back and said the FBI agreed with his decision to send newly discovered evidence to a lab that has worked with his office for years.
He called the claims “not even close to the truth” and said he discussed the matter directly with the FBI.
Signs of friction between the FBI and sheriff’s department emerged as the search for Guthrie stretched into its 12th day, as investigators intensified their search for clues in the presumed kidnapping for ransom
Earlier this week, the case saw its biggest break with the release of newly recovered surveillance footage showing a masked individual on Nancy Guthrie’s porch the night she disappeared.
The FBI said the newly released images were recovered from residual backend data from the doorbell camera after days of searching for footage that may have been lost or corrupted.
The video shows a person wearing a backpack and gloves approaching the front door and attempting to cover a security camera with plants. The individual appeared to be armed with a holster at their waist.
White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said the president reacted with “pure disgust” after reviewing the video.
“I was once again with the president. He and I were both reviewing the newly released surveillance footage from FBI in the Savannah Guthrie case on just this heartbreaking situation with respect to her mother,” Leavitt told reporters. “His initial reaction, of course, is of pure disgust,” she added.
Leavitt urged the public to contact the FBI with any information.
“The president encourages any American across the country with any knowledge of this suspect to please call the FBI, who continue to assist state and local authorities, who are leading this investigation on the ground,” she said on Tuesday.
Guthrie’s family continues to publicly plead for her safe return.

Ex-Met Officer filmed making rape jokes committed gross misconduct
Brian Sharkey was secretly filmed joking about rape, with the footage then being aired in a BBC Panorama documentary in October

- CommentsGo to comments
A former Metropolitan Police officer who was secretly filmed joking about rape and sexual assault has been found to have committed gross misconduct by a tribunal panel.
Ex-police constable Brian Sharkey, who retired in May 2025, made a series of comments in undercover footage which aired in a BBC Panorama documentary in October belittling claims of racial bias and talking about disposing of evidence, his misconduct hearing in south London was told.
Finding his behaviour breached professional standards and amounted to gross misconduct, panel chairman Commander Stephen Clayman said of Mr Sharkey’s comment about sexual offences: “It undermines public confidence in policing at a time when police forces and particularly the Met Police are trying to demonstrate how seriously it takes offences of violence against women and girls.”
At a pub following a shift in January last year, Mr Sharkey’s colleagues were discussing a police officer getting away with committing sexual assault, the tribunal heard earlier.
Following on from that discussion, footage played on Friday showed Mr Sharkey saying: “If you are going to get accused of it you might as well f****** do it then.
“If you go down for a sexual assault you might as well go down for rape.”
He added: “Please, that’s a joke. I challenge myself on that.”
He then said: “That was wrong, I do apologise.”
Cecily White, for the Met Police, told the tribunal it is “clear” he was making a joke, adding: “For an officer to make a joke about allegations of sexual assault or rape, especially to other colleagues… (it) is capable of undermining public trust and confidence because it is capable of making members of the public think that police officers do not think such allegations are particularly serious. They are just a joke, just a laughing matter.
“It is capable of giving the impression that they won’t be taken seriously.”
During his evidence, Mr Sharkey told the panel “something else had been said” after the discussion about sexual assault and that the conversation had turned towards challenge culture in the Met.
He claimed he meant to provide an “example” of how treating “trivial matters” with too much weight can devalue the impact of more serious matters, but accepted it was a “poor example” and “very, very, very wrong”.
“I take sexual assault very, very seriously, do not trivialise it at all,” he said.
“I do regret it, I regretted it right from the start.”
In August 2024, Mr Sharkey was filmed while taking his break during a night shift telling the undercover journalist: “You stop a toerag because he is up to no good, you don’t find anything on him ‘well you’re just stopping me because I’m black or you’re just stopping me because I’m this or you’re just stopping me because I’m that’ and you just get a whole load of a mouth full of shit from them.”
Ms White argued the then-officer was treating claims of racial bias as “spurious excuses”.
“The use of stop and search powers particularly against black and minority communities is a legitimate matter of public concern as this officer was or should have been aware,” the lawyer for the Met said.
Mr Sharkey told his misconduct hearing he “was not being racist at all” and that he would have given more examples rather than just said “this and that” but he got “very tongue-tied”.
He said he does believe the abuse of power over racial bias “is a source of concern”, adding: “I’m not trying to trivialise it at all it was not my intention.”
At the pub evening in January last year, Mr Sharkey was also videoed speaking to the undercover journalist about who to bring into custody.
He said: “If it’s some office worker who has got his first bit of class A – I don’t say do this because I may have, may not have done it – ‘oh shit mate I’ve dropped it, oh f*** I’ve got no evidence now’.”
Mr Sharkey added that if it was someone with a criminal record it would be a different set of rules.
The former officer said he was not talking about himself but that he was telling a story from his probation days some 20 years ago, the panel heard.
“I had explained it incorrectly but that gave him the impression I had done it,” he said on Friday.
The panel found his comments amounted to a breach of the standards of professional behaviour in respect of authority, respect and courtesy, discreditable conduct and equality and diversity.
Mr Sharkey was also filmed making a sexual innuendo to colleagues but the panel did not find that the comment breached professional standards.
On October 1 last year Panorama aired footage that had been captured by an undercover BBC journalist working as a designated detention officer at Charing Cross police station custody suite.
Seven other police officers have been sacked after the BBC investigation.
Last year Pc Sean Park, Sergeant Lawrence Hume, Sergeant Clayton Robinson, Pc Jason Sinclair-Birt, Pc Philip Neilson, Pc Martin Borg and Sergeant Joe McIlvenny were dismissed without notice in separate hearings after it was found they had committed gross misconduct.
The hearing continues.

WASHINGTON
US President Donald Trump on Friday urged his Ukrainian counterpart Volodymyr Zelenskyy to move swiftly in negotiations with Russia.
"Russia wants to make a deal, and Zelenskyy's gonna have to get moving — otherwise he's going to miss a great opportunity. He has to move," Trump told reporters.
Russia and Ukraine held two rounds of US-mediated peace talks in Abu Dhabi, the capital of the United Arab Emirates, in January and earlier this month. As a result, they agreed to the first exchange of war prisoners in five months.
The Kremlin said on Friday that the next round of peace talks between Russia and Ukraine will take place on Feb. 17-18 in Geneva, Switzerland.

Türkiye reveals new prototypes of homegrown combat aircraft KAAN
Defense Industries chief states that country continues test and production preparations for KAAN
ANKARA
New prototypes of the homegrown combat aircraft KAAN, which will undergo testing during the development process led by Turkish Aerospace Industries (TAI), have made their debut.
The head of Türkiye's Secretariat of Defense Industries, Haluk Gorgun, visited the KAAN hangar on Friday to receive information regarding the latest developments.
Gorgun noted that the rollout of the aircraft intended for full-size static testing, alongside the first and second flight prototypes, represents a significant technical milestone.
The official emphasized that KAAN stands beyond a mere aircraft as a symbol of Türkiye’s engineering prowess and independent defense capabilities.
The primary objective of the project centers on indigenously developing a next-generation combat aircraft that will serve the Turkish Air Force for many years.
KAAN will feature advanced capabilities such as low observability, internal weapon bays, enhanced situational awareness and sensor fusion for superior performance in both air-to-air and air-to-ground missions.
Following the first flight of the initial prototype in 2024, development and production processes continue uninterrupted while simultaneously advancing operational capabilities for manned and unmanned fighter jets.
Gorgun explained that KAAN continuously enhances the country's defense and aviation infrastructure, elevating Türkiye into an elite league of global players, particularly through the ongoing development of a domestic engine.
The strategic program also serves as a catalyst that simultaneously strengthens the country's infrastructure, human resources and technological accumulation, he noted.
Authorities are rapidly carrying out preparations for mass production in parallel with the current testing phases as part of this critical technology initiative.
The domestic supply chain for KAAN currently consists of more than 5,000 employees working across over 300 companies in more than 20 cities, Gorgun said.

Chilling images from Nancy Guthrie's porch could hold valuable clues about the masked suspect
Those frightening images of a masked man on Nancy Guthrie’s porch could provide valuable clues to investigators
- Bookmark
The chilling videos of a masked man outside Nancy Guthrie’s home in Arizona before she vanished show just glimpses of the suspect, but for investigators they hold a mountain of clues.
And those images — from the suspect's gloves to his flashlight — could be what's needed to break the case.
“There’s a tremendous amount of information that this guy left,” said former FBI profiler Clint Van Zandt.
The FBI already has analyzed the videos from Guthrie's doorbell camera to identify the suspect's backpack, posting an alert on Thursday with a photo of the brand and model in hopes of narrowing down tips flooding the agency.
It has been nearly two weeks since the mother of “Today” show host Savannah Guthrie was believed to have been abducted.
Former criminal investigators say it's almost certain that authorities are building a physical and psychological profile of the suspect, using the footage released publicly on Tuesday that totals less than a minute.
Whether authorities recovered more footage isn't known, but technology will allow them to see more than meets the eye.
“Every single thing that is in the video is being digitally enhanced. Everything from the mask to backpack to the jacket,” said Ed Davis, the former Boston police commissioner during the marathon bombing and manhunt in 2013.
Here's what was captured in the footage and what clues each might yield:
The backpack
It probably didn't take long to pinpoint the type of backpack the suspect was wearing, Davis said.
Technology available today allows investigators to break down photos and videos to the pixel, he said, giving them images of the stitching and maybe the manufacturer or brand name.
The FBI described the backpack as a black, 25-liter “Ozark Trail Hiker Pack.”
The holster
The FBI says the man on Nancy Guthrie's porch was armed.
But the video shows he had an unusual holster setup, hanging over the middle of his waist and not on the side. It might be an indication that whoever it was has little experience with firearms.
“I've never seen anything like that,” Davis said.
The gloves
The footage gives a close-up view of the suspect trying to cover Guthrie's doorbell camera, first with a gloved hand and then with part of a plant ripped from the yard.
The black gloves appear to be thicker than most and shimmered in the light.
“I spend a lot of time in Home Depot, and I've never seen those gloves,” Davis said. “They're not very common.”
The clothes
The suspect's zip-up jacket, pants, shoes and mask don't immediately stand out. But identifying one or more of those items could be a key.
Because once that happens, investigators can start looking at where those items are sold and combing through receipts and store surveillance cameras, starting with stores in the Tucson area closest to Guthrie's home, said Van Zandt, who spent 25 years with the FBI.
Going through mounds of receipts and footage will take time and isn't something that would be done on most cases, but there's no shortage of people assigned to this one, he said. The Pima County Sheriff’s Department earlier this week said several hundred detective and agents have been assigned to the case.
“If all of the stars line up properly — and they rarely do — I find someone who was in there two weeks prior who bought the jacket, the shoes, the backpack all at the same time,” Van Zandt said.
The flashlight
In one of the videos, the suspect appeared to be holding a small flashlight in his mouth while in front of Guthrie's door.
Figuring out the type of flashlight might be difficult, but there's something else to look at there, said David Lyons, a former homicide detective and police commander in Lexington, Kentucky.
Not many people instinctively hold a flashlight in their mouth, but those who work in the trades might — such as an electrician or a plumber, he said.
“That’s a small thing,” he said. “But at the same time, down the road, it could be something.”
The movements
Every step and movement the suspect made on the porch is worth a close look — from the way he walked, to how he seemed unhurried and how he grabbed the plant from the yard, Lyons said.
All of that will likely be used by behavioral analysts to create a profile of the suspect, he said.
“That’s what this will come down to,” Lyons said. “Those small aspects added all together.”

To reach Mika's villa, located 16 kilometers southeast of Florence, we had to cross a fairy tale landscape – rolling hills dotted with cypress and olive trees, bumpy roads, erratic power lines and half-abandoned properties. We rang the intercom. A woman's voice greeted us warmly, speaking Italian with a strong Romanian accent. After passing through the unassuming gate, we came face to face – or rather, snout to nose – with two winged pigs painted on a wooden sign. "Pigs can fly," reads the sign above the two animals. For a moment, the scene felt hallucinatory. But the sign was a playful nod to the English expression "when pigs fly," the equivalent of the French saying quand les poules auront des dents – "when hens have teeth." In other words: something that will never happen.
Mika stands apart in a pop landscape often accused of uniformity. Defying marketing logic, his world tour – which stops at Paris's Accor Arena on Monday, February 16 – was announced well before the release of his seventh album, Hyperlove, at the end of January. This album tackles what most of his peers avoid like the plague: politics, a notoriously risky subject where there is so much to lose and so little to gain.

Trump Tells Zelensky to ‘Get Moving’ on Peace Negotiations

US President Donald Trump told reporters that President Volodymyr Zelensky was “going to have to get moving” on peace negotiations with Russia on Friday.
Ukraine has long engaged with efforts to negotiate a peace. In November 2025, a 28-point plan to end Russia’s full-scale war – drafted by the Trump administration with input from Kremlin officials – leaked to the press.

“Russia wants to make a deal, and Zelensky’s going to have to get moving, otherwise he’s going to miss a great opportunity. He has to move,” Trump said, according to AFP.
The last round of trilateral talks, hosted by Abu Dhabi, took place on Feb. 4-5. Although the talks resulted in the first prisoner exchange of 2026, there was little tangible progress towards a ceasefire.
While Ukrainian and US negotiators said the talks were constructive, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said earlier this week that the progress of talks had been overhyped – criticizing Washington for supposedly reneging on what Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin discussed at a summit in Anchorage, Alaska, last year.
Zelensky said Wednesday that territorial issues will be the central focus of the next round of negotiations. Territory has long been a sticking point, as Russia continues to demand Ukraine concede territory Russia has proved unable to win on the battlefield.
Zelensky, who is currently in Germany to attend the Munich Security Conference, has not responded directly to Trump’s comments. However, he said in a Telegram post that he had discussed “diplomatic work” during his meeting with German Chancellor Friedrich Merz.

“Ukrainians, along with all other Europeans, must be confident in their future and that Russian aggression will never happen again. I thank the partners who understand this and help.”
Also on Friday, Merz said in his opening remarks to the conference that the global rules-based order “no longer exists” – and that “the leadership claim of the US is being challenged, perhaps already lost.”

Knife-wielding Arc de Triomphe attacker dies after being shot by Paris police
A man who on Friday attempted to stab a French officer during a ceremony at the Arc de Triomphe monument in central Paris has died from his injuries after being shot by police. The suspect was released from prison in December after having served a 12-year sentence for terror-related charges.
A man wielding a knife and scissors was fatally shot by police in Paris on Friday when he tried to attack an officer during a ceremony at the city’s Arc de Triomphe monument, officials said.
The suspect, a French national born in 1978 who had previously been convicted in Belgium on terrorist-related charges, died at hospital from his injuries, the French counterterrorism prosecutor’s office said. Authorities did not release the suspect’s name.
The attacker targeted an officer who was guarding the ceremony for relighting the eternal flame honoring unknown soldiers at the Napoleon-era landmark, according to a Paris police official. Another officer shot the attacker, the official said. No bystanders or police officers were injured in the incident, the official said.

Before the suspect had died, the French counterterrorism prosecutor’s office said it had opened an investigation on charges of attempted murder “in connection with a terrorist enterprise.”
The assailant had been sentenced to 17 years in prison by a court in Brussels in 2013 for attempted murders in connection with a terrorist enterprise against three police officers in the Belgian city of Molenbeek the previous year, according to the prosecutor’s office.
First incarcerated in Belgium, he was then transferred to France in 2015 to serve the rest of his sentence. He was released from prison on Dec. 24, 2025, and had since been subject to judicial supervision and surveillance measures, the statement said.
The Arc de Triomphe is one of Paris’ most famous sites, and sits atop the busy Champs-Elysees avenue.
A large police presence was visible Friday evening near the monument, which was closed to the public. The traffic circle surrounding the Arc de Triomphe remained open to vehicles.
The nearby metro station was closed for security reasons at the request of police, Paris public transport operator RATP said.
French Interior Minister Laurent Nunez expressed his “full support to the officer who intervened and acted with composure and determination in the face of the terrorist threat,” in a message posted on X.

Trump orders 2nd aircraft carrier to Mideast amid Iran nuclear push

President Donald Trump said Friday he is deploying a second U.S. aircraft carrier to the Middle East as he intensifies pressure on Iran to reach a new agreement over its nuclear program.
The USS Gerald R. Ford, the world's largest aircraft carrier, is being sent from the Caribbean Sea to the Mideast to join other warships and military assets the U.S. has built up in the region. The planned deployment comes just days after Trump suggested another round of talks with the Iranians was at hand. Those negotiations didn’t materialize as one of Tehran's top security officials visited Oman and Qatar this week and exchanged messages with U.S. intermediaries.
"In case we don’t make a deal, we’ll need it,” Trump told reporters about the second carrier as he left the White House for a military base in North Carolina. He added, "It’ll be leaving very soon.”
Already, Gulf Arab nations have warned that any attack could spiral into another regional conflict in a Mideast still reeling from the Israel-Hamas war in the Gaza Strip. Meanwhile, Iranians are beginning to hold 40-day mourning ceremonies for the thousands killed in Tehran's bloody crackdown on nationwide protests last month, adding to the internal pressure faced by the sanctions-battered Islamic Republic.
The Ford, whose new deployment was first reported by The New York Times, will join the USS Abraham Lincoln and its accompanying guided-missile destroyers, which have been in the region for over two weeks. U.S. forces already have shot down an Iranian drone that approached the Lincoln on the same day last week that Iran tried to stop a U.S.-flagged ship in the Strait of Hormuz.
It is a quick turnaround for the Ford, which Trump sent from the Mediterranean Sea to the Caribbean last October as the administration built up a huge military presence in the lead-up to the surprise raid last month that captured then-Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro.
It also appears to be at odds with the Trump administration’s national security and defense strategies, which put an emphasis on the Western Hemisphere over other parts of the world.
In response to questions about the movement of the Ford, U.S. Southern Command said American forces in Latin America will continue to "counter illicit activities and malign actors in the Western Hemisphere.”
"While force posture evolves, our operational capability does not,” Col. Emanuel Ortiz, spokesperson for Southern Command, said in a statement. U.S. "forces remain fully ready to project power, defend themselves, and protect U.S. interests in the region.”
Trump, who is in Fort Bragg to celebrate members of the special forces who captured Maduro, warned Iran this week that failure to reach a deal with his administration would be "very traumatic.” Iran and the United States held indirect talks in Oman last week.
"I guess over the next month, something like that,” Trump said Thursday when asked about his timeline for striking a deal with Iran on its nuclear program. "It should happen quickly. They should agree very quickly.”
Trump held lengthy talks with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Wednesday and said he insisted to Israel's leader that negotiations with Iran needed to continue. Netanyahu is urging the administration to press Tehran to scale back its ballistic missile program and end its support for militant groups such as Hamas and Hezbollah as part of any deal.
The USS Ford deployed in late June 2025, which means the crew will have been deployed for eight months in two weeks time. While it is unclear how long the ship will remain in the Middle East, the move sets the crew up for an unusually long deployment.

US Secretary of State Marco Rubio addresses MSC amid transatlantic tensions
Top US diplomat Marco Rubio has started his highly anticipated speech at the Munich Security Conference, with top political and military leaders from Europe and other parts of the world attending the event.
US allies hope to gain a glimpse of Washington's future course on security amid Donald Trump erratic and occasionally hostile course threatening long-standing alliances.
You can watch Rubio's speech in the livestream window above.
Europe mulls self defense without the US ahead of Rubio speech
One of the first MSC panels held early on Saturday morning was "Hard Core Europe: Defending Ourselves Without the US?". With the US an increasingly unreliable partner — walking away from international agreements and threatening to annex territory belong to a fellow NATO member — European nations have been mulling ways reduce reliance on Washington for security.
The discussion came shortly ahead of a speech by US Secretary of State Marco Rubio. Ahead of his departure yesterday, Rubio warned European allies that a "new era" of geopolitics was beginning.
Chinese FM calls for closer economic ties with Europe
Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi said China and the EU should properly manage their differences during a meeting with his German and French counterparts on the sidelines of the MSC on Friday.
According to a readout published by Chinese state news agency Xinhua on Saturday morning, Wang said that "unilateralism, protectionism, and power politics" were on the rise globally and hoped that Europe would instead "pursue a rational and pragmatic policy towards China."
"China's development is an opportunity for Europe, and Europe's challenges do not come from China," Wang said.
Wang also held a separate meeting just with German Foreign Minister Johann Wadephul, in which he hailed economic and trade cooperation as "the cornerstone of China-Germany ties."
What happened at the MSC on Friday?
The Munich Security Conference kicked off on Friday with a speech by German Chancellor Friedrich Merz, who did not hold back in calling out a growing "rift" between Europe and the United States under President Donald Trump.
Merz said the post-World War II order, which had been shaped by US supremacy and Europe enjoying a "vacation from world history" under Washington's security umbrella, has come to an end.
He said Europe can come together and shape a new order.
"We are not at the mercy of this world, we can shape it," Merz said, arguing that Europeans can do so if they "step up together with determination and confidence in our own strengths."
At the same time Merz said the US and Europe need to "repair and revive trans-Atlantic trust together," while pointing out that the US "claim to leadership has been challenged, and possibly lost," warning of the rise of Russia and China.
"Merz's pointed analysis of how isolated Trump's aggressive take on trade and security has left the US was so blunt that it sounded like an insult," DW's Chief Political Editor Michaela Kuefner said at the conference.
Secretary of State Marco Rubio is representing the US at the conference, with a much-anticipated speech due for Saturday morning.
Before leaving for Munich, Rubio said ties between the US and Europe are facing a "defining moment."
"The old world is gone, frankly, the world I grew up in, and we live in a new era in geopolitics, and it's going to require all of us to re-examine what that looks like and what our role is going to be," he said.
Rubio added that the US is "deeply tied to Europe, and our futures have always been linked and will continue to be. We've just got to talk about what that future looks like."
Rubio met with Merz and a German delegation on Friday for closed door talks. The US top diplomat also met with Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi.
French President Emmanuel Macron closed out Friday's MSC with a speech emphasizing Europe's strengths, and urging Europeans not to "give in" to Russia's demands and "exhibit strength and tenacity on Ukraine."
"This is the right time for audacity. This is the right time for a strong Europe," Macron said.
UK's Starmer to call for closer UK-EU defense partnership
British Prime Minister Kier Starmer will call for deeper ties between the UK and the EU in his speech at the MSC on Saturday, according to notes released ahead of time by his office.
"We are not the Britain of the Brexit years anymore. Because we know that, in dangerous times, we would not take control by turning inward — we would surrender it. And I won’t let that happen," Starmer is expected to say on Saturday.
"There is no British security without Europe, and no European security without Britain. That is the lesson of history — and it is today’s reality too."
In his speech, Starmer will argue that European countries must shift away from being overdependent on the US for security, including with in the NATO alliance. He will call on European leaders to work together to build up "sovereign deterrence and hard power."
"As I see it — Europe is a sleeping giant. Our economies dwarf Russia’s, ten times over," the excerpt of Starmer's speech read.
"We have huge defense capabilities. Yet, too often, all of this has added up to less than the sum of its parts."
"Across Europe, fragmented industrial planning and long, drawn out procurement mechanisms have led to gaps in some areas — and massive duplication in others."
Zelenskyy awards Order of Freedom to disqualified Ukrainian athlete
Ukrainian athlete Vladyslav Heraskevych visited Munich on Friday night after he was disqualified from competing in the men's skeleton race event at the Milan Cortina Winter Olympics.
Heraskevych had worn a helmet featuring Ukrainian athletes who have been killed since the 2022 Russian invasion. The Court of Arbitration for Sport ruled on Friday that this violated Article 50 of the Olympic Charter which bans "political, religious or racial propaganda" at the event.
In Munich, Heraskevych was received by Ukrainian delegates on the sidelines of the MSC along with President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, who awarded him the Order of Freedom.
"Ukraine will always have champions and Olympians," Zelenskyy said on social media.
"But above all, Ukraine’s greatest asset is Ukrainians – those who cherish the truth and the memory of the athletes killed by Russia, athletes who will never compete again because of the Russian aggression."
WATCH: Ukrainian MP tells DW what Kyiv is looking for at this year's MSC
Yevheniia Kravchuk, a Ukrainian MP, said Ukraine is seeking to use the Munich Security Conference to deepen defense partnerships in Europe.
She told DW Kyiv can share hard-earned battlefield expertise as warfare evolves.
Rubio skips Ukraine meeting with European leaders
US Secretary of State Marco Rubio did not join a meeting on the sidelines of the MSC Friday attended by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and leaders of Ukraine's European partners.
US officials at the conference speaking to news agencies under condition of anonymity said Rubio's schedule "was packed with separate bilateral meetings" but that the secretary was discussing the Russia-Ukraine war "in many of his meetings."
Rubio met earlier Friday with German Chancellor Friedrich Merz, and discussed "Ukraine, the status of negotiations with Russia and further support for the country, particularly in terms of military aid," a German government source told AFP news agency.
A US official told Reuters news agency that Rubio is due to meet with Zelenskyy at the conference on Saturday.
US President Donald Trump is applying pressure on Ukraine's government to accept a deal to end the war, no matter how unfavorable the terms.
"Russia wants to make a deal, and Zelenskyy's going to have to get moving. Otherwise, he's going to miss a great opportunity," Trump said on Friday.
Conditions of previous deals seen as favorable to Moscow, including ceding territory to Russia without binding security guarantees from Western allies, have been unacceptable to Ukraine.
Rubio's speech on Saturday morning is the most anticipated event of the three-day conference. European leaders will be looking for signals that the US is still a committed strategic partner.
On Thursday before leaving for Munich, Rubio told reporters, "Europe's important to us" and the US is "deeply tied to Europe and our futures have always been linked and will continue to be."
WATCH: German Defense Minister Pistorius on new military spending
Defense Minister Boris Pistorius said Germany's boost in military spending is being welcomed on the other side of the Atlantic.
"We did everything we could do" Pistorius told DW at the Munich Security Conference. "I think the United States realizes that and acknowledges that."
Macron: Europe should not cave in to Russia's demands
French President Emmanuel Macron touched on Russia's invasion of Ukraine during his speech at the MSC.
Macron said Europe should not give into Russia's demands and should "exhibit strength and tenacity on Ukraine."
"I hear some leaders urging Ukraine to accept that they are defeated, overpraising Russia as well. This is a huge strategic mistake, because this is not the reality," Macron said.
Full Russian control of the eastern Ukrainian Donbas region has been included as part of previous peace deal drafts. Russian forces currently occupy a large section of the region, with incremental territorial gains continuing to come at a huge cost. Giving up the region in exchange for security guarantees would be seen as a major concession for Ukraine.
"This is the right time for audacity. This is the right time for a strong Europe," Macron said, while adding that more pressure should be put on Russia.
The French president said if there is a peace deal with Russia, Europe will have to create a new framework for coexistence.
"If we reach a settlement on Ukraine, we will still have to contend with an aggressive Russia," Macron said. "We will have to define rules of coexistence that limit the risk of escalation."
France's Macron: 'We should be proud of our European achievement'
French President Emmanuel Macrontold the MSC on Friday that Europe should be seen as a model for the rest of the world.
"Everyone should take their cue from us, instead of criticizing us," Macron said, referring to criticisms of Europe on issues such as free speech and migration.
"Everybody is asking Europe to be stronger, except for our adversaries and sometimes, less understandably, ourselves," Macron said, adding that Europeans need a "much more positive mindset."
"We need to be proud of our European achievement," Macron said, adding that Europeans "should be proud of ourselves." He said Europeans are "prone to playing themselves down."
Macron noted achievements such as freedom of movement and goods within the EU, and said Europe ranks high in areas such as life expectancy and health. He also said Europe invests in sciences and protects academic freedoms.
"Obviously, we have to fix a lot of things," Macron said, calling on Europeans to face their challenges and fix them. He urged Europe to become more of a "geopolitical power" on the world stage.
AOC: 'We need to have a working-class centered politics' to stave off authoritarianism
Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, a congresswoman from New York who belongs to the progressive wing of the Democratic Party, spoke at an MSC panel focusing on the "rise of populism."
Ocasio-Cortez was elected to Congress in 2018. She had defeated longtime congressman Joe Crowley in a Democratic primary in a shock win, causing a political earthquake in her party.
"When I was elected, the Democratic Party was telling working people 'everything is fine' when it wasn't. I campaigned on the pain points in my life," Ocasio-Cortez said, referring to promises such as raising the minimum wage and expanding public healthcare programs.
"If we are to succeed, if we are going to stave off authoritarianism, we need to have a working-class centered politics," Ocasio-Cortez said.
She said that "extreme levels of income inequality" leads to "social instability" and right-wing populism.
"It is of utmost urgency that we get our economic houses in order and deliver material gains for the working class — or else we will fall to a more isolated world, governed by authoritarians that also do not deliver for working people," Ocasio-Cortez said.
Ocasio-Cortez, like Gavin Newsom, is rumored to be considering a presidential run in the 2028 election.
UN will emerge 'stronger' after reforms, US diplomat says
US ambassador to the UN Michael Waltz defended US-initiated cuts and reforms to the UN, saying that Donald Trump was right to ask why the UN was not getting results in international crises.
"The UN will be stronger at the end of this process. The status quo was unsustainable and not working in places like Gaza or Azerbaijan-Armenia," Waltz an MSC panel dedicated to the changes to the global order.
Waltz also said that having more focused multilateral organizations, such as the new Board of Peace was "perfectly acceptable if we are getting the results."
Trump launched the Board of Peace during the Davos summit last month, expanding on the idea of a coalition of countries working together to resolve the Gaza conflict. The wider agenda and specific mechanisms of the new international body, however, remain unclear.
US allies such as Germany and France have outright refused to join it, while the UK left open the possibility of doing so in future.
California Governor Gavin Newsom: Trump climate policy is 'temporary'
California Governor Gavin Newsom, a Democrat, took part in an MSC panel titled "Playing with Fire: The Need for Decisive Climate Action."
During the discussion, Newsom harshly criticized US President Donald Trump's climate policy.
"I want to be clear: Donald Trump's administration is temporary. California's commitment is not," Newsom said in a post on X summarizing his comments on the panel. "He will be gone in three years. Our resolve to confront climate change is enduring and we remain a stable, reliable partner in that fight."
Newsom claimed that Trump is trying to recreate the 19th century and accused him of being a "wholly owned subsidiary of big oil, gas and coal." The 19th century was a time in the US when fossil fuels, in particular coal, fueled the industrial revolution.
Newsom said Trump took large amounts of money from the fossil fuel industry during the 2024 presidential election and, in return, is attempting to eliminate "all regulations in the United States of America."
His comments came one day after the Trump administration reversed an Obama-era finding that said carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases are harmful to human health. That finding allowed the Environmental Protection Agency to regulate carbon emissions to protect public welfare.
Newsom's appearance at the Munich Security Conference comes amid rumors that he is planning to run for the White House in the 2028 election.
AfD lawmakers attend Munich Security Conference
You may remember that US Vice President JD Vance sent shockwaves with his speech at last year's Munich Security Conference (MSC).
In it, he railed against what he described as an erosion of democratic norms across Europe, citing, among other things, the decision not to invite lawmakers from Germany's far-right Alternative for Deutschland (AfD) to the conference.
To add insult to injury, he later declined a meeting with then German Chancellor Olaf Scholz and instead met with the AfD's co-leader, Alice Weidel.
Coming in the middle of an election campaign, the move was widely seen as a significant breach of diplomatic decorum.
This year, Vance is not attending. The AfD, however, now the largest opposition party in the Bundestag, will be represented.
Three AfD lawmakers have been invited, although organizers stress they will not be "given a platform."
The party's defense policy spokesman, Ruediger Lucassen, told me he wants Germany to return to being a "leading European nation" by "taking on the main military burden on NATO's northeastern flank."
To that end, he said Germany should commit four army divisions, two helicopter squadrons and a cruiser squadron, while also developing deep-strike precision capabilities.
Smaller countries, he argued, should be able to rely on Germany. "Not a European army, but a European alliance ready for defense," he said.
Members of the AfD delegation are also said to be hoping for face time with the US delegation, though both sides are keeping any potential contacts discreet.
According to media reports, the AfD's foreign policy spokesman, Markus Frohnmaier, will travel to Munich for meetings with US officials on the sidelines of the conference, including at the State Department. I have been unable to independently confirm those reports.
Frohnmaier has been a key figure in strengthening ties between the AfD and the MAGA movement in recent months.
I understand that Weidel has no plans to make a spontaneous trip to Munich to meet the US Secretary of State, Marco Rubio.
Rubio is due to travel on to Hungary, where Weidel is a regular guest of Prime Minister Viktor Orban.

Two Brits among three killed in avalanche at French Alps ski resort
The Brits were reportedly part of a group of five people accompanied by an instructor

Two British men are among three people who were killed in an avalanche in the French Alps Friday.
The avalanche struck at around 11:30am (10.30am GMT) in the Val d’Isère ski resort in southeastern France.
A spokesperson from the slope management department at the resort confirmed that the third victim is a French national who was skiing alone.
The Brits were reportedly part of a group of five people accompanied by an instructor who were off-piste skiing, according to the BBC.
The cause of the avalanche wasn’t immediately known.
A red avalanche warning was issued Thursday across the Savoie region by Meteo-France, which is the national weather service.
The Val d’Isère ski resort’s website said off-piste skiing is “strongly discouraged” due to a “very high avalanche risk”.
An FCDO Spokesperson said: “We are aware of an accident in which two British men have died in France.
“We are in contact with the local authorities and stand ready to offer consular assistance”.

Diplomat overseeing Gaza ceasefire says violations threaten transitional governance
The top diplomat overseeing the U.S.-brokered ceasefire deal in Gaza said Friday that continued violations of the agreement pose major obstacles to the Palestinian committee expected to oversee postwar governance and reconstruction
- Bookmark
The top diplomat overseeing the U.S.-brokered ceasefire deal in Gaza said Friday that continued violations of the agreement pose major obstacles to the Palestinian committee expected to oversee postwar governance and reconstruction.
Nickolay Mladenov, who serves as high representative for Gaza for the U.S.-established Board of Peace, spoke during a panel discussion at the Munich Security Conference. The international board, established by U.S. President Donald Trump, is set to meet next week.
The transitional committee, made up of Palestinian administrators, has met in Egypt but has not yet entered Gaza. Mladenov said it won't be able to do its work unless Hamas, the militant group that has governed Gaza since 2007, hands over institutional control. He also called for more aid and improved security.
The agreement calls for Hamas to lay down its arms and for an international security force to be deployed, but there has been no visible progress on either. Israel has continued to carry out strikes in response to what it says are violations of the truce. Palestinian militants have also attacked Israeli forces.
“We need to make sure that what is happening now with the violations of the ceasefire stops,” Mladenov said. “We’re only embarrassing the committee and ultimately making it ineffective.”
Mladenov didn't lay out a specific timeline but said “all of this needs to move very fast.”
Ceasefire is aimed at ending 2-year war
Palestinian Foreign Minister Varsen Aghabekian Shahin, speaking at the same panel, said the timeline is key, adding that Gaza must not be severed from the Israeli-occupied West Bank. The Palestinian Authority wants to govern both territories ahead of eventual statehood, something to which Israel is adamantly opposed.
The Oct. 10 U.S.-brokered ceasefire deal attempted to halt a more than two-year war between Israel and Hamas.
While the heaviest fighting has subsided, the ceasefire has seen almost daily Israeli fire. Israeli forces have carried out repeated airstrikes and frequently fire on Palestinians near military- held zones. There have been 591 Palestinians killed, according to Gaza health officials.
The ministry, which is part of the Hamas-led government, maintains detailed casualty records that are seen as generally reliable by U.N. agencies and independent experts. But it does not give a breakdown of civilians and militants.
Militants have carried out shooting attacks on troops, and Israel says its strikes are in response to that and other violations. Four Israeli soldiers have been killed.
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu announced Mladenov, a Bulgarian diplomat, as the director-general of the board mean to oversee the implementation of the second and far more complicated phase of the ceasefire.
Dozens of Palestinians buried
The bodies of 53 unidentified Palestinians, along with 86 unidentified human remains, were laid to rest on Friday at a mass burial in a cemetery in central Gaza’s Deir Al-Balah.
Earlier this month, Israel transferred the bodies of 54 Palestinians and 66 boxes containing human remains, all unidentified, to Gaza via the Red Cross. Only one body was identified by a family, while the others were buried on Friday.
Israel gave no identification for the bodies and doesn’t allow DNA testing material into Gaza.
“A period of time is allotted for families to identify these bodies and remains. Unfortunately, none of these remains or organs were identified,” Ziyad Obeid, director of the cemeteries department at the Endowments Ministry, said from the burial site. ___

Senators urge Trump to scrap social media vetting for foreign tourists

- Democratic senators urged the Trump administration to abandon a proposal requiring visa waiver travellers to provide five years of social media handles.
- The US Customs and Border Protection policy targets visitors from 42 visa waiver countries for Electronic System for Travel Authorisation (ESTA) forms.
- Critics warn of "sweeping digital surveillance" and a "chilling effect", potentially causing billions in lost tourism revenue for the US.
AI generated
WASHINGTON - Two Democratic senators urged the Trump administration on Feb 13 to abandon a proposal to require millions of foreign visitors to provide social media handles used over the past five years.
The proposed policy from US Customs and Border Protection would require travellers from countries in the visa waiver programme to submit the social media data.
“By requiring travellers to disclose their personal social media information, CBP will force people who simply want to visit family in the United States, conduct business with US companies, or attend events such as the upcoming World Cup to submit to sweeping digital surveillance,” said Senators Ed Markey and Ron Wyden.
“No doubt many Americans would be outraged if countries such as Great Britain, France, or Australia imposed a similar policy on American tourists.”
The Department of Homeland Security did not immediately comment.
In December, the department said the proposal could take effect as early as this month.
Earlier, a group representing the US travel and tourism industry warned the proposal could have a “chilling effect” on visits to the US.
“If we get this policy wrong, millions of travellers could take their business and the billions of dollars they spend elsewhere, only making America weaker,” the US Travel Association said.
Applicants for immigrant and non-immigrant visas have been required to share that information since 2019.
Washington has taken steps to tighten vetting of foreigners, stemming from a Trump executive order issued in January 2025 calling for visitors to the US to be “vetted and screened to the maximum degree”.
The visa waiver programme allows travellers from 42 countries, mostly in Europe, to visit the US for up to 90 days without a visa. They must complete an Electronic System for Travel Authorisation (ESTA) form, which under the change would require social media handles.
The US is considering requiring all email addresses used over the last 10 years and names, birth dates, residences and birthplaces of parents, siblings, children and spouses.
The US State Department in December said it was requiring all H-1B applicants and their dependents to adjust the privacy settings on all of their social media profiles to “public” in order for the department to review social media posts by applicants. REUTERS

Canada school shooter’s online history shows fascination with violence and mass killings

Canada school shooter’s online history shows fascination with violence and mass killings
Jesse Van Rootselaar created a mall shooter game on Roblox and was active on forum where users shared images of gore and mass violence
- Bookmark
Before killing nine people in British Columbia, Canada, 18-year-old Jesse Van Rootselaar appeared to leave behind an extensive online presence that reflected her struggles with mental health and a growing fascination with mass violence and gore.
Tuesday’s mass shooting has devastated the small rural community of Tumbler Ridge, where Van Rootselaar is accused of killing her mother, 11-year-old stepbrother, five schoolchildren and an education assistant. The shootings happened at the family’s home and Tumbler Ridge Secondary School. Van Rootselaar, a former student at the school, died from a self-inflicted injury. Twenty-seven others were injured.
Her digital footprint appears to show a fascination with firearms, violence and previous mass shooters, as well as drugs and nihilistic content, often within dark and obscure internet forums, where users share and celebrate images of death.
She — police say Van Rootselaar was transgender and used she pronouns — appears to have created an account on the website WatchPeopleDie, an online forum where users share images of violent death and glorify mass shooters.
The Independent has also confirmed an account with Roblox, where she created a game that allowed players to simulate a mass shooting inside what appeared to be a shopping mall. The account and content has been removed.
In 2019, she created a Reddit account where she discussed suicidal thoughts, video games and gender transition; in 2023, Van Rootselaar started to socially transition and posted that she was on a six-month waiting list for hormonal treatment, though it is unclear whether she actually received medical gender-affirming care. Health authorities reported that Van Rootselaar was never enrolled in any inpatient care programs in the region.
In February 2023, Van Rootselaar posted that she started a fire in her house while high on psychedelic mushrooms. In that post, she also said she had been recently hospitalized for psychiatric care, was experiencing other mental health conditions, including depression, and received a diagnosis that she was on the autism spectrum.
Van Rootselaar also claims to be taking antidepressants and antipsychotic drugs.
An account on WatchPeopleDie included images and videos of firearms, though the account has since been removed by site moderators in the wake of the attack, according to an analysis from the ADL Center on Extremism.
The account includes many images of guns that were also visible in a Facebook post from the shooter’s mother. In 2021, her mother Jessica Jacobs — who appeared to use her maiden name, Strang, for herself and Van Rootselaar — said to “check out my oldest son Jesse Strang YouTube Channel.”
“He posts about hunting, self reliance, guns and stuff he likes to do,” she added.
Another image from her Facebook account in 2024 shows six guns with the caption “think it’s time to take them out for some target practice.”
Van Rootselaar’s minor’s firearms license expired that year, according to police.
On Reddit, Van Rootselaar posted an image of a Chinese Norinco SKS rifle, the same model that was also included in an image on her mother’s Facebook account.
That same firearm was included on the WatchPeopleDie website with an account using a similar username to one Van Rootselaar used on Reddit.
The account on the website — which has been linked to several school shooters — was immersed in videos of death and violence, commenting “I appreciate this post” on a thread that compiled footage of prior mass shootings.
“I love these first person perspective type videos, when the shooter records his or her own actions it’s always heat,” the account commented on another threat of shooting footage.
In August, the user posted that they found violent content “addictive.”
“I've tried to stray [sic] away from watching this type of thing before cuz it really sucks me in and is a massive useless time dump,” the account wrote, according to the ADL’s analysis.
“To say it ‘doesn’t effect [sic] me is likely naive,” the user added. “It just doesn’t feel like a big deal.”
The Independent has requested comment from the website.
Roblox confirmed to The Independent that Van Rootselaar’s account was removed February 11.
The mall shooting game could only be accessed through downloading a separate app used by developers to design games, and had only seven visits, according to a company spokesperson.
Van Rootselaar’s online presence reflects a pattern of online radicalization towards committing mass violence fueled by engagement with violent content, which experts and law enforcement officials are increasingly warning is a trend of online-driven “nihilism.”
Officials have not found a legible agenda behind a recent streak of high-profile killings and acts of political violence where assailants defied being neatly categorized into familiar ideologically- or racism-driven threats.
A recent wave of attackers instead broadly declared their contempt for humanity and welcomed the end of civilization.
“Although these subcultures can produce outcomes similar to ideologically-motivated extremism, their goals, worldviews and motivations differ from classic ideological movements,” according to a December report from the Institute for Strategic Dialogue. “This presents distinct challenges for prevention and safeguarding.”
The Department of Justice is also investigating what it has labeled Nihilistic Violent Extremism, while Canada labeled groups 764 and Maniac Murder Cult as terrorist entities, among a growing number of groups stemming from far-right accelerationist threats within the “Nihilistic Violent Extremism” ecosystem.
Such groups have proliferated online and spread globally, with arrests reported in at least 29 countries, according to a February report from the Global Network on Extremism and Technology, which reported on a trend of what it calls “post-ideological violence.”
“These communities glorify violence and its perpetrators while engaging in manipulative and coercive practices that draw young people into committing extreme acts of violence against others, animals, or themselves,” according to the report.
“While the full scope of this phenomenon … remains difficult to determine, the growing number of documented cases and victims underscores the urgent need for targeted and coordinated responses,” the group found.
In the aftermath of Tumbler Ridge shooting, social media also focused intensely on Van Rootselaar’s gender, a frequent phenomenon in the wake of recent mass shootings where users wrongly identify suspects as transgender.
Fewer than one in 1,000 mass shooters over the past decade have been identified as transgender, according to the Gun Violence Archive. The overwhelming majority of mass attacks are committed by cisgender men, while trans people are more than four times likely to be victims of violent crimes, including rape and sexual assault, according to the Williams Institute at UCLA School of Law.

Sybiha: We expect concrete decisions from Geneva talks, not history lectures
This was stated by Ukraine’s Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha during a discussion at the Munich Security Conference, an Ukrinform correspondent reports.
The head of Ukrainian diplomacy recalled that two rounds of trilateral talks have already taken place in Abu Dhabi and noted that, thanks to U.S. leadership, there is an opportunity to make progress. At the same time, he stressed that pressure on Russia must be increased in parallel, and that the necessary tools to do so are available.
Sybiha said he agrees with the assessment that there are currently no signs from the Russian side of any readiness for serious negotiations. By contrast, Ukraine has prepared realistic proposals.
“Of course, there can be no peace agreements at the expense of our territorial integrity and sovereignty. But in any case, if we are talking about a 20-point plan, three points remain that must be agreed at the leadership level, and we have workable proposals. We therefore very much hope that during the next round we will not hear any additional history lectures. This is not about the process – now is the time for action, for concrete and decisive steps,” Sybiha emphasized.
As previously reported by Ukrinform, the Ukrainian delegation led by Rustem Umerov, Secretary of the National Security and Defense Council of Ukraine, has already begun preparations for a trilateral meeting between representatives of Ukraine, the United States, and Russia, scheduled to take place in Geneva on February 17–18.
Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said that the Russian delegation at the next round of talks between Ukraine, the United States, and Russia in Geneva will be led by Russian presidential aide Vladimir Medinsky.

Gavin Newsom Says Trump is ‘Code Red’ For Climate Leadership

California’s Governor Gavin Newsom has called the current Trump Administration “Code Red” for American climate leadership. His comments come in response to President Donald Trump repealing the endangerment finding on Feb. 12, the landmark rule that gave the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) authority to regulate greenhouse gasses.
“Pollution is an act of theft in the health of a nation,” Newsom said during a panel at the Munich Security Conference on Friday, Feb. 13. “Never in the history of the United States of America has there been a more destructive president than the current occupant in the White House in Washington, D.C. He's trying to recreate the 19th century. He's a wholly owned subsidiary of big oil, gas, and coal.”
Newsom’s reaction echoed that of Former President Barack Obama who yesterday said that repealing the endangerment finding, which was established during his administration, would make the U.S. less safe, writing on social media, “Today, the Trump administration repealed the endangerment finding: the ruling that served as the basis for limits on tailpipe emissions and power plant rules. Without it, we’ll be less safe, less healthy and less able to fight climate change—all so the fossil fuel industry can make even more money.”

On the world stage, Newsom aimed to assure leaders that California, the fourth largest economy in the world, was not backing down from the climate fight. Greenhouse gas emissions in California have gone down 21% since 2000, and in 2023, the state was powered by two-thirds clean energy, making it the largest economy in the world to achieve this level.
Last week, in the face of the federal government’s efforts to support the electric vehicle industry, the governor announced a $200 million proposal to revive the state’s EV market, which would require automakers to match dollar-for-dollar state incentives. “What Donald Trump just did yesterday with the endangerment finding, by basically eliminating any federal regulations, not just on power plants, methane, but also tailpipe emissions, I think, was writing a death sentence to legacy American automobile manufacturers,” he said. “You talk about innovation, it's been California's regulation in this space that's driven manufacturing innovation that allows American automobile manufacturers to be competitive globally.”

Newsom, a 2028 presidential hopeful, argued that it is possible to make climate appeal to voters across parties in the next election given that many communities are already experiencing the impact of a warming planet, from wildfires to flooding. “Places, lifestyles, traditions are being wiped off the map. This issue has been brought home in a very personal way, not a political way,” he said. “It’s becoming uninsurable. This is an economic issue, not just a moral issue. It's not just a competitiveness issue, and so it's incredibly important that we talk in those terms to address some of the political dynamics.”

Despite federal rollbacks, Newsom assured the crowd that California will remain committed to the climate fight. “Donald Trump is temporary. He'll be gone in three years. California is a stable and reliable partner in this space, and it's important for folks to understand the temporary nature of this current administration in relationship [sic] to the issue of climate change and climate policy.”
He also urged corporate leaders to take a stand against Trump. “I think this is a moral moment across the board…We have to stand up with more clarity and conviction, and we have to be more consistent. People don't speak up because they're afraid of retaliation,” he said. “Well, you know, buck up.”

Rutte in Munich: Europe stepping up to lead NATO

04:19:11 KST

NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte has said European allies are increasingly taking a leadership role within the alliance, arguing that higher defence spending across NATO is strengthening the transatlantic relationship rather than weakening it.
Speaking at the Munich Security Conference following a NATO Defence Ministers meeting in Brussels, Rutte described what he called a “real shift in mindset” among allies, with European nations and Canada stepping up investment and assuming greater responsibility for their own defence.
“Yesterday we had the Defence Ministers session with NATO, and there was a real shift in mindset,” he said. “The Europeans now, all, and Canada, on 2%, and we agreed, of course, in The Hague… to reach the 5%.”
Rutte said the shift was not simply about meeting spending targets, but reflected a deeper political change in how European governments view their role in NATO. He suggested this would reinforce the US commitment to the alliance by addressing longstanding American concerns over unequal burden-sharing.
“What I was also seeing yesterday is this notion of Europe really stepping up, taking more of a leadership role within NATO, and also taking more responsibility for its own defence,” he said. “And I think this will only strengthen NATO.” He added that Europe’s increased spending would remove what he described as a persistent point of friction between Washington and its allies.
“I’m convinced it anchors the United States even more in NATO than it was already because of this dealing with this big irritant… of Europeans spending less than the Americans,” Rutte said. Asked about the role of the United States, Rutte insisted Washington remained fully committed to NATO’s collective defence posture, including its nuclear deterrent. “They are totally committed… both nuclear and conventional, to the Alliance,” he said.
Rutte also said the priority for allies remained continued military support to Ukraine, describing fresh funding commitments as “good news” but warning that more urgent assistance was still needed, particularly in air defence.
“One: good news, more money coming in to support Ukraine in the war effort, but we still need more,” he said. “Particularly, we need interceptors. We need the ammunition to make sure Ukraine can stay strong in the fight.”
During the exchange, he also rejected suggestions that Russia was winning in Ukraine, claiming Moscow’s progress was slow and coming at a heavy cost. “What I will also be doing today and tomorrow is make clear that the Russians are not winning this,” he said. “This so-called Russian bear is not there.”
Rutte described Russia’s battlefield movement as sluggish, while pointing to what he claimed were high monthly casualty figures. “It is basically the stilted speed of a garden snail what we are seeing in Ukraine,” he said. “Staggering losses, tens of thousands a month. 35,000 deaths in December, 30,000 deaths in January.”
He argued that Ukraine was making effective use of Western support, reinforcing the case for sustaining military assistance. “We have to keep Ukraine strong, because what we see is that they make the best use of our support,” he said.
Responding to questions about whether Europe could become militarily independent from the United States, Rutte said NATO’s core strength remained the transatlantic partnership, while acknowledging that allies were moving toward a more European-led model. “I think we all agree in NATO that we should stick together, the US and European and Canadian NATO,” he said. “But having said that, we also all agree that NATO should be more European-led.”
He cited Germany’s increased spending and deployments, alongside European purchases of US equipment for Ukraine, as evidence of that shift.
“We have seen, for example, Germany doubling his defence spending… A clear example of Europe stepping up,” he said, adding that Europe’s expanded role would develop gradually. “We will do this step-by-step, in close conjunction with United States, based on the defence planning process we have.”
Rutte also addressed a question on the reported deployment of Russian ballistic missile systems in Belarus, using it to reiterate the urgency of providing Ukraine with interceptors and counter-drone capabilities. “This is reason why I’m saying here today and tomorrow… we need to do even more,” he said. “Because when it comes to the interceptors to take out missiles… we need the counter drone technology.”
He said NATO allies should also expand cooperation with Ukraine’s defence industrial base, while continuing to rely on US-produced systems purchased through multinational funding mechanisms. “Making use of this essential gear coming out of the US, including, of course, PURL… which only the US can provide, paid for by Allies and partners,” he added.

Russia calls for exclusion of Europe from upcoming Ukraine peace talks

The Kremlin has clarified that the upcoming round of peace talks between Russia and Ukraine in Geneva, Switzerland, will be held strictly in a trilateral format, excluding any European representatives.
"No, it's only a trilateral format, meaning Russia, America, and Ukraine. There won't be any Europeans there," Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov told reporters on Friday in a briefing, dismissing the possibility of involvement of the EU or international organisations.
The talks, scheduled for Feb. 17-18, were previously confirmed by Peskov as the next step in a mediation process facilitated by Washington.
He added that Russia's delegation at the upcoming talks will be led by presidential aide Vladimir Medinsky.
Russia and Ukraine held two rounds of US-mediated peace talks in Abu Dhabi, the capital of the United Arab Emirates, in January and earlier this month. As a result, they agreed to the first exchange of war prisoners in five months.
Meanwhile, French President Emmanuel Macron said that once the conflict in Ukraine is settled, Europe will need to establish a new framework for living alongside Russia to prevent any future military escalation.
"If we reach a settlement on Ukraine, we will still have to contend with an aggressive Russia," he said at the Munich Security Conference. "We will have to define rules of coexistence that limit the risk of escalation."

Arundhati Roy boycotts Berlin fest premiere of her revamped 1980s cult classic – the film shows why

Arundhati Roy boycotts Berlin fest premiere of her revamped 1980s cult classic – the film shows why
Indian writer Arundhati Roy on Friday said she was withdrawing from the Berlin Film Festival over the jury president’s Gaza remarks. The award-winning author and activist was set to attend the world premiere of a restored version of 1989 cult classic “In Which Annie Gives It Those Ones”, which she wrote and starred in. The film provides hints of her unflinching courage, 37 years after its release.
Late one night in 1989, Indian audiences watching the national TV station were captivated when a film, the likes of which they had never seen, suddenly appeared on their screens.
The main actress in the film, "In Which Annie Gives It Those Ones", had an impish face dominated by expressive, kohl-lined eyes, and she carried herself with an insouciance that was thrilling. She was also the screenwriter of the peculiarly titled film, the maverick responsible for dialogues featuring a mix of Hindi and English (Hinglish), the patois of millions of educated urban Indians that was never deemed worthy of cinematographic attention.
“Arundhati Roy”, read the credits, an unknown name across the country back then. But her writing, as discerning viewers could tell, was electrifying.
The film is based on Roy’s student days at New Delhi’s School of Planning and Architecture. And while it’s fiction, there’s little doubt that Radha is a young Roy, displaying all the creativity, sharpness and courage that has marked her work as a writer and activist.
Eight years after the film's TV broadcast, Roy's novel, "The God of Small Things", won the Booker Prize. In addition to her writing, her fearless activism, run-ins with India’s Supreme Court, headline-grabbing jailing, and an array of awards made Arundhati Roy an international household name. Her latest memoir, "Mother Mary Comes To Me", hit bestseller charts in several countries and has been widely hailed by critics.
But the first film Roy ever wrote simply disappeared from the public eye. "In Which Annie Gives It Those Ones" won two National Film Awards when it was released in 1989, but there were no cinema screenings. In cinephile circles, it was assumed that the original 16mm film had gotten lost. That never diminished the movie’s popularity, instead helping propel it to cult film status. In the pre-internet era, video cassette (VHS) recordings of the original TV broadcast began to circulate. They were copied, borrowed, watched and rewatched until their degrading resolution made viewing virtually impossible.
The low-budget film had a scruffy, grainy quality which suited the story about student life at a Delhi architecture school in the 1960s. But before YouTube appeared and copies of the film were posted online, watching "In Which Annie Gives It Those Ones" required dedication.
Now, 37 years after its TV release, "Annie" – as it’s fondly known in cinema circles – has been restored and is having its world premiere at the 2026 Berlin Film Festival under the Berlinale Classics section on Monday, February 16.
Roy was supposed to attend the premier. But on Friday, the Indian author and peace activist suddenly announced that she will not be attending the Berlinale due to the festival jury’s comments regarding the war in Gaza.
On Thursday, Berlin Film Festival jury president Wim Wenders was asked about Germany's support for Israel despite accusations of genocide in Gaza. "We have to stay out of politics," the celebrated German director replied.
In her statement, Roy noted that, “What has happened in Gaza, what continues to happen, is a genocide of the Palestinian people by the State of Israel. It is supported and funded by the governments of the United States and Germany, as well as several other countries in Europe,” she said. “If the greatest filmmakers and artists of our time cannot stand up and say so, they should know that history will judge them. I am shocked and disgusted.”
Roy has never shied away from taking positions, criticising governments, institutions and individuals when they fail to stand up for human rights.
Traces of her unflinching courage are visible on screen in the first film she wrote and starred in 27 years ago.
‘This year’s bleeding-heart thesis’
Directed by Pradip Krishen, Roy’s longtime partner, the film tells the story of Anand “Annie” Grover – a hopelessly idealistic student at a state architecture institute who keeps on failing his final academic year.
Roy plays Radha, a non-conformist student thumbing her nose at societal norms requiring Indian women to be chaste, helpless and polite. She’s not afraid to take on authority, letting professors know exactly what she thinks of them and the commercial business of architecture. When the school’s principal, Yamdoot, dismisses her final project idea as, “This year’s bleeding-heart thesis” that is of no interest to the jury, she cheekily asks him if it’s because her thesis “questions the basis of their existence? Or your existence?” She also steals his cigarettes – and enjoys them.
In her memoir, "Mother Mary Comes To Me", Roy devotes an entire chapter to the film, which marked her debut as a writer. “We called it 'In Which Annie Gives It Those Ones'. In Delhi University slang, ‘giving it those ones’ meant ‘doing one’s usual shit’,” she writes. “It was never meant to be anything more than fun, fringe cinema. But when it finally showed on Doordarshan [India’s national TV channel], it got an audience of millions, which would otherwise have been impossible for a film like 'Annie'.”
"Annie" captures the zeitgeist of its time – the impact of which is felt to this day, particularly in a generation and segment of the Indian population that continues to criticise Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s Hindu nationalist policies. Roy is a vocal critic of the Modi administration’s assaults on human rights, free speech and secular principles.
In its form and content, "Annie" has all the makings of a cult film classic. “The film is honest in intent and execution, unafraid to poke fun at pretentiousness and authority, filled with lovable and relatable characters,” said Nandini Ramnath, a film journalist at Scroll India. “'Annie' was also quite pathbreaking in using the Indian English idiom. Here were students who looked and sounded like the film's viewers. They didn't sound like leftovers of British colonial rule. They didn't sound like they were parodying the language. Roy simply put into dialogue what she was hearing. Plus, she had and continues to have a great sense of humour, which courses through the film.”
Boxes of film history and a negative in archives
The film restoration chapter began a few years ago, when Shivendra Singh Dungarpur, founder-director of the Film Heritage Fund, a Mumbai-based NGO, heard that "Annie"’s director Krishen wanted to donate his film material. Following his years as a filmmaker, Krishen turned his attention in the 1990s to ecology and is now a leading Indian naturalist and environmentalist.
When Dungarpur flew to New Delhi to meet Krishen, he was shown a treasure trove of film history. “All these boxes were lying with all that material,” he told FRANCE 24 in a phone interview from the Berlin Film Festival days before the premier. “We started going through the scripts, photographs, notebooks, all the documentations, clapboards… and the original script of 'Annie' – not the one Arundhati wrote, which she has, but Pradip’s original script,” he noted.
While the low-budget film was shot in 16mm, Dungarpur was given a 35mm copy of the original. “When I went back, I started seeing the film on the rewinding table, and those images, the film, everything just kept coming back to me. The print didn't look that great, and I said, what about the negative?” he recounted.
When Dungarpur called Krishen, he was informed that the 16mm negative was sitting in the National Film Archive of India, and no one had any idea about its state. The Film Heritage Fund got the negative out of the archive and watched it with trepidation. “It was damaged a bit, the colours had faded, there were scratches, the sound was a mono sound. We knew that there was a lot of work on the restoration, a lot of tedious work, and I then decided that I must restore this film,” said Dungarpur.
A filmmaker himself, Dungarpur understood the cultural value of the project when he got down to the restoration work. It took a year and a half to complete, including work done at Italy’s L’Immagine Ritrovata laboratory in Bologna. “We had to do colour corrections, the subtitles had to be done because the subtitles have to be correct, and it was just one thing after the other,” he explained.
The effort was worth it, according to Ramnath. “What is nice about the restored 'Annie' is how it captures the original's graininess, the seedy interiors of the college hostel, the general cheerful chaos of the student dorms while also being sharper and brighter,” she noted.
For Dungarpur, it was a labour of love. “Whenever you restore any film, the first thing you want is that people see it,” he said. “You want the younger generation to see it, to discover it.”
The generation of "Annie" fans who watched the original 1989 broadcast have long acknowledged that the film is a record of a more tolerant time in India. They once believed it was a niche film, set in a specific context for a specific audience. But as cultural borders blur and the world enters a more divisive era, perhaps "Annie" has one of those for everyone.

Rubio skips Ukraine meeting with European leaders in Munich, FT says
US Secretary of State Marco Rubio has cancelled his attendance at a meeting with European leaders on the Russo-Ukrainian war at the last minute.
Source: Financial Times, as reported by European Pravda
Details: The so-called Berlin-format meeting, which took place on the sidelines of the Munich Security Conference, was attended by European, EU and NATO leaders and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.
Rubio had been expected to join the discussions, but he cancelled at the last minute due to "scheduling conflicts".
"The secretary won't be attending the Berlin Format meeting on Ukraine given the number of meetings he has happening at the same time. He's engaging on Russia-Ukraine in many of his meetings here in Munich," a US official said.
One European official told the Financial Times the situation was "insane", while another politician said the meeting "lacked substance" without Rubio's participation.
Background:
- Before the Munich Security Conference, Rubio had said that he might meet Zelenskyy there.
- Rubio is also scheduled to speak at the conference on Saturday and has said he hopes his message will be "well received".

- Democratic senators urged the Trump administration to abandon a proposal requiring visa waiver travellers to provide five years of social media handles.
- The US Customs and Border Protection policy targets visitors from 42 visa waiver countries for Electronic System for Travel Authorisation (ESTA) forms.
- Critics warn of "sweeping digital surveillance" and a "chilling effect", potentially causing billions in lost tourism revenue for the US.

WASHINGTON - Two Democratic senators urged the Trump administration on Feb 13 to abandon a proposal to require millions of foreign visitors to provide social media handles used over the past five years.
The proposed policy from US Customs and Border Protection would require travellers from countries in the visa waiver programme to submit the social media data.
“By requiring travellers to disclose their personal social media information, CBP will force people who simply want to visit family in the United States, conduct business with US companies, or attend events such as the upcoming World Cup to submit to sweeping digital surveillance,” said Senators Ed Markey and Ron Wyden.
“No doubt many Americans would be outraged if countries such as Great Britain, France, or Australia imposed a similar policy on American tourists.”
The Department of Homeland Security did not immediately comment.
In December, the department said the proposal could take effect as early as this month.
Earlier, a group representing the US travel and tourism industry warned the proposal could have a “chilling effect” on visits to the US.
“If we get this policy wrong, millions of travellers could take their business and the billions of dollars they spend elsewhere, only making America weaker,” the US Travel Association said.
Applicants for immigrant and non-immigrant visas have been required to share that information since 2019.
Washington has taken steps to tighten vetting of foreigners, stemming from a Trump executive order issued in January 2025 calling for visitors to the US to be “vetted and screened to the maximum degree”.
The visa waiver programme allows travellers from 42 countries, mostly in Europe, to visit the US for up to 90 days without a visa. They must complete an Electronic System for Travel Authorisation (ESTA) form, which under the change would require social media handles.
The US is considering requiring all email addresses used over the last 10 years and names, birth dates, residences and birthplaces of parents, siblings, children and spouses.
The US State Department in December said it was requiring all H-1B applicants and their dependents to adjust the privacy settings on all of their social media profiles to “public” in order for the department to review social media posts by applicants. REUTERS

US judge orders Trump administration to facilitate deported college student's return
Sign up now: Get ST's newsletters delivered to your inbox
BOSTON, Feb 13 - A U.S. federal judge on Friday ordered the Trump administration to facilitate the return of a Honduran college student who was deported in violation of a court order, a step the government had previously refused to take.
Boston-based U.S. District Judge Richard Stearns gave the administration two weeks to enable the return of Any Lucia Lopez Belloza, a student from Babson College in Massachusetts who was deported after being detained at Boston's Logan Airport while traveling to spend the Thanksgiving holiday with her family in Texas.
"Wisdom counsels that redemption may be found by acknowledging and fixing our own errors," Stearns wrote. "In this unfortunate case, the government commendably admits that it did wrong. Now it is time for the government to make amends."
Stearns, who was appointed by Democratic President Bill Clinton, said he had hoped to avoid holding anyone in civil contempt by giving the administration a chance to correct what it called a "mistake."
But the State Department last week called the judge's recommendation to issue her a new student visa "unfeasible," and U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement declined to facilitate her return, prompting Friday's order.
The U.S. Department of Homeland Security, which includes ICE, and Lopez Belloza's lawyer did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
The 20-year-old college freshman is a Honduran national who was brought to the U.S. by her mother, who was seeking asylum, when she was 8 years old. Babson is located in Wellesley, Massachusetts.
Lopez Belloza has said she was unaware she was subject to a final order of removal, which was the basis for her arrest.
She was flown to Honduras on November 22 even though her lawyer had secured a court order in Massachusetts on the previous day barring Lopez Belloza from being deported or transferred out of the state for 72 hours. She remains in Honduras with her grandparents.
A lawyer for the government at a hearing last month apologized for the violation of the court's order, attributing it to a "mistake" by an ICE officer who did not properly flag it. REUTERS

Shelly Desai death: It’s Always Sunny in Philadelphia actor dies aged 90
Mumbai-born actor was also known for his work in ‘Men of a Certain Age’

Shelly Desai, the character actor best known for his appearances on the hit sitcom It’s Always Sunny in Philadelphia, has died. He was 90.
The Mumbai-born actor earned over 90 screen roles, including the Ray Romano-led drama Men of a Certain Age.
His death was announced on Facebook by his stepdaughter, Dawn Lerman Vaccaro, who wrote: “The kindest person in the world passed away today. I am beyond heartbroken. He was my mother Phyllis's husband, soul mate, my stepfather, my kid’s grandfather and my cheerleader for all my creative projects.”
She added: “Besides his friends and his family, the thing he cared most about was acting and charity.”
In a follow-up post, she added: “He was that guy if you watched enough TV, films, or plays, you saw him — and said it: ‘Oh, that guy.’ With over 92 credits, he was a completely memorable character actor who could walk into a scene, raise one eyebrow, and suddenly everyone else had to work harder. That’s how he showed up for his friends and family, too.”
No cause of death has been announced.
Desai was born in Mumbai, then known as Bombay, on December 3, 1935. He moved to the United States in the 1960s to study engineering, but soon found he preferred to act.
By the 1970s he had appeared on Broadway, and won a small on screen role in Brian De Palma’s 1974 musical film Phantom of the Paradise.

Another fast food chain plans to close hundreds of locations across US
- Fast-food giant Wendy's is undertaking a significant restructuring, including the closure of hundreds of its US restaurants.
- The company plans to shut between 5 per cent and 6 per cent of its US outlets, equating to 298 to 358 locations, in the first half of this year.
- This strategic shift follows a disappointing fourth-quarter performance, with global same-store sales plummeting by 10 per cent.
- Wendy's aims to attract 'inflation-weary customers' by intensifying its focus on value deals, such as the new permanent 'Biggie Deals' menu.
- Despite challenges, the company projects global systemwide sales to remain flat this year, and its shares rose by nearly 5 per cent following the announcement.

AOC accuses Trump of trying to usher in ‘age of authoritarianism’ at Munich conference

Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez has accused Donald Trump of tearing apart the transatlantic alliance with Europe and of seeking to introduce an “age of authoritarianism”, as she condemned his administration’s foreign policy in front of its allies’ top policymakers at the Munich Security Conference.
Speaking at a panel on populism on Friday, Ocasio-Cortez outlined what she called an “alternative vision” for a leftwing US foreign policy, challenging the Trump administration’s shift to the right in front an audience of US allies who have grown increasingly wary of the US’s increasingly nationalist – and militaristic – global posture.
In her remarks, Ocasio-Cortez said Trump and Marco Rubio, the secretary of state, were “looking to withdraw the United States from the entire world so that we can turn into an age of authoritarianism”, as they sought to “carve out a world where Donald Trump can command the western hemisphere and Latin America as his personal sandbox, where Putin can saber rattle around Europe and try to bully our own allies there”.
She also condemned the US capture of Venezuela’s Nicolás Maduro, Trump’s threats to annex Greenland and the US support for Israel’s war on Gaza.
Ocasio-Cortez, one of the most prominent progressive figures in US national politics, traveled to Munich as an apparent counterweight to Rubio, who is due to address the high-profile gathering of leaders and top ministers on Saturday, and said he would tell them the “old world is gone … and we live in a new era in geopolitics”.
JD Vance, the vice-president, stunned the gathering last year as he delivered a full-on assault on Europe for “retreating from its fundamental values” and then met with the leader of the far-right German party, Alternative für Deutschland.
Appearing at a panel called “Vox Populi? Responding to the Rise of Populism”, Ocasio-Cortez decried the US-led war against Iraq as well as the development of the North American Free Trade Agreement (Nafta), calling instead for foreign countries to engage in a “working-class-centered politics” that would help “stave off the scourges of authoritarianism”.
“I believe we’re seeing in economy across economy around the world, including the United States, that extreme levels of income inequality lead to social instability and drives in the sense in authoritarianism, rightwing populism and very dangerous domestic internal politics,” Ocasio-Cortez said during the panel, which also included European and Latin American lawmakers, as well as Petr Pavel, the Czech president.
Ocasio-Cortez also said that she and her fellow Democrats were calling for a return to a “rules-based order” without the “hypocrisies” of US foreign policy that have dominated the past and current administrations.
“Whether it is kidnapping a foreign head of state, whether it is threatening our allies to colonize Greenland, whether it is looking the other way in a genocide, hypocrisies are vulnerabilities, and they threaten democracies globally,” she said.
Ocasio-Cortez’s visit to Munich comes amid a government shutdown in the US that saw some US lawmakers cancel their plans for travel.
Ocasio-Cortez was scheduled to appear later in a panel on the “future of foreign policy”. During her remarks, she said that the international tide in authoritarianism had been fueled “not just by income inequality, but the failure of democracies over decades to deliver, the failure to deliver higher higher wages, the failure to rein in corporations”.
“This is a moment where we are seeing our presidential administration tear apart the transatlantic partnership,” she said. “What is happening is indeed very grave, and we are in a new era, domestically and globally … But that does not mean that the majority of Americans are ready to walk away from a rules-based order and that we’re ready to walk away from our commitment to democracy.”

Trump planning to shake up RFK Jr’s leadership team to promote his healthcare priorities before midterms: report
The reported leadership shuffle includes an official leading the administration’s Minnesota fraud crackdown
- Bookmark
- CommentsGo to comments
The Trump administration is reportedly looking to change up the top leadership at the Department of Health and Human Services ahead of the midterms.
HHS Deputy Secretary Jim O’Neill and General Counsel Mike Stuart are expected to leave their roles, Politico reported.
The changes are part of an attempt at “muscling up the management team” to emphasize President Trump and HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s signature Make America Healthy Again policies, such as rolling out new healthy-eating guidelines and reducing drug prices.
“What basically happened was that HHS Secretary Kennedy, and also the White House, realized that we want to be most efficiently and most effectively implementing that policy and moving the needle on these issues that we see as very clear and unambiguous wins for us,” a White House official told the outlet. “And obviously the polling and such is very clear on these topics as well.”
The administration reportedly saw O’Neill as a poor communicator who hadn’t found his fit within HHS, an insider told CNN.
Both officials are reportedly expected to be offered other jobs within the administration.
O’Neill, currently Kennedy’s second in command at HHS, has been attached to some of the administration’s more divisive health policy moments.
The official, who does not have a formal medical or public health background, took over as interim leader of the Centers for Disease Control after the August ouster of Dr. Susan Monarez, who said she was pressured to pre-approve controversial vaccine recommendations and fire career scientists.
More recently, O’Neill has been one of the public faces of the administration’s attempt to freeze child care funding to states in the wake of a conservative influencer’s allegations of mass fraud at day care centers in Minnesota.
GOP insiders reportedly see so-called MAHA voters as a key voting bloc ahead of the midterms and want the administration to emphasize its more palatable health goals, like healthy eating, rather than Kennedy’s more divisive vaccine skepticism.
"While the MAHA agenda is broadly popular in the area [of] food and agriculture, vaccine skepticism stands as an outlier, rejected by most voters even within the MAHA movement," according to a recent memo obtained by Axios regarding polling of voters in competitive House districts.

AOC says Trump is ‘tearing apart transatlantic partnership’ between US and Europe
The congresswoman said that the U.S. president is looking to command the western world ‘as his personal sandbox’

US congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez has said that President Donald Trump’s administration is “tearing apart the transatlantic partnership” as its relationship with Europe remains strained.
The New York Democrat, who is a potential 2028 presidential candidate, told the Munich Security Conference: “President Trump has withdrawn from and is looking to withdraw the US from the entire world and turn into an age of authoritarianism to carve out a world where Donald Trump can command the western world and Latin America as his personal sandbox."
Speaking alongside other world leaders, including Czech president Petr Pavel, Ms Ocasio-Cortez called for a return to “rules-based order” and to address hypocrises.
She said: “I think this is a moment where we are seeing our presidential administration tear apart the transatlantic partnership, rip up every democratic norm, and … really calling into question, as was mentioned by Mark Carney at the World Economic Forum, the rules based order that we have, or, question mark, do we have?
“But that does not mean that the majority of Americans are ready to walk away from a rules-based order and that we’re ready to walk away from our commitment to democracy.
“I think what we identify is that in a rules-based order, hypocrisy is vulnerability.”
Taking direct aim at Trump’s record during his first year in office of his second term, she referenced his threats to Denmark and his recent capturing of Venezuela’s president Nicolas Maduro.
She said: “And so I think what we are seeking is a return to a rules-based order that eliminates the hypocrisies … when, too often, in the West, we’d look the other way for inconvenient populations to act out these paradoxes, whether it is kidnapping a foreign head of state, whether it is threatening our allies to colonise Greenland, whether it is looking the other way in a genocide.
“Hypocrisies are our vulnerabilities and they threaten democracies.
“And so I think many of us are here to say we are here and we are ready for the next chapter, not to have the world turn to isolation, but to deepen our partnership on greater and increase commitment to integrity to our values.”
Europe has been left reeling from Trump’s more aggressive foreign policy in his second term, forcing a reassessment of global alliances. This has included threats of annexing Greenland, the resource-rich island which is part of Denmark (a Nato member), while his representative at peace talks between Ukraine and Russia – Steve Witkoff – has consistently taken Moscow’s side.
US vice-president JD Vance’s criticism of European countries, including the UK, over free speech and immigration last year set the tone for a dramatic deterioration in relations, which has also seen multiple threats of tariffs on the EU bloc.
It follows comments from California’s Democrat governor Gavin Newsom earlier on Friday, who told the conference that Trump is “doubling down on stupid”.
Mr Newsom, who is also said to have presidential ambitions and has been in a long-lasting dispute with Mr Trump, said: “Never in the history of the United States of America has there been a more destructive president than the current occupant in the White House in Washington, DC.”
In a conversation that was largely focused on climate change, he said that Trump “is trying to recreate the 19 century.”
“We’re proving at scale that we can implement, we can compete and we can dominate, but Donald Trump is trying to turn back the clock.”
He added:“I hope, if there’s nothing else I can communicate today, Donald Trump is temporary. He’ll be gone in three years.”
He also called on other world and corporate leaders to “call out” the U.S. president, stating: “We’re all becoming Chamberlains in this place, corporate leaders have to stand up.”
Sir Keir Starmer will address the conference on Saturday morning and take part in a moderated conversation titled “Principled and pragmatic: wielding power in a world in disarray” with European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen.
He is expected to call for the bloc to move away from its over-dependence on Washington, while his German counterpart, Freidrick Merz, said that the United States’ “claim to leadership is disputed, perhaps squandered”.

Zelenskyy Meets Son Of Iran's Last Shah In Show Of 'Support'

MUNICH -- Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has met Reza Pahlavi, the exiled son of the last shah of Iran -- an extremely rare meeting at such a level for the former crown prince who is one of many figures vying for prominence among the fractured Iranian opposition in exile.
The meeting took place on February 13 during the Munich Security Conference, where Zelenskyy will deliver a major speech and is holding a series of meetings with foreign leaders.
Pahlavi is not reported to have any similar meetings in Munich planned.
'It's From The Heart'
Video shot by Ukrainian public TV showed the two men shaking hands in a wood-paneled room and then sitting at a table. Pahlavi thanked Zelenskyy for voicing support for Iranian protesters during his speech at the recent World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland.
“Sometimes [it is] very important to give strong support in time, when it's important, not after,” Zelenskyy said. “It’s from the heart.”
Security forces killed thousands of people during mass protests in Iran in January, according to reports, prompting strong condemnation from Washington and its allies.
This includes Zelenskyy, who in January declared that “every decent person on this planet sincerely wishes that the people of Iran would finally be freed from the current regime, which has brought so much evil to Ukraine and other countries."
Zelenskyy was clearly referring to Iran’s support for Russia’s war effort, notably through the supply of Shahed attack drones that have caused widespread death and destruction in attacks on civilian targets across Ukraine.
But while the United States has supported Iranian protesters, it has not endorsed Pahlavi or any other leaders in exile -- although Pahlavi has repeatedly called for intervention in Iran by US President Donald Trump.
For Pahlavi, the meeting with Zelenskyy may be a way to try to boost his chances of gaining wider international recognition. Over the last three years, he has met lawmakers from some Western European countries.
In January, Trump said Pahlavi "seems very nice." But the US leader also expressed uncertainty over whether Pahlavi would be able to muster support within Iran to eventually take over.
Shortly before Pahlavi met with Zelenskyy, there was a small but vocal demonstration outside the conference center by a rival opposition group, the National Council of Resistance of Iran, which denounced both the current Iranian authorities and the idea of monarchist rule.
Speaking to Zelenskyy, Pahlavi said the situation in Iran was similar to that faced by Ukraine -- which has been fighting a full-scale Russian invasion since February 2022.
“We have pretty much the same predicament,” he said, “fighting for independence and sovereignty.”
US Strike Force
US naval forces remain poised within striking distance of Iran in one of the biggest US military buildups in the region in years. Trump has voiced support and encouragement for Iranian protesters and signaled that US forces might intervene to protect them.
However, talks between US and Iranian negotiators appear to be more focused on other issues, such as Iran’s nuclear and missile programs, and its network of proxy forces in Lebanon, Iraq, and Yemen.
The Iran talks and the prospect of US military action is a major topic of discussion here at the Munich conference.
“I don't have much hope for diplomacy to the extent that it ends up curtailing Iran's nuclear program while continuing to give them access to some level of enrichment,” US Senator Chris Murphy (Democrat) told RFE/RL.
“Why did he throw out the agreement that did exactly that?” he asked, referring to a nuclear deal agreed upon during the Obama administration that Trump withdrew from during his first term of office.
Later, during a panel discussion, US Senator Lindsey Graham (Republican) said the dispute is not just about the nuclear program, missiles, or proxies.
“President Trump gave an answer, [saying to Iranians] keep protesting, help is on the way. And a couple of days later, he said, it's time for new leadership in Iran because the ayatollah and his crowd, they're bad guys, they're terrible guys. You put all three of those statements together then what do you have? You have a president standing with the people,” he said.
“I am confident that President Trump will get an outcome consistent with those three statements through diplomacy or military force,” Graham added.

Indian man accused of plot to assassinate US activist pleads guilty

The Indian man who US prosecutors accused of plotting to kill a prominent US-based activist after being recruited by an agent of the Indian government has pleaded guilty to three criminal charges, according to a spokesperson for the US attorney’s office in Manhattan.
Nikhil Gupta faces a maximum 40 years in prison after he pleaded guilty to murder-for-hire, conspiracy to commit murder-for-hire, and money-laundering charges in connection to the failed attempt to assassinate Gurpatwant Singh Pannun, a US resident who is an advocate for a sovereign Sikh state in
northern India.
“Nikhil Gupta plotted to assassinate a US citizen in New York City,” said US attorney Jay Clayton. “He thought that from outside this country he could kill someone in it without consequence, simply for exercising their American right to free speech. But he was wrong, and he will face justice. Our message to all nefarious foreign actors should be clear: steer clear of the United States and our people.”
James Barnacle, the FBI assistant director in charge, added that Gupta had worked “at the direction and coordination of an Indian government employee”.
Pannun, who serves as a lawyer at a New York-based group called Sikhs for Justice, said in a statement that the guilty plea was “judicial confirmation” that the Indian government of Narendra Modi orchestrated an assassination plot on American soil.
“The Indian government targeted an American citizen for exercising first amendment rights – organizing the Khalistan referendum, a peaceful political campaign advocating self-determination for Punjab … The Modi government’s transnational assassination plots to silence dissenting political opinion is an act of terrorism and attack on America’s sovereignty,” he said.
The news marks a stunning development in a case that began in June 2023, when another high-profile Sikh activist named Hardeep Singh Nijjar was shot dead outside a Sikh temple in British Columbia, Canada. Justin Trudeau, who served as Canada’s prime minister at the time, said months after the murder that there were “credible allegations” that agents of the Indian government had carried out the killing.
India called the accusation “absurd” and politically motivated. But Trudeau’s allegation gained credibility in November that year, when the US attorney’s office in New York unsealed an indictment against Gupta, and announced he was being extradited back to the US from the Czech Republic.
Gupta was described at the time as an Indian national who resided in India and was an associate of an Indian government official – later identified as Vikash Yadav – who had recruited Gupta to orchestrate the assassination of Pannun, an American citizen, on US soil.
Yadav was also indicted but remains at large and is a subject of a federal arrest warrant.
When Gupta contacted an individual to carry out the murder, he believed he was contacting a criminal associate. In fact, the individual was a described as a confidential source working with the US Drug Enforcement Administration, US prosecutors said.
India’s government has dissociated itself from any plot against
Pannun, saying it was against government policy, according to Reuters.
In his statement, Pannum said: “The Modi government’s claim that [the] murder-for-hire conspiracy was the act of a ‘rogue agent’ collapses under the weight of the evidence presented in federal court.”
The news follows a significant development in US-India relations earlier this month, after Donald Trump claimed that India had agreed to stop buying Russian oil and that he agreed to cut US tariffs on India exports. In a post, Trump called the Indian prime minister, Narendra Modi, “one of my greatest friends”. US officials have said that there is no evidence that Modi was aware of the plot, the New York Times reported.

Three costly retirement regrets in your 70s and 80s - and how to avoid them

Three costly retirement regrets in your 70s and 80s - and how to avoid them
‘Having a comprehensive plan is rarely something anyone regrets,’ one expert said
- Bookmark
- CommentsGo to comments
For all the planning that comes with retirement, certain decisions can fall through the proverbial cracks.
When those cracks widen to a financial gap in retirement for those in their 70s and 80s, regret over missed opportunities can emerge. Instead of enjoying time with grandkids or pursuing travel dreams, retirees may have to work through a maze of tax regulations and income possibilities, for example, to bridge the gap created by choices made (or not made) decades ago.
“Having a comprehensive plan is rarely something anyone regrets,” Virginia-based financial adviser Jeffrey B. Smith, owner of retirement planning firm The Retirement Smith, said in an email to The Independent. “Not having one almost always is.”
The Independent spoke with several financial experts to learn which regrets are common among retirees in their 70s and 80s and how to avoid them.
Not planning for incapacitation
The financial and personal implications of death tend to be front-of-mind for retirees but not what might happen if they become so ill they can no longer make decisions. And when they lose agency to an illness or accident, regret surges, said attorney Lisa McCurdy, CEO of estate and asset protection law firm The Wealth Counselor.
“When no one has been legally appointed to make financial or health care decisions on your behalf, and you lose cognitive ability or become incapacitated, your family is left scrambling,” McCurdy told The Independent by email. “That regret is profound, and it's entirely preventable.”
To prevent this, those looking toward retirement or who are already retired and healthy should assign two legal documents: a durable power of attorney for finances and a healthcare power of attorney or advance medical directive.
The former lets you choose a trusted person to manage your finances if you’re incapacitated, and the latter lets you choose someone to make decisions about things such as medical procedures, medications, authorize medical procedures, approve medications and direct how funds are spent for long-term care, McCurdy said.
“Doing this while you have full capacity means you choose the decision-makers, not a courtroom during a crisis,” she said.
Not saving enough
While the average retiree believes they need more than $800,000 to retire comfortably, they typically only have around $290,000 set aside for their golden years, according to a survey from Clever Real Estate. That disparity is indicative of one of the biggest regrets that certified financial planner Shelby Rothman, owner of wealth management firm EnJoy Financial, sees frequently among her clients.
“Clients often regret not saving enough money for retirement and focusing on short-term goals, like buying a house or starting a family, early in their lives,” she told The Independent by email. “Retirement sneaks up on them and they don’t have enough income for retirement.”
What makes the savings situation even more difficult is that those who realize the shortfall in their 70s and 80s can’t really make up for the lost savings. There just isn’t enough time for compound interest to build in any new savings contributions, Rothman said.
“It’s not just missing out on the dollars they should have saved, but on the money that money should have made over time, like a negative snowball effect,” she said.
To avoid this regret, people should remember that their Social Security should supplement their retirement funds, not be the only source of income, Rothman said. Second, save as much as you can when you’re young.
“If your employer offers a match on a company 401(k), make sure to contribute enough to receive that match - it’s free money,” she said. “In addition, be consistent with your savings. The longer money is invested, the more opportunity there is for it to grow.”
Not hiring a financial professional
Many retirees don’t hire a financial planner or adviser until years after they should, leaving them with regrets during retirement, Smith said.
“After going through a thorough planning process, I frequently hear, ‘I wish I had done this years ago,’” Smith said. “The clarity, structure and long-term strategy provide confidence that many retirees realize they lacked for decades.”
Avoiding this regret requires dispelling a myth commonly held among future or soon-to-be retirees: that financial planning is something that only rich people do because it’s expensive.
If individuals can overcome that mental hurdle, the decision to pay for a financial planner is well worth the investment. Many times, people hire a planner when something goes wrong, and that’s not always the best timing, Smith said.
“Much like hiring a personal trainer, people often don’t realize the value until there’s a specific trigger - retirement approaching, a market downturn or a major life event,” he said. “Most individuals spend decades working without truly knowing whether they are on track or if the decisions they’ve made will sustain them once the paycheck stops.”

Marine Le Pen's 2027 presidential rivals adjust their strategies to her legal timetable

Politics is about anticipation. In Marine Le Pen's case, her political rivals have all but buried the prospect of her embarking on a fourth presidential campaign in 2027. Rather than wait for what they expect to be an unfavorable ruling from the Paris Criminal Court in the embezzlement case involving alleged misuse of European Parliament funds, they are preparing in advance. The Paris Court of Appeal is due to deliver its ruling on July 7. Le Pen was sentenced in March 2025 to four years in prison, including two suspended, a €100,000 fine and a five-year ban on holding elected office. Since November, she has said she will clarify her political future immediately after the appeal ruling.
On both the left and the right, the Le Pen chapter is already closed. Attention has shifted to RN President Jordan Bardella. "We think she's finished," said Socialist Senator Alexandre Ouizille. "Let's not kid ourselves, Mr. Bardella will be the RN's candidate," asserted Xavier Bertrand, one of several presidential hopefuls from the conservative Les Républicains (LR). It is a political burial without ceremony. Bertrand had long considered Le Pen his preferred opponent, always ready to remind people of his victory over her in the 2015 regional elections.

Dubai port giant DP World replaces leader after he is named in Epstein emails

- DP World replaced chairman Sultan Ahmed Bin Sulayem with Essa Kazim and Yuvraj Narayan as CEO on Feb 13.
- Bin Sulayem's removal followed 'Epstein files' revelations of over 9,400 correspondences with convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, sparking condemnations.
- British BII initially suspended new investments with DP World due to the revelations but welcomed the new appointments to continue partnership.
AI generated
DUBAI - Dubai’s DP World named a new chairman and chief executive officer on Feb 13, replacing its former leader Sultan Ahmed Bin Sulayem, after the Epstein files revealed frequent correspondence between him and the convicted sex offender.
The statement did not mention Mr Bin Sulayem. But his close ties to Jeffrey Epstein were revealed in documents recently released by the US Department of Justice, where he is cited more than 9,400 times – making international headlines and sparking condemnations.
“DP World announced the appointment of His Excellency Essa Kazim as chairman of its board of directors and the appointment of Yuvraj Narayan as group chief executive officer,” the group said, in a statement published by the Dubai media office.
DP World took down Mr Bin Sulayem’s biography from their website shortly after the statement came out.
Described by Jeffrey Epstein as one of his “most trusted friends”, Mr Bin Sulayem was group chairman and chief executive officer of DP World, one of the largest port operators on the globe.
The move to replace him followed a decision on Feb 11 by British government investment institution BII to suspend investments with DP World in view of the revelations.
“We are shocked by the facts emerging in the Epstein files regarding Sultan Ahmed Bin Sulayem. In light of the allegations, we will not be making any new investments with DP World until the required actions have been taken by the company,” a spokesperson said.
On Feb 13, a spokesperson said: “We welcome today’s decision by DP World and look forward to continuing our partnership.”
BII is an investor with DP World in four ports in Africa.
‘Right hand’
The documents revealed that Epstein and Mr Bin Sulayem maintained regular correspondence from 2009 to 2018, exchanging messages on intimate matters, meetings, introductions and business opportunities.
The mere mention of someone’s name in the Epstein files does not in itself imply any wrongdoing by that person.
The wealthy Emirati businessman was presented at the time by Epstein as “the right hand” of Dubai ruler Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum.
The correspondence suggests he visited the US sex offender in his home several times, including on his island.
Mr Bin Sulayem shared very intimate information with Epstein.
He told him details about his relationship with a student at a Dubai university, with whom he described having the “best sex I ever had amazing body” and reported sexual massages he received during a trip to Tokyo.
Their correspondence shows that Mr Bin Sulayem travelled to Israel several years before the United Arab Emirates normalised ties with the country, and that Epstein put him in contact with former Israeli prime minister Ehud Barak.
Representative Thomas Massie, who along with Representative Ro Khanna had access to unredacted versions of the files, posted on X a 2009 email exchange between Epstein and a redacted sender discussing a “torture video”.
Mr Khanna then took to the House floor and read the names of six men whose names he said had been redacted, including Mr Bin Sulayem’s.
Mr Massie on Feb 13 posted a tweet referencing Mr Bin Sulayem’s resignation and said: “DOJ redacted information necessary to identify who sent Epstein the ‘torture video email.’ @RepRoKhanna and I first discovered his name and released it Monday. Today he resigns.”
Epstein was convicted in 2008 of soliciting a minor. His extensive ties to the world’s rich and powerful, especially after he was released in 2009, have become politically explosive across the globe.
He died in prison in 2019 while awaiting trial for trafficking children in what was ruled a suicide. AFP

Ukraine War Latest: UK to spend $545M on hypersonic weapons after Ukraine battlefield lessons
Key developments on Feb. 13
- Ukraine's battlefield lessons drive UK to spend over $545 million on hypersonic, long-range weapons in 2026
- Using Starlink ruse, Ukrainian cyber forces trick Russian soldiers into revealing positions, donating to armed forces
- 'Modern Ukrainian technology, battle-tested' — Zelensky unveils 1st drone produced by German-Ukrainian joint venture
- Ukraine's Unmanned Systems Forces release footage of strikes on Russian airfield in Crimea, other targets in occupied territories
- Four injured as Russian strikes target energy infrastructure in Odesa
The U.K. plans to spend 400 million pounds ($545.4 million) on hypersonic and long-range weapons in 2026, drawing on lessons from Russia's war in Ukraine, the U.K. Defense Ministry announced on Feb. 13.
The announcement comes as the annual security conference opens in Munich, running on Feb. 13–15, with about 50 world leaders and government officials expected to attend, including President Volodymyr Zelensky.
"To meet this new era of rising threats, we need hard power, strong alliances, and sure diplomacy," U.K. Defense Secretary John Healey said.
"We can see from the war in Ukraine the decisive impact of long-range precision weapons, so the U.K. is stepping up, investing more than 400 million pounds ($545.4 million) in long-range and hypersonic weapons this year," Healey added.
The planned investments will also support joint weapons projects with France, Germany, and Italy, the statement said.
The Stratus program, a collaboration between the U.K., France, and Italy, is developing a next-generation stealth missile to replace the Storm Shadow. The new missile is designed to "defeat high-value targets, destroy enemy ships, and suppress enemy air defenses," the statement said.
Separately, a joint long-range weapons program between the U.K. and Germany is entering a study phase and will focus on future stealth and hypersonic capabilities.
"Alongside Germany, France and Italy, we will deliver the cutting-edge weapons that will keep the U.K. and NATO safe, boost deterrence, and build a new deal for European security," Healey said.
This year's investment in hypersonic weapons will also cover the development of key technologies, ground and flight testing, and support for academic training, including funding for postgraduate studies, according to the statement.
The U.K. Defense Ministry added that the new domestically produced Deep Precision Strike system, with a range of more than 2,000 kilometers (1,240 miles), is expected to enter service in the 2030s.
Earlier, the U.K. and other partners announced roughly $38 billion in aid to Ukraine following a Feb. 12 meeting of the Ukraine Defense Contact Group in the Ramstein format.
More than $2.5 billion will be allocated for Ukrainian drones, more than $500 million for the Prioritized Ukraine Requirements List (PURL) initiative, and $2 billion for air defense, according to Ukraine's Defense Minister Mykhailo Fedorov.
Ukraine has long urged its partners to boost support for air defense systems, as Russian strikes on its energy infrastructure have intensified over the past months.

Using Starlink ruse, Ukrainian cyber forces trick Russian soldiers into revealing positions, donating to armed forces
A Ukrainian cyber unit claims it tricked Russian soldiers into revealing their positions and donating money to Ukraine's Armed Forces by pretending to help them reconnect Starlink devices they were using on the battlefield.
Russian forces have long been using unauthorized Starlink access to operate drones and other military equipment in occupied areas of Ukraine, but this was effectively switched off last week after the Ukrainian government, in cooperation with SpaceX, introduced a mandatory registration and "whitelist system.
Monopolizing on Russia's desperation to regain access to a crucial battlefield technology, Ukrainian cyber forces posed as a Russian-linked activation service offering to help restore terminals that had been disconnected under the new registration rules.
The operation was carried out by the 256th Cyber Assault Division in cooperation with the InformNapalm and MILITANT, according to a statement published on social media on Feb. 12.
Russian servicemen were instructed to submit identifying information and the coordinates of their terminals under the guise that the devices would be reactivated through Ukrainian administrative service centers.
The group said they collected 2,420 data packets related to Russian-used terminals and transferred them to Ukrainian law enforcement and defense agencies. According to the statement, the data was provided to authorities "for final transfer into brick mode," referring to the disabling of the terminals.
The group claims the terminals were subsequently deactivated. The Kyiv Independent could not independently verify the claims.
The group also said it received $5,870 from Russian soldiers seeking to restore connectivity which it is donating to fundraising efforts for Ukrainian drones.
It also identified 31 Ukrainian "traitors" willing to assist Russian forces by registering terminals. According to the statement, that information has been forwarded to Ukraine’s Security Service (SBU).

'Modern Ukrainian technology, battle-tested' — Zelensky unveils 1st drone produced by German-Ukrainian joint venture
President Volodymyr Zelensky on Feb. 13 unveiled the first strike drone produced by a newly launched German-Ukrainian joint venture ahead of the Munich Security Conference, as he said in a statement published on X.
The launch marks the first Ukrainian drone production line in Germany and is part of Kyiv's broader effort to expand arms manufacturing in Europe, as the war with Russia drives sustained demand for unmanned systems.
"Today, I received the first jointly made attack drone. We saw the production line and the first flight of the drone," Zelensky wrote on X.
"This is modern Ukrainian technology. Battle-tested. Powered by AI. It will strike, it will scout, it will protect our soldiers," the president added.
Zelensky, accompanied by German Defense Minister Boris Pistorius, visited Quantum Frontline Industries (QFI), a joint venture between Germany's Quantum Systems and Ukraine's Frontline Robotics.
During the visit, the Ukrainian-German Linza 3.0 multi-purpose drone was demonstrated and then handed over to Zelensky.
The facility is expected to produce up to 10,000 drones within a year, all of which will be delivered to the Ukrainian Armed Forces, according to the president.
The Linza 3.0 drone, developed by Frontline Robotics, is the latest version of the company's multi-purpose platform. The manufacturer said it features AI-enabled visual-inertial navigation, can carry up to 4 kilograms of payload, operate up to 15 kilometers (9 miles), and can stay in the air for up to 60 minutes.
The parties announced the start of joint production in December 2025, and Ukraine plans to open 10 more joint ventures by the end of 2026, Zelensky said. The president did not specify which countries the ventures would be located in.

Ukraine's Unmanned Systems Forces release footage of strikes on Russian airfield in Crimea, other targets in occupied territories
Ukrainian forces have struck multiple Russian military targets, including an airfield, in Russian-occupied territories over the past two days, the Unmanned System Forces (USF) said on Feb. 13.
Ukraine regularly attacks military facilities in Russian-occupied areas that supply weapons, fuel, and equipment to Russian troops.
The 1st Separate Center of the USF struck on Feb. 12 an airfield in the village of Hvardiiske in Crimea, the Kirova electrical substation in the city of Luhansk, Luhansk Oblast, and a data center in Prymorsk, Zaporizhzhia Oblast.
All targets were struck with mid-range precision weapons and were located in Russian-occupied territories, according to the USF.
Drone operators from the "Kairos" unit of the 414th Separate Brigade, also known as "Madyar's Birds", targeted an ammunition depot near the village of Rozivka in the Russian-occu[ied part of Zaporizhzhia Oblast on Feb. 11, according to the statement.
"Systematic strikes on such infrastructure disrupt command and logistics, reducing the Russian army's ability to sustain combat operations," the USF said.

Germany’s Friedrich Merz quipped to Sir Keir Starmer “I hope you don’t mind about the European flag” as they posed for the cameras in front of a row of flags ahead of their meeting with France’s Emmanuel Macron.
The German chancellor made the Brexit-related joke before the trio sat down for talks on the sidelines of the Munich Security Conference on Friday (13 February).
The three European powers are known collectively as the E3.
With the media present before their bilateral meeting, Sir Keir warned: “There’s no UK security without European security. There’s no European security without UK security.
“So we have to work together.”

Global: European states must retract outrageous attacks on UN Special Rapporteur Francesca Albanese

Reacting to calls by ministers and officials in France and Czechia for Francesca Albanese, the UN Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in the Palestinian Territory occupied since 1967, to resign, Amnesty International’s Secretary General Agnès Callamard said:
“It is reprehensible that ministers in Austria, Czechia, France, Germany and Italy have attacked the UN Special Rapporteur on the Occupied Palestinian Territory, Francesca Albanese, based on a deliberately truncated video to misrepresent and gravely misconstrue her messages – as is clear from watching her original address in its entirety.
“The ministers that have spread disinformation must act beyond merely deleting their comments on social media – as some have done. They must publicly apologize and retract any calls for Francesca Albanese’s resignation. Their governments must also investigate how this disinformation happened with a view to preventing such situations.
“If only these ministers had been as loud and forceful in confronting a state committing genocide, unlawful occupation and apartheid as they have in attacking a UN expert. Their cowardice and refusal to hold Israel accountable stand in stark contrast to the Special Rapporteur’s unwavering commitment to speaking truth to power.
“The Special Rapporteur’s commitment to objectively investigate facts based on hard evidence and apply international law has been vital in exposing Israel’s ongoing violations of Palestinians’ rights and the complicity of third parties. The calls for her to resign are the latest in a series of alarming personal attacks and attempts to silence her – and must be categorically rejected. This campaign to discredit her only serves as a smokescreen to deflect attention away from Israel’s genocide in Gaza, its system of apartheid and unlawful occupation of the Occupied Palestinian Territory.
“Despite a drop in Israeli air attacks and some limited improvements in the cross-border movement of goods and people since the truce in October 2025, there has been no meaningful change in the conditions Israel is inflicting on Palestinians in Gaza and no evidence to indicate that Israel’s intent has changed. The genocide is ongoing.
“Israeli military operations in the occupied Gaza Strip have continued, killing over 590 Palestinians since October 2025. The estimated death toll of Palestinian victims since October 2023 now stands at over 72,000.
Not only does this allow Israel to violate international law with impunity, but it also effectively undermines the integrity of crucial international human rights mechanisms that were adopted to protect us all.
Amnesty International’s Secretary General Agnès Callamard
“Israel has also significantly escalated the cruel and unlawful closures that it has imposed on Gaza for over 18 years. Israeli military operations to effectively create a no-go zone across nearly 60 percent of the Gaza Strip have further worsened conditions. In the occupied West Bank, including illegally annexed East Jerusalem, attacks by Israeli forces and state-backed settlers have killed more than 1,100 Palestinians and displaced tens of thousands since October 2023.
“This outrageous injustice persists despite the International Court of Justice repeatedly ordering Israel to take all measures within its power to prevent genocidal acts, and its Advisory Opinion that Israel’s occupation is unlawful and must end as soon as possible. Let’s also not forget that the International Criminal Court has issued arrest warrants against Israel’s prime minister and the former minister of defense for war crimes and crimes against humanity.
“Instead of upholding their legal obligations under international law to protect Palestinians, third states have decided at best, to look away, and at worst, to arm the perpetrators of genocide and war crimes while attacking those who tirelessly condemn Israel’s impunity and the material gain to be made by state and non-state actors from supporting Israel’s violations of Palestinians’ rights.
“Not only does this allow Israel to violate international law with impunity, but it also effectively undermines the integrity of crucial international human rights mechanisms that were adopted to protect us all.
“This is a critical moment for humanity, with international law and human rights institutions under attack like never before. The use of misinformation to further delegitimize them poses a profound threat to human rights and the rule of law itself.
“This is the precise moment that states such as Austria, Czechia, France, Germany and Italy should be taking a stand. They must demonstrate their commitment to upholding their legal obligations to stop Israel’s genocide and bring its decades-long international crimes to an end. This means actively supporting UN mechanisms and respecting the autonomy of UN-appointed independent human rights experts. They must act to hold Israel accountable for its ongoing genocide, apartheid and unlawful occupation, rather than joining the shameful bandwagon of weaponizing disinformation against this Special Rapporteur.”
Background
On 7 February, UN Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in the Palestinian Territory occupied since 1967, Francesca Albanese, spoke at a forum in Doha organized by Al Jazeera. She said:
“The fact that instead of stopping Israel, most of the world has armed, given Israel political excuses, political sheltering, economic and financial support […] We who do not control large amounts of financial capitals, algorithms and weapons, we now see that we as a humanity have a common enemy, and freedoms, the respect of fundamental freedoms is the last peaceful avenue, the last peaceful toolbox that we have to regain our freedom.”
These comments were misconstrued as describing Israel as that “common enemy”. Albanese rejected these accusations and clarified her comments on social media that “the common enemy of humanity is the system that has enabled the genocide in Palestine, including the financial capital that funds it, the algorithms that obscure it and the weapons that enable it”.
On 11 February, the French Foreign Minister Jean-Noel Barrot made a statement calling for the Special Rapporteur to resign. This was followed by similarly harmful statements from Austrian, Czech, German and Italian ministers.

Peugeot center Odesa Adis-Motor showroom completely destroyed in drone attack – Stellantis Ukraine rep
As a result of a massive overnight drone strike on Odesa on February 13, a fire completely destroyed the building housing the Peugeot Center Odesa "Adis-Motor" dealership, the Ukrainian representative of Stellantis told Interfax-Ukraine.
The representation reported that neighboring dealership centers were also partially damaged, including one representing the Opel brand. In addition, the premises of the paint shop, service center, and office-administrative building were destroyed.
The company added that employees of the Adis Motor automotive complex were present on the premises at the time of the strike but, fortunately, no one was injured.
Efforts are currently underway to document the consequences and assess the damage caused.
According to Stellantis Ukraine, due to damage to the Opel and Peugeot dealership centers, customer service operations will temporarily be carried out at the Jeep Center Odesa Adis-Motor facility.
"The process of organizing the redirection of service operations is currently underway to ensure continuity of customer service for the dealerships," the representation stated.
In Odesa, the Adis-Auto automotive group operated three Adis-Motor dealership centers representing Stellantis brands: Peugeot (opened in 2010), Opel (opened in 2020), and Jeep (opened in 2024).
The Adis Group is an official dealer of Mitsubishi Motors, Peugeot, Opel, Subaru, and Jeep, and also serves as a service partner for Citroën.
The official representative of the Stellantis group in Ukraine, Peugeot Citroën Ukraine, represents the Peugeot, Citroën, Opel, DS Automobiles, and Jeep brands.
As previously reported, on the night of February 13, Russian forces carried out a massive drone attack against Odesa and the surrounding region.
Energy, port, residential, and industrial infrastructure facilities were damaged. The nighttime attack resulted in six people being injured and one fatality.
According to the State Emergency Service of Ukraine in Odesa Region, the fire completely destroyed the auto dealership.
"As a result of the strikes, large-scale fires broke out at the auto dealership, spreading across an area of 2,000 square meters. Vehicles parked nearby, garage units containing vehicles, and an energy facility that sustained significant damage were all engulfed in flames," the agency said in a statement on Facebook.

Berlin Format supports Ukraine – von der Leyen
European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen stated this on X while participating in the Munich Security Conference alongside other world leaders, Ukrinform reports.
"We reaffirmed our readiness to provide strong security guarantees after the fighting ends, with a crucial US backstop and monitoring role," von der Leyen stated.
She added that at the same time, European, American, and Ukrainian partners have prepared a joint Prosperity Framework, based on reforms, EU integration, and the mobilization of public and private capital.
Europe is also strengthening its direct support for Ukraine, the European Commission President recalled, noting that the EU is finalizing a EUR 90 billion loan to support the functioning of the Ukrainian state, while simultaneously reinforcing air defense systems and boosting defense capabilities.
The EU is also increasing the cost of the war for Russia through a 20th sanctions package, which is expected to be approved soon, she emphasized.
"Our goal is clear: to ensure Ukraine can negotiate peace on its own terms, from a position of strength and with a safe, secure and prosperous future for its citizens within the EU," von der Leyen said.
As previously reported, the 62nd Munich Security Conference began on February 13 — a leading global forum for discussing key international security challenges.
Up to 1,000 representatives from nearly 120 countries are taking part in the three-day event, including almost 60 heads of state and government, 56 foreign ministers, more than 30 defense ministers, and leaders of over 40 international organizations.
The Ukrainian delegation is headed by President Volodymyr Zelensky.

The government has left itself almost powerless against Palestine Action
Editorial: While it was always absurd for the home secretary to categorise the direct action group as a terrorist organisation – placing it in the same bracket as Isis and the Provisional IRA – there are better ways for its activists to win the argument than by using violence
- Bookmark
- CommentsGo to comments
Whatever might be said about the merits of the government’s attempt to outlaw Palestine Action, it has proved to be a humiliating failure in every respect.
The High Court ruling that the proscription of the group as a “terrorist” organisation is “disproportionate” and in contravention of human rights legislation has left ministers in the worst of all worlds. The government is accused of tyranny, but in fact is also now prospectively unable to control an organisation that has resorted to violent acts, at least against property, and which Jewish communities have found deeply threatening.
Given that two juries have refused to convict Palestine Action activists in high-profile cases where the evidence of wrongdoing has been overwhelming and unchallenged, the situation is clearly a mess.
The home secretary, Shabana Mahmood, says she is “disappointed” by the judges’ decision, but she should not be surprised. She will appeal against the decision, so the ban on Palestine Action remains in place for the time being – but it feels like a dead letter.
Indeed, the Metropolitan Police refused to take the latest bait offered outside the High Court by protesters with placards saying they support Palestine Action. Officers declined to arrest them for the benefit of the television cameras. The police pointed to the “unusual” situation created by the High Court ruling; they are correct that it is unusual, but this is not a convincing reason for failing to uphold the law.
When Ms Mahmood’s predecessor, Yvette Cooper, stood up in the Commons last June to make the case for proscription, she had some reasonable arguments. She was right to say that Jewish communities found some Palestine Action activities “intimidatory and unacceptable”. The Board of Deputies of British Jews has issued a warning that “Palestine Action has repeatedly targeted buildings hosting Jewish communal institutions, Jewish-owned businesses, or sites associated with Israel, in ways that cause fear and disruption far beyond the immediate protest sites”.
We live in a time when legitimate concerns about the behaviour of the Israeli armed forces in Gaza have too easily slid into blaming British Jews for such actions – a classic antisemitic trope, whether conscious or otherwise.
After the Manchester synagogue attack, the Bondi Beach shootings, and other murderous assaults on Jews who have nothing to do with the Netanyahu government, all those who protest the suffering of the Palestinian people have to be especially clear about the peaceful nature and intent of their cause. Those who are pro-Palestine, however that is defined, must never allow their movement to be overtaken or hijacked by anti-Jewish hate.
Sadly, despite Ms Cooper’s honourable intentions, the decision to proscribe Palestinian Action has done nothing to ameliorate this danger.
There is no reason, either, for the government – or the British people as a whole – to accept the destruction of vital and valuable defence equipment as an exercise in freedom of expression. The definition of “direct action” does not include committing vandalism in the pursuit of a political cause.
As Ms Cooper pointed out, Palestine Action does not have the right to attack “key national infrastructure and defence firms that provide services and supplies to support Ukraine, Nato, Five Eyes allies and UK defence”. It is not just property that gets hurt. Last year, a Palestine Action activist was allegedly responsible for breaking a police officer’s spine with a sledgehammer during a raid on premises belonging to an Israel-based defence company. (The jury failed to reach a verdict in that case, and a retrial is pending.)
We are still a democracy, with the ancient right to protest protected by common law, by the human rights convention, and by the safeguard against bad law guaranteed by a jury. There are better ways for Palestine Action to win its arguments than by using violence, as was seen in the general election, when many so-called Gaza independents were elected to the House of Commons. If Palestine Action goes beyond peaceful, noisy protest and resorts to intimidation and violence, then its members should be restrained, as with any other group, through proportionate action by the authorities.
The mistake made by Ms Cooper and the government was to choose the wrong measure to keep the peace so far as Palestine Action is concerned. Despite the violence sometimes deployed, it was always absurd to categorise Palestine Action as a “terrorist” organisation, bracketing it with, say, Isis or the Provisional IRA. It resulted in retired people and wheelchair users, who were obviously not terrorists in any accepted sense of the word, being manhandled by the police for holding up a piece of cardboard with words on it. The law was dragged into farce and disrepute when confronted with a T-shirt proclaiming loyalty to “Plasticine Action”.
There are existing laws and powers that can, and are, used in the case of demonstrations and direct action, including incitement to racial or religious hatred, disorder, criminal damage and grievous bodily harm. If Palestine Action is a more sinister organisation than it appears – as ministers have claimed it to be – but is still not clearly a terrorist one, then a new law should be framed accordingly, and be justified to parliament and the people.
At the moment, the government has left itself practically powerless to deal with Palestine Action, while simultaneously infringing on the common right to protest. Even if the ban is upheld on appeal, juries may still choose to ignore it, and other laws for that matter, and free Palestine Action protesters. On behalf of her government, Ms Mahmood will need to think again about what to put in place of this unenforceable ban.

The victory won by Tarique Rahman's Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) was overwhelming. The party won 212 of the 300 seats up for election, guaranteeing it an absolute majority, in parliamentary elections that finished on Thursday, February 12, according to the electoral commission. Meanwhile, Jamaat-e-Islami, Bangladesh's largest Islamist party, made significant gains in a country where 90% of the population is Muslim, securing 77 seats – its best-ever result.
The party leader asked its officials and activists not to hold street celebrations, but instead to offer prayers in mosques on Friday. Rahman, 60, is set to become prime minister after spending 17 years in exile in the United Kingdom. He is the heir to a dynasty that has dominated the country's political scene. His father, BNP founder General Ziaur Rahman, served as the country's president from 1977 to 1981, before being assassinated during a coup attempt. His mother, Khaleda Zia, former prime minister Sheikh Hasina's main rival, was the first woman to become prime minister of Bangladesh in 1991. She was the face of the BNP until her death in December 2025.

Russia and Ukraine to hold more talks in Geneva next week
Trump has given both sides until June to reach deal, but future of Donbas industrial heartland remains a sticking point.
Russian and Ukrainian envoys are set to engage in a new round of United States-brokered talks next week in Geneva as the war approaches the four-year mark with no apparent compromises on territory in sight.
Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said on Friday that the trilateral talks, which follow two earlier rounds in Abu Dhabi, would be held on February 17-18, according to the RIA Novosti news agency.

The new round of negotiations was confirmed by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy’s communications adviser, Dmytro Lytvyn.
As fighting continues along the roughly 1,250-kilometre (750-mile) front line, with Moscow keeping up its assault on Ukraine’s power grid and Kyiv launching long-range attacks on war-related targets like oil refineries, the future of Ukraine’s Donbas industrial heartland remains a major bone of contention.
Russia is pushing for Ukraine to pull out of the fifth of the eastern Donetsk region in the Donbas that it still controls. Ukraine, for its part, has rejected a unilateral pull-back and wants Western security guarantees to deter Russia from re-launching its offensive if a ceasefire is reached.
Zelenskyy said last week that the US had given the warring parties a June deadline to reach a deal, though US President Donald Trump’s previous ultimatums have not resulted in a breakthrough.
Hundreds of thousands of soldiers and tens of thousands of civilians have been killed since Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, according to many estimates, making the war Europe’s deadliest since World War II.
Two previous rounds of trilateral talks in Abu Dhabi, led by US envoys Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner, reportedly focused on military issues, such as a possible buffer zone and ceasefire monitoring.
In the upcoming talks, Russian President Vladimir Putin’s adviser, Vladimir Medinsky, a hawkish ex-culture minister who previously led failed talks in Turkiye in March 2022, is returning to head Moscow’s delegation.
Ukraine’s delegation will again be led by Rustem Umerov, Ukraine’s National Security and Defence Council chief, accompanied by Zelenskyy’s chief of staff, Kyrylo Budanov, and a host of other officials.
In advance of the talks, Russian forces continued to carry out air strikes, killing three brothers between eight and 19 years of age in a strike on eastern Ukraine overnight from Thursday to Friday.
In Odesa, one person was killed and six more injured in a Russian strike at the city’s port and energy infrastructure, officials said.
The local governor of the Volgograd region of southwestern Russia said Friday that three people, including a 12-year-old boy, were injured by drone debris from a Ukrainian attack.
Later, two people were killed and three others wounded in a missile attack on the Russian city of Belgorod, regional governor Vyacheslav Gladkov said.
On Friday, Zelenskyy attended the Munich Security Conference in Germany, where he was due to hold bilateral and multilateral meetings to secure support from allies before the talks.
Speaking in Munich, German Chancellor Friedrich Merz said he was “ready to talk” with Russian leaders, but that Russia was not yet prepared for “serious” peace talks with Ukraine.
He said discussions with Moscow might make sense as part of a broader effort to bring Russia to the negotiating table, following French efforts to urge European leaders to consider resuming dialogue with Putin.
But the Russians “have to concede that they are really willing to talk about a ceasefire and then about a peace plan,” said the German leader.
NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte said that the Russians were “not winning [the war] as some are thinking”.
“This so-called Russian bear is not there,” he told reporters. “It is basically still the speed of a garden snail”, adding that Moscow was accruing “very slow, staggering losses”.
In other developments, Ukraine’s Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha met his Chinese counterpart, Wang Yi, in Munich, where the pair “discussed peace efforts and China’s important role in facilitating an end to the war”.
Beijing has said it takes a neutral stance on the Ukraine war, but has been accused by Kyiv and Western allies of providing Russia with crucial support, notably by supplying military components.

Vaping in cars carrying anyone under 18 will be banned in England under government plans to reduce the harm caused by smoking and e-cigarettes.
The move is included in the tobacco and vapes bill, which will also outlaw smoking, vaping and using heated tobacco in playgrounds and outside schools and hospitals.
Smoking in cars containing children and young people up to the age of 18 has been illegal in England since 2015. The new legislation will extend that prohibition to the use of vapes and heated tobacco.
“No child in a playground or hospital patient should suffer because someone else chooses to smoke,” said Wes Streeting, the health secretary.
“Secondhand smoke increases the risk of heart disease and lung cancer and we want to protect children and the sick from harm.”
The Department of Health and Social Care said that the measures it is proposing are needed to protect health given the growing evidence about the dangers of heated tobacco and vaping.
It said: “Evidence is emerging that emissions from heated tobacco and secondhand vapour from vapes pose health risks. At the same time, youth vaping has risen sharply in recent years, raising concerns about nicotine addiction and long-term health effects.”
The bill does not include a ban on smoking outside pubs. It also exempts smoking or vaping in care homes, hospices, mental health hospitals and residential schools.
The measures are subject to the outcome of a public consultation, which launched on Friday and will run for 12 weeks until 8 May.
The health campaign charity Action on Smoking and Health said ministers were right to explore the possibility of outlawing vaping in cars carrying under-18s.
Caroline Cerny, ASH’s deputy chief executive, said: “This consultation, and the wider legislation it is part of, is focused on protecting children. Although exposure to secondhand vapour is significantly less harmful than secondhand smoke, it is reasonable to consider whether steps should be taken to minimise any potential risk – particularly in small, enclosed spaces such as cars where children are present.
“A balance needs to be struck in these regulations between protecting children and ensuring adults who smoke are still supported to switch to vapes. The consultation process should help the government strike that balance.”
Prof Chris Whitty, England’s chief medical officer, said: “People who do not smoke but who are exposed to secondhand smoke can suffer significant harmful effects on their health, including an increased risk of asthma, poor birth outcomes, several cancers, stroke and heart disease.”

Bangladesh nationalists claim landslide victory in first election since Gen Z uprising
The Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) celebrated a landslide victory on Friday in the first elections held since a deadly 2024 uprising, with leader Tarique Rahman poised to become prime minister.
Election Commission figures said the BNP alliance had won 212 seats, compared with 77 for the Jamaat-e-Islami alliance, which said Friday there had been "massive irregularities in vote counting" and demanded "redress".
It was unclear immediately what action Jamaat would take.
BNP chief Rahman told AFP two days before polling he was "confident" that his party, crushed during the autocratic 15-year rule of ousted prime minister Sheikh Hasina, would regain power in the South Asian nation of 170 million people.
Hasina's Awami League party was barred from taking part.
The US embassy congratulated Rahman and the BNP for a "historic victory", while neighbouring India praised Rahman's "decisive win", a significant step after recent rocky relations with Bangladesh.
China and Pakistan, which both grew closer to Bangladesh since the 2024 uprising and the souring of ties with India, where Hasina has sheltered since her ouster, also congratulated the BNP.
'Seek redress'
But Jamaat chief Shafiqur Rahman, 67, who had mounted a disciplined grassroots campaign on a platform of justice and ending corruption, told reporters angrily on Friday that his party would "seek redress from the Election Commission".
His party had earlier claimed there were "repeated inconsistencies and fabrications" in the result announcement process.
"Our youths will not spare anybody who attempts to compromise the sacrifices made in July", he said, referring to the 2024 uprising against Hasina.
The Election Commission said turnout was 59 percent across 299 constituencies out of 300 in which voting took place.
Another 50 seats in parliament reserved for women will be named from party lists.
Heavy deployments of security forces are posted countrywide, and UN experts warned ahead of the voting of "growing intolerance, threats and attacks" and a "tsunami of disinformation".
Political clashes killed five people and injured more than 600 during campaigning, police records show.
However, after a turbulent campaign period, the vote passed largely peacefully, and a day after the vote, Bangladesh has seemingly reacted to the result so far with calm.
Party workers spent the whole night after voting in front of the BNP offices.
"We will join the nation-building effort led by Tarique Rahman," Md Fazlur Rahman, 45, told AFP. "Over the last 17 years, we have suffered a lot."
Khurshid Alam, 39, a businessman in Dhaka, said: "The promises and aspirations for the next five years made by Tarique Rahman to the people, I hope he can implement them."
'Ended the nightmare'
Interim leader Muhammad Yunus, who will step down once the new government takes power, has urged all to stay calm.
"We may have differences of opinion, but we must remain united in the greater national interest," he said.
The 85-year-old Nobel Peace Prize winner has led Bangladesh since Hasina's rule ended with her ouster in August 2024.
Yunus said the election had "ended the nightmare and begun a new dream".
Hasina, 78, who was sentenced to death in absentia for crimes against humanity, issued a statement decrying an "illegal and unconstitutional election".
Yunus championed a sweeping democratic reform charter to overhaul what he called a "completely broken" system of government and to prevent a return to one-party rule.
Voters in Thursday's election also endorsed proposals in a referendum that included prime ministerial term limits, a new upper house of parliament, stronger presidential powers and greater judicial independence, with 60 percent backing the changes.
Crisis Group analyst Thomas Kean warned that the incoming government now faced "daunting challenges", including "boosting the economy, ensuring security and continuing the reform process".

Chris Paul, the ‘Point God,’ retires as All-Star weekend begins, ending a 21-season NBA run

Chris Paul, the ‘Point God,’ retires as All-Star weekend begins, ending a 21-season NBA run
Chris Paul, the ‘Point God,’ retires as All-Star weekend begins, ending a 21-season NBA run
Chris Paul, the “Point God” who was a 12-time All-Star selection and two-time Olympic gold medalist, announced his retirement on Friday in the capper of a 21-season career that will surely merit induction into the Basketball Hall of Fame.
Paul made the announcement on the first day of the NBA’s All-Star weekend at the home of the Los Angeles Clippers in Inglewood, California. Paul spent his final season — an abbreviated one — with the Clippers, who sent him home in December and wound up trading him to Toronto earlier this month.
The Raptors knew Paul would never play in Toronto, and that begged the question about whether the Wake Forest legend would try to finish the season with another team in pursuit of the thing he never got — an NBA title.
The answer came Friday. He’s done. He said last summer that he has hated missing events with his children over the last few years, and now he can devote himself much more to his family and other interests.
“It’s time for me to show up for others and in other ways,” Paul wrote on a social media post, announcing the decision.
He strongly hinted earlier this season that this year was going to be his last. Paul was a four-time All-NBA first team selection, and he ranks second in NBA history with 12,552 assists and 2,728 steals. He was the first player to score at least 20,000 points while recording at least 10,000 assists; LeBron James and Russell Westbrook have both since done that as well.
“It feels really good knowing that I played and treated this game with the utmost respect since the day my dad introduced me to it,” Paul wrote. “It was the very first relationship I ever knew.”
Paul played for New Orleans, Houston, Oklahoma City, Phoenix, Golden State, San Antonio and the Clippers during his career, spending the last four years with four different teams.
He also was a past president of the National Basketball Players Association — instrumental in getting the league through the bubble season when the pandemic struck in 2020 — and championed the NBA establishing better ties with Historically Black Colleges and Universities.
“From the moment he entered the league, Chris distinguished himself with his savvy playmaking skills, elite competitiveness and intense work ethic,” NBA Commissioner Adam Silver said in a statement, in which he called Paul “one of the greatest point guards in NBA history.”
Paul is 15th all-time in regular-season games played and 36th in points, was a six-time steals champion, five-time assists champion, a nine-time All-Defensive team pick, 11-time All-NBA selection and was part of the NBA’s 75th anniversary team.
He’s one of six players in NBA history to have reached $400 million in career earnings.
“I’ve been playing basketball since I was 4 years old, and there’s nothing other than my family that brings me more joy than the hard work and all that stuff that goes into it,” he said in 2024. “Yeah, that’s why we get to play a child’s game and say it’s my way of life.”
Paul became arguably the most accomplished player in Clippers franchise history while leading the team to six winning seasons from 2011-17, including the Clippers’ first two Pacific Division titles and three playoff series victories. Paul returned to Los Angeles as a free agent last July, rejoining a franchise where he is loved by fans — but it went bad quickly, and Paul’s last game with the Clippers was Dec. 1.
It turned out to be his last NBA game, period.
“While this chapter of being an ‘NBA player’ is done, the game of basketball will forever be engrained in the DNA of my life, spanning three decades,” Paul wrote. “It’s crazy even saying that!! Playing basketball for a living has been an unbelievable blessing that also came with lost of responsibility. I embraced it all.”
Paul is one of seven players to have an NBA career span at least 21 seasons. And he’s already in the Hall of Fame: the 2008 Olympic ‘Redeem Team’ was enshrined as part of the 2025 class. It won’t be long before he goes in on his own as well.

Brazilian au pair gets 10-year sentence for scheme to kill lover’s wife and another man

Brazilian au pair gets 10-year sentence for killing Joseph Ryan in murder plot against lover’s wife
Brazilian au pair gets 10-year sentence for killing Joseph Ryan in murder plot against lover’s wife
FAIRFAX, Va. (AP) — An au pair who schemed with her employer-turned-lover to kill his wife and another man received a 10-year prison sentence on Friday.
Prosecutors had recommended Juliana Peres Magalhães walk free after she pleaded guilty to a downgraded manslaughter charge in the February 2023 killing of Joseph Ryan. Instead of being tried for second-degree murder, she became their star witness, testifying that she had fatally shot Ryan as Brendan Banfield was fatally stabbing his wife, Christine, in the couple’s bedroom.
Brendan Banfield was convicted by a jury this month of aggravated murder in the deaths of his wife and Ryan.
“I know my remorse cannot bring you peace,” Magalhães told the victims’ families on Friday, wiping away tears and muffling sobs. “I hope you can someday understand that I really did not believe his plan would actually happen.”
Instead of sentencing her to time served, Judge Penney Azcarate delivered the maximum possible sentence to the woman from Brazil.
“Let’s get it straight: You do not deserve anything other than incarceration and a life of reflection on what you have done to the victim and his family. May it weigh heavily on your soul,” the judge said.
At Banfield’s trial, Magalhães testified that she and the IRS agent created an account in the name of his wife, a pediatric intensive care nurse, on a social media platform for people interested in sexual fetishes. Ryan connected with the account and agreed to meet for a sexual encounter involving a knife.
Magalhães, then 22, said she and Brendan Banfield took the couple’s 4-year-old child to the basement, and then found Ryan surprising Christine Banfield with a knife in the couple’s bedroom. She said Brendan Banfield shot Ryan and then began stabbing his wife in the neck. When she saw Ryan moving, Magalhães said, she fired the second shot that killed him.
The au pair wasn’t arrested until eight months later, and hasn’t left jail since. Prosecutors raised concerns that if she were to be allowed bail, she would flee to Brazil or be deported by immigration officials before they could finish their case. She didn’t talk with investigators for more than a year, until she changed her mind as her trial date approached.
“I lost myself in a relationship, and left my morals and values behind,” Magalhães told the judge.
“You were texting and speaking to Joseph Ryan, encouraging him to bring a knife and ultimately, through the phone conversation, getting his consent, knowing all along you were bringing him to his death,” the judge responded.
Ryan’s mother, Deirdre Fisher, told the court that her son, born days before Christmas, was her “greatest gift.” Three years after his killing, she can’t bear taking down their Christmas tree. An urn with Ryan’s ashes sits in front of the decoration.
“I say good morning to him each day when I turn on the tree’s lights,” she said. “But of course that’s not Joe sitting there. He can’t say ‘I love you’ back.”
Sangeeta Ryan described her nephew as “inquisitive, curious, smart, charming and so dang talkative.” She said he loved martial arts and role-playing with his friends. She also noted that he had moved in with his octogenarian grandmother to care for her.
“His sudden murder devastated his grandma — she could no longer live in the family home without Joe,” his aunt said. The woman quietly moved away, hoping to avoid her memories and the reporters knocking at the door.
Christine Banfield’s relatives attended Friday’s hearing. A judge has said Banfield will be sentenced in May.

Minnesotans welcome the immigration surge drawdown but remain vigilant

Minnesotans welcome the immigration surge drawdown but remain vigilant
Minnesotans welcome the immigration surge drawdown but remain vigilant
MINNEAPOLIS (AP) — The Trump administration’s drawdown of its immigration enforcement surge in the Twin Cities area has been met with relief, but state and city officials say small businesses and immigrant communities are still reeling.
Thousands of officers were sent to the Minneapolis and St. Paul area for Operation Metro Surge. The Department of Homeland Security said it was its largest immigration enforcement operation ever and dubbed it a success, but the crackdown came under increasing criticism as the situation grew more volatile.
The shooting deaths of U.S. citizens Renee Good and Alex Pretti by federal officers drew condemnation and raised questions over officers’ conduct, prompting changes to the operation.
Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz and Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey, both Democrats, said the damage would be lasting and called on the federal government to help pay the costs.
“This unprecedented federal escalation has upended daily life, it has eroded trust and inflicted a whole lot of harm on the operation that we need to provide as a city,” Frey said Friday. “Minneapolis taxpayers should not be left to foot the bill of this situation that has been created by the federal government.”
The mayor and other Minneapolis officials outlined the ways the crackdown has strained the finances of residents, businesses and the city itself. Expenses such as staff overtime and street cleanups cost the city an extra $6 million in January, they said.
The city estimates that small businesses have lost tens of millions of dollars in revenue, and thousands of hotel room were cancelled, Frey said. Furthermore, an estimated tens of thousands of people, including school-age children, are in need of support services such as rent and food assistance.
It’s the federal government’s responsibility in any emergency to assist in the recovery, Frey said, noting it was “all the more important” when federal agencies caused the damage.
The operation leaves a mark
Following Thursday’s announcement, some residents held a vigil at a makeshift shrine that went up where Good was shot in Minneapolis.
Mark Foresman, an attendee from the suburb of St. Louis Park, said he is skeptical that the agents will leave.
“The Trump administration has created an atmosphere of distrust for government in general,” he said, suggesting the Trump administration’s tactics seemed designed to sow fear. “They’ve repeatedly been caught in lies.”.
John Schnickel, a local who attended the vigil, disputed Trump officials’ claims that Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers or the operation had made Minnesota safer.
“I don’t even want one ICE person here, if they act the way they’ve been acting,” said Schnickel. “They talk about how the murder rate is down, and yet they’ve added two people to it,” he said.
Most U.S. adults say they think Trump’s immigration policies have gone too far, according to a recent AP-NORC poll.
Homan credits improved coordination
Border czar Tom Homan told reporters Thursday that “extensive engagement” with state and local officials allowed for a formal end to the operation. The White House had long accused Minnesota of protecting criminals from deportation with so-called sanctuary laws.
President Donald Trump softened his tone and dispatched Homan to reduce tensions after the Jan. 24 killing of Pretti, saying that he and Walz were on a “similar wavelength” after weeks of barbs between the two leaders.
Homan on Thursday highlighted examples of newfound cooperation with state and local entities, including law enforcement being increasingly responsive to requests for assistance and agreements on how jails handle deportable inmates.
Minnesota’s state prison system and many of its county jails have long shared information with federal immigration authorities so they can take custody of arrested immigrants.
The major exception is the Hennepin County Jail, which serves Minneapolis and doesn’t work with immigration authorities unless an arrest warrant has been signed by a judge. Hennepin County Sheriff Dawanna Witt, who oversees the jail, insisted Friday that no policies had changed.
Frey, meanwhile, emphasized Friday that his position hasn’t changed despite Homan’s indication that agreements with state and city leaders had been made.
“We do not enforce federal immigration law, period. We do not cooperate with ICE or any agency around enforcement of federal immigration law, period,” Frey said.
Immigration enforcement will continue on a smaller scale
Homan announced last week that 700 federal officers would leave Minnesota immediately, but that still left more than 2,000 in the state. He said Thursday that a “significant drawdown” was already underway and would continue through next week.
He didn’t specify how many officers would remain, but he said enforcement would continue in the Twin Cities. Todd Lyons, ICE’s acting director, said during a congressional hearing Thursday that the agency was still searching for about 16,840 people in Minnesota who have final orders of removal.
Homan also said mass deportations will continue across the country, and that officers leaving Minnesota will report back to their stations or be assigned elsewhere.
The focus on the Twin Cities, which Trump had pushed for partly because of fraud allegations involving Somali residents, followed increased deployments in big cities and small towns run by Democrats, including Los Angeles, Chicago, Charlotte and New Orleans.
Fallout in Congress and the courts
Even though the Twin Cities operation is ending, the fallout will continue.
The Trump administration is trying to secure votes in Congress to prevent Department of Homeland Security funding from expiring at the end of the week, with Democratic lawmakers demanding restraints on immigration officers following Good and Pretti’s killings.
And there are ongoing federal investigations into the shooting of Pretti.
The effects of the Minnesota crackdown are also still playing out in court, as federal prosecutors pursue high-profile cases against protesters and deportation cases slowly proceed.
A federal judge issued a temporary emergency order Thursday, finding that immigrants detained at a federal building in Minnesota have too many barriers to legal counsel.
Former CNN host turned independent journalist Don Lemon pleaded not guilty to federal civil rights charges Friday, accused in a protest at a Minnesota church where an ICE official is a pastor.

Journalist Don Lemon pleads not guilty to civil rights charges in Minnesota church protest
ST. PAUL, Minn. (AP) — Former CNN host turned independent journalist Don Lemon pleaded not guilty to federal civil rights charges Friday, following a protest at a Minnesota church where an Immigration and Customs Enforcement official is a pastor. Four others also pleaded not guilty in the case.
Lemon insists he was at the Cities Church in St. Paul to chronicle the Jan. 18 protest but was not a participant. The veteran journalist vowed to fight what he called “baseless charges” and protect his free speech rights.
“For more than 30 years, I’ve been a journalist, and the power and protection of the First Amendment has been the underpinning of my work. The First Amendment, the freedom of the press, are the bedrock of our democracy,” Lemon said outside the courthouse after his arraignment. “And like all of you here in Minnesota, the great people of Minnesota, I will not be intimidated, I will not back down.”
Dozens of supporters gathered outside the courthouse, chanting “Pam Bondi has got to go” and “Protect the press.”
‘We the people have to stand for our rights’
Civil rights attorney Nekima Levy Armstrong was among the other defendants who pleaded not guilty Friday. The prominent local activist was the subject of a doctored photo posted on official White House social media that falsely showed her crying during her arrest. The picture is part of a deluge of AI-altered imagery that has circulated since the fatal shootings of Renee Good and Alex Pretti by federal officers in Minneapolis amid President Donald Trump’s administration’s immigration crackdown.
Levy Armstrong echoed Lemon’s defiant words after the hearing.
“We the people have to stand for our rights. We have to stand for the Constitution. We have to stand for our First Amendment rights to freedom of the speech, some freedom of assembly, and freedom of the press,” she said.
“Today we have the federal government trying to weaponize the Department of Justice in order to silence us, in order to prevent us from speaking the truth,” Levy Armstrong said. “They are trying to prevent us from calling out a manifest injustice.”
All of the defendants have been charged under the FACE Act
Protesters interrupted a service at the Southern Baptist church last month, chanting “ICE out” and “Justice for Renee Good,” referring to the 37-year-old mother of three who was fatally shot by an ICE officer in Minneapolis.
In total, nine people have been charged under the 1994 Freedom of Access to Clinic Entrances Act in relation to the church protest. The FACE Act prohibits interference or intimidation of “any person by force, threat of force, or physical obstruction exercising or seeking to exercise the First Amendment right of religious freedom at a place of religious worship.”
Two more defendants accused in the protest are scheduled for arraignment next week, including another independent journalist, Georgia Fort.
Penalties can range up to a year in prison and up to a $10,000 fine.
Attorneys for journalists seek to pierce veil of grand jury secrecy
Lawyers for Lemon and Fort filed a joint motion with the court Friday seeking transcripts of the normally secret grand jury proceedings that resulted in the indictments against the nine defendants. They maintained that Lemon and Fort were at the church protest in their capacity as journalists covering the story.
The defense attorneys noted that several judges — including the chief federal judge for Minnesota — found no probable cause to support the complaints that prosecutors first tried to file against the two journalists, so they refused to sign arrest warrants for Lemon or Fort before the government turned to the grand jury.
They said those refusals raise serious concerns about whether the government made misleading or inaccurate statements of law and/or facts to the grand jury. And they expressed concern that President Donald Trump, Attorney General Pam Bondi and other Justice Department officials put undue pressure on prosecutors to charge them.
“In the United States of America, we do not prosecute journalists for doing their job. That happens in Russia, China, Iran and other authoritarian regimes. And yet the government sold this unconstitutional mess to the grand jury,” they wrote. “Disclosure of the grand jury proceedings is necessary to ensure the government did not mislead or mis-instruct it.”
The attorneys also said prosecutors told them they will oppose the motion.
Protest provoked conservative religious backlash
Renee Carlson, an attorney with True North Legal, which is representing Cities Church, said in a statement that by pleading not guilty Lemon and others are “doubling down on their claim that the press can do whatever they want under the auspices of journalism.”
“The First Amendment does not protect premeditated schemes to violate the sanctity of a sanctuary, disrupt worship services, or intimidate children,” Carlson said. “There is no ‘press pass’ to trespass on church property or conspire to invade religious worship.”
The church protest drew sharp complaints from conservative religious and political leaders. White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt warned in a social media post at the time: “President Trump will not tolerate the intimidation and harassment of Christians in their sacred places of worship.” Even clergy who oppose the administration’s immigration enforcement tactics expressed discomfort.
Former federal prosecutor is part of Lemon’s legal team
One of Lemon’s attorneys who was in court Friday is Joe Thompson, one of several former prosecutors who have left the Minnesota U.S. Attorney’s Office in recent weeks citing frustration with the Trump administration’s immigration enforcement crackdown in the state and the Justice Department’s response to the killing of Good and Pretti.
Thompson had led the sprawling investigation of major public program fraud cases for the prosecutors office until he resigned last month. The Trump administration has cited the fraud cases, in which most defendants have come from the state’s large Somali community, as justification for its immigration crackdown.

Surprise! US Women's Curling team beats Canada for first time at the Olympics ... without knowing it
The U.S. women’s curling team was surprised to learn from AP reporters that their defeat of Canada marked an Olympic first
- Bookmark
The U.S. women's curling team was surprised to learn from AP reporters that their defeat of Canada on Friday marked an Olympic first.
“If that's true," caveated Minneapolis native Taylor Anderson-Heide, "I think we just played a really good game. They're No. 1 in the world.”
Tara Peterson, from Shoreview, Minnesota, chimed in: “It just always feels really good to beat (Canada skip) Rachel Homan. So any team to beat them, that’s pretty impressive."
Peterson, like Anderson-Heide, couldn't help but add a qualifier to her response: "Apparently, we’ve never beat them in the Olympics before. That makes it just extra special."
Though the athletes sounded somewhat unsure of AP's intel, it's true. Since 1998, when women's curling was introduced at the Olympics, teams from the U.S. and Canada have played at least once in each games. The U.S. has lost every time.
The U.S. men have beaten Canada, however, notably in the Olympic final in 2018.
Canada’s Team Homan has for years been considered the best in the world.
In Friday’s nail-biting match that went 9-8, the U.S. managed to capitalize on a few weak shots by Canada and clinch the victory. After the win, the Americans walked together down the ice and back to their coaches, raising fists in triumph.
Peterson said she thought the Canadians were less sharp than normal.
This year's American women's curling team — like their Gen-Z men's counterparts — meld approachability with ambition.
Alongside Anderson-Heide and Peterson, the team includes skip Tabitha Peterson, who's Tara's older sister, as well as cool-as-a-cucumber Cory Thiesse, who has already won a silver medal in the mixed doubles event.
Aileen Geving, from Minnesota, is an alternate.
Three of them have jobs other than curling, and three are mothers to young children. Tara's a dentist, Tabitha's a pharmacist and Thiesse a lab technician.
Tara gave birth to her son, Eddie, in September 2024 and a few months later, Tabitha had a daughter, Noelle. Geving had daughter Sienna directly following the 2018 Games.
They have several matches left in the round-robin before the semifinals on Friday. They've won two matches, against Korea and Canada and and lost one, against Sweden.

Landslide kills 1, injures 2 near Rome after heavy rains
Severe weather continues to affect parts of central Italy, reports local media
ISTANBUL
A 58-year-old man was killed and two others were injured after a landslide struck a residential building near Rome, Italian authorities said on Friday.
The incident occurred at around 10.45 pm (2045GMT) late Thursday in the municipality of Formello, on Via Nazario Sauro street, following days of heavy rainfall that triggered the collapse of part of a hillside, ANSA reported.
According to initial reports, debris swept away a three-story building after a section of the slope and a retaining wall gave way. The victim was in his ground-floor apartment at the time of the collapse.
Two other residents, who were on the upper floor, were injured and transported to the hospital. Authorities said they are not in serious condition.
Firefighters, Carabinieri officers from the Cassia company, and emergency medical services were dispatched to the scene.
An investigation is underway to determine the exact cause of the landslide, as severe weather continues to affect parts of central Italy.

WASHINGTON - President Donald Trump on Feb 13 said the United States relationship with Venezuela is “very good” and that he plans to visit the country.
Mr Trump’s praise for Venezuela’s interim leader, Ms Delcy Rodriguez, follows the US capture of Venezuelan president Nicolas Maduro
“I’m going to make a visit to Venezuela,” Mr Trump told reporters at the White House, although he did not share any additional details.
“We have a very good relationship with the president of Venezuela,” Mr Trump said, noting the United States is “working together very closely” with Ms Rodriguez on access to oil.
“The relationship we have right now with Venezuela I would say is a 10,” Mr Trump added.
Asked by Reuters if he will recognise Ms Rodriguez as the official government, Mr Trump responded, “Yeah, we have done that. We are dealing with them, and really right now they have done a great job.”
The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment on whether the official US stance towards Ms Rodriguez’s government has changed.
Trump administration officials in recent weeks made clear that the US did not recognise Ms Rodriguez’s interim government
US Energy Secretary Chris Wright in Venezuela on Feb 12 said Ms Rodriguez is the “interim president” working with the United States.
Mr Wright, in a CNN interview, said the US will not “tell Delcy what her future role” is in potential future elections, calling that decision up to the Venezuelan people.

Rules-based global order no longer exists: German Chancellor Merz

German Chancellor Friedrich Merz said Friday that the rules-based international order has eroded, outlining new proposals to confront mounting global instability and geopolitical fragmentation.
In a keynote speech at the Munich Security Conference, Merz said the world has entered a dangerous period of great power rivalries, with a growing number of wars and conflicts threatening global peace and security.
Referencing this year's conference motto, "Under Destruction," Merz cited Russia's war on Ukraine, China's growing assertiveness, challenges to U.S. leadership, and tensions in transatlantic relations as signs of a changing world order.
"The conference’s motto signifies that the international order, which is based on rights and rules, is on the verge of being destroyed. I fear we need to put it even more bluntly: this order-imperfect even at its best-no longer exists in its original form," he said.
"If there was a unipolar moment in history after the fall of the Berlin Wall, it is long gone. In any case, the leadership claim of the United States is being challenged, and may already have been lost,” the conservative leader said.
In response to growing unpredictability and threats, Merz said Germany will seek to strengthen the European Union and help build new global partnerships with key actors.
"Great power politics in Europe is not an option for Germany," Merz said, adding that Germany is ready to assume a leadership role in Europe with support from EU partners and neighbors, but has no "hegemonic fantasies” on the continent. "We Germans will never again go it alone. That is a lasting lesson from our history."
In his wide-ranging speech, Merz also addressed recent tensions between U.S. President Donald Trump and European countries. He said Europeans are committed to overcoming these tensions and strengthening NATO to meet the security challenges of the new era.
"In an era of great power rivalry, even the United States cannot go it alone," he said, stressing that NATO membership serves the interests of both Europeans and Americans. "So let's repair and revive transatlantic trust together. We, the Europeans, we are doing our part."

Saudi FM calls for urgent halt to Israel's Gaza killings

Saudi Foreign Minister Prince Faisal bin Farhan on Friday called for an immediate end to Israel's killings in Gaza and swift reconstruction of the devastated enclave, saying fatalities have continued despite a cease-fire agreement with Tel Aviv.
Speaking Friday during a panel discussion at the Munich Security Conference, the minister said the cease-fire had failed to end fatalities in Gaza, stressing the need to stop the violence and begin rebuilding the devastated territory.
Prince Faisal also emphasized the need to preserve the unity of Gaza and the West Bank, saying stability in Gaza is essential to that goal. He underscored the importance of addressing Palestinian rights, including the right to self-determination.
His remarks come amid heightened tensions in the West Bank, after Israel’s government approved measures on Sunday aimed at changing the legal and civil reality there, including expanding enforcement powers into areas designated as A and B.
An Oct. 10 cease-fire agreement ended Israel’s two-year war that began on Oct. 8, 2023. Palestinian authorities say the conflict killed more than 72,000 Palestinians, wounded over 171,000 others and caused widespread destruction affecting 90% of civilian infrastructure. The U.N. estimates reconstruction costs at approximately $70 billion.
At least 591 Palestinians have been killed and over 1,578 others injured in Israeli attacks since the ceasefire, according to Gaza’s Health Ministry.
Munich is hosting the 62nd Munich Security Conference from Friday through Sunday under tight security, as diplomats describe the current period as the most turbulent since the end of the Cold War, marked by escalating conflicts and growing uncertainty over the future of the global order.

WASHINGTON, February 13. /TASS/. US President Donald Trump said that he intends to visit Venezuela in the future.
"I'm going to make a visit to Venezuela," the White House press pool quoted the US leader as saying.
Responding to reporters’ questions, Trump emphasized that the US has "a very good relationship" with Venezuela's authorized president Delcy Rodriguez. "We are working together very closely," he added.
When asked if the US recognizes Rodriguez as head of state, Trump said: "Well, right now we have done that. We're dealing with them and right now, they've done a great job."
On January 3, the US attacked civilian and military targets in Venezuela. Venezuelan Foreign Minister Yvan Gil Pinto said that the US had attacked civilian and military targets in Caracas. He called Washington's actions military aggression. The US later confirmed the strikes and announced the capture and removal of Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro and his wife from the country. On January 5, they appeared before a federal court in the Southern District of New York. The couple was charged with involvement in drug trafficking. Neither Maduro nor his wife pleaded guilty. Rodriguez, who served as executive vice president under Maduro, is currently acting as head of state in Venezuela. The US administration has stated that Washington will temporarily take over the administration of Venezuela and expressed confidence that it will obtain compensation for US oil companies from Caracas.

A man has been shot at the Arc de Triomphe monument in Paris after he wielded a knife and tried to attack police, officials said.
The attacker targeted an officer securing a ceremony for relighting the eternal flame honoring unknown soldiers at the Napoleon-era landmark, according to a Paris police official.
Another officer shot the attacker, who was hospitalized, the official said.
No bystanders or police officers were injured in the incident, the official told The Associated Press.
The French counterterrorism prosecutor’s office said it is investigating the case and sent an investigator to the scene.
The Arc de Triomphe is one of Paris' most famous sites, and sits atop the busy Champs-Elysees avenue.
A large police presence was visible Friday evening near the monument, which was closed to the public. The traffic circle surrounding the Arc de Triomphe remained open to vehicles.
The nearby metro station was closed for security reasons at the request of police, Paris public transport operator RATP said.
No other details were immediately available.

ADL urged Mamdani to disavow ‘Hot Girls 4 Zohran’ co-founder as Brooklyn hire draws fire

The Anti-Defamation League New York/New Jersey escalated its criticism of Zohran Mamdani this week, citing concerns about both a senior Brooklyn appointment and the mayor’s continued proximity to an activist group that helped energize his campaign.
On Thursday, the ADL said Mamdani’s selection of Alvaro Lopez as Brooklyn Borough Director raised “serious concerns,” pointing to a now-deleted social media post and to Lopez’s past activism.
The role is seen inside City Hall as a key liaison post for Brooklyn, home to one of the largest Jewish populations in the US. In the statement quoted by a local New York-area publication, the ADL said the borough includes “approximately 500,000 Jewish New Yorkers.”
The ADL said that on November 3, 2023, less than a month after Hamas and other terror groups abducted 251 people from Israel on October 7, Lopez referred to individuals seen ripping down posters of hostages as “heroes” in a post that was later deleted.
It also said Lopez attended events in 2024 and 2025 that “featured pro-Hamas rhetoric” or explicitly called for Israel’s destruction, and it highlighted his involvement with the Democratic Socialists of America - NYC chapter, which it described as having promoted extreme anti-Israel messaging since October 7.
'Hot Girls 4 Zohran'
In a separate post the same day, the ADL publicly called on Mamdani to distance himself from Kaif Gilani, a co-founder of Hot Girls 4 Zohran, arguing that Gilani had a history of sharing antisemitic content and pro-Hamas rhetoric online, mocking Israeli victims of terror, amplifying conspiracy theories from a Holocaust revisionist, denying sexual violence committed by Hamas on October 7, and calling for Israel’s eradication.
The ADL said the group, now rebranded as Hot Girls Organize, “continue[s] to be embraced by” Mamdani, and asked whether the mayor’s office would “cut ties and disavow” Gilani, as it said the office of Brad Lander had done.
Lander’s campaign said it severed its relationship with Gilani’s firm after reports about the consultant’s social media activity surfaced. In a New York Jewish Week newsletter item published February 11, 2026, the outlet reported that Lander’s team said it was unaware of the account and ended the relationship, with a spokesperson saying the posts did not reflect Lander’s views.
The controversy spilled into state politics this week. A New York Jewish Week roundup reported that after Mamdani testified about the city budget in Albany, he dodged a question about Gilani from Politico, after Jewish Insider reported that Gilani circulated pro-Hamas content and conspiracy theories about Israel.
Mamdani’s office did not immediately respond to the ADL’s latest criticism or to questions about whether City Hall intends to publicly disavow Gilani.

Your Taxes: Israel moves charities online for tax breaks
Unknown
Unknown Publisher

03:49:05 KST

Charity used to begin at home, but now in Israel, it begins on the home page. As of January 1, the Israel Tax Authority required all charities to move over to an online system of digital donations called “Israel Donations” (Terumot Yisrael). That’s if donors want to continue enjoying a tax break for their generosity. The aim is to stamp out fake donation receipts.
Main tax break
Donations to charities ranging from NIS 207 to NIS 10,354,816 (in 2026) generally confer a 35% tax credit for individuals, or 23% for companies, if various conditions are met. In particular, the charity must be approved by the ITA (under Israel Tax Ordinance Section 46), and the tax break is capped at 30% of taxable income. For example, if you donate NIS 1,000 to an approved charity, your tax bill may go down by NIS 350.
How it works
The Israel Donations system electronically issues the charity a report number to be inserted on each donation receipt in addition to the regular receipt number. The donor doesn’t have to keep the receipt in paper form to claim a tax break.
Instead, starting in 2026, details of each donation reported are immediately stored electronically on the ITA’s system. The donor can access these details in his online “personal area” (Eizor Ishi) in the ITA system.
If you haven’t yet logged onto your “personal area,” you will need to sooner or later. This is how the government now communicates with you without postal delays.
The donor can use the digital donations to claim the charity tax breaks in his or her annual tax return.
But the individual can claim the tax break sooner if: (1) his employer has appropriate payroll software that can handle digital donations and give the tax break on the next monthly paycheck, or (2) when doing a tax adjustment (Tium Mas) if someone has more than one employer.
If the employer has the appropriate software that can handle digital donations, the employee still has to agree to its use. The employer only gets to know how much in total the employee donated, not which charities benefited.
Limitations
Employees cannot claim the tax break for donations over NIS 25,000 per year via their employer. If they do donate more than this amount, they can only claim a tax break for the excess after the year-end on an annual tax return.
If the employer uses a payroll bureau, there are procedures enabling them to provide the charity tax breaks on their software. Only employees designated by the senior management of the bureau can deal with this.
Self-employed freelancers can only claim tax breaks on their annual tax return.
In all cases, donors need to give the identity number to the charity so that they can be credited with each donation in the Donations Israel system.
What the charity should do
To qualify for approval under ITO Section 46 (meaning their donors get tax breaks), charities must register on the Israel Donations system and say which charity personnel are authorized for these purposes.
The new Israel Donations system is available to charities that issue digital donation receipts to named donors whose identity number is known. In the case of charities still issuing paper receipts, another online app can be used to obtain the report numbers for each donation receipt. But this is less recommended, as it involves keying in manually all the donation information into the system. So, charities (local synagogues, etc.) should consider investing in digital-receipt software.
Donations can be in a foreign currency if a special currency code number is added. If donations are by way of standing order, receipts must be issued each year for amounts received in that year. Donations in kind must be marked “in kind.” Donations can be anonymous if marked “anonymous,” but the donor gets no Israeli tax break.
Comment – US olim
The US-Israel tax treaty lets Israeli residents receive both the above 35% Israeli tax credit and a deduction under US law if they are also US taxpayers. This applies to charitable contributions to a charitable organization for US tax purposes that support Israeli causes, i.e., US “Friends of Israel” organizations. The tax break is limited to contributions not exceeding 25% of taxable income from US sources.
Unfortunately, it is not clear whether US olim (immigrants) donating to US Friends of Israel charities can avail themselves of the new Israeli digital donation system.
As always, consult experienced professional advisers in each country concerned at an early stage in specific cases.

Your Investments: The key to responsible planning after receiving an inheritance

So, the Seattle Seahawks won the Super Bowl earlier this week. As a long-suffering Seattle sports fan, it’s nice to win a major sports title. While it’s definitely fun to win, I must admit that while I am a true fan and stay up late Sunday nights/Monday mornings to watch their games, I’m not as emotionally invested as I used to be. What gave me the most joy and feeling of success as a parent was watching the games with my sons while eating wings, hot dogs, some steaks, chips and salsa and onion rings between 2am-4am. While I’m still nauseous from that meal days later, I do feel a sense of pride! The food, along with the game, was a bonding experience.
Earlier this week I sat with a man who received a substantial inheritance. He is retired and his mother passed away at a rather advanced age as you can figure out. He received about $1,250,000. He never had much savings or pension and is living on a small amount of US Social Security and an even smaller amount of Bituach Leumi. After asking some more questions, it became clear that he needs about $30,000 a year in supplementary income.
I mentioned that the amount is doable and that he can have a portfolio where he will be able to take that out and, over time, should be able to even slowly grow the portfolio. Then he threw a wrench into the plan. “I forgot to tell you that I inherited $1,250,000, but I promised my married kids(7) money for a down payment, was thinking about starting a vending machine business and was thinking of buying an investment apartment as well because he only needs to put 10% down. Yikes. That certainly changes things. He literally spread himself too thin and could have potential money problems down the road, especially if he needs to start eating principle from the get-go.
I mentioned that he should scrap the investment property idea. I said that while you only need to put 10% down now, at some point in the not-too-distant future, you need to come up with the rest of the money. That amount, plus the down payment promised to the kids, will wipe you out. And as for the vending machines, I said to just do things by the book and invest in a moderate growth type of portfolio. Keep it simple, don’t fall for some kind of vending machine scam.
I receive calls all the time from heirs. They have come into money and need help planning and managing it. I can tell you that the above story, while maybe a bit extreme, is quite typical. The difference tends to be that the inheritor is thinking about all the things they want to do with the money and the meeting I mentioned actually went ahead and fulfilled his dreams.
An inheritance should be a blessing
Personal finance guru, Dave Ramsey, writes, “Receiving an inheritance from a family member should be a blessing. But too often, it becomes a curse. It’s estimated that $68 trillion worth of assets will pass down from Baby Boomers to younger generations over the next 25 years, and many of those heirs won’t know how to put their inheritance to good use. More than one-third of all inheritors see no change or a decline in their wealth after getting an inheritance.
Did you catch that? Some folks see their wealth decrease after they inherit a financial windfall. We’ve seen too many people get an inheritance and then throw it all away. They go on a few vacations, buy a fancy new car, and before they know it, the money is gone, and they have nothing to show for it.”
When you receive an inheritance, it’s important to take your time before making any decisions. You are in the midst of grieving, and you are overly emotional and not able to make rational decisions. I recommend waiting a couple of months before making decisions. Then, in honor of the deceased, I think it’s a great idea to give some of the money to charity. What better way to honor their name than to help out and give back to society? If you have debt, outside of a mortgage, then pay it off.
You can certainly use some of this money to improve your financial future. Paying down some or all of your mortgage and investing for the long term are two things that you can do today, that will be hugely beneficial down the road.
And finally, there is nothing wrong with enjoying some of the money. Obviously, it depends on your specific financial situation, and how much you have received, but in most cases using some money for a vacation, or the much-needed kitchen renovation is reasonable.
Be smart and deliberate after receiving an inheritance to make sure that you take care of your own financial future before you start promising the world to others. .

Palestinian cars smashed in West Bank altercation after attack on illegal settler farm

An altercation erupted between Palestinians and Israeli settlers around the village of Talfit on Friday morning, Army Radio reported.
According to reports, Palestinians approached an illegal farm established by Jewish settlers on private land in Area B of the West Bank. Police told KAN that dozens of Palestinians attacked the farm, and that two of the settlers required medical attention.
In retaliation, the settlers descended on Talfit, damaging cars and attacking the residents. Locals claim that Hilltop Youth smashed seven cars, and that four people were wounded, including one by gunfire.
The IDF dispersed the chaos and remained in the village. Police opened an investigation, but no arrests have been reported.
Conflicts in West Bank expected to increase
Conflicts between Palestinians and settlers in the West Bank have occurred several times in recent months, and are expected to increase following a court decision on Sunday altering how West Bank land is treated.
Until Sunday, a series of rules were in place requiring additional approvals from the IDF legal division, the Civil Administration, the Palestinian Authority, and others for purchasing or building on land in the West Bank.
On Sunday, the government announced that it was repealing or streamlining many of those rules to make it easier for Jewish Israelis to acquire land in areas where, previously, doing so had been much harder.

DUBAI, Feb 13 - Iran on Friday released on bail three prominent reformist figures arrested last week amid a sweeping government crackdown on dissent, one of their lawyers told the semi-official ISNA news agency.
Lawyer Hojjat Kermani said the freed activists included Azar Mansouri, head of the moderate Reform Front coalition, along with Javad Emam and Ebrahim Asgharzadeh. He said he was not told what charges his clients may face.
The releases come as authorities try to quell the country's bloodiest unrest since the 1979 Islamic Revolution through a campaign of mass arrests and intimidation.
The U.S.-based rights group HRANA said about 53,000 people have so far been arrested, and the total number of killed had reached 7,008, including 6,509 protesters. Reuters could not independently verify the figures, and Iranian officials could not immediately be reached for comment. REUTERS

‘They will fire every missile’: Israel braces for worst-case Iran scenario
Unknown
Unknown Publisher

03:45:13 KST

As the diplomatic channel between the United States and Iran continues, Israel is preparing for war. Jerusalem’s red lines are nowhere near Tehran’s, which refuses even to consider limits on its missile program — the same missiles that caused destruction in Israel during the 12-day war.
For Iran, its ballistic missile program is not merely a weapons system but a supreme strategic asset, possibly even more important than its nuclear project, given its proven ability to paralyze Israel’s home front and inflict significant damage despite advanced defense systems. Lessons from the war — in which Israel was forced to manage a “munitions economy” in the face of hundreds of launches, intercepting most of them yet still sustaining heavy damage — reinforced in Tehran the view that Israel is vulnerable to attrition attacks that could deplete its interceptor stockpiles.
Because Iran views its missile array as a primary tool of deterrence and decisive force, intelligence assessments conclude it will not relinquish it even under U.S. pressure in negotiations. That hard line places the region on what officials describe as a collision course — either signing an agreement that leaves Israel exposed to a significant threat, or sliding toward all-out war. In response, Israel’s air defense system — composed of seven battalions deployed nationwide and built around five layers — is preparing alongside the U.S. military, and possibly an international coalition.
Worst-case scenario
Tal Inbar, a senior research fellow at the Missile Defense Advocacy Alliance, told ynet that Iran’s launch capabilities have not changed significantly from previous attacks, though the regime still possesses dozens of heavier missiles that have not yet been used.
“We have not seen the capability for extremely massive fire — not many hundreds or thousands simultaneously,” Inbar said. “But in a war in which the Iranian regime feels these are its final hours, it will fire everything it has. In such a case, one could imagine strikes even on symbolic targets that are not military.”
He stressed that these are extreme scenarios. “One can assume that if the United States initiates the attack, there would be an operation designed to prevent as much as possible the use of these tools. The U.S. can do things Israel cannot, for example a barrage of hundreds of cruise missiles on various launch sites in Iran. These are things we have not seen before.”
The U.S. 'large armada'
During the most recent confrontation with Iran, the Israel Defense Forces made extensive use of its defense systems. Reports last month claimed Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu asked President Donald Trump to delay a strike on Iran partly due to interceptor shortages. Since then, large American forces have arrived in the region, also to assist with interceptions — despite significant interceptor use in defending Israel in June last year and challenges in replenishing stockpiles.
Israel’s air defense systems are undergoing tests, adjustments and upgrades to address evolving threats. Still, U.S. assistance — providing a broader response to Iranian threats even far from Israeli territory — remains a critical component of the defense array.
As part of coordination between Israel and the United States, IDF Chief of Staff Lt. Gen. Eyal Zamir made a secret visit to Washington about two weeks ago, following visits by Military Intelligence chief Maj. Gen. Shlomi Binder and Mossad chief David Barnea. Zamir met with Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen. Dan Caine for high-level strategic coordination. Senior American officials have also visited Israel, including U.S. Central Command chief Adm. Brad Cooper. The guided-missile destroyer USS Delbert D. Black docked in Eilat and will continue operating in the Red Sea as part of what Trump described as a “large armada” sent to the region. The deployment includes the aircraft carrier USS Abraham Lincoln, the USS Gerald R. Ford en route to the Middle East and eight additional destroyers.
According to reports, at least 10 U.S. warships are now in the Middle East. The Lincoln carrier strike group includes the destroyers USS Michael Murphy, USS Frank E. Petersen Jr. and USS Spruance. Other destroyers in the region carry guided missiles capable of neutralizing aerial threats. The Wall Street Journal reported the United States has at least eight destroyers within range to shoot down Iranian missiles and drones: two near the Strait of Hormuz, three in the northern Arabian Sea, one in the Red Sea and two in the eastern Mediterranean.
Fox News identified additional vessels, including USS McFaul and USS Mitscher near the Strait of Hormuz, USS Delbert D. Black, and USS Roosevelt and USS Bulkeley in the eastern Mediterranean.
The Journal also reported that the United States is deploying an additional THAAD battery and Patriot systems at bases where its forces are stationed across the Middle East, including Jordan, Kuwait, Bahrain, Saudi Arabia and Qatar. Satellite images show an additional Patriot battery positioned at Al Udeid Air Base in Qatar, a primary U.S. base in the region that was targeted in Iran’s response to strikes on its nuclear facilities in June last year. THAAD systems can intercept ballistic missiles outside the atmosphere, while Patriot systems defend against lower-altitude, shorter-range threats.
Reports say the U.S. has also deployed three squadrons of F-15E fighter jets to Jordan, which could play a role in downing Iranian drones. Those aircraft carried out similar missions during Iran’s first direct attack on Israel in April 2024, in what the U.S. Air Force described as its largest aerial engagement with an adversary in more than 50 years. In addition, six Vermont Air National Guard F-35 jets were recently seen landing in the Azores after being moved from the Caribbean closer to the Middle East. Several U.S. Navy EA-18G Growler electronic warfare aircraft have also relocated from Puerto Rico to Spain in recent weeks.
International coalition expected to assist
During Iranian attacks in April and October 2024, several countries assisted in defending Israel by intercepting drones and missiles and sharing intelligence. The United States, Britain, France and Jordan helped thwart the April 2024 attack. According to the Journal, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and other Arab states also took part, quietly sharing intelligence and radar data.
However, during Operation Rising Lion, the international coalition focused more on de-escalation efforts and preventing a broader war, playing a less active role in intercepting launches from Iran. With increased U.S. involvement — and its willingness to lead a strike rather than merely join one — questions remain about how that coalition would respond.
Inbar said past experience demonstrated the effectiveness of regional defense, beginning with detection capabilities largely based on U.S. space assets and the engagement of threats by friendly forces throughout the region. “The coalition and international defense were most evident in the April attack,” he said. “We did not see that in Operation Rising Lion aside from the Americans — and now we may see it again. There is no doubt that if missiles fly that Saudi Arabia or Abu Dhabi can intercept, they will do so.”
He added that in a future confrontation, energy facilities in the Gulf could also come under attack. “If there is a strike, this time they could target assets of value to Iran, such as oil and gas loading terminals or other energy infrastructure not previously attacked.”
First and second layers: accelerated Arrow production
In July last year, following heavy use of Arrow interceptors during the war with Iran, Defense Ministry Director General Maj. Gen. (res.) Amir Baram signed an order to significantly accelerate Arrow interceptor production at Israel Aerospace Industries. The system intercepts ballistic threats outside and at the edge of the atmosphere and defends Israel against long-range strategic threats. Officials describe it as among the world’s most advanced air defense systems.
The Arrow system includes two variants: Arrow 2 and Arrow 3. After long-range ballistic missile launches, the first defensive layer is Arrow 3, a two-stage interceptor that destroys targets at ranges of up to about 2,400 kilometers (1,500 miles) and altitudes of about 100 kilometers (62 miles) outside the atmosphere through direct impact. U.S. Navy SM-3 interceptors, deployed during Operation Rising Lion, can also intercept missiles inside and outside the atmosphere at ranges of up to about 1,200 kilometers (750 miles).
Missiles that evade exo-atmospheric interception are handled by Arrow 2, the second layer, which intercepts long-range ballistic missiles within the atmosphere at altitudes of up to about 100 kilometers and ranges of up to about 1,500 kilometers. The U.S. THAAD system, if deployed in Israel, can also intercept such threats at altitudes of 100 to 150 kilometers and ranges of up to 300 kilometers, sometimes even during the missile’s boost phase.
Last month, Zamir visited an Arrow battalion, assessed readiness and led a drill simulating a missile attack on Israel.
Third layer: upgraded David’s Sling
Earlier this week, in light of existing and emerging threats, the Defense Ministry completed a series of tests on the David’s Sling air defense system, designed to intercept rockets, missiles, cruise missiles, aircraft and drones. Officials said the tests incorporated lessons from combat and included challenging scenarios.
David’s Sling constitutes the third layer of Israel’s multilayered defense system, after the two Arrow layers. It intercepts medium-range missiles and heavy rockets at altitudes of about 15 to 70 kilometers (9 to 43 miles) and counters cruise missiles through direct impact within the atmosphere. During Operation Rising Lion, it also intercepted missile debris.
Defense officials described the successful tests as another technological and operational leap forward for a system that demonstrated high performance during the war, with successful interceptions that saved lives and prevented heavy damage.
Fourth layer: Iron Dome on land and at sea
The Iron Dome system, which continues to incorporate lessons from the 12-day war, is expected to play a central role in any future confrontation with Iran. It constitutes the fourth layer of Israel’s air defense envelope and intercepts short-range rockets, missiles and mortars at altitudes of about 10 to 15 kilometers (6 to 9 miles). The system can also intercept threats aimed at populated areas or strategic sites, as well as missile debris and unmanned aircraft.
A battery commander in the 947th Iron Dome Battalion told ynet that current versions of the system have evolved significantly since Operation Rising Lion, with ongoing implementation of lessons learned in what she described as an arms race with Iran.
Alongside the land-based system, the Navy operates a sea-based Iron Dome variant deployed on Sa’ar 6 corvettes. Its first interception occurred in April 2024. The ships are also equipped with Barak missiles that intercept larger and more distant threats. The naval system is designed to protect offshore infrastructure, including gas platforms.
During Operation Rising Lion, another system, Barak MX, joined the defense effort and intercepted dozens of threats from Iran in its early days. The modular, multi-mission system provides sea-to-air and surface-to-air defense against aircraft, helicopters, drones, anti-ship missiles and cruise missiles. It was originally designed to protect naval vessels and strategic maritime assets.
Fifth layer: the laser that changes everything
Less than two months ago, at the end of 2025, Israel delivered for the first time its high-powered laser system, Iron Beam, adding it to David’s Sling, Arrow, Iron Dome and the naval system, as well as Air Force fighter jets and helicopters that have also intercepted drones and cruise missiles.
The Defense Ministry said the laser, developed over more than a decade, proved effective in extensive tests against various threats, successfully intercepting rockets, mortars and drones. Unlike previous systems, Iron Beam uses an advanced laser source and a unique electro-optical targeting system to intercept a wide range of targets with upgraded range, maximum precision and high efficiency at negligible marginal cost.
Originally known as “Magen Or” and earlier as “Iron Beam,” the system is an Israeli laser-based active defense platform against short-range rockets, missiles and mortars, as well as aircraft, drones and gliders. Developed by Rafael Advanced Defense Systems in cooperation with Elbit Systems, it is considered groundbreaking and the first of its kind in the world. It forms the fifth layer of Israel’s air defense array.

MOSCOW, February 13. /TASS/. The Russian stock market ended the trading session on Friday with rising indicators, according to Moscow Exchange data.
The MOEX Russia Index grew by 0.39% to 2,776.34 points. The RTS Index added 0.38% to 1,132.99 points. The yuan rate moved downward by seven kopecks to 11.09 rubles.
"The uncertainty level went down - firstly, it has become known today that the next round of talks on Ukraine will be held in Geneva on February 17-18; secondly, the Central Bank lowered the key rate by 50 basis points to 15.5%," Alexander Shepelev from BCS Investment World said.
"Stocks of Sistema (+3.9%) were growth leaders in the stock market, likely as a response to key rate lowering," Natalya Milchakova from Freedom Finance Global said. Norilsk Nickel securities fell the most (-2.9%), probably during the correction after the release of IFRS reporting statements for 2025, she noted.
BCS Investment World believes the MOEX Russia Index will move within the corridor of 2,700 - 2,850 points on Monday. Freedom Finance Global believes the index will be within 2,700 - 2,800 points.

President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Friday that Europe should be “independent” in partnership with the US, as the first day of the 2026 Munich Security Conference came to an end.
The annual conference, which is scheduled to take place from Feb. 13-15, brings together heads of state, ministers, researchers, journalists, and civil society to debate pressing international security policy.

“Europe needs an independent and strong defense industry – in partnership with the United States. I believe that Europe should be independent, with strong security guarantees,” Zelensky said in a Telegram post on Friday.
Zelensky said that Ukraine is ready to share its battlefield experience with European allies – adding that Kyiv counts on its “strategic partnership with Germany and other European countries.”
“We can share our experience, and I am glad that during this Munich Security Conference we are opening joint production,” he continued – apparently referring to the production of Ukrainian drones in Germany, which Zelensky previously said would begin before the end of February.
Later, the president met with German Chancellor Friedrich Merz, with whom he discussed the “first significant results” of joint production and “how to scale it up.”
Earlier on Friday, Merz made his opening address to the conference – telling attendees that the global order “no longer exists.”

“The leadership claim of the US is being challenged, perhaps already lost,” Merz said, as per Politico.
Zelensky also met with Reza Pahlavi, whose father was the Shah of Iran deposed in 1979.
“We condemned the cooperation between Russia and Iran, in particular the Iranian regime’s supply of Shaheds to Russia and the transfer of licenses for the corresponding production,” Zelensky said. “Such a partnership poses a real threat not only to Ukraine, but also to the entire region.”

State Department orders nonprofit libraries to stop processing passport applications

State Department orders nonprofit libraries to stop processing passport applications
The State Department has ordered nonprofit public libraries to stop taking passport applications, cutting off a popular local service
- Bookmark
The U.S. State Department has ordered certain public libraries nationwide to cease processing passport applications, disrupting a long-standing service that librarians say their communities have come to rely on and that has run smoothly for years.
The agency, which regulates U.S. passports, began issuing cease and desist orders to not-for-profit libraries in late fall, informing them they were no longer authorized to participate in the Passport Acceptance Facility program as of Friday.
“We still get calls daily seeking that service,” said Cathleen Special, executive director of the Otis Library in Norwich, Connecticut, where passport services were offered for 18 years but ceased in November after receiving the letter. “Our community was so used to us offering this.”
A State Department spokesperson said the order was given because federal law and regulations “clearly prohibit non-governmental organizations” from collecting and retaining fees for a passport application. Government-run libraries are not impacted.
The spokesperson did not respond to questions as to why it has become an issue now and exactly how many libraries are impacted by the cease and desist order. In a statement, they said, “passport services has over 7,500 acceptance facilities nationwide and the number of libraries found ineligible makes up less than one percent of our total network.”
The American Library Association estimates about 1,400 mostly non-profit public libraries nationwide could potentially be affected, or about 15% of all public libraries, depending on how many offer passport services.
Democratic and Republican members of Congress from Connecticut, Pennsylvania, New York, New Jersey and Maryland are pushing back, sending a letter to Secretary of State Marco Rubio this month asking him to extend the existing program until Congress finds a permanent solution.
"In a time when demand for passports is surging, libraries are among the most accessible passport acceptance facilities, particularly for working families and rural residents,” the members wrote.
The lawmakers' letter said people will have to travel long distances, take unpaid time off from work or forgo getting a passport when demand is surging due to Real ID requirements. If Republicans in Congress impose strict new voting rules, citizens could need their passport or birth certificate to register. People fearing immigration agents are also increasingly carrying passports to confirm their citizenship.
They said the change is particularly disruptive to their states, where many public libraries are structured as nonprofit entities. They predicted some libraries, which benefit financially from passport processing fees, will have to lay off staff, cut programs or close their doors if not allowed to continue providing passport services.
Public libraries are organized differently in each state. In Pennsylvania 85% of public libraries are non-profit organizations, versus being a department of a local municipal government. In Maine, it's 56%; Rhode Island, 54%, New York, 47% and Connecticut, 46%, according to the American Library Association.
Pennsylvania Reps. Madeleine Dean, a Democrat, and John Joyce, a Republican, have proposed bipartisan legislation that would allow 501(c)(3) non-profit public libraries to continue to serve as passport acceptance facilities by amending the Passport Act of 1920. A similar companion bill is pending in the Senate.
Dean, who first learned about the policy change from a library in her district that has provided passport services for 20 years, called the State Department's interpretation of the law “nonsense.”
In Joyce's rural, south-central Pennsylvania district, the Marysville-Rye Library is one of only two passport facilities serving the 556-square-mile Perry County, according to the letter to Rubio. Now the county courthouse will be the only remaining option.
The State Department noted that 99% of the U.S. population lives within 20 miles of a designated passport processing location, such as a post office, county clerk's office or government-run library authorized to accept in-person passport applications.
“Should the removal of an ineligible facility affect passport services, we will work to identify new eligible program partners in the impacted area,” the agency spokesperson said.
But Special said the Norwich post office had often referred people to her library for passports when someone needed service outside regular hours or had children who needed to be watched and entertained while their parent filled out the paperwork. Library staff also assisted applicants with language barriers.
“And now the burden falls on them to do all of it and that’s tough on them," she said of the post office down the street. "I don’t know how they’re keeping up, to be honest, because it was such a popular service with us.”

Ring cuts surveillance firm ties amid Super bowl ad outcry
February 13, 2026Under pressure from the United States public, doorbell camera maker Ring has announced a "joint decision" to end its partnership with Flock Safety, a tech company that operates automated license-plate reading systems.
The two US-based businesses have faced backlash over concerns that their products could be used by AI systems and law enforcement to spy on users.
"Following a comprehensive review, we determined the planned Flock Safety integration would require significantly more time and resources than anticipated," Ring said in a statement posted on Thursday.
"The integration never launched, so no Ring customer videos were ever sent to Flock Safety," the statement reads.
However, the statement makes no reference to the "Search Party" feature at the center of the current controversy. And while Flock Safety is under fire over its products being used to support the work of ICE and the US Border Patrol, it remains unclear whether ending the partnership will in any way affect Ring's "Search Party" feature, which is already operating.
Ring and its CEO on blast over Superbowl ad
The Amazon-owned Ring triggered public outcry with a 30-second ad aired during the Super bowl last Sunday.
The final NFL game, watched by nearly 125 million people, included a commercial about a fictional family losing their dog and finding it using Ring's "Search Party" feature through a network of connected outdoor cameras. The ad also features Ring founder and CEO Jamie Siminoff.
"'Search Party' from Ring uses AI to help families find lost dogs... Be a hero in your neighborhood with 'Search Party'," Siminoff's voice-over says.
However, users and experts quickly pointed out that the feature could be used to track human beings.
"Amazon Ring already integrates biometric identification, like face recognition, into its products via features like 'Familiar Faces'," privacy nonprofit Electronic Frontier Foundation wrote on Tuesday.
"It doesn't take much to imagine Ring eventually combining these two features: face recognition and neighborhood searches."
Massachusetts Senator Ed Markey also blasted the ad on social media, calling it "mass surveillance."
"What this ad doesn't show: Ring also rolled out facial recognition for humans. I wrote to them months ago about this. Their answer? They won't ask for your consent."
What did Ring say?
Responding to the controversy, Ring spokesperson Emma Daniels told The Verge that the "Search Party" feature was designed to track dogs and was "not capable of processing human biometrics."
Pressed on the potential for tracking people, she said those features "are not capable of that today."
"We don't comment on feature road maps, but I have no knowledge or indication that we're building features like that at this point," she told the US tech outlet.

Colombia: Four months after the attack on Yendri Velásquez and Luis Peche, justice remains pending

Four months after the armed attack against Venezuelan activists Yendri Velásquez and Luis Peche in Bogotá, the authorities have yet to present clear progress in the investigation or guarantee full protection measures, warns Amnesty International, while expressing concern over the risks faced by many Venezuelans who have been forced to flee their country without receiving adequate international protection.
“This attack cannot be treated as an isolated case. It reflects the risks faced by migrants and refugees, especially those who have been targeted for their activism. The state’s obligation is to protect and investigate urgently. Every day without progress deepens the harm,” said Valentina Ballesta, America’s Deputy Director for research at Amnesty International.

Colombia is the main host country for Venezuelans displaced by the prolonged human rights crisis in their country. In this context, Amnesty International recalls that states receiving migrants and refugees have clear obligations under international law: they must not only allow entry or stay in their territory, but also ensure effective access to asylum-seeking procedures without unreasonable delay, adopt timely protection measures against foreseeable risks to life and integrity, and investigate and punish acts of violence with due diligence.
“The case of our colleague Yendri Velásquez and Luis Peche illustrates how administrative barriers to the timely recognition of refugee status generate risks — particularly for people who defend human rights and who should therefore be subject to special protection, given they face particular risks,” said Marcos Gómez, Amnesty International’s Venezuelan section director.

Four months after the attack, Amnesty International warns that the lack of clear and effective investigative results prolongs the suffering of the victims and sends a dangerous message of tolerance toward such attacks — particularly in a country like Colombia, which has faced a longstanding crisis of violence against human rights defenders. Impunity is also a form of violence; when states fail to investigate seriously and promptly, they breach their duty to protect, and erode trust in institutions.
“People live in fear in Venezuela, and those of us outside the country do too. The state has the responsibility to protect us and to investigate what happened. We will continue to speak out because silence will not protect us,” said Yendri Velásquez, Amnesty International member.

Amnesty International urges Colombia’s Attorney General’s Office to advance immediately with a thorough and impartial investigation into this attack; ensure adequate protection measures for the victims; and reaffirm in practice its commitment to international protection for those seeking safety.
Likewise, we remind the migration authorities of Colombia and across the Americas that international protection is not a discretionary concession: it is a legal duty and an ethical responsibility. Amnesty International will continue to monitor this situation and demand justice for any attack against people in need of international protection.

A battered car forces William Byron into a backup for his Daytona 500 three-peat bid

A battered car forces William Byron into a backup for his Daytona 500 three-peat bid
William Byron chases an unprecedented third straight Daytona 500 win Sunday when he attempts to make NASCAR history
- Bookmark
William Byron will try to drive his way into NASCAR history Sunday when he attempts to become the first winner of three consecutive Daytona 500s.
He'll have to do it in a backup Chevrolet after his preferred No. 24 was damaged in a qualifying race at Daytona International Speedway.
No big deal, though: Byron won his first Daytona 500 in 2024 in a Hendrick Motorsports backup car.
“We’ve won this race with a backup car, so I’m not super worried on that aspect,” Byron said. “But it does suck that you put a lot of work into the primary and you don’t get to race it.”
He will start 39th in the 41-car field in NASCAR's season opener but isn't concerned about being in the back of the pack. Byron was hardly dominant in winning the last two Daytona 500s — he led a total combined 14 laps in both victories — and his success has been rooted in being in the right place at the right time.
No driver in 67 previous Daytona 500s has won “The Great American Race” three years in a row. Richard Petty in 1975, Cale Yarborough in 1985, Sterling Marlin in 1996 and Denny Hamlin in 2021 all came up short.
“It’s hard. You’re going to need things to fall your way," Hamlin said of Byron's chances. "In 2021, I legit thought we were going to get (it). We led the most laps in that race, was really fast, but didn’t work out on the last pit sequence.
"There’s an element of fortune there that has to fall your way. Last year, he was fortunate on the last lap there, but if you put yourself in the top eight you can get fortunate at times. He puts himself in the top eight, which is what matters.”
Byron came from nowhere last year — he was ninth at the start of the final lap of overtime — when a monstrous wreck in front of him allowed Byron to squeeze through and snag the win after leading all of 10 laps the entire day.
He led only four laps in 2024 — and dropped as low as 34th during the race — but again was in position to pounce when it mattered. He navigated a last-lap scramble to take the lead right before a caution flag froze the field to win under yellow.
Luck? Maybe. But it takes skill to be able to capitalize when the opportunity arises.
“It just feels like I’ve been, at this track in particular, able to have some things go my way and also make good decisions in those moments that I had opportunities," Byron said. “It’s a mix of being in the right place and then having those chances to make good decisions.”
His two-year run is a remarkable turnaround for Byron, who has only finished half of his 16 career starts at Daytona, crashing out eight times.
“I feel like for a while it was a joke; I couldn’t finish a race here,” Byron said. “My first six years, I couldn’t finish the race, but I was always in the mix. I think it’s kind of finally tipped the other way.”
Byron has five career victories at drafting tracks — two at Atlanta and three at Daytona (he won the summer race in 2020). But he thinks his ability to master the draft and navigate through traffic turned in his favor at Talladega, where he has five top-five finishes.
“I feel like we’ve had some things go our way, and then we’ve been good at the speedways. Really, it started at Talladega. I think we were better at Talladega for a while," Byron said. "We weren’t finishing at Daytona, and once we figured out a way to finish the races at Daytona, it seemed like it started to go the other way.
"You just try to do the best job you can, learning the little nuances of the draft. I don’t think I’m the best at drafting at the moment. I think there’s still more to learn.”
Hendrick Motorsports owner Rick Hendrick, winner of a NASCAR-record 20 Daytona 500s, doesn't believe Byron's success at Daytona has been tied solely to luck. He noted that Byron has raced for the NASCAR championship the last three years and has racked up 16 career victories in the No. 24 Chevrolet.
“I don't know if you can really luck into it. You've got to put yourself in position to do it," Hendrick said. "William is probably underestimated as a plate racer; he's one of the best out there. If you watch his way through traffic and the success he's had, not just because he's won the two Daytona's back-to-back, because he's been up there, he’s just getting more mature — not mature — more seasoned.”
Busch tries to end drought
Kyle Busch starts on the pole for the first time in his 21 attempts to win the Daytona 500, and at 0 for 20, his drought is the longest among active drivers in the field.
Even worse, Busch takes a 93-race losing streak into Sunday that dates to 2023, his first season driving for Richard Childress Racing. It's a frustrating drought for Busch, a two-time NASCAR champion with 63 career Cup wins.
His 10-year-old son, Brexton, a budding racer, watched his father win the pole from the family motorhome in the infield and fell back onto a couch in anxiousness after watching his dad's qualifying run. Busch said he badly wants to win for his family.
“It’s been a rough stretch. It’s no secret, right? Seeing my son and his passion that he has, he really, really is probably my biggest cheerleader,” Busch said. “He wants to see me run well. He wants to see me win races. He wants to celebrate in victory lane like he sees other drivers’ kids being able to do. So there’s nothing more that drives me every single weekend than seeing him see me, be proud of me.”
The pole-winning run comes as RCR tries to return to its championship-contending form, which has been spotty in the 25 years since Dale Earnhardt was killed in a last-lap crash at the Daytona 500. Earnhardt won six championships and one Daytona 500 driving for Childress.
No driver has ever won the race for the first time in more than 20 attempts — the number it took the Earnhardt to win it in 1998.
“It’s a box we’ve got to check,” said Busch, who finished second to then-teammate Hamlin in 2019. “This is an opportunity to be able to do that. I’ve come down here a lot of years. I think I finished in about every position possible. It would be nice to (open) 2026 with a victory here in the Daytona 500.”
Hamlin goes for No. 4
Hamlin missed his shot to win three straight Daytona 500s but still has records to chase.
Another victory would be his fourth and tie him with Yarborough for second-most all-time victories in NASCAR’s biggest race. Only seven-time winner Richard Petty, also a seven-time NASCAR champion, has more.
“Every win that you get here puts you in a certain list,” Hamlin said. “The list is so small at that four number, it certainly was on my mind on the last lap last year when we were leading, that we are going to get another one. I feel as though the opportunity will be there, and hopefully we can put ourselves in position to move ourselves up that Daytona 500 winners board.”
Keselowski races hurt
Brad Keselowski is 0 for 16 in the Daytona 500 and doesn't have great odds Sunday because of a fall he took while on a family ski trip in December.
Keselowski slipped on ice and broke his right leg, and the injury caused him to miss last week's preseason exhibition race. He arrived in Daytona using a cane to walk as he's hurried his recovery time to ensure he wouldn't miss any points-paying races.
“When I’m in the car, I know I’ve got an injury, don’t get me wrong, but I feel the best in the car," he said. "The seat is molded to me really well and you get a little adrenaline flowing, so I felt pretty good.”
He's raced hurt before: Keselowski broke his ankle in a 2011 crash but raced to a victory at Pocono a few days later. He said the injuries are extremely different.
“This is way more serious. When I broke my ankle that sucked. Don’t get me wrong, it was very painful, but in a couple weeks, I was fairly mobile,” he said. "This is a much more significant injury, unfortunately. It’s hard to explain to people that have never broken their femur before what it’s like.
"A normal broken leg is eight to 12 weeks. This is more like six months, so it’s just totally different.”
Odds and ends
Joey Logano and Chase Elliott won their qualifying races earlier in the week to emerge as strong contenders. ... Dale Jarrett is the last driver to win from the pole in 2000. ... Jimmie Johnson and rookie Connor Zilisch start side-by-side in 31st and 32nd as row 16 pairs the oldest and youngest drivers in the field. Johnson is 50 and Zilisch is 19. ... Logano and his Team Penske teammate Ryan Blaney are the betting favorites at plus-1200.

IAEA chief says Iran inspections deal 'possible but terribly difficult' after 12-day war
Grossi says nuclear landscape has 'changed radically' as inspectors return, but damaged facilities remain off limits
LONDON
The head of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has said a new agreement with Iran on nuclear inspections is “absolutely possible” but “terribly difficult” following what he described as a dramatic shift in the country’s nuclear landscape after the recent 12-day war between Iran and Israel.
“An agreement with Iran on inspections is technically possible and it is politically even viable but difficult,” IAEA Director General Rafael Mariano Grossi said during an event at the Munich Security Conference on Friday.
Grossi said the conflict had “changed radically” the situation surrounding Iran’s nuclear infrastructure.
“After the 12-day war, the whole landscape of nuclear Iran has changed radically in terms of perhaps not capabilities, but in terms of actual physical infrastructure, which is basically no longer there or badly damaged,” he said.
He pointed to facilities at Isfahan, Natanz and Fordo, suggesting that the previous “impressive array of so many facilities dealing with different aspects of the nuclear fuel cycle” may no longer exist in the same form.
Any future agreement, he said, would have to focus not only on what remains but also on “what kind of nuclear Iran can emerge from this new situation.”
Grossi stressed that Iran, as a member of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT), has the right to pursue peaceful nuclear activities. However, he acknowledged “the reality of a political restraint, which is being very clearly articulated by the US and perhaps others.”
IAEA inspectors have returned to Iran, though they have not been able to access damaged facilities. “We have been inspecting, if I can put it in simple terms, everything but the attacked facilities,” he said.
Despite the challenges, Grossi said dialogue had resumed. “Some said, with this war, it is over. You will never see monitoring in Iran again… So we were able to work again to establish some form of dialog, imperfect and complicated and extremely difficult.”
He described the coming days as “a very, very crucial moment,” raising the possibility of “light at the end of the tunnel” towards a new arrangement.
Israel launched attacks on Iran on June 13, 2025, sparking a war marked by tit-for-tat airstrikes, raising fears of a broader regional conflict.
Several senior Iranian military commanders and nuclear scientists were killed in Israeli airstrikes that targeted Tehran and other cities, including Maj. Gen. Mohammad Bagheri, chief of staff of the Iranian Armed Forces, Gen. Hossein Salami, chief of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), and senior IRGC commander Gen. Gholam Ali Rashid, head of the central headquarters of the Iranian military.

Zelensky, Merz discuss joint weapons production projects
According to Ukrinform, the President's official website stated this in an article.
Zelensky thanked Germany for its significant contribution to protecting lives during the full-scale Russian war and particularly highlighted the supply of air defense systems that have saved thousands upon thousands of people.
The key topics of discussion included further military assistance, additional contributions to the PURL program, diplomatic efforts aimed at achieving peace, and energy support.
Zelensky said that earlier in the day he had personally visited the first Ukrainian-German drone manufacturing enterprise. Zelensky and Merz discussed continuing defense cooperation and implementing other joint projects that could make Ukraine and Germany stronger.
Special attention was also given to diplomatic efforts to achieve peace. He briefed Merz on meetings between the Ukrainian, American, and Russian sides, as well as preparations for upcoming negotiations. He also spoke about work on relevant documents and their key provisions.
In addition, the parties discussed the situation in Ukraine's energy sector and recovery efforts. Zelensky thanked Germany for its support and informed his counterpart about current needs.
As previously reported, Zelensky, together with German Defense Minister Boris Pistorius, visited the production facilities of the joint Ukrainian-German enterprise Quantum Frontline Industries GmbH in southern Germany.

ECB fines French bank Crédit Agricole for failing to identify climate risks

The European Central Bank said on Friday, February 13, it had fined French bank Crédit Agricole €7.55 million for failing to properly identify climate change-related risks that could affect its balance sheet. "Crédit Agricole did not sufficiently assess the materiality of its climate-related and environmental risks" by a deadline set after an investigation in 2024, the ECB said in a statement, adding the bank was late by "75 full days."
Since 2020, the ECB has required banks to manage and disclose climate-related risks to their portfolios as fears grow that increasingly frequent and intense natural disasters could hit asset values. The transition to a lower-carbon economy also introduces risk for investments in fossil fuel firms or energy-intensive sectors.
Crédit Agricole expressed its "incomprehension" at the ECB's move and said the fine related to only a small part of the bank's work. Climate risk is limited overall across the bank, according to the statement. "This risk is immaterial at the Crédit Agricole group level," the bank said in a statement, adding that it had missed the ECB's deadline since "responding to the ECB at the requested level of granularity required extensive work." "The group reiterates that it naturally identifies and takes climate and environmental risks into account in its models," it said.
The ECB fined Spanish bank Abanca €187,650 last November for failing to identify and disclose climate risks on time.

Merz Say U.S. Not Powerful Enough to ‘Go It Alone,’ Warns Against ‘Deep Rift’ With Europe

German Chancellor Friedrich Merz has warned of “a deep rift” between Europe and the United States, arguing that the latter “will not be powerful enough to go it alone.”
In his address at the Munich Security Conference Friday, Merz urged Europe and the U.S. to “repair and revive trans-Atlantic trust together” in what he referred to as an “era of great power rivalry.”
Switching to English as he addressed American “friends,” Merz nodded to Trump’s contentious relationship with NATO, insisting that “being a part of [the alliance] is not only Europe’s competitive advantage. It’s also the United States’ competitive advantage.”
While he acknowledged that the existing global order has long been flawed, Merz—when discussing the “under destruction” theme of this year’s conference—argued the “international order based on rights and rules is currently being destroyed.”
He also referenced Vice President J.D. Vance’s speech from last year’s conference. Vance drew ire from European leaders when he argued that what concerned him most was Europe’s “threat from within... the retreat of Europe from some of its most fundamental values—values shared with the United States of America.” He used “free speech” as an example of the values in retreat.
“The culture war of the MAGA movement is not ours,” Merz continued. “Freedom of speech ends here with us when that speech goes against human dignity and the constitution. We do not believe in tariffs and protectionism, but in free trade.”
The German leader appeared to make further strides to distinguish Europe from the Trump Administration, adding: “We stick to climate agreements and the World Health Organization (WHO) because we are convinced that global challenges can only be solved together.”
On Jan. 22, the U.S., under Trump’s direction, officially pulled out of the WHO. The move has garnered much criticism from global health experts.
TIME has reached out to the White House for comment on Merz's comments.

As Europe takes part in ongoing negotiations regarding the hope for a cease-fire in the Russia-Ukraine conflict, Merz said he has also started private talks with French President Emmanuel Macron about “nuclear deterrence.”
Merz’s concerns echo those made by Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney in Davos in January. Speaking at the World Economic Forum, Carney argued that the old world order was “not coming back” and encouraged people not to “mourn” the way things used to be. He accused “great powers” of using economic pressure to yield results while urging middle powers to push back.
Carney’s remarks were delivered shortly after Trump threatened to tariff countries who oppose his campaign to annex Greenland—a threat he has since walked back. Trump later lashed out in response to Carney’s speech.

The U.S. President will not be appearing at the Munich Security Conference. Instead, Secretary of State Marco Rubio will represent the U.S. on Saturday and deliver a highly-anticipated speech.
Rubio also warned of a “new era” in geopolitics as he boarded his flight to Germany.
When asked if his message to Europeans will take a softer approach than Vance’s address last year, Rubio told reporters: “The world is changing very fast right in front of us. We live in a new era in geopolitics, and it's going to require all of us to sort of re-examine what that looks like and what our role is going to be.”
On Friday afternoon, the U.S. Department of State confirmed that Rubio and Merz had met in Munich, after the German Chancellor’s speech.
“They discussed pressing global challenges including securing supply chains, advancing efforts to end the Russia-Ukraine war, and strengthening the partnership between the United States and Europe,” said a spokesperson. “The Secretary expressed appreciation for Germany’s strong support for Ukraine, including over $76 billion in assistance since 2022, and discussed continued coordination on reconstruction efforts.”

Zaporizhkoks allocates UAH 4.3 mln to restore one of its regenerators
PJSC Zaporizhkoks, one of Ukraine's largest producers of coke-chemical products, has invested UAH 4.3 million in a major overhaul to ensure stable operation of the plant's regenerator.
According to the company, Zaporizhkoks has completed a capital repair of Regenerator No. 6 in the recovery shop. A contractor carried out a comprehensive overhaul of the regenerator's foundation metal structures, installed new reinforcement segments for the casing, and added structural stiffeners.
The project also included replacement of the roof's metal structures with fencing and internal protective lining, as well as upgrades to the slurry pipeline and air duct. The total investment in the overhaul amounted to nearly UAH 4.3 million.
Maksym Shapovalov, head of the recovery shop, explained that regenerator overhauls at the plant are performed on a scheduled basis.
"This is a technically complex process lasting nearly nine months, involving restoration of both external structures and internal lining. The regenerator's technical readiness for uninterrupted, efficient operation without failures directly determines the stability of the recovery shop's technological process and the plant's overall performance. That is why Zaporizhkoks prioritizes a systematic approach to repairs, continuous monitoring of equipment condition, improving energy efficiency, and implementing modern technical solutions," he noted.
The coke gas desulfurization unit (formerly the sulfur removal shop) of the recovery shop ensures purification of coke gas and production of gas sulfur. Stable operation of this equipment allows for high-quality purification of coke gas, which is used to heat coke batteries and power plant boilers, critical for the continuity and stability of the entire production process.
This year, Zaporizhkoks plans a capital overhaul of Regenerator No. 7. In total, 12 such units are in operation at the shop.
Zaporizhkoks operates a full technological cycle for processing coke-chemical products.
According to the National Securities and Stock Market Commission (NSSMC), as of Q4 2025, Dashuria Ltd. (Cyprus) owns 94.9565% of the company's shares.

Five more Ukrainian children returned from occupied territories, Russia – Lubinets
Five Ukrainian children returned home from the temporarily occupied territories and Russia, among them a seven-year-old boy who was deported from Kherson children's home during the occupation of the city, Verkhovna Rada Commissioner for Human Rights Dmytro Lubinets has said.

"We get along very well with Europe. We'll see how it all works out. We're negotiating right now for Greenland," he said.
On January 31, the US administration announced the start of negotiations on the future ownership of Greenland and expressed hope for a deal that would benefit both the US and Europe. Washington said that quite a lot had already been agreed upon. Trump has repeatedly stated the need for Greenland to join the US. During his first presidential term, he offered to buy the island, and in March 2025, he expressed confidence that it could be annexed.

Germany and France Begin Talks on Joint European Nuclear Umbrella

Germany has begun talks with France on creating a joint European nuclear deterrent within NATO.
This was reported by the European Pravda with reference to a statement by German Chancellor Friedrich Merz at the Munich Security Conference.
As Merz noted, negotiations on joint nuclear deterrence do not mean that Europe no longer relies on NATO’s protection, but demonstrate its desire to strengthen its own defense.
“We are not doing this by writing off NATO. We are doing this by creating a strong, self-sufficient European pillar within the Alliance,” the chancellor said in his speech.
He also stressed that the world is entering a new reality. Europe, in his opinion, must recognize this and adapt to it while preserving its own values.
At the end of January 2026, it was reported that European countries had intensified discussions on strengthening their own nuclear deterrence amid doubts about the long-term commitment of the US to guarantee the security of the continent.
This was prompted by statements and actions by US President Donald Trump, which European capitals perceive as a signal to review the traditional security model. At that time, it became known that Germany and Poland were already unofficially negotiating the extension of French nuclear deterrence to other EU states.
Shortly thereafter, Swedish Prime Minister Ulf Kristersson said that Sweden had held preliminary consultations with France and the UK on possible cooperation in the field of nuclear deterrence.
According to him, there are no specific proposals or time frames at this stage — the talks are in the early stages.
“I am saying that when we joined NATO, we became fully involved in all discussions, including those in Europe about nuclear weapons. Not to use them, but as long as dangerous countries have nuclear weapons, healthy democracies must also have access to nuclear weapons,” he said.
Turkey also does not rule out the possibility of joining the nuclear arms race due to concerns about Iran’s ambitions.
According to Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan, they are trying not to upset the fragile balance of power in the Middle East, as this could provoke a large-scale “nuclear arms race.” At the same time, Turkey may be forced to join such a process in the event of further escalation of threats.

Palestine Action cofounder Ammori after High Court win: UK ban ‘backfired’
Huda Ammori celebrates ‘victory for Palestine’ as top court rules proscription as a ‘terror’ organisation was unlawful.
London, United Kingdom – The United Kingdom’s ban on Palestine Action has “backfired”, its cofounder said, after the High Court ruled that proscribing the group as a “terror” organisation was unlawful.
Critics from the United Nations human rights chief to the Irish author Sally Rooney decried the UK’s ban last June as an illiberal overreach, since it put Palestine Action on par with ISIL (ISIS), al-Qaeda and dangerous far-right organisations.

- list 4 of 4UK court says Palestine Action ban ‘unlawful’: What does the verdict mean?
On Friday, High Court judges dealt a massive blow to the government of Labour leader Keir Starmer, saying, “The decision to proscribe Palestine Action was disproportionate.”
“Today is a victory for Palestine,” Palestine Action cofounder Huda Ammori told Al Jazeera. The ban has “backfired on [the government] massively. They’ve made Palestine Action a household name.
“They have spread the message and the power that ordinary people have to shut down weapons factories across the country and across the world. So for that, I thank them.”
Founded in 2020, Palestine Action’s stated objective has been to counter Israeli war crimes – and what it says is British complicity in them – by targeting weapons manufacturers and associated companies.
Its main target is Elbit Systems, Israel’s largest arms company, which has several sites in the UK.
“Rather than ask somebody else to stop those weapons going and being used to commit genocide, we go to the source, and we stop those weapons ourselves,” said Ammori, a 31-year-old Briton of Iraqi and Palestinian heritage.
“That is what direct action is about. If you saw a building burning down with children inside, you wouldn’t hesitate to bang down the door to save those children’s lives. It is exactly the same principle. You don’t care about the value of the door. It is about those lives. It is about the liberation of Palestine. And so we do our bit to shut down the Israeli weapons trades from Britain.”
The group has been a thorn in Starmer’s side since Israel began its genocidal onslaught in Gaza.
Palestine Action-linked activists have carried out several raids, often leaving their mark in red spray paint intended to symbolise blood.
Dozens are currently being held on remand in relation to two actions.
Some prisoners, known as part of the “Filton 24”, are alleged to have participated in a break-in at a UK subsidiary of Elbit Systems in Bristol.
Others are accused of involvement in a break-in at the UK’s largest air base in Oxfordshire, where they were alleged to have spray-painted two Voyager refuelling and transport planes. It was after this raid that the government banned Palestine Action.
They all deny the charges against them, such as burglary and criminal damage.
Six of the “Filton 24” were recently acquitted of aggravated burglary; five of them were bailed.
“At its core, Palestine Action is an organisation that promotes its political cause through criminality and encouragement of criminality. A very small number of its actions have amounted to terrorist action,” the High Court judges said.
Tens of thousands of people have protested against the ban. Almost 3,000 of them have been arrested for raising placards with slogans such as: “I oppose genocide. I support Palestine Action.”
“The government committed a huge crime against its own population,” said Ammori. “It was unlawful for them to ban Palestine Action, and when they banned Palestine Action, they subsequently did thousands of unlawful arrests against their own citizens and tried to prosecute them through the courts for terrorism offences, for holding up signs.”
Despite Friday’s ruling, the ban remains in place pending appeal.
The UK’s Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood said she was “disappointed” by Friday’s ruling and intends to appeal – earning further criticism from rights groups and some fellow Labour politicians.
John McDonnell, an MP who voted against the proscription, said on X, “I thought it was unjust. We have a right to protest, to assemble, and to speak freely in this country – that has been secured largely by direct action over centuries. I am urging the government to abide by that tradition and not to appeal this judgement.”
“Shabana Mahmood needs to take a step back,” said Ammori. “She’s completely betrayed the Palestinian people since she’s become minister … it’s only going to backfire on her.
“Palestine Action’s ban will be lifted … We won today in the High Court … If they try and appeal, we’ll beat them again.”

German Spy Chief Warns of Russian Threat to Local Polls

Germany’s foreign intelligence chief warned Friday that Russia is planning to target high-stakes regional elections this year with “hybrid” attacks, and called for Berlin to consider “counter-measures” against the growing threat.
Berlin, a key backer of Ukraine in its war against Moscow, says it has faced a growing number of Russian sabotage plots and cyberattacks, and accused Moscow of spreading disinformation before general elections last year.

Russia dismissed those claims as “absurd” and “baseless”.
Five German states hold elections this year and all eyes are on whether the far-right AfD, which has been surging in the polls and is seen as Moscow-friendly, will succeed in taking power in any of the regions.
Martin Jaeger, head of the BND foreign intelligence agency, warned that Russia had dramatically stepped up its use of “hybrid warfare” -- which refers to largely unconventional methods that can involve sabotage, disinformation campaigns and other disruptive attacks.
“Elections in Moldova and Romania are recent examples, and we expect more hybrid campaigns throughout this election year in Germany,” Jaeger said in a panel discussion at the Munich Security Conference.
But he warned the efforts to fend off Russian attacks had so far fallen short.
“Deterrence is not working yet,” he said.
“This raises the question, do we simply want to continue to observe and record these developments, or have we reached a point where we must take action -- counter-measures?”

“I’m deeply convinced we should much more often prove that we would be able to do very similar things to make the other side also feel the pain,” he added.
His comments come after recent reports said that Berlin is considering overhauling laws to expand the powers of the BND.
Under new proposals, German spies would reportedly be able to launch sabotage operations and cyberattacks if the country’s recently formed National Security Council concludes there is a “systemic threat”.
The BND would also be handed extra powers for intelligence gathering, including the use of facial recognition software.
The government previously declined to comment on specifics, saying only that they planned to make changes to laws governing espionage.

Prosecutors claim Chinese-run distribution network concealed revenue, evaded tax obligations and fostered money laundering of drug proceeds
The Primeiro Comando da Capital, or PCC, syndicate allegedly sold imported consumer electronics throughout Brazil via a Chinese e-commerce platform called “Knup Brasil”, including mobile phone chargers, electronic scales and other accessories at competitive prices.
According to São Paulo police, customers placed orders through the platform but were instructed to transfer payments via Brazil’s instant payment system, Pix, to separate companies with no legitimate commercial activity.
Invoices were allegedly issued at artificially reduced values by third-party firms, creating what investigators described as a deliberate mismatch between declared income and actual cash flow.

Trump says he will visit Venezuela, praises ‘very good’ relations

WASHINGTON
US President Donald Trump said Friday that he plans to visit Venezuela, citing what he described as strong ties between the two countries and growing cooperation in the oil sector.
“I’m going to make a visit to Venezuela … We haven’t decided (when),” Trump told reporters at the White House.
Trump praised relations with interim Venezuelan President Delcy Rodriguez, saying Washington and Caracas are “working together very closely,” particularly on energy.
“We have a very good relationship,” he said, adding that major US oil companies are operating in the country and that the partnership is generating significant revenue.
“The relationship we have right now with Venezuela is, I would say, a 10.”
Asked whether the US recognizes Rodriguez’s administration as Venezuela’s official government, Trump responded: “We have done that. We’re dealing with them.”
He said oil production is on the rise and that the US is refining Venezuelan crude, describing the relationship as “strong.”
US Energy Secretary Chris Wright visited the South American country this week to assess its oil industry and hold talks with teh interim government centered on a massive overhaul of the country’s energy sector to revitalize its economy and reintegrate its oil reserves into the global market.
Wright’s high-profile visit to Venezuela follows a political shift on Jan. 3, when US forces captured President Nicolas Maduro and his wife Cilia Flores in a military operation in Caracas and transported to New York, where they are being held in a federal detention facility. Rodriguez has since moved to normalize relations with Washington.

Trump warns of 'very big force' if talks with Iran fail
'Well, in case we don't make a deal, we'll need it,' Trump says when asked why he decided to send 2nd aircraft carrier to Middle East
WASHINGTON
President Donald Trump said Friday that the US is prepared to deploy a “very big force” if ongoing negotiations with Iran fail.
"Well, in case we don't make a deal, we'll need it ....If we have a deal, we could cut it short," Trump told reporters when asked why he decided to send a second aircraft carrier to the region.
"It'll be leaving. It'll be leaving very soon. We have one out there that just arrived ...We have it ready. A big, a very big force," he added.
His remarks came after local media reported that the US will send the USS Gerald R. Ford to the Middle East to back up the USS Abraham Lincoln carrier strike group.
When asked about the negotiations with Iran, Trump said he thinks they will be "successful."
"And if they're not, it's going to be a bad day for Iran — very bad," he added.
The US and Iran held indirect talks in the capital Muscat on Feb. 6 with Omani mediation to discuss Tehran’s nuclear program.
The sit-down marked the end of a roughly eight-month suspension after the US launched strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities during an escalation of the Iran–Israel conflict in June 2025.
Amid the negotiations, the US has significantly increased its military footprint in the region as Trump warns Iran that it must make a deal.
Uranium enrichment remains a central point of dispute. The US demands Iran halt uranium enrichment and transfer highly enriched uranium out of the country—a non-starter for Tehran.
Washington has also sought to include Iran’s missile program and its support for armed groups in the region in the negotiations, but Tehran has repeatedly said it will not negotiate issues beyond its nuclear program.

German spy chief calls for more operational freedom to counter threats
Sign up now: Get ST's newsletters delivered to your inbox
BERLIN, Feb 13 - Germany should beef up its intelligence services and allow them more freedom to act in the face of a range of hybrid threats from Russia, the head of the country's foreign intelligence service said on Friday.
After decades of self-imposed caution over state spying and surveillance following World War Two, German politicians and security officials have been pressing to allow its foreign and domestic intelligence agencies greater leeway to act in the face of what they see as an increased threat from Russia.
"The threat emanating from hybrid warfare has been recognized," Martin Jaeger, head of the BND, Germany's foreign intelligence service, told a panel at the Munich Security Conference.
"Deterrence is not working yet. This raises the question, do we simply want to continue to observe and record these developments, or have we reached a point where we must take active countermeasures?"
"This question also applies to my service, the BND. In my opinion, the service must and will become more operational," he said.
Jaeger said Germany had uncovered a major Russian-linked influence operation ahead of last year's federal election, which he said used pseudo-investigative research, deepfakes, and fabricated witness statements on various platforms. He said police had registered 321 acts of sabotage in Germany last year, many of which were likely to be linked to Russia.
The Russian government has consistently denied running disinformation networks but the perceived threat has been a recurrent theme among Western policymakers since Russia's seizure of Crimea in 2014 and its invasion of Ukraine in 2022.
German Chancellor Friedrich Merz told the conference of security policy experts in Munich that Germany would strengthen its intelligence services as part of a wider drive to rebuild its armed forces and improve its resilience in the face of a heightened threat from Russia.
"We will protect our free democratic order from both internal and external enemies," he told the conference in a speech in which he said the old international rules-based order no longer existed as it had in the past.
The German parliament is debating a new bill that would allow the intelligence services, which are currently bound by strict rules curtailing their activities, to take more active measures against security threats. REUTERS

IDF says Hezbollah operative rebuilding group’s infrastructure killed in strike
Separately, two fringe activists for settlement in Lebanon cross border to plant trees, are returned to Israel by troops
Emanuel (Mannie) Fabian is The Times of Israel's military correspondent
A Hezbollah operative was killed in an Israeli airstrike in southern Lebanon on Thursday night, the military said.
The operative — identified by Lebanese media as Mahdi Hassan Shaito — was targeted in the southern town of at-Tiri. Lebanon’s health ministry also reported one person dead in the strike.
According to the Israel Defense Forces, the operative was involved in restoring the terror group’s military infrastructure in the at-Tiri area.
The military said the operative’s activities were a violation of the ceasefire agreement between Israel and Lebanon.
Under the November 2024 ceasefire deal, Hezbollah was required to withdraw and disarm south of the Litani River. Israel alleges that the terror group continues to operate in the area, leading the IDF to conduct near-daily strikes.
The US-brokered ceasefire with Hezbollah came after two months of open conflict in Lebanon, including an IDF ground operation in the country’s south in a bid to enable the safe return of some 60,000 residents of northern Israel displaced by the terror group’s near-daily attacks. The rocket attacks began on October 8, 2023 — a day after fellow Iran-backed terror group Hamas invaded southern Israel, sparking the war in Gaza.

The ceasefire required both Israel and Hezbollah to vacate southern Lebanon, to be replaced by the Lebanese armed forces. Israel has withdrawn from all but five strategic posts along the border.
Since the ceasefire, the IDF said it has killed over 400 Hezbollah operatives and members of allied terror groups in strikes, hit hundreds of Hezbollah sites, and conducted over 1,200 raids and other small operations in southern Lebanon.
Weakened by the war and still facing regular Israeli strikes, Hezbollah is under internal and international pressure to hand over its weapons, with the Lebanese army having drawn up a plan to disarm it.
Separately, earlier on Thursday, two Israeli activists for settlement in Lebanon — a small fringe group — breached the border before being returned to Israel by the IDF.
According to the military, some 20 activists had gathered near the Israeli border community of Yir’on, with two crossing the barrier into Lebanon.
The activists said they entered Lebanon to plant trees and to “renew the Jewish settlement in Lebanon.”
The IDF said that the two civilians were apprehended by troops, brought back to Israel, and handed over to the police for further questioning.
“The IDF strongly condemns the incident and emphasizes that it is a grave event constituting a criminal offense that endangers civilians and IDF troops,” the army added.
There have been several occasions where Israeli civilians have crossed the border into Lebanon since the November 2024 ceasefire between Israel and Hezbollah.
Support for Jewish settlement in Lebanon remains very small, and no politicians or major figures outside of fringe settler groups have called for their establishment.

Once a political leader’s net favourability sinks deep into negative territory, recovery is the exception, not the rule. It usually takes an economic rebound, a dramatic political reset or an opposition implosion to reverse the slide. Sir Keir Starmer’s personal ratings are in a danger zone from which few escape.
Yet the prime minister, like the Bourbons, has learnt nothing and forgotten nothing. He made a speech this week after coming close to being ousted suggesting he would “fight” on. He doubled down in parliament despite glaring errors in judgment. He forced out his cabinet secretary while his own failures remain unaddressed. He seemed to blame everyone but himself. When support slips and a leader answers with defiance, voters don’t see strength – they see denial.
The bigger picture, as the Resolution Foundation said this week, is that living standards are forecast to rise up by just 0.3% a year until 2029-30 – even weaker than the previous decade’s 0.4% annual growth, which included Covid and the energy crisis. Britain, under Sir Keir’s stewardship, is set to grow more slowly in “normal times” than it did during national emergencies.
The prime minister’s claim to responsible management is undone by his own incompetence. Public trust ebbs away – a worry when voters start shopping around and Reform UK is selling racism. Stagnation exposes governments that lack an economic model. That is why interventions this week by Andy Burnham, the Greater Manchester mayor, and Daisy Cooper, the Lib Dem Treasury spokesperson, matter. Both accept that cost of living pressure is becoming politically dangerous and that the status quo isn’t working.
The Lib Dems want to shake up Whitehall. They are calling for a break up of the Treasury and its replacement with a new department of growth based in Birmingham. The most radical idea is that the growth department would set fiscal policies. That might be a very good idea if it opened up the space for productive cash injections with an acknowledgment that fiscal deficits are required to rebuild the social democratic space.
By contrast, Mr Burnham’s plan is a revolution: roll back Thatcherism and restore politics to the heart of economics. Hence his call for electoral reform, abandoning the parliamentary whip system and replacing the House of Lords with an elected senate of nations and regions. A new political settlement, he says, is a precondition to achieve public control of essentials – such as housing and utilities – to reduce costs and support productivity.
Mr Burnham’s distance from Westminster – after his path back was closed by Sir Keir – gives him freedom to speak out. His proposal logically implies a constitutional role for metro mayors. In this vision, the national government sets the macro framework; regions control infrastructure and housing, and the senate safeguards territorial interests. That would be a welcome and different version of the UK from today’s Treasury dominated unitary state.
Zack Polanski’s Green surge has made radical talk respectable and cost of living politics inescapable, especially ahead of an upcoming Manchester byelection in what was a safe Labour seat. The Greens are part of a wider revolt against Britain’s economic model. From Labour’s soft left, Mr Burnham offers structural overhaul, while the Lib Dems promise a growth engine, and the Greens push redistribution. Meanwhile, Sir Keir’s Labour is governing inside a failed model rather than replacing it. That looks politically fatal.

Cuban official decries ‘massive punishment’ by US oil blockade
Diplomat Carlos de Cossio says US fuel embargo harms Cuba’s medical services, food production and standard of living.
Cuban diplomat Carlos de Cossio has accused the United States of imposing collective punishment on his country as the administration of President Donald Trump ramps up pressure to choke the Caribbean island’s access to oil.
In a post on X on Friday, de Cossio, who serves as Cuba’s deputy foreign minister, described the situation from Havana’s perspective.

“To be clear: a. Cuba requires importing fuel. b.The US is applying threats & coercive measures to any country that provides it. c. Lack of fuel harms transportation, medical services, schooling, energy, production of food, the standard of living. d. Massive punishment is a crime,” he wrote.
The Fourth Geneva Convention says that “collective penalties and likewise all measures of intimidation or of terrorism are prohibited” under international law.
Cuba relied heavily on oil imports from Venezuela, which have been cut off after the abduction of the country’s leader, Nicolas Maduro, by US forces last month.
After the fall of Maduro, Cuba turned to Mexico for fuel.
But the White House has threatened to impose “additional tariffs on imports from any country that directly or indirectly provides oil to Cuba”.
The Mexican government halted the oil supplies to Cuba after the Trump administration’s threat.
But on Thursday, Mexico sent two ships loaded with humanitarian aid to Cuba.
The US oil blockade comes as the Trump administration pursues a policy of regional dominance over the Americas.
Washington targets Cuba
The White House said in its National Security Strategy last year that Washington’s goal is to “restore American preeminence in the Western Hemisphere”.
With Maduro gone, many foreign policy hawks in the US see a golden opportunity to topple the Cuban government.
Washington has had hostile relations with Havana since the rise of the late President Fidel Castro after the communist revolution that overthrew US-backed repressive leader Fulgencio Batista in 1959.
Trump has argued that the Cuban government is “ready to fall” on its own without access to Venezuelan oil.
Last month, the White House released a memorandum labelling the Cuban government an “unusual and extraordinary threat” to the US.
For its part, Havana has issued defiant statements against the US while also expressing willingness to engage in diplomacy.
“The Cuban people and the American people benefit from constructive engagement, lawful cooperation, and peaceful coexistence,” the Cuban Ministry of Foreign Affairs said in a statement on February 2.
“Cuba reaffirms its willingness to maintain a respectful and reciprocal dialogue, oriented toward tangible results, with the United States government, based on mutual interest and international law.”
But days earlier, Carlos de Cespedes, Cuba’s ambassador to Colombia, told Al Jazeera that his country will not accept being “terrorised” by US pressure.
“It will not subjugate us or break our determination even if a single drop of oil doesn’t reach us,” he said.
Last month, Cuba’s President Miguel Diaz-Canel said his country is “ready to defend the Homeland to the last drop of blood”, but he has also said that the island is not a threat to anyone and is open to talks with the US.

The Society man v the premier: When Daniel Andrews tipped Chris Lucas over the edge
In a new weekly series profiling the tycoons whose money and influence define Victoria’s hospitality landscape, we begin with Chris Lucas — the Geelong underdog who built a Toorak palace and traded the dining room for the war room to challenge a premier.
It’s 11.54am on a Friday, and a woman in a bedazzled shirt is swinging eagerly on golden handles, trying to pull open the double doors of one of Melbourne’s most palatial restaurants.
After a few seconds, she concedes defeat, slumping into one of the black metal chairs laid out for diners who routinely arrive early for the midday lunch service at Maison Bâtard.
Finally, the tall glass doors click open with a whoosh, sounding like a collective sigh. The diners hurry inside.
The creative director
Stepping into one of Chris Lucas’ restaurants is like stepping into a theme park. Beyond inhaling the food, he wants you to feel the weight of the 110-page wine list at Bâtard; marvel at its “icy throne” of an oyster bar, flanked by marble and smoked mirrors; and gawk at boisterous dining institution Chin Chin’s famous, and sometimes unsettling, projections.
His head chefs’ names elude most. Lucas is the face of the operation – the creative director, the visionary, Walt Disney.
It’s a role that sees him rub shoulders with the rich and famous – arm in arm with Margot Robbie, his restaurants visited by Drake and John Cena – and in the ear of Australia’s most influential people.
He is one of former Victorian premier Daniel Andrews’ most vocal, and arguably influential, opponents – even when the restaurateur’s team feared it was to his detriment.
As it stands, he has 12 restaurants operating nationally (including Grill Americano in Sydney, which opened in November), or almost double that if you count the micro bistros and bars inside his larger venues.
He has amassed a sprawling commercial empire. Between 2021 and 2024, he bought $70.1 million worth of property in Melbourne’s CBD alone.
Bâtard, a four-level Parisian giant, is his most ambitious project yet, thought to have cost $45 million. And still, he’s plotting world domination.
He designs his venues alongside wife Sarah Lucas, with whom he shares a 22-room mansion in Toorak bought in 2014 for $18.55 million, according to commercial records.
Lucas has “fingers in every pie”, and control of every menu in his restaurants, down to the commas. “He’s hands-on with everything,” his former publicist Monica Brown tells me, laughing.
“I mean, you’ve got to love working with somebody like that, or you’d want to kill him.”
Where delays have hampered billionaire Justin Hemmes’ plans to infiltrate Melbourne’s hospitality sector on a grand scale, Lucas is on an unprecedented run of restaurant openings.
His restaurants are a refuge for the wealthy, a hangout for those too rich to care (hello, stealth-wealthers sporting trackpants), a go-to for people who want to impress (clients, dates) and the frequent site of once-a-year – or once-in-a-lifetime – celebrations.
Overwhelmingly, though, they are ambitious and aspirational – like his life story, the way he tells it.
The salesman and strategist
When I meet Lucas, it’s at Grill Americano in Melbourne – a typically stylish affair frequented by businessmen and barristers.
He’s more relaxed than I imagined. Chattier. He asks the maître d’: “Did you tell her who had lunch here yesterday?”
They did.
“Ricky Martin,” he says, grinning.
A friend tells me before our interview that, at the opening of his restaurant Carlotta in Canberra, Lucas knew everyone in the room.
He closed the restaurant just 14 months later, in December, impatient with the lack of progress in its CBD precinct, which he said was unconducive to his “multi-venue model” and plans for expansion in the national capital.
“It isn’t consistent with our strategy to operate just one restaurant in a market,” Lucas told Good Food.
So profound is his crowd-pulling power, developers and project heads approach him to move into their buildings (he’s got another four venues in the works, including two at a $400 million Toorak development, and all-electric restaurants at a swanky $1 billion Bourke Street office tower).
He haggles on rent and pushes developers to chip in for restaurant fit-outs, according to sources not authorised to speak on the subject.
He is strategic. A master networker. He is involved in the details – he will handpick bronze sconces from French antique stores. So it surprises me a little he still sees himself as a “kid from Geelong with no money”, whose success came off the back of an opportunity to go to university in Melbourne – something he wouldn’t have done if it wasn’t free.
Before our interview, he asks me whether I’m from country New South Wales. I tell him not quite, but a regional area. He nods, as if to say “me too”.
We talk a lot about his ultimate goal as a restaurateur: elevating Australia to international culinary acclaim.
The country’s distance from the northern hemisphere holds it back, he says, but it’ll only take the success of one or two local restaurants overseas to “open the floodgates”.
He reveals his team is looking at opening venues in the Middle East, Britain and the United States.
“We’re having a bit of a go at all of those areas,” he tells me.
A while later, I put to him one of the main criticisms of the Lucas Collective that I’ve seen in hospitality circles: effectively, that they don’t care about the “little guy”. Lucas appears confused, hurt.
“Well, I don’t understand that because I grew up as a little Greek immigrant boy in Geelong, in a pub working with my dad, with nothing. And then my dad died when I was quite young, and my mother brought me up on a widow’s pension,” says Lucas, whose surname is an anglicisation of the Greek Loukas.
One former bartender at Chin Chin – the Aussie-Thai juggernaut that made Lucas a household name, and divided diners with its no-bookings policy – tells me colleagues laughed at her request for a pay rise because they were so rare.
Some complain Lucas restaurants “will work you ’til you break”.
But a former marketing assistant recalls Lucas was horrified to find her working more than six hours’ overtime, at about 11pm, printing menus in a back room at one of the venues. Lucas finished the job himself, staying until at least midnight.
Lucas says: “The foundation stone of what I’ve achieved today is because I have regard for – I won’t use the ‘little’ bit, because I don’t really understand that – but the people who work for me, work with me.
“You know, our business supports thousands and thousands of small farmers, winemakers, who rely on us.”
Lucas got his first inklings about restaurants at age 10, stepping inside the kitchen of Melbourne’s first modern hotel, where his uncle was the executive chef.
His father, Kon, warned him against a life in the restaurant business, leading him to study pharmacology at university in the years after Kon’s death.
He graduated, but dramatically changed course because of advice from his faculty head: Lucas was one of the worst chemists he’d ever seen, and he should become a salesman instead.
Lucas took it to heart, and signed up to sell computers with global technology company IBM – which was recruiting on campus – in 1981.
It was a move that saw him work in Tokyo, London, Silicon Valley and New York; exploring restaurants and izakayas, courtesy of the company’s generous expense account; and partying at the likes of Studio 54.
Years later, Lucas would tell the Australian Financial Review the job took him from “simple country boy to global executive”. He was highly regarded among IBM colleagues, according to people who knew him at the time.
Then the niggling allure of the restaurant business proved too much.
After a decade at IBM, Lucas sold his stake in telecommunications start-up Primus Telecom, funding his debut restaurant venture, St Kilda brasserie One Fitzroy Street, in 1995. There was “no Mark Zuckerberg story” – no tech millions, Lucas maintains – only a gamble that paid off.
Property journalist Nicole Lindsay tells me One spearheaded a “cleaner” image for the area.
“That really changed the nature of that whole strip, and St Kilda in general,” says Lindsay, who tracks Lucas’ commercial portfolio.
But it was with South Yarra’s Botanical, which Lucas bought and renovated for $7 million, that his status as culinary visionary was carved out.
He mortgaged his home and borrowed from the bank and family connections to afford it, before upending the pub’s layout and erecting a pick-it-yourself wine wall.
With top British chef Paul Wilson, he instituted a popular early iteration of the now-ubiquitous gourmet burger (a menu item Lucas’ wife refuses to eat but a mainstay at Bâtard). He sold the leasehold for Botanical in 2007 for a reported $16 million.
When the Bot was named the Good Food Guide’s 2004 restaurant of the year, reviewer John Lethlean wrote that the place groaned “with energy and innovation”.
“As with most things Lucas has done, he did this properly,” Lethlean wrote. “Acres of cash have been splashed.”
When I interview the now 64-year-old Lucas, he’s just announced his Collective Foundation, a huge part of which he says is about elevating hospitality as a sought-after career path in Australia.
He’s working with La Trobe University to design an “elite” program of specialised hospitality diplomas and degrees, and fund scholarships for underprivileged kids.
“It’s great that someone like me, coming out of Geelong – [which] was just a small country town at the time – [can] achieve some success,” he says.
“I want to be able to see if we can do that for other young kids.”
The Society man and the premier
Lucas does not always come off as the country boy made good.
He has the polish and pugnacity of a business titan accustomed to getting his way, and will slam his restaurant door in the face of a premier.
It all started with a phone call to Melbourne talkback radio. Long before the Andrews government announced its road map out of lockdown, its relationship with business – especially the restaurant business – was starting to fracture.
Lucas’ tipping point came in August 2020, during Melbourne’s second lockdown, when then-premier Andrews announced he would push for a 12-month extension to state-of-emergency powers – a move that would give authorities the power to enforce lockdowns for another year.
It was, he told 3AW’s Neil Mitchell, the equivalent of “dropping a bomb” on Victorians.
“The premier is disconnected,” Lucas lamented. “I think he has a lack of understanding of what’s actually going on in the community at the grassroots level.”
The interview started a media campaign among restaurateurs fearing for their livelihoods. Within half an hour of hanging up the phone, Lucas received thousands of messages of support.
Later, one media outlet described the phone call as a “tear-here” moment for Melbourne, when demands for an end to lockdowns became unrelenting.
“The mental state of Victorians is at such distressing levels,” Lucas told Mitchell. “The suicide rates, the family bust-ups, the torment, the financial pressures amongst the people of Victoria is extraordinary.”
Lucas became the uncompromising spokesman for the hospitality industry’s revolt against COVID-19 restrictions. Again and again, he derided the Andrews government, arguing it was needlessly decimating businesses and destroying Victorians’ mental health.
His public scolding of Andrews was so frequent that his then-publicist Brown says she was concerned about alienating diners.
“There are times when I told him to take the foot off the pedal,” Brown tells me over the phone from Britain.
When his contempt led him to break one of hospitality’s unspoken rules, Brown was particularly worried.
Andrews’ wife, Catherine, tried to make a lunch booking at his South-East Asian venue Hawker Hall, and Lucas told her there was nothing available.
The restaurateur later defended this rejection, pointing out that the Italian restaurant Di Stasio also knocked back Andrews for a birthday booking.
The premier had his “own cross to bear”, but they were allowed to disagree, Lucas told a media outlet. After all, he said, “we live in a democracy”.
“[Lucas] was never a Dan Andrews fan during COVID,” Brown says. “There were a lot of people who were, and when you own a restaurant, your door’s open to everybody, whatever the politics are … you welcome everybody.”
To this day, some former senior Andrews staffers refuse to eat at Lucas’ restaurants, instead favouring those belonging to restaurateurs like Andrew McConnell, who were less outspoken about the state government’s COVID-19 containment measures.
Brown and Lucas maintain the restaurateur’s issue wasn’t with the premier himself but his policy decisions. “[They] were driving [Lucas] crazy because he was on the receiving end of them,” Brown says.
During our interview, Lucas tells me that two of his young staff took their lives during the pandemic.
“Two?” I ask, taken aback. His eyes well up with a mixture of anger and sadness: “Two too many.”
Lucas had a line to Victoria’s then-treasurer Tim Pallas during the pandemic, as well as then-tourism minister Martin Pakula and prolific Andrews critic, former Liberal MP Tim Smith.
He often spoke to City of Melbourne’s then-lord mayor Sally Capp, and was also in touch with former Labor leader Bill Shorten and then-federal treasurer Josh Frydenberg, with whom he shared his despair.
But his frustration was not being able to get through to Andrews himself, according to insiders. “I did meet with lots of other politicians, and to be honest, [Andrews] didn’t really make himself available. He didn’t want to talk to anyone,” Lucas tells me.
The professional stakes were immense for Lucas during COVID-19. He was on the verge of unveiling his much-anticipated Society restaurant, billed as an avant-garde training kitchen to rival Europe’s best.
The project was years in the making, after Lucas in 2018 recruited chef Martin Benn and maître d’ Vicki Wild – the couple behind the vaunted Sydney fine-diner Sepia – to co-lead it in a coup for Melbourne.
But lockdowns stalled the restaurant’s official opening three times. Wild left the business weeks before it finally opened in July 2021 (a year late), and Benn followed in September.
Publicly, Benn blamed the pandemic for their decision. But insiders tell me that by the time Wild left Society, she refused to speak to Lucas – even when they were in the same room.
Wild declined to comment for this story.
Lucas doesn’t want to say much about Benn and Wild’s departure.
But he lauds them for sticking it out in Melbourne during COVID, particularly when they didn’t have family living locally. Society’s kitchen – which he describes as the “most amazing” in Australia – wouldn’t exist without Benn, he says.
Benn and Wild recently announced they are opening a $35 million four-level private members’ club three minutes’ walk from Bâtard.
“Thousands of people come through these businesses, play their role and then move on,” Lucas says. “They played a key role, and they’ll always be part of that history moving forward.”
Some industry insiders believe Society didn’t live up to its vision. Its enormous kitchen, bespoke chandeliers and soaring ceilings still impress, and it is a “very good restaurant” that pulls a crowd. But hot, innovative? Not so much.
Society dropped from two hats to one in the 2026 Good Food Guide, and the neighbouring Lillian Brasserie was de-toqued. Flinders Lane’s Grill Americano regained its hat, and Kisume returned to the Guide for the first time in four years, after several years of the restaurant’s 12-seat Chef’s Table being reviewed.
Lucas’ seven remaining large Victorian venues – including Bâtard – are without hats, although these run the gamut from casual pizzeria Baby to the perennially busy Chin Chin.
Emma Breheny, editor of The Age’s Good Food Guide, says restaurant groups often have ups and downs as they expand nationally.
“It’s a lot of balls to keep in the air. Grill Americano, for example, was awarded two hats in its first year, then dropped to one, then none, and is now back to one hat,” she says.
“Within big groups, the focus and energy gets stretched in a way that’s different to owner-operator venues, where the boss is in there every day noticing every little thing.”
Bâtard and Society are Lucas’ crown jewels. The latter is an internationally recognised restaurant, but more importantly lives up to its mission of giving young Australian chefs a world-class alternative to training overseas, Lucas says. “That’s a unique thing.”
The two faces of a culinary king
In Lucas’ great dominions, it’s a bit of a novelty for staff when he visits for a meal.
Sorcha Harrop, a bartender at Chin Chin between October 2016 and July 2017, says he came in for lunch during one of her shifts and she tried acknowledging him a few times – but was ignored. Lucas denied the exchange.
Harrop launched legal action against the Lucas Group in November 2017, alleging she was underpaid, but withdrew it after the company agreed to back-pay her $9500.
In 2019, this masthead revealed a broader audit found more of Lucas’ workers were paid less than the minimum rates of the award – an error for which Lucas says his company was “absolutely exonerated”.
The Fair Work Ombudsman formally cautioned the Lucas Group in July 2020 following an investigation. The ombudsman confirmed the company paid back affected employees and had overhauled its payroll systems.
When the underpayment audit was revealed, Harrop claimed the company, which has since grown to almost 2000 employees, “exploited eager, passionate people and worked them to the bone”.
But other people describe working at Lucas’ restaurants as creative, exciting, fun; the ultimate resume addition in a youthful and naturally transient industry. And Lucas is one of its most recognisable champions.
Pakula, a key player in Andrews’ cabinet over two terms, recalls receiving a rush of texts from Melbourne restaurateurs throughout the pandemic – each of whom suddenly had his personal mobile number.
The messages detailed the pressure the industry was under and what the government should do to ease it, he says.
It wasn’t until two years later, while chatting with Caterina’s Cucina e Bar owner Caterina Borsato over lunch, that Pakula found out it was Lucas handing out his number, and mobilising restaurateurs to hassle him. He ran into him a couple of nights later at an event and told him jokingly, “you’re sprung, mate”.
“The thing with Chris is, you can have a pretty robust conversation with him and a pretty robust disagreement, and he’s not sensitive … he doesn’t bear a grudge, and I like to think I don’t either,” Pakula says.
“That’s a good, healthy relationship. I actually value it quite a bit.”
In 2024, Lucas launched the Australian Restaurant and Cafe Association. Its sole focus is having a seat at the government’s table when it comes to policy issues including tax, wages and skilled worker migration – an industry first, Lucas says.
Merivale – a Sydney-based restaurant group run by Justin Hemmes, which is seeking to expand into Melbourne – had a seat on the association’s board, but stepped down following allegations of sexual harassment, exploitation and drug use at the company’s Sydney venues. The allegations were reported by this masthead and 60 Minutes and are denied by Merivale.
I ask Lucas whether, as the association’s deputy chair, he had any say in Merivale’s stepping down.
“I can’t really disclose what goes on and what doesn’t go on,” he says.
“We’ve worked really hard over the last 30 years to create amazing restaurants [and] safe workplaces, where women can feel safe, young people can feel safe.
“I feel a bit of a parental obligation as well. I’ve always felt that way, which is why, during COVID, I went to great lengths to protect my kids and my people, because I felt they’re like family.”
According to hospitality insiders, Lucas thought it was embarrassing when City Of Melbourne Lord Mayor Nicholas Reece recently posed for a photo with Merivale’s billionaire boss Hemmes.
Lucas quietly campaigned for Reece’s deputy, Roshena Campbell, before she joined Reece on Melbourne’s mayoral ticket in mid-2024. When I interview Lucas, he says he supports them both.
The restaurateur would have more venues around Australia by now if it weren’t for COVID-19, as his ambition has always been for a national and international business, he says.
He’s just unveiled a characteristically bold second foray into Sydney: Grill Americano in the centre of the city’s “prime-cut zone”.
Lucas’ business acumen and ambition demand respect from his peers – and in his hometown, Geelong, he is a hero.
The restaurateur is a long-time supporter of the Cats, and in 2024 the AFL club approached him to open Club Chin Chin at GMHBA Stadium.
The regional outpost “speaks volumes” about what the restaurateur is trying to achieve, Cats chief executive Steve Hocking says.
“He’s very thoughtful about where he places [his restaurants], and the access people have to them,” Hocking tells me.
Local hospitality matriarch Lyndsay Sharp, who is also on the Cats’ board, describes Lucas as a risk-taker who is “always raising the bar”, while Brown says the restaurateur has more energy than men half his age.
But there’s a lesser-known side to Lucas: he’s a romantic, his former publicist says. “I don’t think many people you speak to will describe him like that.”
It’s a side of Lucas likely born in his uncle’s restaurant, where – as a starry-eyed kid – he fell under the allure of towering cakes, croquembouches and ice sculptures, in what felt like “a fancy show” he couldn’t afford.
Back at Bâtard, it comes through in the light cast by the hanging lanterns outside, which beckon diners to escape from the chaos of Melbourne’s CBD.
It draws their gaze to the sparkling Parisian chandelier centrepiece of the restaurant’s first floor, and blares through speakers on its ceiling, where Nat King Cole sings “Love was made for me and you …”
Lucas has become the curator of his own fantasy – and he’ll step on anyone who tries to take it from him.
Crisis support is available 24/7 from Lifeline (13 11 14).
The author dined at Maison Bâtard as a guest of the Lucas Collective.

Michael Mohammed Ahmad confronts traumatic childhood abuse in his new novel, Bugger
Michael Mohammed Ahmad is marking his 40th birthday with the publication of his most confronting book yet.
Warning: This story contains descriptions of sexual abuse.
Ahmad is the founder of the influential Sweatshop Literacy Movement, a Western Sydney collective committed to giving voice to diverse communities.
He's also the author of four novels, including The Lebs (2018) and The Other Half of You (2021), both shortlisted for the Miles Franklin Literary Award.
His latest novel, published this month, is Bugger, an unsparing account of 24 hours in the life of a 10-year-old boy who is sexually assaulted by his 17-year-old cousin.
A proponent of own-voices writing, Ahmad draws on his own experience of childhood sexual abuse in the novel.
It's a book he says he couldn't have written earlier in his writing career.
"I don't think I could have done this 20 years ago when I first began writing," he tells ABC Radio National's The Book Show.
"I'll turn 40 this week, and it's taken me 40 years, really, to live the kind of life and develop the education and the skill set, as well as the courage and resilience, to put together this book.
"I was ready to tell the story at the time that I started writing it, but it took me my entire life to get here."
The tragedy of abuse
The process of writing the novel, followed by the back-and-forth of editing, was gruelling for Ahmad.
"Every time I had to work on the book, every time I had to sit down and write in explicit detail some of the scenes, the quite harrowing scenes, I had to relive the story itself. I had to relive the memories," he says.
He was also cognisant of the effect the book's publication could have on his family and others in his circle: "The victims, myself included, and also the perpetrators, and then the enablers, the people around the victims and the perpetrators and how they participated in the crimes that are depicted in the book."
The author is aware that Bugger is a book that deals with a distressing subject.
"The tragedy of sexual abuse against a child is the worst thing that can happen to a family," he says. "And I come from a family where we've had many tragedies."
Other kinds of misfortune — illness, death or accident — often bring families together in their grief, he says.
"Whether it's at home or at the funeral or at the cemetery, in the days, the weeks, the months and sometimes even in the years after, family members are literally holding each other, consoling each other, checking in on each other, bringing food over for one another."
Child sexual abuse often plays out differently.
"It's the kind of story that doesn't bring a family together. It's the kind of story that absolutely tears an entire family apart," he says.
"Not least of all, and this is probably the most important detail … because in many cases, family members will side with and protect the perpetrator over the victim."
This last point informed his decision to write the novel as a first-person narrative in the present-tense, rather than give the narrator, Hamoodi, the advantage of hindsight.
"I want to emphasise that I did write it very delicately and sensitively because I was aware of the pain that some readers might go through," he says.
"[But] I really wanted to show the confusion, not just the pain, but the confusion that a child [who is the victim of sexual abuse] goes through."
Discussing the book on ABC Radio National's The Bookshelf, co-host Cassie McCullagh says the result is "a convincing and evocative portrayal of the life of a child through their eyes".
Fellow host Kate Evans agrees. "It's deliberately discomforting and almost claustrophobic," she says.
"It's being trapped under the sheets with the boy, and with the experience and with the secrecy and the silence, which makes it relentless but also powerful."
'Write like you're dead'
Despite the deeply personal and traumatic nature of the story he tells in the novel, Ahmad approaches it with unflinching honesty.
"I consider myself literally an open book," he says. "There's no question that I find offensive. There's no conversation that I would shy away from having."
This sense of fearlessness has always underpinned Ahmad's creative writing practice.
"You have to produce your work like you're dead," he says
"I strongly believe that if a writer isn't 100 per cent truthful in what they are trying to communicate to their audience, then, by extension, the audience won't believe what they're saying.
"You have to be willing to open yourself up to be completely vulnerable and to confront the darkest elements of your lived experiences and your reality."
It's a philosophy shared by his Sweatshop colleagues, including Winnie Dunn, whose debut novel Dirt Poor Islanders was shortlisted for the Miles Franklin Literary Award in 2025.
But "writing like you're dead" requires a thick skin and a disregard for any ensuing fallout.
"You can't be afraid of consequences," he says.
"If I spent too much time thinking about the possible outcomes, how it might affect me or affect certain people in my life that I care for dearly, I think I would get cold feet and prevent myself from doing it or going all the way with what I need to communicate.
"So, I tend to try and block out that possibility while I'm creating the work."
Justice for victims
Ahmad closes his novel with "un-acknowledgements" rather than the usual gratitude-filled acknowledgement section.
The two-line paragraph reads:
"How cruel of me to ask any decent person to take credit for such a book? How selfish of me to ask any dignified creature to share its burden?"
Ahmad says he initially tried to write a typical acknowledgements section.
"I must have written about 30 variations of an acknowledgements, but every time I did, I found myself very overwhelmed emotionally.
"Everybody that I love dearly and that I'm grateful towards for having helped me produce this book, I didn't want to taint their name with the tragic story that unfolds."
The author has already received correspondence from people who have read the book.
"The first thing they do is they thank me for having the courage to come forward and tell this story, and then they share their own story … of abuse or the experience of somebody they love who's been through abuse," he says.
It's a note of hope in an otherwise bleak episode.
"If the book can provide an opportunity for us as a country to have the conversation, to find the confidence and the courage to come forward, and in doing so, destigmatise this widespread issue, I think that could ultimately lead to justice for victims," Ahmad says.

Trump pardons 5 former NFL players ranging from perjury to drug trafficking
Ex-NFL players Joe Klecko, Nate Newton, Jamal Lewis, Travis Henry and the late Billy Cannon are all granted clemency.
President Donald Trump has pardoned five former professional football players – one posthumously – for various crimes ranging from perjury to drug trafficking.
The pardons were announced on Friday by White House pardon czar Alice Marie Johnson. Ex-NFL players Joe Klecko, Nate Newton, Jamal Lewis, Travis Henry and the late Billy Cannon were granted clemency.

“As football reminds us, excellence is built on grit, grace, and the courage to rise again. So is our nation,” Johnson wrote on the social media site X, as she thanked Trump for his “continued commitment to second chances”.
Johnson said Dallas Cowboys owner Jerry Jones “personally” shared the news with Newton, who won three Super Bowls with the team.
The White House did not return a request for comment Thursday night on why Trump, an avid sports fan, pardoned the players.
Klecko, a former star for the New York Jets, pleaded guilty to perjury after lying to a federal grand jury that was investigating insurance fraud. A defensive lineman, Klecko was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 2023. He was a two-time Associated Press All-Pro player and a four-time Pro Bowler.
Newton, an offensive lineman, pleaded guilty to a federal drug trafficking charge after authorities discovered $10,000 in his pick-up truck as well as 175 pounds (79kg) of marijuana in an accompanying car driven by another man. Newton was a two-time All-Pro player and six-time Pro Bowler.
Lewis, formerly of the Baltimore Ravens and the Cleveland Browns, pleaded guilty in a drug case in which he used a cellphone to try to set up a drug deal not long after he was a top pick in the 2000 NFL draft. Lewis, a running back, was named an All-Pro once and was a one-time Pro Bowler. He was named the 2003 AP Offensive Player of the Year.
Henry, who played for the Denver Broncos, pleaded guilty to conspiracy to traffic cocaine for financing a drug ring that moved the drug between Colorado and Montana. He was a running back for three teams and a one-time Pro Bowler.
And Cannon — who played with the Houston Oilers, Oakland Raiders and Kansas City Chiefs — admitted to counterfeiting in the mid-1980s after a series of bad investments and debts left him broke.
Cannon was a two-time All-Pro player and a two-time Pro Bowler. Cannon also won the 1959 Heisman Trophy while starring for Louisiana State University, where he had one of the most memorable plays in college football history: an 89-yard punt return for a touchdown against Ole Miss. He died in 2018.

MUNICH, Germany — German Chancellor Friedrich Merz said that U.S. leadership can no longer be taken for granted and Europe must prepare to stand more firmly on its own, in a stark warning to world leaders in Munich.
“The leadership claim of the U.S. is being challenged, perhaps already lost,” Merz said during the opening of the Munich Security Conference, laying out the starkest assessment yet from Berlin of a world increasingly defined by great-power rivalry. “In the era of great powers, our freedom is no longer simply guaranteed. It is under threat.”
He argued the global system itself may already have collapsed. “The international order based on rights and rules … no longer exists in the way it once did,” he said.

Two Britons among three dead in French Alps avalanche
Two Britons and one French person have died in an avalanche in the French Alps on Friday.
The British pair were part of a group of five people skiing off-piste with an instructor in the Manchet valley, near Val d'Isère, a spokeswoman for the resort told the BBC.
The French national was skiing alone when the avalanche struck at 11:30 local time (10:30 GMT), Albertville prosecutor Benoit Bachelet said in a statement announcing the deaths.
Another British person has minor injuries, he added.
A spokesperson for the Foreign Office told the BBC they are aware of the death of the two British men and they are "in contact with the local authorities and stand ready to offer consular assistance".
A manslaughter investigation has now been launched by the Albertville public prosecutor's office and will be carried out by CRS Alpes mountain rescue police.
The ski instructor, who was unharmed, tested negative after taking alcohol and drug tests, according to Bachelet.
Antoine Martignon and his wife were in La Vallée du Manchet on Friday morning, and captured the avalanche on video.
The pair had initially tried to ski in Val d'Isère, but found the slopes too crowded and decided to go for a walk.
"I was watching people free riding and skiing off-piste, and thought it looks very dangerous," said Martignon.
"In 20 seconds there was an avalanche, it went down and took people below."
Val d'Isère has already experienced avalanches this winter, with one person dying in the resort of Tignes nearby last month.
France's national weather service had issued a red alert for avalanche risk across the Savoie region on Thursday, which was then lifted on Friday. But the risk level remained high across the Alps with "very unstable snow cover".
The avalanche comes in the wake of Storm Nils, which passed through France the day before, leaving between 60cm and 100cm of snow, the weather service said.
There have been a number of fatal avalanches in the region in recent weeks, including the death of a British man off-piste skiing at the La Plagne resort in January.
"We have had some very complicated, very unstable snow since the beginning of the season," Luc Nicolino, slopes manager at La Plagne, told AFP.
"It's a kind of mille-feuille with many hidden, fragile layers."

Trump warns of 'very big force' if talks with Iran fail

President Donald Trump has said that the US is prepared to deploy a “very big force” if ongoing negotiations with Iran fail.
"Well, in case we don't make a deal, we'll need it," Trump told reporters when asked why he decided to send a second aircraft carrier to the region.
"It'll be leaving. It'll be leaving very soon. We have one out there that just arrived. We have it ready. A big, a very big force," he added.
His remarks came after local media reported that the US would send the USS Gerald R. Ford to the Middle East to back up the USS Abraham Lincoln carrier strike group.
Venezuela
Trump said that he plans to visit Venezuela, citing what he described as strong ties between the two countries and growing cooperation in the oil sector.
“I’m going to visit Venezuela. We haven’t decided (when),” Trump told reporters at the White House.
Trump praised relations with interim Venezuelan President Delcy Rodriguez, saying Washington and Caracas are “working together very closely,” particularly on energy.
“We have a very good relationship,” he said, adding that major US oil companies are operating in the country and that the partnership is generating significant revenue.
“The relationship we have right now with Venezuela is, I would say, a 10.”
Asked whether the US recognises Rodriguez’s administration as Venezuela’s official government, Trump responded, “We have done that. We’re dealing with them.”
He said oil production is on the rise and that the US is refining Venezuelan crude, describing the relationship as “strong”.
US Energy Secretary Chris Wright visited the South American country this week to assess its oil industry and hold talks with the interim government centred on a massive overhaul of the country’s energy sector to revitalise its economy and reintegrate its oil reserves into the global market.
Wright’s high-profile visit to Venezuela follows a political shift on January 3, when US forces abducted President Nicolas Maduro and his wife Cilia Flores in a raid in Caracas and transported them to New York, where they are being held in a federal detention facility.

Using Starlink ruse, Ukrainian cyber forces trick Russian soldiers into revealing positions, donating to armed forces
A Ukrainian cyber unit claims it tricked Russian soldiers into revealing their positions and donating money to Ukraine's Armed Forces by pretending to help them reconnect Starlink devices they were using on the battlefield.
Russian forces have long been using unauthorized Starlink access to operate drones and other military equipment in occupied areas of Ukraine, but this was effectively switched off last week after the Ukrainian government, in cooperation with SpaceX, introduced a mandatory registration and "whitelist system.
Monopolizing on Russia's desperation to regain access to a crucial battlefield technology, Ukrainian cyber forces posed as a Russian-linked activation service offering to help restore terminals that had been disconnected under the new registration rules.
The operation was carried out by the 256th Cyber Assault Division in cooperation with the InformNapalm and MILITANT, according to a statement published on social media on Feb. 12.
Russian servicemen were instructed to submit identifying information and the coordinates of their terminals under the guise that the devices would be reactivated through Ukrainian administrative service centers.
The group said they collected 2,420 data packets related to Russian-used terminals and transferred them to Ukrainian law enforcement and defense agencies. According to the statement, the data was provided to authorities "for final transfer into brick mode," referring to the disabling of the terminals.
The group claims the terminals were subsequently deactivated. The Kyiv Independent could not independently verify the claims.
The group also said it received $5,870 from Russian soldiers seeking to restore connectivity which it is donating to fundraising efforts for Ukrainian drones.
It also identified 31 Ukrainian "traitors" willing to assist Russian forces by registering terminals. According to the statement, that information has been forwarded to Ukraine’s Security Service (SBU).
Starlink, which provides high-speed satellite internet without reliance on local mobile networks, has become critical infrastructure on both sides of the war. Ukrainian forces rely heavily on the system for frontline communications and drone coordination. At the same time, Kyiv has accused Russia of exploiting the technology to improve battlefield connectivity.
On Feb. 10, Ukraine’s Coordination Headquarters for the Treatment of Prisoners of War said Russia was coercing the families of Ukrainian POWs into registering Starlink terminals, describing the tactic as another attempt to bypass Ukraine’s new verification system.

Man indicted for murder after fatal helicopter crash and shootout in Flagstaff
The suspect hopped from roof to roof while shooting at officers, police said
- Bookmark
An Arizona man has been indicted on two counts of first degree felony murder and dozens of other charges after a helicopter crashed during a shootout.
Terrell Storey, 50, opened fire on officers from multiple rooftops in a Flagstaff neighborhood on the night of Feb. 4 in a standoff that lasted over two hours, police said.
As he was being captured, a state helicopter crash responding to the shooting crashed. Trooper paramedic Hunter Bennett, 28, and pilot Robert Skankey, 61, were killed.
The indictment does not specify whether Storey fired at the helicopter with the semiautomatic long rifle that police said he was using. The cause of the crash remains under investigation by federal authorities.
After his arrest, Storey was hospitalized for gunshot wounds that were not life-threatening.
Coconino County Attorney Ammon Barker said Friday that he anticipates Storey will be arraigned on Feb. 23 but declined further comment on the facts of the case.
The indictment names as victims 25 law enforcement officers who responded to the scene and people who live in homes in the area.
The indictment totals 60 criminal counts, including the two felony murder charges for the deaths of Bennett and Skankey. Other charges include aggravated assault, burglary disorderly conduct and endangerment.
Storey remained hospitalized Friday, said Jon Paxton with the Coconino County Sheriff’s Office.
He's being held on a $5 million bond and is represented by the Coconino County Public Defender’s Office. The Associated Press left a voicemail message for Public Defender Jennifer Stock.
The confrontation that led to the helicopter crash began when officers responded to a domestic violence call, according to Flagstaff Police Chief Sean Connolly.
As the officers spoke with the victim in the front yard, Storey shot at them from the back of the residence with a semiautomatic rifle, Connolly said. A protracted gunbattle ensued, with the suspect “hopping from roof to roof” in the neighborhood while shooting at officers, the chief said.
The helicopter crew had been playing a common role, helping officers on the ground. Before crashing, the helicopter was making a pass back to the shootout scene when it slowed to almost a hover about 1,000 feet (300 meters) over a hilltop, according to public flight-path data.
Skankey was a longtime resident of Kingman, Arizona, and had been hired by the Arizona Department of Public Safety in May 2021. He previously served in the U.S. Marine Corps and was married with four children.
Bennett was an honors graduate of Arizona State University and the top graduate of his 2023 Arizona Law Enforcement Academy class. He transferred to an air rescue unit in 2024 and months later married his high school sweetheart, officials said.
Barker said in a statement announcing the indictment that his office was “committed to pursuing this case with the diligence and care it requires.”
“Our hearts remain with the families of Hunter Bennett and Robert Skankey, and with all the families impacted by this incident,” Barker said.

What we know about Angus Taylor's policies

Here's what we know about Angus Taylor's policies
In short:
Angus Taylor says the Liberal Party will focus on "Australian values" under his leadership.
He has foreshadowed a stricter immigration policy and a focus on deregulation.
What's next?
The Liberal Party is expected to release its immigration policy within a few weeks.
New Liberal leader Angus Taylor has signalled he will pursue a stricter immigration policy and a return to "Australian values" in his first pitch to win back voters.
His deputy Jane Hume said the party would not be moving "left, right or centre", but rather focusing on "hard-working Australians".
Standing in front of six Australian flags in Canberra yesterday, Mr Taylor outlined some core principles for the Liberal Party's direction under his leadership.
His policies remain light on detail for now, but here are the promises so far.
Immigration
Mr Taylor will unveil an immigration policy within weeks and said it would be a key priority for the party, both as a vehicle to reduce cost-of-living pressures and to "protect the Australian way of life".
"It is clear that numbers have been too high, and standards have been too low," he said.
"If someone doesn't subscribe to our core beliefs, the door must be shut."
When asked who those people might be, Mr Taylor was not definitive but referenced the Bondi terror attack and said Australians were "less free".
"Our borders have been opened to people who hate our way of life. People who don't want to embrace Australia, and who want Australia to change for them,"he said.
Mr Taylor said he wanted immigrants to adhere to core beliefs in democracy, the rule of law and basic freedoms.
But he also said he believed "good migration" was in Australia's best interests.
"But we don't want bad immigration," he said.
This rhetoric is similar to comments from One Nation politicians, and in the Newspoll that preceded Sussan Ley's last days as leader, pollsters found almost a third of responders preferred One Nation's policies on immigration over the major parties.
Mr Taylor insisted his party was not trying to become One Nation "lite".
"We are not seeking to be One Nation lite — but we respect the fact that those voters who might be thinking about One Nation have reasons to do so. We need to restore their confidence in us."
Cost of living
Mr Taylor said he wanted to reduce financial pressure on families, including "expanding choice in child care", and indicated he did not support Labor's universal childcare model.
He also touched on energy costs and said Australia's energy policy needed to be "based on common sense, not Labor's net-zero ideology".
The Liberals believe some of Labor's carbon taxes, including on family vehicles, electricity and manufacturing, should be scrapped.
Mr Taylor said he also wanted to re-establish home ownership as the "centrepiece of the Australian dream".
"All Australians, especially young Australians, deserve the stability and the opportunity to own a home."
The economy
Mr Taylor said he considered free markets central to the economic prosperity of Australia.
"Bigger government isn't the solution to Australia's problems. Australians are the solution,"he said.
The Liberal leader, who served as shadow treasurer under Peter Dutton, said the party would focus on growing the economy, deregulation and scrapping "bad taxes".
"We will ferociously fight Labor's bad taxes — taxes on homes, taxes on superannuation, taxes on our children's future."
He also said he did not like tariffs.
"And I'm going to continue to fight for access to markets for our resources, our miners, our farmers, manufacturers, our service providers."
The policies we won't see
Mr Taylor took some responsibility for the Coalition's lacklustre economic policies taken to the last election, but would not be drawn into an analysis of the election campaign.
He acknowledged the party had "got some big calls wrong", including its opposition to Labor's income tax cuts.
But he said the Liberals had learned lessons from the election and were committed to being the "party of lower taxes".
Ms Hume was also forced to answer for her part in the work-from-home policy the Coalition scrapped midway through the campaign after a massive backlash from its base.
"That policy was a mistake, which is why we didn't take it to the election," Ms Hume said.
"We won't be taking it to a future election."

Air Force Working with Collins, Shield AI to Build Autonomy Software for CCAs
Unknown
Unknown Publisher
2026-02-13
18:26:33 UTC
03:26:33 KST

The Air Force is working with Collins Aerospace and Shield AI to develop the software Collaborative Combat Aircraft will use to fly missions alongside manned fighters, the service revealed Feb. 12—and drone-maker General Atomics was quick to announce it has already flown its YFQ-42A aircraft with Collins’ system.
Shield AI, meanwhile, said Feb. 13 it expects to start flight testing its software on Anduril Industries’ YFQ-44A drone “in the coming months.”
The two companies are developing “mission” autonomy software, which will allow CCAs to take complex action when given basic directions from a pilot in a manned aircraft. Shield AI, for example, noted in a release that its system allows aircraft to “reroute around no-fly zones, avoid or engage obstacles, respond to unexpected conditions, and complete missions safely and effectively without human intervention.”
That’s separate from but related to the flight autonomy software responsible for executing basic or preplanned operations, like taking off, sticking to a flight path, or landing.
Anduril and General Atomics have been publicly competing to build the first aircraft for the CCA program since April 2024, and the Air Force has announced milestones like first flights and designations.
By comparison, the competition to build the software that will enable the drones to operate semi-autonomously had been kept largely secret until now. Back in July 2024, officials revealed that five companies were working on the “mission” software side of the program but declined to name them citing security concerns. Then, in September 2025, Aviation Week reported that Collins and Shield had been selected to move forward, but no official announcement followed.
Now, nearly six months later, the Air Force has confirmed the two firms’ selection. The service release touted the integration of both into the Autonomy Government Reference Architecture—the open, universal standard the government has set for mission autonomy software that all contractors must build their systems to comply with.
“Verifying A-GRA across multiple partners is critical to our acquisition strategy,” Col. Timothy Helfrich, portfolio acquisition executive for fighters and advanced aircraft, said in a statement. “It proves that we are not locked into a single solution or a single vendor. We are instead building a competitive ecosystem where the best algorithms can be deployed rapidly to the warfighter on any A-GRA compliant platform, regardless of the vendor providing the algorithm.”
Collins is paired with General Atomics, while Shield AI is working with Anduril—feeding into the dynamic of “established Pentagon supplier vs. Silicon Valley startup” that has defined the GA-Anduril competition. Collins has gone through various mergers and acquisitions but traces its roots back decades, while Shield AI was founded in 2015 and quickly expanded with backing from venture capital firms.
Shortly after the Air Force made its announcement, General Atomics published its own release with additional details on how it has already started flight testing Collins’ software on the YFQ-42A.
Testing began earlier this month, GA’s release states, and Collins’ software, dubbed “Sidekick,” controlled the drone for more than four hours. During that time, a human operator on the ground provided “various commands” to the drone and the software interpreted those commands and directed the aircraft to execute them “with high accuracy,” the release states.
GA’s release also notes that since the YFQ-42A made its first flight in August 2025, the company has built and flown “multiple” aircraft, including instances of “push-button autonomous takeoffs and landings”—using flight autonomy software separate from the mission software. An image accompanying the release shows three YFQ-42s on a flightline.
Ryan Bunge, vice president and general manager for strategic defense solutions at Collins, said in a statement that “the rapid integration of Sidekick onto this platform to perform various combat-relevant tasks highlight the strength and adaptability of Collins’ open systems approach. The autonomy capabilities showcased in this flight highlight nearly a decade of dedicated investment and close collaboration with our customers to advance collaborative mission autonomy.”
Anduril and Shield AI, meanwhile, released their own statements promising flight tests with Shield’s “Hivemind” autonomy software in the near future—Shield’s release states that flight demonstrations are expected “in the coming months,” while Anduril’s says the firm is looking forward to a first flight “very soon.”
Shield noted in its release that Hivemind has already operated on multiple other aircraft, including General Atomics’ MQ-20 Avenger drone, the U.S. Navy’s BQM-177 target drone, and Airbus’ H145 helicopter.
“Shield AI is proud to be named a mission autonomy provider supporting the Collaborative Combat Aircraft program,” Gary Steele, the firm’s CEO, said in a statement. “The Air Force is moving with urgency to explore how autonomy can reshape air combat, and we have spent years preparing for this—building, testing, and flying mission autonomy in the real world. We will work relentlessly to deliver and to help advance the next era of airpower alongside the Air Force and its industry partners.”
Anduril, meanwhile, emphasized the YFQ-44A’s modularity.
“The aircraft’s simple design, external weapons stores, and open hardware and software architectures ensure that the aircraft can easily be configured with a range of mission systems, software suites, and payloads to support a wide variety of missions,” Jason Levin, senior vice president of engineering, said.

Zelenskyy: Ukraine negotiating with partners on largest ever aid package by 24 February
Ukraine is expecting several major aid packages ahead of the anniversary of the Russian full-scale invasion and has received positive signals from its partners.
Source: Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy speaking to journalists in Munich, as reported by European Pravda
Details: Zelenskyy shared these expectations after a so-called Berlin-format meeting with Ukraine's partners, which included European, EU and NATO leaders. He said the main subject of the discussions was the energy situation.
"We discussed the most complex energy issues we have in Ukraine in detail. And we discussed with the entire Berlin group the separate aid packages in addition to those that are currently being prepared," Zelenskyy said.
Early arrangements suggest that the joint energy aid package could be record-breaking in size. "I think we can now work on the largest energy assistance package," Zelenskyy noted.
He emphasised that the package is expected to be finalised very quickly, and that large military aid packages are also anticipated.
Quote: "Separately, we will work on air defence missiles and other measures to strengthen our armed forces. We want – and all partners have agreed – to deliver the maximum support packages for Ukraine within 10-11 days, by 24 February. We want the packages, decisions and hopefully also sanctions to be ready by the 24th."
Background:
- Earlier, in Munich, Zelenskyy discussed joint weapons production with German Chancellor Friedrich Merz.
- Ukrainian Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha said that agreements on rapid accession to the EU are realistic and negotiations are ongoing.
- An AI-generated video depicting drones striking targets in Davos and Brussels was shown at the Munich Security Conference.

How the Space Force Is Managing Growth at Its Busiest Launch Range
Unknown
Unknown Publisher
2026-02-13

03:24:16 KST

If the forecast holds, the world’s busiest spaceport is poised to get even busier.
The Space Force’s latest projections show that its Eastern Range at Cape Canaveral Space Force Station in Florida could be supporting as many as 500 launches annually by 2036—a fivefold increase over the next 10 years.
That forecast is based on business projections from each of the major launch companies who have pads at the spaceport, including SpaceX, United Launch Alliance, and Blue Origin, as well as newcomers like Firefly, Stoke, and Relativity. Their backlogs are filled with commercial and government customers making plans for proliferated constellations with hundreds to thousands of satellites. They’re also seeing demand from the Pentagon itself, which is growing increasingly dependent on space for things like navigation and communication and wants more spacecraft to track and even intercept threats.
Rapid growth is nothing new for the range, which is home to both Cape Canaveral and NASA’s Kennedy Space Center. Over the last decade, SpaceX’s mastery of reusable rocketry and its prolific launch rate—combined with the rise of proliferated satellite constellations and demand for space-enabled services—has spiked the spaceport’s annual launch rate from around 18 missions in 2016 to 109 last year.
The Space Force in recent years been managing that growth by rethinking the way it operates its ranges, running them more like commercial spaceports than government launch facilities. That means streamlining processes, introducing more automation, relocating office buildings to increase efficiency, and pushing for policy changes that allow it to collect more fees from the companies that use its facilities and reinvest them in infrastructure improvement projects. Congress has allocated $1.3 billion between fiscal 2024 to 2028 for the service to make those improvements at the Cape and its West Coast range at Vandenberg Space Force in California, part of an effort called “Spaceport of the Future.”
Col. Brian Chatman, who oversees operations at the Cape as commander of Space Launch Delta 45, said that funding is helping reshape the landscape at the range, but there’s more work to be done and more resources needed to meet an annual cadence of 500 launches—a milestone he thinks could come much sooner than 2036.
Chatman’s instinct to be prepared for launch rates to grow faster than expected is based on past experience. In 2017, the Space Force projected the Eastern Range would hit the century mark—100 launchs per year—by 2030. The service reached that cadence in 2025.
“We’re laying in plans now for 500 in ‘36, but I would not be at all surprised if we saw that happen sooner,” he told Air & Space Forces Magazine in an interview. “Right now, 500 by 2030 is really what I’m pushing the team to build the plans to.”
Spaceport of the Future
With funding in hand for the first phase of the Spaceport of the Future infrastructure overhaul, SLD 45 has spent much of the last two years in design mode, finalizing building plans and relocating offices to ensure it’s making the most of its limited footprint.
One such project involves relocating government workspaces that are currently scattered throughout what’s known as the “industrial area,” where launch service providers assemble and test their rockets and prepare hardware to be transported. By consolidating the government functions in another area of the range, Chatman said, companies can expand and use that space more efficiently.
Another project will move some of the range’s weather balloon release stations that are currently situated within one of the launch complex’s blast damage assessment areas, which can cause schedule issues that Chatman said have led to launches being scrubbed.
“Relocating the weather balloon release facility more inland to decouple it from the blast damage assessment area of one of the launch complexes allows us then to be able to continue to support weather balloon releases while, simultaneously, launches are happening, and allows people to access the weather balloon location to release those weather balloons while we’re doing hazardous operations in and around the launch sites,” he said.
Construction on these and other phase one projects will start early this year and continue for the next three years or so, Chatman said.
Spaceport 2036
But the work won’t stop after that. As the SLD 45 team completes the first round of projects, it’s also making plans for upgrades it will need to support the growth it expects by 2036, if not sooner—projects it didn’t account for as part of the Spaceport of the Future initiative. The service is still finalizing its strategy in partnership with NASA and its launch providers, and Chatman said the goal is to have it finalized this summer and then included as part of the Space Force’s fiscal 2028 budget request.
Through its meetings with industry, the Eastern Range team identified five broad focus areas it needs to address to support a higher launch cadence:
- infrastructure and utilities
- transportation and access limitations
- commodity supply chains
- process and organizational alignment
- expanded launch support facilities
One major need, Chatman said, is for a transport lane dedicated to moving rocket boosters across the range. Today, the base relies on one main travel route to get on and off the Cape. Launch vendors use that same lane to transport rockets to the pad and—as more companies transition to reusable vehicles—to bring spent boosters back to their processing facilities.
That wasn’t an issue when the range was supporting 10 or 20 launches a year, but today, it presents a real challenge. Chatman said the issue was on full display last November after Blue Origin’s New Glenn made its second flight and the company recovered its booster. Getting the booster from the wharf to the company’s processing facility took more than four hours and caused major disruption to traffic flow.
“That was four and a half hours that we had to come up with alternate means for personnel just to get to work,” Chatman said. “I’ve got to have dedicated routes for those transports to happen, again, to maximize efficiency for all operations happening now on the Eastern Range.
The range is also considering changes to the way it provides utilities and delivers commodities, like fuel, to launch sites. Today, it moves fuel via hundreds of trucks and is seeing a growing demand for power and wastewater treatment, Chatman said.
“As we look to increase the amount of launches, that increases the amount of wastewater that is being produced,” he said. “A wastewater treatment facility that can grow and stay on par with the requirements to be able to handle that wastewater coming off those launch vehicles is something we didn’t account for in the first Spaceport of the Future.”
Near-Term Needs
While the bulk of these projects will be included in future budget requests, Chatman said the range is hopeful it might be able to secure funding for a few more pressing needs in the fiscal 2027 budget, due for release this spring. That includes the booster transport lane and some of the commodity distribution needs.
Chatman said he’s also trying to make a case for more near-term funding to fill personnel gaps. SLD 45 has 3,000 personnel, about 2,000 of them government civilians. The range has never fully recovered from cuts made during sequestration in 2012 and then took an additional hit last year as civilian employees left via the government’s deferred resignation program.
Today, the range has 450 approved but unfilled manpower billets that Chatman said he lacks the funding to fill. Those positions are crucial during what could be five to 10 years of construction at the Eastern Range, providing everything from legal support to navigate environmental regulations to maintaining day-to-day operations.
“The team is absolutely getting after it, but one of the conversations we’re having within Space Systems Command and across the Air Force and Space Force is, I need some additional bodies to be able to meet that cadence we have going forward,” Chatman said. “We are methodically going through and executing as fast and as hard as we can, but within the constraints that we have, just from a limited manpower and resourcing perspective.”

Implementation of EU standards in agricultural sector requires audit of state capacity – ex-official
The successful implementation of European standards in Ukraine's agricultural sector depends less on passing laws than on the state's actual ability to enforce them, said former head of the State Service for Food Safety and Consumer Protection (2016–2019) and current serviceman of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, Volodymyr Lapa, in an interview with the channel MinSelo.
"The issue is not simply writing into law that 'we comply with EU standards.' The key question is whether the state service is prepared to enforce the new rules and whether this works in practice at every enterprise and in every laboratory. Legislation provides for an audit of the state service's capacity by the Cabinet of Ministers, but it remains unclear whether such an audit has ever been conducted," he said.
According to Lapa, the real indicator of the situation is the statistics on violations recorded by the European side.
"If we look at the trend in notifications concerning Ukrainian products over recent years, we see that their number has essentially not changed. This means the control system has not qualitatively improved, and the implementation of standards without properly trained specialists risks remaining purely declarative," the expert said.
In his view, Ukraine must change its philosophy of oversight, shifting from process control to risk-based control, following the EU model, where businesses are responsible for safety and the state is responsible for the functioning of the system itself.
"The state should not control businesses as such, but rather the risks. If an inspector comes to an enterprise just to 'tick a box' or collect a bribe, that is imitation. The state must control the quality of its own inspector's work. Until we move to a model of controlling the controllers, we will continue to receive notifications," explained the former head of the State Service for Food Safety and Consumer Protection.

The Court of Arbitration for Sport on Friday rejected an appeal by Ukrainian skeleton racer Vladyslav Heraskevych against his disqualification from the Olympics.
The International Olympic Committee on Thursday blocked Heraskevych from performing at the Games for refusing to change his helmet, which depicted 22 Ukrainian athletes that Russia has killed during its war on Ukraine. The IOC said the helmet violated its guidelines on political messaging during the Games.
Heraskevych said his memorial act was not political and denied violating any rules. The IOC returned his accreditation to the Olympics, which are being held in Northern Italy, but still banned him from performing, despite a wave of support for Heraskevych from senior figures, including Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.

Trump administration sues Harvard, accusing it of defying investigation
US authorities are seeking documents to determine whether the Ivy League university had illegally considered race in its admissions process
The Trump administration sued Harvard University on Friday, accusing it of failing to comply with a federal investigation and seeking documents to determine whether the university had illegally considered race in its admissions process.
The move comes less than two weeks after US President Donald Trump said his administration was seeking $1 billion from Harvard to settle probes into school policies, after a news report that said Trump had dropped his demand for a payment from the Ivy League school.
Harvard representatives did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Trump’s administration has been threatening to withhold federal funds from Harvard and several other universities over issues including pro-Palestinian protests against Israel’s war in Gaza, campus diversity and transgender policies.
The US Justice Department said on Friday in a press release that Harvard had “repeatedly slow-walked the pace of production and refused to produce pertinent data and documents”, including admissions policies and correspondence related to banned diversity, equity and inclusion programmes.
In the complaint filed in Boston federal court, Justice Department lawyers said the documents requested will help assess whether Harvard is complying with a 2023 decision by the US Supreme Court which said that race-conscious college admissions programmes are unconstitutional.

World's rules-based order 'no longer exists', Germany's Merz warns
The rules-based world order "no longer exists", the German Chancellor has warned at a major security summit.
Opening the annual Munich Security Conference, Friedrich Merz told other world leaders that "our freedom is not guaranteed" in an era of big power politics, and that Europeans must be ready to make "sacrifice".
He also admitted that "a deep divide has opened between Europe and the United States".
The conference is taking place on the backdrop of US President Donald Trump threatening Denmark's sovereignty over Greenland by pledging to annex the Arctic territory and his tariffs on imports from European nations.
US Secretary of State Marco Rubio, who was listening to Merz and will deliver his own speech on Saturday, earlier spoke of a "new era in geopolitics".
Some 50 world leaders are expected to attend this year's conference, where European defence and the future of the transatlantic relationship will be discussed.
It comes at a time when US commitments to the Nato military alliance have been called into question. Trump's ambition to acquire Greenland has also been viewed by many European leaders as a watershed moment that has eroded trust with their biggest ally.
Trump told reporters outside the White House on Friday: "Greenland's gonna want us... We get along very well with Europe. We'll see how it works out. We're negotiating right now for Greenland."
The Russia-Ukraine war, tensions between the West and China, as well as a potential Iran-US nuclear deal are also on the agenda at the annual gathering.
Referring to multiple warnings that the rules-based order was collapsing, Merz told the conference: "I fear we must put it even more bluntly: this order, however imperfect it was even at its best, no longer exists in that form."
He also said that "a rift, a deep divide has opened between Europe and the United States. Vice-President JD Vance said this very openly here in Munich a year ago".
Merz continued: "He was right. The culture war of the Maga [Make America Great Again] movement is not ours. Freedom of speech ends here with us when that speech goes against human dignity and the constitution. We do not believe in tariffs and protectionism, but in free trade."
Last year, Vance attacked Europe, including the UK, for policies on free speech and immigration. His speech triggered a year of unprecedented transatlantic tension.
But Merz did not write off the decades-long partnership, instead appealing directly to the US by saying "let's repair and revive transatlantic trust".
The German leader also revealed that "confidential talks" were ongoing with French President Emmanuel Macron on creating a joint European nuclear deterrent. He gave no further details.
France and the UK are the only two nuclear powers in Europe - but Germany and many other European nations have traditionally relied on the US nuclear umbrella within the Nato alliance for deterrence.
Addressing the conference later on Friday, Macron reiterated his call for Europe to "learn to become a geopolitical power" in the new global context.
He said Europe was already re-arming following Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022 - but stressed that "we have to accelerate" and work collectively across the continent.
Describing the war in Ukraine's as Europe's "existential challenge", the French leader urged others not to "cave in to Russian demands" - but rather to increase pressure on Moscow to achieve a just peace.
Ahead of the Munich conference, Rubio warned that "the world is changing very fast right in front of us" after being asked whether his message to Europeans would be more conciliatory than Vance's a year ago.
"We live in a new era in geopolitics, and it's going to require all of us to sort of re-examine what that looks like and what our role is going to be," he said.
Tensions have been heightened in recent months as Trump has repeatedly said that Greenland is vital to US national security, stating without evidence that it was "covered with Russian and Chinese ships all over the place".
Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen said earlier in the day that she planned to meet Rubio to discuss the US threats to seize Greenland from its Nato ally.

Taylor Swift rumor sparks spike in golf tournament ticket sales
Tournament organizers had extra security plans in place just in case
- Bookmark
A Taylor Swift rumor led to a spike in ticket sales for the AT&T Pebble Beach Pro-am.
Pebble Beach had an extra buzz Friday morning as attendees held out hope that Swift would show up to support her fiancé, Kansas City Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce.
He is playing in the PGA Tour event that combines corporate CEOs and celebrities with golf's best.
Alas, Swifties, it was just another pretty day at Pebble Beach.
It still was good news for the Monterey Peninsula Foundation, which runs the event.
Tournament director Steve John said when Kelce was announced as playing in the pro-am, more than $60,000 in tickets were sold over the next 12 hours.
Swift is rumored to be in town. But she was not at Spyglass Hill Thursday, where Kelce was playing with pro partner Keith Mitchell along with Mackenzie Hughes and retired NFL quarterback Alex Smith.
No matter. Pebble Beach is the main attraction, and John said some $21,000 tickets for the second round were sold between 6:30 p.m. Thursday and 6:30 a.m. Friday, two hours before Kelce played.
More than 1,000 spectators lined the left side of the first fairway at Pebble Beach, but all they saw was Kelce hitting his tee shot to the right, into and out of the trees, and along the cart path (he made a par).
Sure, there was plenty of Chiefs gear in the crowd, one young girl wearing a Kansas City sweatshirt. The tournament has a long history of athletes over the years, including Ken Griffey Jr. playing in a group with Tiger Woods some 20 years ago. Roger Clemens once made a hole-in-one.
This, however, was clearly a Swift moment. Except that it wasn't.
John and his tournament staff left nothing to chance.
When he wasn't busy responding to text messages — will she be there or not? — he had plans in place for security, for transportation across the course, even a secure suite overlooking the 18th green.
The big crowd — not the largest, but more than usual — followed along the Kelce group down the first few holes. They still had four hours left. They had hope.

World’s largest drone fleet deployed to deter Russia
United Kingdom

NATO is moving to expand the use of unmanned systems in the Baltic Sea, after senior Alliance officials described the deployment of a large drone fleet in 2025 as a major proof of concept for rapidly fielding commercially available technology to protect critical undersea infrastructure.
The next phase of the initiative, Task Force X Baltic, will be formalised through a new letter of intent signed by eight participating Allies, with NATO arguing the programme represents a practical shift from innovation testing towards real operational adoption.
Speaking at NATO Headquarters in Brussels, Nikolaos Loutas, Director in NATOâ€™s Defence Industry, Innovation and Armaments Division, told myself and other journalists that the effort is tied directly to the Allianceâ€™s wider post-2025 Summit drive to accelerate the pace of technology integration. â€œAt the 2025 NATO Summit, Allied governments agreed a substantial increase in our defence spending to deliver on a new ambitious set of defence targets,â€ he said, adding that they also endorsed â€œa rapid adoption action plan to accelerate the pace of technology adoption to deliver on those targets.â€ He described the action plan as a mechanism to embed innovation into defence planning, aimed at addressing what he called the urgent operational need for effective new technology. â€œThe action plan mainstreams NATOâ€™s innovation efforts into defence planning and capability development to address our Armed Forcesâ€™ urgent need for innovative and effective technological products,â€ Loutas said.
He said Allies had committed to measures designed to accelerate procurement and integration, including shared best practice, new adoption pathways, and greater experimentation to reduce risk for new products. â€œThey committed to de-risk new products through providing more testing and experimentation opportunities to innovators,â€ he said, pointing to Task Force X Baltic as one of the practical mechanisms enabling this. Loutas said the initiative is now reaching a significant milestone, with NATO preparing to launch the second phase. â€œOne measure in this direction is the Task Force X framework, which is reaching a second milestone today, a very important one, with the signing of a letter of intent for the second phase of Task Force X Baltic,â€ he told reporters.
Loutas said the first phase of Task Force X Baltic was launched in support of NATOâ€™s Baltic Sentry activity in 2025 and was intended to show that Allied forces could integrate new technology at speed alongside conventional capabilities. â€œTask Force X supports Allies rapidly acquiring, integrating and deploying new technological products alongside our conventional forces,â€ he said. He added that the project demonstrated how close collaboration between militaries and industry could deliver persistent surveillance at scale, covering multiple domains. â€œThe first phase of Task Force X Baltic demonstrated that allied navies and army forces, when collaborating closely with industry, can deliver persistent intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance from sea floor to space at speed, at scale and more affordably,â€ he said.
NATO officials said the second phase will see eight Allies reaffirm cooperation on rapidly acquiring technology-enabled, multi-domain capabilities for naval operations: Denmark, Estonia, Finland, Germany, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland and Sweden. â€œAt todayâ€™s signing ceremonyâ€¦ eight participating Alliesâ€¦ reaffirmed their readiness to cooperate on rapidly acquiring new technology enabled multi domain capabilities for naval operations,â€ Loutas said, adding that the work supports NATOâ€™s broader Digital Ocean concept endorsed by Defence Ministers. â€œThis will contribute to the implementation of the Digital Ocean vision,â€ he said.
Alongside Task Force X Baltic, Loutas said several other multinational initiatives were progressing, including cooperation on military airworthiness in crisis or conflict, ballistic missile defence capability development, a deep precision strike initiative involving drone technology, and Swedenâ€™s entry into an existing NATO air mission memorandum. â€œAll these initiatives demonstrate concrete actions taken by Allies to meet their capability targets,â€ he said, framing them as part of the Allianceâ€™s wider effort to strengthen deterrence and defence. He added that Task Force X Baltic in particular is intended to translate experimentation into deployment, with a focus on rapid acquisition of commercial systems and real-world testing in operational conditions.
â€œWe will see commercially available drones and systems be acquired quickly and deployed in operational conditions in the Baltic Sea,â€ he said. â€œBy integrating those innovative solutions alongside our conventional forces Allies will be able to test real time interoperability and command and control integration,â€ with lessons then captured in a playbook that can be scaled. â€œLessons learnedâ€¦ will be summarised [in] a playbook which will allow NATO to scale and quickly establish further Task Force instantiations in the future,â€ he said.
NATOâ€™s Supreme Allied Commander Transformation, Admiral Pierre Vandier, linked the origins of Task Force X Baltic directly to the cable-cutting incidents in the region, saying NATO seized the moment to demonstrate rapid response and capability deployment. â€œRemember, in December one year ago, we got the cables that were cut in the Baltic,â€ he said. â€œI seized the opportunity [to] demonstrate that NATO was able to take that into account, and probably more rapidly than [people expected].â€ Vandier said the first vessels deployed quickly, with NATO able to show the presence of an unmanned fleet within a month. â€œThe first two ships that were able to sailâ€¦ was only 30 days after the cables were cut,â€ he said.
He added that the effort expanded sharply in the following weeks, reaching 50 boats before the NATO Summit. â€œDuring the following month, we demonstrate that we were able to operate a fleet of 50 boats before the summit,â€ Vandier said, claiming the United States later increased the size of the force by providing additional platforms. â€œThe USâ€¦ provided 20 boats more,â€ he said.
Vandier described the activity as unprecedented in scale, stating: â€œWe have operated during one month the biggest unmanned fleetâ€¦ on this earth.â€ He said the aim now is to move beyond experimentation and into multinational adoption, arguing that NATO is pushing towards a new era of integrated operations between traditional platforms and unmanned systems. â€œNow we are in a state whereâ€¦ we have the nations to adopt,â€ he said. â€œWe are on the way to make nations cooperate on this and open a new era of cohabitation between legacy platforms and unmanned platforms.â€ According to Vandier, such integration would increase operational dilemmas for adversaries, while also improving cost efficiency. â€œ[It] will create more dilemmas for the enemyâ€¦ and a better use of the money,â€ he said.
The Admiral repeatedly framed the case for unmanned systems as a response to both mass and affordability problems, contrasting the cost of major surface combatants with the need for persistent presence and surveillance. â€œWhen you just look atâ€¦ a frigateâ€¦ [the] price per day at sea is 5 million,â€ he said. â€œItâ€™s something you canâ€™t afford.â€ He linked this to broader lessons from Ukraine, arguing that the challenge of countering mass drone threats has forced militaries to think differently about sustainable capability.
â€œAs we seeâ€¦ where we need toâ€¦ kill these drones with affordable munitions, itâ€™s exactly the same with [unmanned surface vessels],â€ he said, describing them as a way to apply technology to achieve effects that would otherwise require prohibitively expensive force structures.
When asked how NATO intends to prevent further cable sabotage, Vandier acknowledged that physical prevention is difficult but argued that persistent surveillance and attribution are achievable through sensor networks and unmanned monitoring. â€œYou canâ€™t prevent a ship to drag its anchors on the sea bed and cutting the legs,â€ he said. â€œBut todayâ€¦ we have sensors that hear the heat of the anchor on the sea bed.â€ He said such systems can detect the act of dragging and identify responsible vessels. â€œYou hear the drag, and then, with persistence, surveillance fixed, you can identify who is the ship which is trying to do that,â€ he said, comparing it to criminal deterrence through monitoring. â€œItâ€™s exactly as robbersâ€¦ if you have video surveillance in your city, you will get them caught,â€ Vandier said.
Pressed on how large a future unmanned fleet could become, Vandier said size decisions would remain with participating nations, depending on funding and contract structures. â€œThe size of the fleet is nationsâ€™ business,â€ he said. â€œIt depends on the money and the type of contract.â€ However, he suggested that if Baltic states each fielded around 20 platforms, the region could see a fleet approaching 100 unmanned vessels, which he argued would be sufficient for monitoring the Baltic Sea. â€œIf each of the Baltic country hasâ€¦ 20 ships, weâ€™ll see a fleet of less than 100 which is worth enough to monitor the Baltic Sea and for a very limited amount of money,â€ he said.
A key theme of the briefing was the exploration of new procurement and support models, including leasing or hiring platforms rather than traditional ownership. Vandier said NATOâ€™s early work demonstrated that commercial capability could be brought into service rapidly through such approaches, with multiple companies offering solutions. â€œWe demonstrate that we were able to hire something,â€ he said. â€œYou have today a bunch of companiesâ€¦ you have some US, you have some French, you have some Danish, you have a lot of offers.â€
Loutas reinforced that Task Force X is partly intended to explore how defence acquisition must adapt to rapidly evolving systems that blur the line between hardware and software. â€œItâ€™s also an important exercise for us to understand and explore different ways of developing capabilities,â€ he said. â€œIn some cases, might make sense to acquire. In other case might make sense to lease,â€ he added, arguing that the Alliance must understand which business models deliver the best results under modern conditions.
Vandier warned that rapid technological change means long-term procurement assumptions are increasingly risky, particularly as artificial intelligence, miniaturisation and commercial communications technologies drive fast obsolescence cycles. â€œThe speed of obsolescence is very, very high,â€ he said. â€œIf you think that you will buy a ship that will be in your inventory for the next 10 years, you are making a great mistake.â€ He argued that future fleets will need regular refresh cycles for sensors, command-and-control and effectors.
â€œEach yearâ€¦ two years, you will have to refresh your C2, your effectors, [your] sensors,â€ he said. Vandier also indicated that while ISR is a core requirement, some tested systems may have additional roles, including interception. â€œSome of theâ€¦ [systems] we tested are also interceptors,â€ he said. â€œThey can be weaponised.â€
The briefing also suggested NATO is already considering how the Task Force X model could be expanded beyond the Baltic. Asked whether it could be duplicated for Arctic Sentry or Eastern Sentry operations, Vandier said a project is already under way to replicate the approach in the Arctic environment. â€œWeâ€™ve launchedâ€¦ [a] projectâ€¦ replicating this in the weather conditionsâ€¦ of the Arctic,â€ he said, noting that cold temperatures, battery limitations and rough seas present distinct challenges.
He said similar work is also being pursued in support of Eastern Sentry. â€œWe also launched something similar for Eastern Sentry,â€ Vandier said, adding that the first operational exercise in that context had already taken place in Finland last year. Looking ahead, he said NATOâ€™s transformation command plans a large-scale exercise in Romania intended to test emerging counter-drone concepts, with Ukraine involved to assess outcomes.
The Alliance sees unmanned systems as a central tool for achieving mass, persistence and affordability in contested maritime environments. With the second phase of Task Force X Baltic now being formalised, NATO is positioning the programme as a template for wider adoption, with lessons from the Baltic cable incidents driving a push to embed commercial unmanned capability into NATO capability.

MUNICH, Germany — U.S. officials have countered Europe’s push for technology sovereignty from America with a clear message: It’s China you should worry about, not us.
The European Union is rolling out a strategy to reduce its reliance on foreign technology suppliers. Donald Trump’s return to office has put the focus on American cloud giants, companies like Elon Musk’s Starlink and X and others — with European officials increasingly concerned that Washington has too much control over Europe’s digital infrastructure.
As political leaders and security and intelligence officials met in Germany for the Munich Security Conference, Washington sought to calm nerves. The idea that Trump can pull the plug on the internet is not “a credible argument,” the United States’ National Cyber Director Sean Cairncross told an audience Thursday.

Ukraine's Oschadbank retains leadership in net corporate loan portfolio in 2025
State-owned Oschadbank (Kyiv) reported that, according to official statistics from the National Bank of Ukraine (NBU) as of January 1, 2026, it ranked first among Ukrainian banks in terms of net corporate loan portfolio.
"Oschadbank has continued to maintain leadership in business financing for the second consecutive year… At the beginning of 2026, we also ranked first in total loan portfolio volume, having provided businesses with financing exceeding UAH 122 billion," said Oschadbank Management Board Chairman Yuriy Katsion.
According to NBU statistics, Oschadbank's net loan portfolio totaled nearly UAH 101.6 billion, representing 13% of the market, and increased by more than UAH 11.5 billion, or 12.9%, over the year. It is separately noted that the financial institution ranked first in terms of the total corporate loan portfolio volume before accrued interest and deduction of reserves.
According to Oschadbank, 33% of the net loan portfolio is directed toward financing energy projects and ensuring energy supply, nearly 25% toward the agro-industrial complex and food processing, and 8.4% toward supporting the country's defense capability.

‘The Motherland Is Catching Up’: Russians in Kazakhstan Feel Moscow’s Reach in String of Expulsions

An activist who used to volunteer for organization run by the late Alexei Navalny in St. Petersburg.
Two Chechens — one fleeing war, the other punishment for criticizing regional autocrat Ramzan Kadyrov.
An IT worker from Crimea who quietly opposed Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and tried to forge a new life abroad.
The profiles of the Russians caught up in a startling new crackdown on Kremlin critics in Kazakhstan embody all the diversity of Russia’s wartime emigre population — and the grave risks such people face trying to escape persecution back home.
In a swift reversal of longstanding norms, Kazakhstan has begun planning to deport or extradite several Russian citizens since the start of the year. If sent back, their lawyers say they face lengthy prison sentences, forced conscription and, in some cases, torture.
To make matters worse, experts say the Kazakh government is circumventing the law to make it happen.
“In general, everything that is happening now is such lawlessness,” Murat Adam, an Almaty-based lawyer representing two of the Russians under threat of extradition, told The Moscow Times in an interview this week.
The news has unsettled the tens-of-thousands-strong Russian emigre community in Kazakhstan, a Kremlin-friendly nation in Central Asia that was nonetheless seen as a safe haven for refugees fleeing Putin’s regime — until recently.
In some sense, the legal guardrails that once protected them seem to have come off. Experts told The Moscow Times that sending citizens back to a country where they face such clear danger violates numerous international human rights treaties to which Astana is an observer.
At times, it has not been clear if the country is even playing by its own rules. The deportation of the IT specialist, a 25-year-old dual Russian and Ukrainian citizen named Alexander Kachkurkin, appears to have been carried out in coordination with Moscow even though the latter didn’t appear to file an extradition request.
Kazakhstan’s Prosecutor General’s Office and Foreign Ministry did not respond to requests for comment.
One Russian living in Kazakhstan, speaking to The Moscow Times on condition of anonymity, said that the news has “caused alarm” in the Russian diaspora community. He is now planning to leave the country.
“Before, I felt I could live peacefully and build a career here,” the source said. “But alas, unfortunately, that is now becoming dangerous.”
A friend, he said, aptly described the sense of fear: “It’s as if the Motherland is catching up.”
‘For most people, this causes fear and concern for their lives’
For many in a similar position, trying to outrun the Motherland could describe the past four years.
The full-scale invasion of Ukraine sparked an exodus of tens of thousands of Russians fearing persecution or mobilization. Kazakhstan, with its liberal entry regime for Russian citizens, was an attractive destination for many of them. By the end of 2022, as many as 100,000 Russians had moved to the country.
It was and remains an uneasy existence. While Kazakhstan has a process for obtaining political asylum, it is practically never granted. What’s more, the country’s close relations with Russia have, in recent years, propagated fears of stricter enforcement of Moscow’s extradition requests.
Such fears were largely hypothetical until one event in late January.
When IT specialist Kachkurkin was 14, he lived through the annexation of his home region, Crimea, by the Kremlin, an event he never supported, according to a source close to his case.
“Effectively against his will, he was made a citizen of another country,” said Yevgeny Smirnov, a lawyer with the human rights group Pervy Otdel.
Russia’s full-scale invasion in 2022 was the final straw that prompted him to move to Kazakhstan. It was only supposed to be a temporary solution: Kachkurkin dreamed of moving to Europe or Ukraine.
In late January, he was handed administrative violations for allegedly jaywalking and smoking hookah indoors.
In response, Astana ruled to deport Kackhurking back to Russia. Immediately upon landing, he was arrested and charged with treason for allegedly transferring money to Ukraine.
Local media have reported that there was no extradition request. The Moscow Times asked Kazakhstan’s Prosecutor’s Office and Foreign Ministry if the country received such a request for Kachkurkin, but did not receive a response. Smirnov said that he has no knowledge of one in this case.
Now, he is in pre-trial detention in Moscow’s notorious Lefortovo Prison, facing a near-certain guilty verdict and a sentence of 12-15 years.
Smirnov said he believes that Astana coordinated with Russia’s security services to circumvent traditional extradition processes, which would have opened the door to appeal the move.
“I’ve probably been involved in several hundred treason cases, so I’m no longer surprised by how they unfold in Russia,” Smirnov said. “But I was very surprised by Kazakhstan’s approach, the fact that they, at the unofficial request of the FSB, are participating in the kidnapping of a person on their own territory.”
The news about Kachkurkin set off a shockwave through the Russian emigre community. If this low-profile, non-activist emigre is vulnerable to Russian law enforcement’s hunt for dissidents, many thought, who isn’t?
“For most people, this causes fear and concern for their lives,” said one Russian living in Kazakhstan, who requested anonymity due to the sensitivity of the topic. “Several of my friends said that we need to prepare more actively for moving out of Kazakhstan because [now] they can send you to Russia for less.”
Those fears seemed to be confirmed this week when Kazakh prosecutors announced that they had approved an extradition request for a different regime critic, 34-year-old activist Yulia Yemelyanova, who has been detained since a layover at Almaty International Airport in August 2025. Her charge? Allegedly stealing a phone worth 12,000 rubles ($155) in St. Petersburg.
Adam, her lawyer, filed a complaint with the country’s Supreme Court on Feb. 11, arguing that Yemelyanova cannot be extradited while her application for asylum is under consideration.
The document, shared with The Moscow Times, lays out a dire situation.
“If extradited to the Russian Federation,” it reads, “Yemelyanova will face a high risk of torture, inhuman treatment and violation of her fundamental right to a fair trial.”
Since leaving Russia, Yemelyanova has worked with organizations supporting Ukrainian refugees and Russian political prisoners — positions that make her even more of a target, the document states.
Meanwhile, two other men could also be extradited in the coming months: 35-year-old Zelimkhan Murtazov and 30-year-old Mansur Movlayev. Both are from the republic of Chechnya, a tightly controlled region in the North Caucasus whose largely autonomous security forces, the Kadyrovtsy, have a reputation for brutality.
A military deserter, Murtazov has been barred by authorities from leaving Astana’s Nursultan Nazarbayev International Airport for over a month.
Kazakhstan agreed to extradite Movlayev in late January after denying him refugee status the month prior. Having suffered torture in Chechnya, Movlayev fled the region in 2022 and has been seeking asylum ever since.
“He fears for his life, fears that he may be killed,” reads a complaint to Kazakhstan’s Supreme Court obtained by The Moscow Times.
‘To a certain extent, it’s to please Putin’
The unsettling string of expulsions represents something new for Kazakhstan. A few extraditions — mostly of military deserters — have taken place since Russia invaded Ukraine, but never on this scale.
“Since 2022 until practically last month, Kazakhstan was very, very cautious about these cases,” said Yevgeny Zhovtis, director of the Kazakhstan International Bureau for Human Rights and the Rule of Law.
“On the one hand, even if people were looking for asylum, Kazakhstan was not granting asylum to anybody,” he said. “But at the same time, they were not preventing them from leaving to a third country.”
Zhovtis said that recent cases set a worrying precedent. They also potentially violate international human treaties such as the 1951 Refugee Convention and the Convention Against Torture, which prohibits extradition to a country where someone could be subject to torture.
He believes the policy turnaround could be an attempt to keep Moscow happy as the country readies for a constitutional referendum in March, and potential parliamentary and presidential elections after that.
“I think that Kazakhstan doesn’t want to be exposed to some kind of Russian involvement or too much Russian pressure,” he said. “To a certain extent, it’s to please Putin.”
How does a person stay safe under such conditions?
According to one Russian in Kazakhstan, who requested anonymity, the answer is simply to keep one’s head down.
Before the war began, he had engaged in small-scale activism — sometimes attending protests, other times working as an election observer.
These days, he keeps an even lower profile. While the activist gene is strong — as is the occasional urge to publicly comment on Kazakhstan’s domestic political developments — he resists speaking out. The life he’s eked out is too precarious to risk it.
“As long as I’m silent,” he said, “I think I’m safe here.”
A Message from The Moscow Times:
Dear readers,
We are facing unprecedented challenges. Russia's Prosecutor General's Office has designated The Moscow Times as an "undesirable" organization, criminalizing our work and putting our staff at risk of prosecution. This follows our earlier unjust labeling as a "foreign agent."
These actions are direct attempts to silence independent journalism in Russia. The authorities claim our work "discredits the decisions of the Russian leadership." We see things differently: we strive to provide accurate, unbiased reporting on Russia.
We, the journalists of The Moscow Times, refuse to be silenced. But to continue our work, we need your help.
Your support, no matter how small, makes a world of difference. If you can, please support us monthly starting from just $2. It's quick to set up, and every contribution makes a significant impact.

The war dead pictured on banned Ukrainian athlete's helmet
Ukrainian skeleton slider Vladyslav Heraskevych's disqualification from the Winter Olympics over his helmet depicting fellow athletes killed since Russia's full-scale invasion is the Games' biggest controversy so far.
Heraskevych was barred from the men's skeleton in Milan-Cortina earlier this week after he refused to stop wearing it and on Friday his appeal was denied.
He has said those featured on his helmet include teenage weightlifter Alina Perehudova, boxer Pavlo Ishchenko and ice hockey player Oleksiy Lohinov, adding that some of them were his friends.
More than 20 athletes appear on the helmet in total - here's more on each of them.
Volodymyr Androschuk - track and field
Androschuk died a few days after his 22nd birthday in January 2023 while fighting in the Bakhmut area of eastern Ukraine.
He represented his country at the international level, competing in decathlon and pentathlon events.
At one time he had hoped to qualify for the 2024 Olympics in Paris or the 2028 Games in Los Angeles, the New York Times reported, but by 2022 injuries meant he decided to volunteer for the army instead.
"It was his dream," Oleksiy Kasyanov, the general secretary of Ukraine's track and field federation and formerly its national decathlon coach, told the paper in reference to Androschuk's sporting ambitions.
Karyna Bakhur - kickboxer
Bakhur was killed last year during Russian shelling in the Kharkiv region, north-eastern Ukraine.
The 17-year-old was a kickboxing champion who represented Ukraine at national and international level.
She died a few weeks before her 18th birthday after suffering shrapnel wounds while running for shelter in the city of Berestyn.
Speaking to Ukrainian newspaper Pravda after her death, Bakhur's coach, Volodymyr Zibarov, said the athlete "had enormous potential".
"We were supposed to leave tonight for the World Cup in Austria... Russian missile simply took Karyna from us one day earlier," he said.

Maksym Halinichev - boxer
Halinichev died in 2023 in the Luhansk region of eastern Ukraine.
According to Ukrainian sports news outlet Tribuna, he refused to participate in a 2022 European boxing championship in order to volunteer as a soldier.
Speaking to Voice of America, one of his coaches said once Halinichiev had seen the destruction caused by the war, he felt he had to fight.
"I have a little child. I don't want her to live in occupation among the aggressor, among the Russians," another of his coaches quoted him as saying.
Tribuna said Halinichev was injured twice during the war but continued to fight until his death.
He won silver at the 2018 Youth Olympic Games and the 2021 European U22 Championships.
Pavlo Ishchenko - powerlifter

Slovak fugitive arrested after arriving at Olympics to watch national hockey team
A Slovak fugitive who had been on the run for 16 years was finally arrested when he turned up in Milan to support his national ice hockey team at the Milano Cortina Winter Olympics, police said Friday.
The 44-year-old man, who was not named, was wanted by Italian authorities for a series of thefts committed in 2010.
The carabinieri managed to track down and arrest the man on Wednesday after he checked into a campsite on the outskirts of Milan, thanks to an automatic alert from the campsite reception.
The man was taken to Milan's San Vittore prison to serve a pending sentence of 11 months and 7 days, according to the carabinieri, Italy's military police.
He was arrested before he could see Slovakia's hockey team take the ice in the opening game at Milan's Santagiulia Arena. Slovakia beat Finland 4-1.
Slovakia also beat Italy in a preliminary match on Friday.

Trump says second aircraft carrier ‘leaving very shortly’ for Middle East
US President Donald Trump on Friday upped the stakes in Washington’s already tense relationship with Iran, saying that a second American aircraft will be “leaving very shortly” for the Middle East. Trump is hoping to strike a deal with Iran to curb its nuclear programme, but has warned of severe consequences if one does not come through.
US President Donald Trump said Friday a second aircraft carrier group would be heading to the Middle East soon, upping the military threat against Iran amid negotiations over its nuclear programme.
“It’ll be leaving very shortly,” Trump told journalists when asked about reports the USS Gerald R. Ford would be moved from the Caribbean to the Middle East. “In case we don’t make a deal, we’ll need it.”

Costco makes a major change to its cake ordering process after customer complaints
Costco members have long complained about having to make custom cake orders in person, made worse by crowded parking and no online confirmation
- Bookmark
- CommentsGo to comments
Ordering cakes from Costco will soon be, well, a piece of one.
The warehouse club is finally going digital, allowing members to place cake and deli tray orders through the Costco app, meaning no more paper forms or in-person trips to the store.
The update is expected to be available to all members by the end of this year, the warehouse retail club announced Thursday, after first revealing plans for it during the Q1 2026 earnings call in December 2025.
For years, members had to physically head to the bakery, scribble their orders on a printed form and make a second trip to pick up their creation. Many found the process half-baked, especially with crowded parking lots and no online confirmation to ease the wait.
“Many of the things that we’ve heard from our members that could be a little bit clunky are now moving to a digital state, and we’re seeing great adoption right out of the chute,” Costco CEO Ron Vachris told investors in the December call, adding that the company aims on “locking in” its brick-and-mortar business with its virtual digital business.
Some members reported seeing the new app feature rolling out in certain areas as early as August 2025. A Reddit user shared a screenshot of the improvement available in Salt Lake City, prompting celebrations among other users.
“This is awesome news, will save me from an extra $200 shopping trip when I go to drop off the order form for my kid’s birthday cake lol,” one person wrote.
Early adopters reported that the Custom Cake Ordering button was not immediately obvious. Some had trouble locating it, while others found it under the Warehouse tab at the bottom of the app, appearing as a rectangular white button.
Costco says in-app ordering will be available exclusively to members, and a Custom Cake Ordering portal still does not appear on the retailer’s website. The company is also enhancing its mobile app with AI-powered features designed to create a personalized, persuasive experience that drives membership sign-ups and renewals. Upcoming tools include digital membership cards, in-store inventory checks and gas price trackers.
The Independent has contacted Costco for comment.
With more than 800 warehouses worldwide, including over 600 in the U.S., Costco has long trailed rivals like Sam’s Club in online bakery offerings. Additional digital upgrades, such as faster self-checkouts, are also on the way.

He's denied that, and this weekend at the Munich Security Conference is seen as another key moment to get a steer of the US position, and how the Trump administration is attempting manoeuvre in mediating an end to the conflict by the summer.

UK court rules that the government ban on Palestine Action is unlawful

In a blow to Prime Minister Keir Starmer’s government, London’s High Court has ruled that the ban on Palestine Action is unlawful.
The court stated that the ban will remain in place, pending the results of the government’s appeal. However, the Metropolitan Police announced that it will no longer arrest people for supporting the group.
“This approach relates solely to the expression of support for Palestine Action,” noted law enforcement in a press release.”We will continue to intervene and make arrests where we see people crossing the line from lawful protest to intimidate, to damage property, to use violence, to stir up racial hatred or to commit other offences.”
In their decision, the three-judge panel said that then-home secretary Yvette Cooper did not account for how the proscription would impact protected protest.
“The nature and scale of Palestine Action’s activities falling within the definition of terrorism had not yet reached the level, scale and persistence to warrant proscription,” read the judgement.
Guardian Legal Affairs correspondent Haroon Siddique referred to the ruling as a “humiliating defeat” for the government, which has “transformed Palestine Action from a little-known protest group to one that is on the front page of newspapers.”
An organizer with the group told reporter Matt Shea that the 2700 arrests and 500 charges that members faced are now void and that they are entitled to financial compensation from the government.
The victory was celebrated by Palestine activists and human rights groups.
“This is a monumental victory both for our fundamental freedoms here in Britain and in the struggle for freedom for the Palestinian people, striking down a decision that will forever be remembered as one of the most extreme attacks on free speech in recent British history,” said Palestine Action’s cofounder Huda Ammori in a statement.
“Today’s ruling is a vital affirmation of the right to protest at a time when it has been under sustained and deliberate attack,” said Amnesty International UK’s Law and Human Rights Director Tom Southerden. “The High Court’s decision sends a clear message: the government cannot simply reach for sweeping counter‑terrorism powers to silence critics or suppress dissent. We welcome this judgment as an essential check on overreach and a powerful reminder that fundamental freedoms still carry weight in UK law.”
“This is a vindication for those who had the courage and humanity to oppose genocide,” former Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn told Novara Media. “This government thinks it can shield itself from accountability for the role it has played in one of the greatest crimes of our time. Today’s historic judgment proves it will not succeed.”
The ruling was condemned by government officials, like Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood, who said he was “disappointed” by the decision
“I intend to fight this judgment in the Court of Appeal,” he added.
Palestine Action was proscribed in July, after breaking into the Royal Air Force’s Brize Norton air base and damaging two planes to protest Israel’s genocide in Gaza.
“Britain isn’t just complicit, it’s an active participant in the Gaza genocide and war crimes across the Middle East,” declared the group. “By decommissioning two military planes, Palestine Action have directly intervened in the genocide and prevented crimes against the Palestinian people.”
Starmer referred to the direct action as a “disgraceful” act of vandalism.
Writing in Mondoweiss following their proscription, Dr. Asim Qureshi, the Research Director at CAGE International, detailed how the targeting of Palestine Action was a clear attempt to quash pro-Palestine speech.
“Britain’s proscription regime has entrenched a cultural McCarthyism, where political speech on Palestine is policed not just by the state but by the institutions that claim to protect democratic discourse,” wrote Qureshi.
Earlier this month, six Palestine Action activists were acquitted on aggravated burglary charges over their July 2024 raid on an Elbit weapons factory in Filton, England.

Greek farmers have driven dozens of tractors to parliament in central Athens for an overnight rally to protest what they say is government inaction that threatens their livelihoods
- Bookmark
Thousands of angry farmers from across Greece converged on central Athens on Friday, driving dozens of tractors to parliament, horns blaring, for an overnight rally to protest what they say is the government’s failure to address problems threatening their ability to produce crops.
Police blocked off central streets in the Greek capital and accompanied the tractor motorcade through the center of the city as it made its way to central Syntagma Square in front of the parliament building, the traditional focal point of protests in Greece.
Farmers have been protesting for months over high production costs, low prices for their products and delays in the payment of European Union-backed subsidies.
The payment delays came as authorities reviewed all requests following revelations of widespread fraud claims for EU farm subsidies. Protesters have argued that the delays amounted to collective punishment, leaving honest farmers in debt and unable to plant their fields for next season.
Livestock breeders, who have seen their flocks decimated by mass culls due to an outbreak of sheep and goat pox, have joined the protests, which began in November.
After weeks of tractor blockades along major highways and border crossings that caused traffic and transportation chaos, Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis met with farmer representatives last month. The government made a series of concessions, including fuel tax rebates and cheaper electricity rates.
But while the farmers dismantled their roadblocks, they say the government failed to address many of their problems.
“Our struggle continues, because our basic demands weren’t satisfied,” Rizos Maroudas, head of a farmers’ union of the central Greek region of Larissa, told Greek state television ERT Friday, adding that cheap imports were undermining Greek products.
The government, he said, had the financial ability to resolve the farming community’s problems “but it doesn’t have the political will to do it.”
Early last month, farmers escalated their protests with a 48-hour blockade of major highways, toll stations and junctions over high production costs and the European Union’s trade deal with South American nations. The EU-Mercosur agreement seeks to progressively remove duties on almost all goods traded between the two blocs.
Friday’s protesters have vowed to spend the night at the rally, staying outside parliament until Saturday.

VIENNA, February 13. /TASS/. The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and Iran may reach an agreement on inspections of the country’s nuclear facilities in the coming days, IAEA Director General Rafael Grossi said.
"We have returned to Iran (after last year’s strikes on the country’s nuclear facilities - TASS). <...> We were able to work again, to establish some form of dialogue - imperfect, complicated and extremely difficult - but it is there. So I think the big question of the moment is how to define these steps for the future. We know perfectly well what needs to be checked and how to check it. I would say we are at a very, very crucial moment. Perhaps, over the next few days, as opposed to weeks or months, we might be seeing light at the end of the tunnel," he pointed out at the Munich Security Conference, when asked about the possibility of a new agreement on nuclear inspections.
Overnight into June 13, Israel launched a military operation against Iran. Less than 24 hours later, Tehran retaliated. Nine days later, in the early hours of June 22, US jets targeted three Iranian nuclear sites, effectively entering the conflict. The following evening, Tehran carried out a missile strike on Al Udeid, the largest US military base in the region, located in Qatar. US President Donald Trump later announced that Israel and Iran had agreed to a complete ceasefire. The truce took effect on June 24.
Iran severed contact with the IAEA due to a lack of condemnation from the agency against Israel and the US. On September 9, Iran and the IAEA signed an agreement to resume cooperation. On September 20, however, Iran suspended cooperation with the IAEA over a resolution demanding the country provide the agency’s inspectors with full access to its nuclear sites.

The End of Climate Regulation As We Know It

The Trump Administration’s repeal of the Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA) endangerment finding dominated headlines this week. Given that the endangerment finding underpins all of the EPA’s noteworthy climate rules, this move is a big deal with significant consequences for efforts to tackle emissions as well as regulate companies.
In its announcement, the administration framed this as a big win for American industry. In reality, the effort might better be described as an ideological project that will result in marketplace confusion. Lawsuits will abound. States will try to step into the void, generating more lawsuits and more confusion. Meanwhile, companies will need to decide to what degree they respond.
Companies that operate in a global market will continue to face regulatory pressure in many other jurisdictions in Europe, Asia, and Latin America. And they also know that a future administration may restore the endangerment finding and all the regulations that come with it.

In the wake of the announcement, environmental groups put out a flurry of statements condemning the move. Members of Congress joined activists in protest outside of the EPA. “We’re going to stand with you,” said Massachusetts Democratic Senator Ed Markey at the rally. “We’re going to lead this fight in the Senate against this special interest.”
With its current makeup, the Republican-majority Congress is unlikely to push back on the move. Courts, on the other hand, can throw sand in the gears of Trump’s deregulatory move, leaving everyone guessing about how this issue might finally shake out.
In watching the response to the widely anticipated news, I couldn’t help but think about the now famous Mark Carney speech in Davos last month. "The old order is not coming back,” he said. “We shouldn't mourn it. Nostalgia is not a strategy, but we believe that from the fracture, we can build something bigger, better, stronger, more just."
The endangerment finding was never the first-best solution to tackle climate change. Instead, it came about through a series of contortions. In the early 2000s, the Bush Administration refused to make climate policy. In response, the state of Massachusetts sued the government saying the EPA wasn’t doing its job under the Clean Air Act, a law that dates back to the 1970s when climate change was more scientific curiosity than political issue. The Supreme Court ruled that the EPA should study whether climate change harmed public health. If so, it had a legal obligation to regulate the greenhouse gases that cause it.
Unsurprisingly, in 2009, the EPA released the endangerment finding showing that, in fact, greenhouse gases did threaten public health. From that finding came a slew of regulations from tailpipe emissions standards for cars to power plant emissions rules. But every rule was promulgated under the threat of litigation and the teeth of the regulation relied on a law that was designed with a completely different purpose in mind. Importantly, climate regulation under the Clean Air Act was designed to make the existing system cleaner with sticks but offered little to create a new and better system with carrots.
And, while these rules have played an important role keeping emissions in check and protecting public health, they are not singularly responsible for the progress the U.S. has made in slowing its emissions. Economic shifts and declining cost curves have stimulated clean energy in a way that rules could not have done alone.
No one knows what will happen when Trump leaves off and, presumably, climate denial falls out of favor again. Restoring the endangerment finding would be one step for new leadership to take, but simply bringing back the old regime of climate regulation would be insufficient to the size of the challenge now at hand.
I have put this very question to many of the people I speak with: What does the next era of climate action look like in the U.S.? I have heard only limited thinking in response about what the next big policy agenda on climate may be. Trump’s assault on the system has been so fast and so aggressive that it has left climate advocates in a defensive position. But it would be unwise to assume that Trump has created a resilient status quo.
If anything, the lack of a clear set of climate plans that might be considered in a post-Trump era just means there’s an even wider range of possibilities for businesses to prepare for. In the past, industrial policy, carbon pricing, tightened rules and regulations were all in play. In the future, we could see anything from new taxation regimes fueled by populist backlash to targeted electricity tariffs. It’s also possible that Trump’s climate agenda endures given the understandable focus on other geopolitical issues and domestic challenges.
In short, in completely rupturing climate efforts, Trump has created a blank slate. No one knows exactly what’s next, but it probably shouldn’t be the exact same thing as before.

Minnesotans welcome the immigration surge drawdown but remain vigilant
The Trump administration is scaling back its immigration enforcement surge in and around the Twin Cities of Minneapolis and St. Paul, but state officials and residents say its effects on Minnesota’s economy and immigrant communities will linger
- Bookmark
The Trump administration's drawdown of its immigration enforcement surge in the Twin Cities area has been met with relief, but state officials and residents say its effects on Minnesota’s economy and immigrant communities will linger.
Thousands of officers were sent to the Minneapolis and St. Paul area for Operation Metro Surge, which the Department of Homeland Security called its “ largest immigration enforcement operation ever " and touted as a success. But President Donald Trump's enforcement campaign came under increasing criticism and pushback as the situation grew increasingly volatile.
The shooting deaths of U.S. citizens Renee Good and Alex Pretti by federal officers drew condemnation and raised questions over officers' conduct, prompting changes to the operation.
And despite the announced end to the surge, Democratic Gov. Tim Walz urged Minnesotans to remain vigilant.
Drawdown after improved coordination
Border czar Tom Homan told reporters Thursday that “extensive engagement” with state and local officials allowed for a formal end to the operation.
Trump dispatched Homan to de-escalate tensions after the Jan. 24 killing of Pretti. Homan said a drawdown would be predicated on the level of cooperation the federal agencies received from state and local officials.
That cooperation came to pass, particularly with state and local law enforcement and jails' handling of deportable inmates, Homan said.
But he also said he made various internal changes since arriving, including changing certain personnel, deploying body cameras and communicating that misconduct by immigration officers would not be tolerated.
“There were some issues here. We fixed those issues,” Homan said. “We’ve had great success with this operation and we’re leaving Minnesota safer.”
Immigration enforcement will continue, but with a smaller footprint
Homan announced last week that 700 federal officers would leave Minnesota immediately, but that still left more than 2,000 in the state. He said Thursday that a “significant drawdown” was already underway and would continue through next week.
Homan said he would be on the ground for a “little longer” to oversee the drawdown, and that a small team would facilitate the transition and ensure the continuing cooperation of state and local authorities.
He did not specify how many officers would remain, but he said targeted enforcement would continue in the Twin Cities.
“President Trump made a promise of mass deportation, and that’s what this country is going to get,” Homan said.
Todd Lyons, Immigration and Customs Enforcement's acting director, said during a congressional hearing Thursday that the agency is still searching for about 16,840 people in Minnesota who have final orders of removal.
The operation leaves its mark on the Twin Cities
Following Homan’s announcement Thursday, some residents held a vigil at a makeshift shrine that went up where Good was shot in Minneapolis.
“I don’t even want one ICE person here, if they act the way they’ve been acting,” said local attendee John Schnickel. “Does it fade away if they leave here? Are they going somewhere else, or has the country and the White House learned a lesson?”
He also disagreed with remarks by Trump officials that the enforcement surge made Minnesota safer. “They talk about how the murder rate is down, and yet they’ve added two people to it,” he said.
Mark Foresman, an attendee from the suburb of St. Louis Park, said he is skeptical that the agents will leave.
“The Trump administration has created an atmosphere of distrust for government in general, so that’s caused citizens like myself to not believe what they say, because they’ve repeatedly been caught in lies,” he said, suggesting the Trump administration's tactics seemed designed to stir up publicity and sow fear.
Juan Uvera, who was visiting from New York City, said one thing that jumped out to him was the number of businesses that were closed or had signs barring ICE.
“From afar, on TV, it’s just like people are getting shot and killed. But you actually see the effect it has on the people over here," he said.
Anna Van Sice, an attendee who was wearing one of the commonplace whistles that have been used in immigration crackdown cities to warn that federal officers are nearby, said the Twin Cities area can’t let its guard down and that will keep responding to ICE's presence.
“We don’t have a lot, or any trust in the government right now,” she said. “I guess I’ll believe it when I see it.”

US orders another aircraft carrier to the Middle East

US orders another aircraft carrier to the Middle East
February 13, 2026The US is preparing to send the USS Gerald R. Ford's aircraft carrier strike group to the Middle East, joining the USS Abraham Lincoln and its guided-missile destroyers in the Arabian Sea, President Donald Trump confirmed on Friday.
"It'll be leaving very soon," Trump told reporters without giving an exact timeline.
The deployment of a second aircraft carrier strike group to the region comes after Trump warned of "very bad" consequences if Iran did not make a deal with Washington over its nuclear program.
The Ford's strike group is being redirected from the Caribbean, where it was deployed in October 2025 as the US built up a massive military presence in the region ahead of a raid that captured Venezuelan dictator Nicolas Maduro.
The Ford left port in June 2025, and its deployment has already been extended once. Its sailors had expected to return home in March, according to the New York Times, which first reported the re-deployment earlier Friday.
Trump hopes for 'deal' with Iran on nukes
The second carrier group deployment in the Arabian Sea comes after US and Iranian representatives met last week in Oman for inconclusive talks on Tehran's nuclear program.
Trump has not ruled out military action if Tehran does not agree to curb its nuclear program.
Asked why a second aircraft carrier was headed to the Middle East, Trump said on Friday, "In case we don't make a deal, we'll need it... if we need it, we'll have it ready."
Trump during his first term in 2018 pulled the US out of a deal that had envisioned a cap on Iran's uranium enrichment in exchange for sanctions relief.
Tehran claims its nuclear ambitions are peaceful, however, the IAEA estimated last year that Iran has enriched uranium far beyond the level needed for civilian use.
Iran suspended cooperation with the IAEA after the US bombed Iranian nuclear sites last June during a Israel's 12-day war against the Islamic republic. At the time, Trump said the strikes had "completely and totally obliterated" Iran's key nuclear enrichment facilities, although this was never independently confirmed.
Despite claiming that Iran's uranium enrichment capability was destroyed, Trump has said he wants a new nuclear deal with Iran.
A White House fact sheet dated February 8 coming after tariffs on countries that "acquire any goods or services from Iran" said that Trump "recently deployed a massive armada to the region, urging Iran to come to the table and negotiate a fair, equitable deal with no nuclear weapons, or face even stronger consequences."
Trump warns Iran
Gulf Arab nations have warned any US attack on Iran could spiral into another regional conflict.
On Friday, Trump told reporters it would be a "bad day for Iran" if Tehran fails to make a deal.
When asked on Thursday about a timeline for a possible deal with Iran, Trump said "I guess over the next month."
"It should happen quickly. They should agree very quickly … otherwise it's going to be very traumatic. I don't want that to happen, but we have to make a deal," Trump told reporters.
Trump last threatened the use of force against Iran during the regime's deadly crackdown on anti-government protests in January, but pulled back after claiming the regime had agreed to not execute arrested protesters.
Despite these claims, human rights groups estimate thousands of demonstrators were killed by security forces during the protests. In the coming days, Iranians are beginning to hold 40-day mourning ceremonies for those killed.

UK mother separated from children for years has ‘draconian’ order overturned
Unknown

03:01:37 KST

A mother who did not see her children for nearly six years after they were taken away by the family courts has been reunited with her son after the flawed evidence used in her case was overturned.
An assessment by an unregulated psychologist led to “extraordinary” and “draconian” orders that effectively terminated her relationship with her children, lawyers told the high court.
A district judge followed the recommendations of the psychologist Melanie Gill, which included that Erin* had turned her daughter and son against their father and should be banned from seeing them.
Gill also advised that there was no need to investigate cross-allegations of domestic abuse by the parents. This meant that claims of serious physical and sexual assault made by the mother against the father were not examined.
In December 2019 the court ordered the children’s removal from their mother and granted the father sole custody. They were nine and 12 at the time. Erin did not see or speak to them again until last year.
But last month England’s most senior family judge “set aside” the court’s original findings based on the conclusions of Gill, who claims to have acted as an expert witness in up to 200 cases.
It is the second time in six months that findings in a case in which she has given evidence have been dismissed by the high court.
At the 29 January hearing, it was heard how the ruling had left Erin feeling as if she had “a noose around her neck for six years”. In an interview with the Bureau of Investigative Journalism she said: “It wasn’t just me. The children were cut off from all their family and friends. They had 50% of their identity stripped away overnight.”
It was argued that the children had been silenced by the process set in motion by Gill’s evidence, even when they raised allegations of abuse.
Lawyers told the high court that errors and missed opportunities by every professional involved in the case had failed to protect the siblings.
A previous attempt by the mother to appeal was blocked and she launched a fresh application seven months ago.
The case took a dramatic turn in November when her teenage son Dylan* ran away from his father’s home and hired his own solicitor. After a period in foster care he was later reunited with his mother for their first Christmas together in six years.
Unusually, the teenager – represented by his own legal team – was in court for his mother’s legal bid overseen by the president of the family division, Sir Andrew McFarlane.
The 15-year-old sat at the front of the courtroom as Jo Delahunty KC told McFarlane how her young client had lost all trust in professionals and become lonely, fearful and isolated in his father’s care.
McFarlane made a new order for the boy to live with his mother. He is yet to hand down his judgment, which is expected to map out a route for similarly affected families who wish to return their case to court.
McFarlane said: “Melanie Gill considers this some kind of vendetta against her. This is far bigger than one person. It’s about the court properly engaging with allegations and cross-allegations.”
After the hearing, Dylan said that he felt heard at last, adding: “I’m so grateful to be home with my mum finally and to feel happy again”.
The children’s father, who has consistently denied the allegations against him, chose not to attend the January hearing. The daughter, who is now 18, was not party to the case.
Erin’s legal team cited “compelling” new information in bringing the successful challenge. This included guidance from December 2024, which said the courts should not use experts to look for “parental alienation” – the idea that a child has rejected one parent because they have been manipulated by the other.
The guidance also stated that psychologists assessing families on behalf of the courts should be regulated. However, judges are permitted to appoint whom they wish, including experts who are not regulated.
Gill asserts that she is well qualified to perform the role of expert witness in family proceedings and that she has years of specialist training and expertise.
The government is working with the committee that makes rules for the family courts to introduce a ban on unregulated experts, after a public consultation last year, which received 60 submissions.
*Names have been changed to protect the identities of those involved

'I felt like an animal': Palestinian activist says ICE chained her in hospital after seizure
A Palestinian woman held in US immigration detention for nearly a year says she was shackled to a hospital bed for three days after suffering her first seizure, describing the experience as "dehumanising" and "terrifying".
Leqaa Kordia, 33, is currently detained at the Prairieland Detention Facility in North Texas.
In a statement on Thursday through her legal representatives, she said she experienced a seizure on 6 February after fainting twice inside the facility's medical unit.
"I woke up terrified and confused," Kordia said. "Not until enduring nearly a year of cruel confinement in inhumane conditions had I ever suffered one before."
According to her statement, witnesses told her that during the seizure she fell twice after leaving the bathroom, striking her head before beginning to convulse. She was transported by ambulance to a hospital.
Kordia said she remained in shackles throughout her hospitalisation.
"For three days in the emergency room, my hands and legs were weighed down by heavy chains as they drew my blood and gave me medications," she said. "It was terrifying. I felt like an animal. My hands are still full of marks from the heavy metal."
She added that the restraints were not removed when she used the bathroom or showered, and that officers refused to explain why she was chained. When she asked a supervising officer, she said she was told: "Because I said so."
Kordia also said she was prevented from speaking with family members and that hospital staff denied entry to one of her attorneys.
"I worried that if something happened to me, no one would know," she said.
Her doctors, she stated, told her she was more prone to seizures due to poor sleep, inadequate nutrition and stress. Kordia has previously said she lost significant weight in detention and struggled to access food that complies with her religious dietary requirements.
"At Prairieland, your daily life - whether you can have access to the food or medicine you need or even a good night’s sleep - is controlled by the private, for-profit business that runs this facility," she said. "I've been here for 11 months, and the food is so bad it makes me sick."
Kordia is a Palestinian Muslim who grew up in the West Bank and later lived in New Jersey.
She was among dozens of people arrested outside Columbia University in 2024 during pro-Palestinian demonstrations. The charges against her were dismissed.
She was later taken into custody during a routine check-in with US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) in March 2025.
Federal officials have accused her of overstaying her visa and have scrutinised financial transfers she made to relatives in the Middle East. Kordia has said the funds were intended to support family members whose homes were destroyed in Gaza.
An immigration judge has twice ordered her released on bond, but the government appealed both rulings, prolonging her detention. She is the last Columbia protester still held in immigration confinement.
In her statement, Kordia said she believes she was targeted because of her activism.
"The only reason ICE targeted me in the first place is because I protested against the Israeli government's genocide in Gaza," she said, adding that nearly 200 of her family members have been killed.
"ICE detention facilities are built to break people and destroy their health and hope," she continued. "The best medicine for me and everyone else here is our freedom."

Affordable housing so good that architects want to live there too

Affordable housing so good that architects want to live there too
Dan Szwaj is greeted with tears of joy. He is not a technician finally arriving to reconnect the internet, or a plumber coming to unblock the loo.
He is the architect of the Boronia apartments in the Danks Street precinct in Waterloo, who took the “stigma out” of affordable housing for a new tenant, 57-year-old Carrie-Anne Huddleston.
After losing a well-paid corporate job a few years ago, Huddleston’s life unravelled. She was priced out of her home when she was hit with a $600 a month hike in rent. Like many older single women without a partner with an income, she stayed with friends and couch-surfed, initially reluctant to try affordable housing because she had grown up in public housing in Woolloomooloo.
“I just keep crying, happy tears. I feel a huge sense of relief. You just want to have a nice place and stuff. Some people are living in cars,” Huddleston told Szwaj.
Szwaj was moved too. “It made my day.”
Huddleston said her new one-bedroom unit, in the $66 million, five-storey block with 76 units by the non-profit private enterprise City West Housing, felt glam.
Not sad at all, she told Szwaj, director of architectural firm Turner, as she leant in for a hug.
Turner’s practice has a reputation for high-quality, affordable and public housing that is “tenure-blind”. A project by the practice in Liverpool won the 2023 Premier’s Prize for architecture.
“It should be a building that anyone would choose to live in, regardless of income or circumstance,” Szwaj said.
What are often dreary utilitarian spaces, like fire stairs that can feel unsafe, with the whiff of urine, are full of light.
Apartments look away from busy Bourke Street and over a new park.
The fire stairs have been turned into a spiral staircase, with what resembles a romantic Juliet balcony at its top and descending into an increasingly green courtyard on the first floor.
And its use of much-maligned deck access – external corridors or walkways, likely to be familiar to anyone who has watched British shows such as Line of Duty or Slow Horses – connects neighbours.
Szwaj said: “The UK’s [external walkways] function as cheap access. These are on a scale where neighbours can see each other, you can make eye contact.”
UK architectural historian Owen Hatherley said the appeal of deck access – which he has in his own block – is straightforward, reported Architecture Today in the UK.
“Rather than getting to your flat through a dark, enclosed internal corridor, you reach it through a walkway partly in the open air. Like anything, it can be well-designed or badly designed, depending on such factors as width, length and spaciousness.”
Most architects would never deign to live in public or subsidised housing, Hatherley wrote.
Not so Boronia.
Award-winning architect and Churchill fellow Carol Marra’s first response was, “I could live here, this is no different from market housing”.
In some ways, it was even better, she said. The build-to-rent model by City West was built to last with robust finishes, so it’s easy to maintain.
Drains were hidden below entries and balconies to prevent water from entering the units. The floors were flush inside and out, which improved access for those with a disability, and made them easy to repair.
The project was designed when the maximum height limit was lower than it is now, but Szwaj said they had to anticipate future development. “We did this by maximising the prime frontage facing the future park, having apartments facing each of the future street aspects, making use of multiple entries, and creating a central, north-facing courtyard as a communal focus.”
Developer Coronation Property plans to build five blocks directly to the north of Boronia with about 850 homes, including an estimated 70 affordable units and 400 build-to-rent. The tallest could be 29 storeys.
As part of the Herald’s reviews of apartment life, Marra and two other experts on multi-residential housing – Peter McGregor, the director of McGregor Westlake Architecture, and his award-winning associate director Damien Madell – agreed to visit.
Marra, a co-founder of architectural practice Marra+Yeh, saw families hanging out on the corridors, looking down into the courtyard. Residents were using the external stairs rather than the lift and enjoying the internal courtyard.
“There is a generosity to those very functional but highly used areas, corridors, stairs, which turns them into amenities for the residents. Instead of those spaces being the minimum required for compliance, they have been turned into an amenity.”
Madell, who has won awards for apartment design, said the quality of the entry lobbies and the landscaped courtyard was uplifting and would elevate the daily experience of residents. “This project sets a new benchmark for its type.”
McGregor was most impressed by the courtyard layout and the building’s character. The design of the generous open-air galleries – external walkways – that overlook the courtyard and the street dealt with issues of privacy to the bedrooms with screens and small skylights connecting the floors.
“All have good sun, shade and airy qualities, a perfect model for the Sydney climate. The courtyard forms the protected heart of the building.”
Leonie King, the chief executive of City West – a charity that previously had the NSW government as a shareholder – plans more affordable housing around Green Square.
Tenants’ rent is capped at 25 to 30 per cent of household income, or 74.9 per cent of market rent, whichever is lower. Housing is targeted to households on very low and moderate incomes, with a connection to the area.
About 64 per cent of residents at Boronia work, and of those, 35 per cent are essential workers. Others moved from nearby Waterloo Estate.
The rent is based on the gross income of its residents, not on how big the apartment is or the number of bedrooms. A single mum with one child, for example, would be allocated a two-bedroom apartment and would pay the same amount of rent if she had three children and needed a larger unit.
Finding an affordable unit is still hard, something Huddleston experienced first-hand.
Only 2 per cent of the 40,000 homes promised by Housing Australia Future Fund over five years have been completed, reported The Australian Financial Review’s Michael Bleby. Boronia and Assemble’s Swift Walk development in Melbourne were among the first 895 social and affordable homes completed last year. A further 9485 homes are expected to be finished this year, with another 8000 in the works, he reported.
Back on her balcony that will soon have a view of a new 1400-square-metre public park, Huddleston said she appreciated the small touches – places to put photos, the soft-touch drawers in bathroom and kitchen, built-in laundry, a lot of storage, and screening from the entryway.
“It’s new, it’s calm and it’s bright. I feel very safe here. It’s been a gift. My mother said if I didn’t take it she wouldn’t talk to me.” To make ends meet, she had been working as a birth and death doula, and is looking for more work. “I didn’t get married, I didn’t have kids, it is really hard. What’s great, if I lose my work, I can ring these guys, they will work with me, won’t have to worry about being homeless. It’s having a landlord who gives a shit. They actually care.”

The six retirement fears keeping Australians up at night

Opinion
The six retirement fears keeping Australians up at night
I asked a simple question in my Epic Retirement Facebook club last week: What are you most afraid of as you head towards retirement? The responses came flooding in, and what struck me wasn’t the fear itself. It was how consistent the answers were.
“Running out of money.” “Dying at my desk”, “Changing a lifetime of saving to spending”, “Boredom, identity and loss of purpose”, “Centrelink and the government changing the rules on super”, “Being alone”.
These aren’t irrational anxieties. They’re sensible questions asked by people who don’t want to sleepwalk into a phase of life that deserves more care and attention than that.
Dismissing them as benign helps no one. What does help is turning these vague fears into something they can measure and manage. Fear thrives on ambiguity. Give it structure, numbers and a plan, and it tends to shrink to a far more workable size or even get out of the way.
1. “What if I run out of money?”
This was by far the most common response. People were blunt: “Running out of money”, “Not having enough to live on”, “That I can’t afford my living expenses”.
One person wrote, “Not owning my own home and using retirement income on $700 a week rent.” Another said, “It’s being able to survive and not ending up homeless.”
There’s nothing abstract about that.
The mistake people make is jumping straight to the question of how much they need to retire, as if there’s a single magic number that guarantees safety. There isn’t. People don’t run out of money because they missed a headline figure. They run out of money when spending and income drift apart for long enough.
The most useful place to start is far more practical: work out what it actually costs you to live an ordinary year of your life. Not your best year and definitely not your worst year. Just the year you actually live at a comfortable pace of spending and level of income.
After money, the next fear wasn’t financial at all. It was about time.
Once you know that number, the fear becomes more specific and therefore more manageable. You can start asking sensible questions: “What income covers this now? What changes later? If something goes wrong – markets fall, work dries up, health intervenes – what could I adjust?”
For renters, this fear is particularly valid. Housing is the biggest financial risk in retirement. Which is why decisions around location, downsizing, timing, or even part-time work often matter more than chasing higher investment returns. These aren’t failures, they’re tools.
2. “What if I wait too long and lose my health?”
After money, the next fear wasn’t financial at all. It was about time. It’s expressed in statements like: “My biggest fear was dying at my laptop” or “I’m afraid I’ll lose my health before I get the chance to do the things I want.”
This fear feels different because it contains an uncomfortable truth. You can rebuild money. You can’t rebuild time. And once your health goes, your choices narrow quickly. This is why “I’ll do it later” isn’t a plan. It’s a hope.
Retirement isn’t one long phase. There are years when your body is willing, years when it’s slower, and years when it limits you. If there are experiences you care about that depend on energy, mobility, strength or confidence, they belong earlier, not deferred indefinitely.
And health can’t be treated as something you’ll deal with once you stop working. Strength, balance, mobility and prevention aren’t vanity projects. They’re what make retirement usable.
3. “Who am I if I’m not working?”
This fear surprises people, but it shouldn’t. One person put it perfectly: “Trying to get a life is way more stressful than work.”
Work quietly answers many questions for us: when to get up, where to be, who needs you, what counts as a good day. When that structure disappears overnight, it can feel deeply unsettling, even if retirement was planned.
What often goes wrong is that people expect retirement to feel good immediately. When it doesn’t, they assume they’ve made a mistake. But that uncomfortable phase isn’t failure. It’s a transition.
The answer isn’t to fill every hour or find a grand “purpose”. It’s to replace the outgoing structure in your life deliberately. A few anchors matter.
Think about setting up something that gets you moving, something that puts you in contact with people, something that feels useful or absorbing. Purpose usually grows out of commitment, learning with others and making real connection, not hobbies alone.
4. “I don’t know how to spend”
This fear is one that sounds ludicrous to anyone under 50. But it’s very real. “I’ve spent my working life being careful with money. I don’t think I know how to enjoy spending.”
This makes perfect sense. Most people have been rewarded their entire adult lives for restraint. Saving was responsible. Spending was risky. Then retirement arrives, and the instruction flips: start drawing it down.
People hesitate, delay and second-guess every purchase. Many underspend not because they need to, but because it feels safer. That can be just as problematic as overspending.
The fix is putting some spending structure in place. When you were working, pay arrived regularly and spending had boundaries. In retirement, if everything comes from one big pool, every decision feels loaded.
Paying yourself a regular amount for everyday life and separating discretionary spending creates guardrails. Once spending is planned, it stops feeling reckless. Learning how to spend is part of retirement skill-building. It’s not indulgent.
5. “The rules will change underneath me”
This fear had a different tone: people were worried about things they can’t control really affecting their plans. Think about it, inflation, rising costs, governments changing the rules, battles with Centrelink and anxiety about systems becoming more complex or cashless.
Most of these fears can usually be pinpointed back to things you already care about, but may not have proactively stepped through.
And they’re right, things do change. You simply cannot plan retirement on the assumption that nothing in the economy, politics and the bureaucracy will shift. That has never been true.
The mistake is trying to control what you can’t. The goal isn’t certainty, it’s resilience. That means setting yourself up with buffers, flexibility and not running your plan right to the edge. One focused admin day a year beats years of living with low-level anxiety.
6. “What if I end up alone?”
This was the heaviest of the fears because it’s not one many of us talk about out loud. “Losing my partner before we have time to enjoy retirement together.”
Loneliness creeps up quietly on us over our lifetime. We often forget that work provides connection by default. Retirement doesn’t do this. Connection in retirement has to be planned and proactively stepped into.
You need to find groups you can be regular with, commitments that you look forward to, places where people would notice if you didn’t turn up. For those ageing solo, this isn’t optional. You need to think about it as infrastructure to build your life around, so you never end up alone, even if you do end up single by death, divorce or choice.
Ultimately, if you’re feeling them, most of these fears can usually be pinpointed back to things you already care about, but may not have proactively stepped through.
None of them are solved by pretending they won’t happen. The best thing to do to overcome them, or lessen their grip on you, is to examine them, do the work they point you to do, and make good decisions. Have a go!

Aussie travel investors get a European tour from hell

Aussie travel investors get a European tour from hell
“Nobody expects the Spanish Inquisition!” was the famous Monty Python cry.
That was certainly the case for one of Australia’s most successful tourism businesses: ASX-listed Web Travel Group.
It all sounded pedestrian enough last Friday when the group informed the ASX that “the Special Delegation of the Balearic Islands of the Spanish Tax Agency has commenced an audit of its Spanish subsidiary in respect of direct taxes,” dating back three years.
A dusty little Web Travel office in Mallorca, the port city that was once a byword for British package-tour hell, and one-time refuge of the late Australian businessman fugitive, Christopher Skase.
What’s the big deal, right?
What followed was a level of market mayhem worthy of a Monty Python skit.
Web Travel shares crashed 41 per cent to an 11-year low, wiping hundreds of millions of dollars off its market valuation in the process. It was the sort of reaction you would expect for an extinction level event, not a standard audit by tax authorities.
As a shell-shocked boss John Guscic told investors on Monday, having signed off on the announcement while in Tunisia for work: “I went to bed on Thursday night as the market was about to open with a view that we just signed off on a straightforward, non market sensitive ASX release to keep the market appropriately informed.”
He woke up to a CEO’s worst nightmare.
“The market had obviously drawn a much broader and inaccurate conclusion about the content of the release than we could have ever anticipated, it would appear the assumption is we are facing an existential crisis,” Guscic said.
But the Web Travel team should have known better with investors still reeling from the unfolding disaster at one of Australia’s other globally successful travel operators, Corporate Travel Management.
As one analyst pointed out: “The revelation could not have come at a worse time. Investors in the Australian travel intermediary industry are still dazed over Corporate Travel’s accounting irregularities and customer overcharging in Europe/the UK – a saga that has frozen Corporate Travel shares since August 2025.”
Corporate Travel needs to restate its financial accounts going back years and determine if it overcharged clients, including the British government, more than the $160 million it has uncovered to date.
Its lucrative Australian government business is undergoing an independent audit and company founder Jamie Pherous stepped away this month with no clarity on if its shares would trade again. There is no suggestion Pherous was personally involved in or aware of the overcharging.
It’s a long way from Web Travel’s Balaeric concerns, but there is good reason for market caution – as shown by the fact that its stock trades at a significant discount to where it was before the Spanish inquisition kicked off.
But Web Travel’s management were always going to be caught between a rock and a hard place on this issue.
The reason they took the unusual step of announcing this audit was that the “the Special Delegation of the Balearic Islands of the Spanish Tax Agency” didn’t just send a letter through the post.
It showed up at the company’s office with around 12 agents. We know this because local media just happened to witness and photograph the entire operation with reporting that included alarming phrases such as “alleged tax fraud”.
Web Travel is understandably commenting as little as possible. Anything they say would only antagonise the authorities. A little bit of research indicates Spanish tax authorities are not to be messed with.
Late last year, Robert Amsterdam, founder of US law firm Amsterdam & Partners, warned of a “rule of law crisis” within Spain’s tax system which some describe as a hangover from the country’s days under the Franco dictatorship.
“Spain hasn’t passed a new national budget since 2022 and is using the Spanish Tax Authority to shore up the country’s finances by incentivising tax collectors through a shady bonus system. It’s not only unethical, but illegal in our view,” he said in a widely reported interview on the matter.
Web Travel has not said how much of its European revenue, which generates one-third of its overall business, is channelled through Spain.
The company, which used to own Web Jet, acts as an accommodation-selling middleman between hotels and travel agents, which means it is also facing AI concerns and the threat of disintermediation by its partners in this travel eco-system. But that’s a story for another day.
Right now, Web Travel just needs to deliver on the promise that there is no change to its financial outlook and avoid the kind of rolling disaster at Corporate Travel that might cost its investors billions.

Elections are reshaping global politics

From Japan to Israel, elections are reshaping global politics
At a time when so much of the global conversation is about the rapid decline of democracy, it is striking what a huge impact elections — and looming elections — are having on world events just now.
Overshadowed this week, as so often happens these days by news from Washington or the Middle East, was an election result in Japan with huge ramifications for the region, and Australia.
There's also been a landmark parliamentary election result in Bangladesh, after months of instability, as well as significant recent elections as far afield as Moldova and Portugal — either overcoming Russian interference or seeing off threatened incursions by the European far right.
And a complex web of looming poll battles in the United States, Israel, Ukraine and the UK, are exerting their influence over current events.
Japan's stance on Taiwan
The parliamentary dominance won this week by Japan's first female prime minister, Sanae Takaichi, raises the spectre of a big shift in the regional power balance, just as the clock starts ticking closer to the time many analysts believe China may seek to move on Taiwan.
Takaichi has suggested, since becoming prime minister last October, that Japan may get involved if there is a Chinese military blockade of Taiwan. China has made clear its displeasure. Takaichi has not only not backed down but framed her election win as popular endorsement of her position.
It raises fascinating questions about how north Asia — Japan and South Korea — might now collectively position themselves in the near future, and what knock on effects that might have more broadly.
Beyond the spectre of any looming confrontation over Taiwan, Takaichi has also already begun escalating spending on defence, even broaching the idea of Japan having nuclear weapons, and she also wants Japan to have a greater role in global defence exports.
She is doing this amid the great unravelling — world leaders repositioning themselves to a world that is not led by the United States — however hard it may be to ignore the world's biggest superpower.
Just as there is now uncertainty in the Asia-Pacific about US commitment to the region, and by contrast a fair bit of certainty in Europe about where it stands with the US, America's role in the Middle East seems particularly convoluted.
LoadingNetanyahu meets with Trump
This week, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu visited Donald Trump in the White House. It was a meeting taking place amid a lot of conflicting time pressures and it was strikingly absent of the usual pomp and circumstance.
There was no ceremonial welcome or "gaggle" — that moment when reporters are briefly allowed into the Oval Office for a picture of two leaders together and to shout questions.
The Israeli PM said the meeting had been brought forward a week because of planned US-Iran negotiations.
But it also meant Netanyahu was foregoing any attempt to attend the first meeting of Trump's Board of Peace in Washington next week.
And it also meant he would not be attending the annual conference of the powerful American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC) — a pro-Israel lobby group which has reportedly collected an unprecedented amount of money to invest in this year's US mid-term elections. Netanyahu will reportedly attend the AIPAC conference virtually instead.
There was speculation as to whether the strange nature of the meeting reflected some plotting between the two close powers ahead of a possible US strike on Iran next week, or — as appeared more possible from public comments afterwards — a difference between the two leaders about whether the US should be negotiating with Iran at all.
Either way, it is all important in the context of looming Israeli political developments.
An election looms in Israel
A general election is not due in Israel until October. But there is a budget crisis in play right now which may bring forward an election to as early as May.
Ultra-Orthodox members of Netanyahu's parliamentary Coalition are threatening to block the national budget unless the government agrees to legislation to formalise exemptions from military service for ultra-Orthodox men. The deadline for the budget stand-off is March 31.
Netanyahu's hold on parliamentary power is weak. Polling numbers do not suggest a clear path to power after the election.
His culpability in the security breakdown which allowed the massacre of Israelis on October 7 is being questioned during an inquiry.
The government's shaky political situation at home can be seen to explain much of recent events in Israel — from the government's announcement this week of an aggressive escalation in powers to control the West Bank, as well as the posturing with Trump.
The even more aggressive push into the West Bank and expansion of illegal settlements in the Palestinian territory was seen as a clear attempt to lock in the government's far right support.
Far-right Israeli Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich announced the moves, saying, "we will continue to kill the idea of a Palestinian state".
But Trump has repeatedly made clear he does not support an annexation of the West Bank and this might explain why the announcement of the new moves in Israel were notably lacking a firm timeline.
Netanyahu's regional strongman persona suffers if the US does not strike Iran.
But the US president has moved from last month threatening an imminent strike from his vast Armada to rejecting immediate action and instead pushing for negotiations.
This gives Netanyahu all the more reason to push the West Bank expansion to shore up his credentials.
His closeness to Trump is also seen as a political plus so it is also worth noting that this week the US president was invited to come to Israel on the nation's Independence Day in late April — potentially only a month from polling day — to personally receive the Israel Prize. He is the first foreign leader and the first non-Israeli citizen or resident to receive the prize.
All in all, pundits in Israel see the signs increasingly pointing to an early poll, and to the government taking actions to maximise its position ahead of that election.
Meanwhile in Ukraine
The spectre of elections even arose in Ukraine this week, with reports that preparations for elections — not held since war broke out — had been underway for some time under pressure from the United States.
President Volodymyr Zelenskyy hosed down that idea, saying elections would only occur once there were security guarantees and a ceasefire with Russia in place.
It could well be that the US mid-terms end up being the decisive ones for Ukraine's future, given the perception in Washington that Trump wants to see an end to the war he said would end within 24 hours of him returning to the White House, before Americans go to the polls in November.
Elections are even tempering the fallout from the Epstein files.
The crisis surrounding the future of UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer over his appointment of disgraced Epstein associate Peter Mandelson has been diffused for now. That's partly because, well, there really isn't a good alternative and partly because of elections. First up there's a by-election in a couple of weeks' time. And then in May, there are significant votes for local councils and national parliaments in Scotland and Wales.
So amid all the warfare — military and political — and the trashing of institutions abroad in the world, it seems the raw allure of bums on seats still remains a force to be reckoned with.

After just nine months Sussan Ley was sent on eternity leave

analysis
Ley didn't define herself by her gender but women might relate to her workplace woes
And they say the Liberal Party doesn't get women.
They got this one pretty quickly — after just nine months. One human gestational period elapsed before Sussan Ley — the first woman to lead the Liberal Party in its 82-year history — was crisply sent on eternity leave by an emphatic vote of her colleagues.
Ley isn't the most swiftly-eliminated leader in the party's federal history. She held on to the job 24 days longer than Alexander Downer, and 16 days fewer than Brendan Nelson. So premature ejection isn't exclusively a lady phenomenon.
And Ley would be the last person who'd want to be assessed purely on the basis of her gender.
Her entire life and career — in farming, aviation, the finance sector, politics — is testament to her preparedness to advance dauntlessly into the denser cock-forests of the Australian biosphere.
She's prospered in many jobs thanks to her diligence, indefatigability and patience, and she's lost this one due to her inability to carry Australians with her.
None of the above-listed virtues and failings is gender specific, and it'd be foolish to attribute the vote chiefly to sexism. Or to argue that women won't return to a Liberal Party led by a man. Women are not stupid. Also, it's more complicated than that.
Some classic workplace tropes
The issue for the Liberal Party is not simply the toppling of a female leader. It's also about what happened to that leader while she was in the job.
And while Ley departed the scene yesterday with unimpeachable good grace, channelling the 4th century Christian martyr Agnes of Rome with her spotless white garb and remembering to thank everyone and to be especially nice about Angus, it's entirely available for less even-tempered females to conclude that her party has some pretty wild double standards.
Among professional women, the fastest-growing demographic in Australia, who also — perhaps relatedly — are among the fastest-defecting voters from the Liberal Party, some of Ley's experiences are classic workplace tropes.
For example:
- Adult Man Babysitting: A situation in which female leaders are sometimes called in to nurse male colleagues through tantrums. Absolute calm is required from her in these circumstances, because even though the tantrum may be about quite a small injury to the relevant dude's ego, if she raises her voice she will absolutely acquire a reputation as a "psycho". See: Negotiations with the National Party.
- Not In The WhatsApp: A phenomenon in which a female leader may become aware that a group of chaps has openly assembled to discuss which of them will get her job, while she is quite busy doing that job. See: The pre-funeral breakfast gathering in Melbourne last month in which an influential group of Liberal men gathered to nut out who would take Ley's place. See also: Julie Bishop, the previous most senior serving Liberal woman, who weathered several leadership spills and regularly witnessed horse-trading between male colleagues over who would get to be deputy, even though she was the deputy and was sitting right there.
- Clean That Up, Would You? In which it becomes extremely urgent for a female leader to fix up a long-standing and extremely knotty problem, even when it has been kicked down the road or in some cases even created by the exact people who are very desirous of a quick resolution. See: Sussan Ley facing pressure from colleagues including Angus Taylor and Barnaby Joyce to abandon the Coalition's commitment to net zero, negotiated in government five years earlier by *checks notes* Barnaby Joyce and Angus Taylor.
- Changing Goalposts: In which a female leader takes a deep breath, mutters fervent prayers to an unresponsive deity and — after consulting widely — accepts a position that may not be her own view but seems genuinely to reflect the majority opinion across her team. At which point the chaps who got their way either defect to One Nation or go for her job regardless. (See point 3)
- Just, I Don't Know… *vague gesture* ... Not Up To It: A classic of the genre, where everyone is convinced that a female leader is generally just not quite right, though no-one can quite put their finger on why. In the genteel rush to rule out the obvious factor (BOOBS!) much weight will commonly come to rest on minor gaffes. See: Sussan Ley's analysis last year that Anthony Albanese's Joy Division T-shirt was an unforgivable piece of subliminal antisemitism. Rococo, admittedly. But worse than Angus Taylor's inability, in Question Time, as shadow treasurer, to distinguish between monthly and annual inflation?
An interesting coincidence
These are historical matters now, as far as Ley is concerned. The first female leader of the Liberal Party is off to embark on her new phase of life, leaving the Parliament entirely. The Liberal women of the House of Representatives — having previously required a seven-seater to car-share to work, with a space for handbags — will soon be able to travel in a compact sedan.
Ley herself, it's abundantly clear, does not plan to hang around and settle scores. She is moving on, citing a mantra she learned in her piloting days: "If I had an ego, I'd be dead."
It's unlikely there will be regular commentary on the efforts of her successor, or efforts to defend her legacy or revel in whatever misfortune might come the way of her malefactors.
Of the seven former prime ministers of this country who still draw breath, there is really only one who has consistently employed a similar approach. It's the only other woman. What an interesting coincidence.

There is a foolproof way to get rid of hiccups. It’s not pretty

There is a foolproof way to get rid of hiccups. It’s not pretty
Each week, Good Weekend’s how-to column shares expert advice on how to navigate some of modern life’s big – and small – challenges. This week: How to cure hiccups.
“There is an effective cure, but it’s not pretty,” warns Dr Sarah Holper, neurologist at The Royal Melbourne Hospital and author of What’s Wrong with You? An Insider’s Guide to Your Insides.
Hiccups are a disruption in the rhythmic tightening and relaxing of the diaphragm during normal breathing. “The diaphragm is like a layer of ham – a meaty parachute – between the intestines and gut,” explains Holper. “When you breathe in, it flattens downwards, creating a vacuum that pulls air into your lungs. When you exhale, it relaxes upwards, the lungs shrink, and air is expelled.”
A hiccup happens when the diaphragm suddenly flattens at the wrong time in the breathing cycle, yanking air into the lungs. This “really startles” your vocal cords, which respond by “snapping shut, exactly 35 milliseconds after that sudden intake of air. That’s what creates the ‘hic’ sound.”
This diaphragm spasm is caused by an irritation of the vagus nerve. Vagus is Latin for “wandering”, and the vagus nerve wanders all over the body, from the brainstem to eye muscles, eardrums, vocal cords, heart, lungs, diaphragm, stomach walls and intestines, all the way to the rectum. An irritation at any point – even a single hair tickling an eardrum – can cause hiccups.
Related Article
Curing hiccups involves – bizarrely – more stimulation. Says Holper, “Like if a kid’s having a tantrum, you stop it by distracting them: if you flood the vagus nerve with other messages, it resets itself.” Press your eyeballs; induce a gag reflex; rub your earlobes. Or try the Valsalva manoeuvre – close your nose and mouth and forcefully “exhale”, as if blowing up a tight balloon or having a bowel movement.
Admittedly, it’s all a bit of an inexact science. But there is another way: a case study in the medical literature entitled Termination of intractable hiccups with digital rectal massage. “The author put on gloves – he really emphasised that – and performed a circumferential rectal massage with his finger. And it cured the hiccups.”
This result has been replicated and, apparently, there’s “plenty of anecdotal evidence” that it works. “Basically, the vagus nerve forgets about the hiccups,” concludes Holper. “It forgets about the diaphragm. It just thinks, ‘What is going on?!’ And then it resets very effectively.”
Both Holper and the literature suggest this procedure is best undertaken by medical professionals. For the rest of us, try the eyeballs, the earlobes or the old standby: a glass of cold water.

ABC’s Radio National report card: Have the big changes worked?

ABC’s Radio National report card: Have the big changes worked?
Radio was the ABC’s first medium when it was founded in 1932, grounded in a central mission of building unity in the relatively new Commonwealth. But by the time influential administrator and aesthete Kim Williams arrived as chair in 2024 it had, in his words, been neglected.
In his first public address as chair of the national broadcaster, Williams used the Redmond Barry Lecture to call for a “renewed” Radio National as the broadcaster’s flagship, leading a rejuvenated audio division.
It needed more creativity and better curation, Williams said while giving the lecture at the State Library of Victoria in June 2024, having spent the past three months getting deep under the hood of the broadcaster. Williams spoke, then things happened quickly.
Rumoured plans to cull one of its talkback networks – Local Radio, NewsRadio or Radio National – were kiboshed. Just months later, ABC backflipped on a decision to fold the audio division in with the rest of its screen content.
In August that year, Williams told Radio National staff of his bold ambitions for the station. He wanted it to become the ABC’s “heartland”, and to replicate the BBC’s equivalent station, Radio 4, which reached 17 per cent of the British public (at that time) every week.
“My aspiration would be to that level. My aspiration is to actually see it be a service that has a real impact,” Williams said.
With former ABC Radio Melbourne manager Dina Rosendorff at the helm, the ABC instigated a station-wide review. The result was a visual rebrand, while “Always Curious” replaced “Think Bigger” as the station’s mission. There was also greater emphasis on knitting the day’s programming together with two continuity announcers appointed to guide listeners.
There was a complete rethink of the flagship Breakfast show. Newshound Patricia Karvelas was replaced by Sally Sara and a team of dedicated and experienced roving reporters styled like Radio 4’s Today program. The network’s former star Fran Kelly returned to do The Radio National Hour in the evenings. There were new programs such as Saturday Extra with the BBC’s former Washington correspondent Nick Bryant. Life Matters got a new host, as did The World Today with Andy Park. Journalist and filmmaker Marc Fennell got a new show, there was a new arts program, a new economics show, a media show, a science show, a food and culture show, and many more.
Finally, there was an insistence, led by Williams, that the station be referred to as Radio National, rather than the colloquial “RN”. It was a minor point, but it showed the chairman’s personal investment in small aspects of the station’s presentation, and his desire for it to reassert its position in the national conversation.
At that point, ratings and audience figures had been on the slide for several successive years. Unlike local radio, which was the beneficiary of a ratings boost at the height of the pandemic, Radio National figures were largely consistent with those in 2019, but from 2022 onwards, the statistics fell off a cliff.
National effort
A year on from Williams’ remarks and the average weekly national audience of Radio National had fallen by 9 per cent to 462,000 in the 2024-25 financial year, according to the last annual report. That is just 1.7 per cent of our population. There is a long way to go to reach Williams’ target.
And over the course of the calendar year, Radio National reported an average radio survey cumulative audience of 472,250 across the five capital cities, down from 496,000 in 2024.
There are eight ratings reports published each year, and “cumulative audience” includes any listener who tuned in for at least eight minutes in that survey period.
But after an initial six months bedding the new programming in, a deeper look into the numbers shows there are some green shoots, and at the very least, the station has arrested any further declines. Across the five cities, the final survey delivered 492,000 cumulative listeners, 36,000 more than the same survey in 2024 and across the final four surveys of 2025, audiences rose 4 per cent.
But there remains an audience issue for Radio National in the country’s two largest cities, where the station has lost 35 per cent of its audience since pre-COVID in 2019.
“Talk formats like Radio National tend to attract older audiences, so the numbers should be holding firm,” a former ABC executive says, speaking on the condition of anonymity as they remain in the industry.
ABC head of audio Ben Latimer says live radio is only one part of the picture for Radio National, arguing that many of the station’s programs now reach larger audiences in podcast form than on broadcast.
“What we’re seeing post-COVID is a redistribution of listening rather than a loss of relevance, with Radio National playing a central role in the ABC’s podcast leadership,” Latimer says.
There’s some truth to that. Of the top 100 podcasts in the country, 24 are produced by the ABC, according to recent figures from data and ratings firm Triton, many of them shows on Radio National. Compare that with a year prior, when only 15 of the top 100 shows were made by the ABC, and it’s an impressive jump.
Asked if Radio National is now a podcast-first station, Latimer says its role is to reach Australians “wherever and however they choose to listen”. If You’re Listening, hosted by Matt Bevan, is a prime example of that, airing on radio on Friday afternoons. But the show performs better online. It was the nation’s 18th most popular podcast in December and its full video versions gather hundreds of thousands of extra views on YouTube.
While several of the new shows commissioned for 2025 were dumped after one year, in 2026, Radio National further tinkered with its lineup. There’s a Radio National Arts Hour from Monday to Thursday, and it expanded Global Roaming, adding in two new hosts, Kylie Morris and Latika Bourke, and releasing a new episode each weekday. The approach can look choppy, but it’s also resulting in experimentation, with losses quickly cut and new bets placed.
It also goes some way to rejuvenating its arts coverage, a sector increasingly neglected across media, and which the ABC stripped back in a round of cuts in 2023.
It’s not just ratings that define success for the ABC, says managing director Hugh Marks, still in his first 12 months, though he notes the ABC is No. 1 in “live streaming”.
“Ultimately, success for the ABC’s radio services is about delivering trusted, distinctive content that serves the public interest by meeting the needs of the Australian community with integrity and purpose,” Marks says.
“We continue to strengthen these outcomes by investing in high-quality journalism and specialist programming, improving delivery through broadcast and digital platforms so audiences can engage with ABC content wherever they are.”
Tough programming
The big changes to the ABC’s audio offering have come during the tenure of Ben Latimer, who joined the ABC in 2023 from Nova, Lachlan Murdoch’s commercial radio company. It was a major switch: Nova focuses more on music and entertainment, Radio National is increasingly highbrow. For the broadcaster’s staff, any member of management coming from the dreaded “commercial” sector can be a lightning rod when things don’t go to plan.
When Latimer joined, ABC Radio was already in a transitional phase with an extensive, internal review already commissioned by the Ita Buttrose-led board. The aim: to address the rapid decline in audience figures for its local stations after pandemic-juiced figures. One of the key recommendations was that each show be judged on its own merits, which is in part what followed.
Each network has a distinctive role to play, Marks says. While Radio National provides breathing room for long-form storytelling and engagement, the network of local radio stations is the ABC’s most direct connection to the community.
There have been some significant changes to the local stations, especially in Sydney and Melbourne. Several hosts retired, including Richard Glover, or were pushed out, and ratings suffered.
“Change in any large creative organisation is always complex, and our staff base is just as passionate as our audience, but renewal is essential if we’re to remain relevant to audiences,” Latimer says.
The former ABC executive, who declined to be named, said the simplest explanation for the local stations’ woes was their broadcast material.
“While rivals have continued to provoke, argue and surprise, ABC Radio has become safer, flatter and more predictable,” the former executive says. “The data suggests listeners haven’t been driven away by technology, but by programming that no longer feels essential.”
Marks says the ABC’s job isn’t to chase clicks and provoke, like the commercial talkback model, but he agrees there needs to be investment in the renewed success of the ABC’s local radio.
“It’s important we see positive momentum in the short to medium term, and I think we can already see the impact of some of that work.
“The ABC’s purpose is to provide valued services that reflect and contribute to Australian society, culture and identity, not to compete in the marketplace of clicks.
“Quality, the diversity and distinctiveness of each channel and format, and the ability to serve accurately and distinctively every community that we operate in will stand us in good stead against the rise of noisier formats.”
Now the changes have been made, it’s up to the audience, who will vote with their feet.

Help! My new partner doesn’t wash his hands after going to the toilet
Q: I’ve met a lovely man. But the other day, I heard him go to the toilet for a long session, then come out without washing his hands. No mistake about it, the soap was bone-dry when I checked. Now I feel reluctant to hold hands or get intimate with him. Please help! T.S., Mildura, VIC
A: Aww, what a romantic scenario to share on Valentine’s Day. You lurking outside the bathroom while your man is in there, your ear pressed against the door like a detective on Law & Order: Special Toilet Unit. And when he comes out, hiding behind a pot plant until he’s gone, then sneaking in to do your surveillance work: examining the moisture content of the soap, inspecting the dampness quotient of the hand towel, counting the remaining toilet-roll squares to confirm that it was an actual sit-down, square-using session.
But do you really know what he was doing in there? He may have just been plucking his inner nostrils. Men do that in bathrooms: our nose hairs regrow every 15 minutes; it’s a part-time job. Or he may have gone in there to get some time out from you because you’re always following him around everywhere, checking on him, ducking down behind pot plants.
But if you’re right, here’s a handy little handwashing tip that might help: men are very open to self-improvement when it comes to intimacy ultimatums. Subtly suggest that you’ll be withholding all spicy activity until he improves his bathroom hygiene, and I guarantee he’ll start washing his hands about 200 times a day. You’ll be going through a bar of soap every hour. His hands will be so puckered and blistered and raw from frenzied over-scrubbing, you won’t want them going anywhere near you. But you made your promise. Now you’ve got to see it through.

Rachel spent five years ‘quiet quitting’ her marriage. Her husband didn’t see it coming
Whether single, divorced or “subconsciously uncoupling”, an ever-increasing number of women of a certain age – and means – are rethinking their romantic relationships.
Four middle-aged women, members of a long-running book club, stand around a marble island bench in the kitchen of an inner-west Sydney terrace, sipping rosé while the host assembles a salad. Call it an extraordinary general meeting of the club – there’s no book on the agenda, and more serious issues are on the table.
“He wasn’t very attractive but it went for six weeks and was fantastic; I had sex again and then I said, ‘Thank you very much,’ ” says one of the guests, Sally*, who met the man she’s referring to via a friend soon after ending her marriage in 2020. Sally, 53, hadn’t dated since her early 20s. “I later learnt that that’s called a ‘palate cleanser’. The kids just thought I was at book club a lot.”
Claudia* interjects to share her expression for a rebound hook-up – “like a sniff of coffee beans”.
Sally, long, fair hair and cool glasses, resumes her story. “Then I started doing the bloody Bumble thing and I was like, ‘This is terrible!’ ” She turns to Rachel* – “like when you and I went speed dating and you came out of that and said you were going to become a lesbian”. Rachel, 59 and slender with strawberry-blonde hair pulled back, replies: “I liked the women more.”
But Sally, the head of finance for a large corporation, is a driven woman and, after two decades with “a terrible husband” who wrapped her in debt, was determined to find a new partner, a good man. She left no stone unturned. An expensive agency introduced her to an international businessman who bought her clothes, took her to restaurants and picked her up in limousines. “There was completely no substance,” Sally says. “After about four months, like when you get past that headiness, I realised my brain was inconvenient to him.” Back in the dating-app swamp, she chatted online briefly to a man who told her about his weekend and sent her a photograph of a barbecue he’d just assembled. “It’s a boy thing,” he told her, before asking what she’d been up to. “That weekend, literally, I’d been chainsawing trees in my garden. It didn’t go very far after that.” But Sally treated her search as a project. “I’d meet six different dates in three weeks, give it a break and just live for a while, and then go back in and I’d do it again.”
Lucy* the 62-year-old host, turns from the sink where she’s draining spaghetti and says to Sally: “You were really brave. You kept getting back out there, you were really corporate about it – like, ‘OK, it’s a numbers game.’ If John and I split up, that’d be it for me, I’d never go online, I’m terrified of it.”
Like Sally, Rachel is determined too. For five years she knew she wanted to leave her husband – he was “emotionally unavailable”, neglectful of her and their children, utterly focused on his IT business. Sometimes when he was working, he’d tell her that he was “in the zone” – as in don’t interrupt him. Sometimes he’d go away for weeks on end. “You did everything, you raised the kids, you pressure-hosed the driveway, you did everything,” Lucy comments. But Rachel wanted her youngest child to turn 18 before she upended the marriage. She parked her unhappiness. In early 2022, she buckled – just before her daughter’s birthday.
“It was, ‘I can’t do this marriage any more,’ I was just done.” Her husband was blindsided. “It was this anger, like, ‘How dare you inconvenience my life which is so good with you doing everything.’ ” One of his first responses to the news was to ask Rachel to hold off until he’d closed a major contract. Plating up spaghetti ragù, Lucy observes: “Women check out a long time before they actually leave, and when they do finally walk out the door the men are like, ‘What! I didn’t see this coming!’ If they’d been paying attention, they would have noticed that she hadn’t been present for years.”
Rachel was ready for adventure after her marriage ended. “I’m quite a sexual person and I needed to enjoy that aspect of my life again.” She had a year-long relationship with the first (and last) man she met via an app. He was kind and loving and the sex was great but, politically, they were a gulf apart. “And he never stopped talking about himself.” Rachel, a public servant, told the man it was over. Now she’s ambivalent about ever entering another relationship. “I’m quite happy to be single,” she says. “It’s important women aren’t afraid to be alone; it’s really disempowering to be afraid to be alone.”
This evening’s book club agenda: a new feminist movement – a revolution in how heterosexual women in midlife are thinking about love, relationships, men and living arrangements. An ever-increasing number of women of a certain age, disaffected with where they’ve found themselves after lifetimes of socialisation about women’s roles, are binning old romantic scripts that cast them as labourers and emotional moorings and reassessing what they want their lives to look like.
Sally’s and Rachel’s stories are emblematic of the shift: both are what psychologists might dub “walkaway wives”; both ditched deeply unsatisfying marriages once they felt their children were old enough to cope with upheaval. Their decisions match a broader demographic shift: while the divorce rate is at its lowest in 50 years, the share of divorces involving couples married 20 years or more – a proxy for midlife and older splits – has risen by about 30 per cent over three decades. (There is no available data to reflect the rate of de facto separations; and, as Nicole Kidman knows too well, men still leave women.) But this story is about more than marriages ending: it’s about what women are deciding to do when they are single again – regardless of whether they chose to leave the relationship or were left. Women who have the financial resources to do so are increasingly taking a stand, sometimes for the first time, about what sort of man and partnership is worth their time and energy, even if that means they end up building solo lives.
Dr Elisabeth Shaw, a clinical psychologist and CEO of Relationships Australia NSW, talks to hundreds of women every year, and has felt the changing temperature. “We’ve really seen out the phase where women feel they need a man to feel good enough,” Shaw says. “More women in midlife are willing to stand alone and take what comes.”
On the morning of the book club, Lucy, a shrewd, plugged-in identity in the Sydney entertainment world, emailed me a recent article from Oprah Daily headed, “Why the Stereotype of the Desperate Single Woman Is Becoming a Thing of the Past”. It cited 2022 Pew Research Centre data showing that 65 per cent of single American women overall (versus 50 per cent of men) were not actively seeking love or dates, while 2020 data reported this rising to 71 per cent for women aged 50-plus. The article noted: “We are living through a moment of quiet refusal, a steady unravelling of roles we never truly wanted.” Now, as Lucy herds us towards the dinner table, she mentions the article. She believes the same change is happening in Australia but is convinced the article understates its weight. “I think it’s far more consequential, a profound shift in the bedrock of the patriarchy and, as an offshoot, it translates to something of a crisis for midlife and older men, particularly in the midst of the male loneliness epidemic. They’ve always been able to rely on having a woman to take care of them; what happens if women clock off?”
In early November last year on national television, Terri Rippon turned down a man, offering Australian women a stunning visual of what midlife female empowerment can look like. In a moment of excellent television, Rippon was steadfast. Although it’s a far less interesting detail, she was beautiful too: silver-blue Grecianesque gown, unsullied grey hair and eyes so deeply blue you could dive into them.
This is what anachronistic television looks like: on the semi-reality show The Golden Bachelor (broadcast on Nine, the owner of this masthead) a silver fox – in this instance, Barry “Bear” Myrden – is ushered through orchestrated dates with a group of middle-aged women before picking them off in a series of tense “rose ceremonies”. The women wait, helpless, as he pauses for dramatic effect before calling on them one by one to receive a rose. Those who do not get a bloom are booted.
As one of the contestants, Rippon had squirmed through a number of the ceremonies, at the end of which Myrden selected her to play on. In one episode, she watched another contestant’s anxiety build as she waited on his decision. “I couldn’t get that out of my mind: here’s this woman feeling that way over a man, waiting for this man to choose her.” By episode five, Rippon was done. “Terri, will you accept this rose?” Myrden asked. For what seemed a lifetime, she was silent. He asked her again. Finally, she stepped forward. “I thought long and hard about it,” she said, shaking her head, smiling kindly, “I’m not going to accept your rose.” Was that a how-dare-she look darting across the bachelor’s face?
Now Rippon, a 62-year-old property developer from Torquay on Victoria’s Surf Coast, tells me her answer was not premeditated or scripted. She simply realised that she had no interest in competing with other women for a man. Her thinking about men and relationships has been hard-won. In 2000, Rippon’s then-husband told her he needed to move out “to work things out”. She discovered he had started a new relationship when her young sons returned from an outing and told her they’d met “Daddy’s new girlfriend”. “I was a complete mess,” she says. “It really broke me.”
Rippon has had three long-term relationships in the years since, the last with a financially insecure man a decade younger. “It was great – probably sexually driven – but he was immature. I remember having an argument with him one day and I said, ‘My god, I’m nearly f---ing 60, I don’t need to put up with this crap.’ ” She is not interested in being either a “nurse or a purse” for a man, she says. “I’m sick of helping men. If I met somebody now, he has to be at least on the same level as me financially and I most likely would never live with them. They need to have their house, I’d have my house. Happy days.”
Rippon’s Golden Bachelor turn is not the only pop culture moment to reflect the midlife shift. Backlash against the influencer-driven, frilly-aproned trad-wife movement was in full swing by the time Lyz Lenz’s divorce memoir, This American Ex-Wife – which described marriage as “a commonplace horror” – was released in early 2024. Two months later, American writer Miranda July’s novel All Fours, the “first great perimenopause novel” according to The New York Times Magazine, quickly became a rallying point for women. “Sometimes I could hear Harris’s dick whistling impatiently like a teakettle, at higher and higher pitches until I finally couldn’t take it and so I initiated,” says July’s anti-heroine of the chore of having sex with her husband alongside “endless cleaning and cooking and caring and working”. The Yale Review described the bestseller as “a call to freedom from conventional forms of domesticity and marriage”. In the novel, a semi-famous artist seething with hormones and discontent farewells her husband and young child and, instead of driving to New York for a work event, stops at a “junky” motel where she spends weeks in a transformative, dream-like liaison with a younger stranger. After All Fours′ publication, women bombarded July, 51, with messages confessing to their own relationship disaffections. Book clubs threw themselves upon it, All Fours group chats proliferated. Inspired, some women reportedly upturned their own lives.
English singer Lily Allen’s exceptional 2025 album West End Girl added another layer. Many read the autofictional exposé of the infidelities of 41-year-old Allen’s (now ex) husband as a rejection of the expectation women should stay silent about men’s poor behaviour. It electrified women, setting off a social media storm. “For every woman who’s twisted herself into a human pretzel to keep some emotionally constipated bloke happy, this is our national anthem,” one woman commented on Allen’s Instagram.
The zeitgeist has spawned headlines (“Is having a boyfriend embarrassing now?” – UK Vogue) and new language. Terms such as “heteropessimism” and “heterofatalism” have emerged to describe, in the main, women’s weariness and cynicism about straight relationships. As Annabel Crabb identified in her 2015 book, The Wife Drought, one of the troubles hetero women face is that they don’t get to have a wife. Even while working full-time, women continue to do the greatest share of unpaid household labour – on average, 32 hours a week, nine hours more than men, according to the Australian government’s 2025 Status of Women Report Card. Studies also have found that women bear about 70 per cent of the mental load of running households – keeping tabs on school projects, medical appointments, gifts for everyone as well as his mother. And then there’s “mankeeping”, a term postdoctoral Stanford University fellow Angelica Puzio Ferrara coined in 2024 to describe the work of being a partner’s de facto counsellor, managing his emotional turmoil and buttressing what is frequently a frail social network.
Little wonder a Chicago psychotherapist’s Substack post headed “Ageing Out of F---s” went viral in late 2025. Ellen Scherr, who claims “to help women navigate midlife transitions when you suddenly can’t tolerate anyone’s bullshit” argues that neurological and hormonal shifts can strip away decades of hypervigilant, people-pleasing behaviour and emotional labour. In their place, she writes, women in midlife can gain clarity, time and authenticity. ”Welcome to what I call the Great Unf---ening,” Scherr wrote. The first comment underneath said: “Wow. This was a whole exhale I didn’t know I’d been holding.”
Back at the book club dinner table: dragging sourdough through sauce, mopping up the spillover of revolutionary discussion. There are any number of aspects of this new love landscape to address. “We’ve looked the devil in the face and gone through the fire,” says Sally, laying down her fork. “We know who we are.”
Such resolve isn’t forged in a vacuum. By midlife, adding to the strain of difficult or insufferable relationships, any number of other blows can land, often simultaneously – bereavement, redundancy, caring for ailing parents or wayward young adult children, menopause, health issues. Eleanor Mills, the 55-year-old founder and CEO of Noon, an organisation dedicated to building community for women in midlife, calls it “the midlife clusterf---“. But Mills also describes an opposing force turbo-powering a woman’s agency at this time – the realisation that, in a “hundred-year life”, they still have time. “We’re seeing lots of women voting with their feet and saying, ’I’m not prepared to settle for something shit when I’m only halfway through my life,” says Mills. “We’re approaching midlife with a different kind of agency and sense of expectation.”
There’s no manual to explain the rules of engagement after a woman decides the status quo is untenable; things can be messy, protracted or even remain unresolved. Enter “quiet divorce” – what an article late last year in New York magazine’s The Cut termed “subconsciously uncoupling”, checking out on a marriage while remaining together, the age-old condition of detaching and living in a state of weary acceptance or worse. As Rachel knows, it can take a toll. During the five years she was quietly quitting her marriage, she endured crippling perimenopause symptoms and, at one point, underwent major surgery. She thought her husband would step up when she was released from hospital but on the first day home, she cooked the family dinner.
As Lucy brings a cake to the table, Rachel says she was on antidepressants and relied heavily on the “serenity prayer” to get through – accepting what can’t be changed and finding the courage to change what can. “You switch off the taxi light,” Sally says. “You do what you have to do,” Rachel replies.
Sally’s “quiet quitting” from her husband was noisier. As fast as she paid the mortgage, her husband piled up debts secured against the house. “I worked my arse off until I had enough to buy him out.” In 2010, she negotiated a financial separation from her husband, although she elected to stay under the same roof for another 10 years for their children’s sake. “I had to give him cash but it meant I had a legal agreement that I was the primary caregiver, the owner of the assets.” Now Sally finds herself thinking about women who don’t have the financial means to engineer exits. “The real work these days is helping women build a five-year plan, because it can take that long, you’ve got to get your ducks in a row.” She has been astonished at women she knows who haven’t even had their own bank accounts when they’ve separated from their husbands. “I’m like, ‘What are you doing!’ ”
Lucy shares her experience: soon after her marriage in the mid-2000s, her husband’s behaviour switched from kind to controlling and abusive. “I realised he was a liar, scary.” Like Sally, she was the main income earner, but it took her seven years to manoeuvre her way through her husband’s coercive control and out of the massive debt he’d landed her in. “With every move I made, I massaged his ego; I had to make him think that things were his idea and would benefit him.” Finally, in 2010, Lucy was able to transfer money out of joint accounts and cancel credit cards. “He wasn’t a shouter, he was a quiet man. He said to me, ‘I just tried to use the credit card.’ I said, ‘Yep, it’s not going to be working any more because we’re splitting up.’ He said, ‘Well, what am I meant to do for money?’ I said, ‘Get a job.’ I came out of the marriage going, I will not be treated like shit ever again.”
With such a mindset, building new intimate connections can be a slow, tremulous process. “I have to protect myself,” Rachel says. One woman I speak with for this article describes the experience of being with a new lover as “terrifying”: “I’m so rigidly keeping my vulnerabilities under wrap that it’s like walking on a tightrope. The truth is, after a spectacularly dramatic end to a long and ultimately toxic 20-year marriage, I’m not sure how I would cope with rejection again and that’s what drives my choices about relationships now. Midlife men should know that midlife women don’t need them – we are independent, we’re not looking for someone to look after us … they need to add value to our life!”
Another woman tells me that, although she recently started dating a new man after rebuilding herself from a devastating relationship breakdown in mid-2023, her only priority is maintaining a calm and peaceful home for her daughters. “The relationship will only continue if it is completely incremental to my life and my peace,” she says. “If in any way it compromises this beautiful life we have now, I just wouldn’t stand for it.”
Both Sally and Lucy are now in strong, committed relationships – Lucy has been with John for 13 years, Sally with Chris for a little over two years. Both are poster women for another hallmark of this new era – LAT relationships, people “living apart together”, maintaining relationships while keeping separate households. In 2019, more than 1.5 million single Australians had an intimate partner they didn’t live with. “It’s a case of build-your-own arrangement,” says Lucy, one of many women who see a LAT arrangement as defensive architecture as much as lifestyle preference, a way to achieve intimacy without slipping into old roles. “I am a great fan of geographic separation; from my experience, I don’t think men and women living together in a heterosexual relationship full-time serves women particularly well. Men are hard work, even the lovely ones. We lose ourselves and end up as domestic servants – it’s in our DNA.” Lucy and John, who both have young adult children, are only now starting to talk about moving closer or in together. “We’re having some really intense conversations about it; we both have baggage and I’m really protective of my own space.”
Lucy has counselled Sally about the issue of cohabitation. Soon after Sally met Chris, she was overwhelmed by the sense they should have been together forever. Lucy took her for coffee. “She said, ‘Don’t try and merge your houses and your kids all at once.’ That really settled me,” Sally says. For now, she and Chris see each other three nights out of seven. “We’ve got a rhythm, I really look forward to seeing him – it’s exciting, there’s so much joy in our relationship; even if eventually we move in together I think we’ll need ways to preserve that.”
Kerri Sackville, the Sydney-based author of Out There: A Survival Guide for Dating in Midlife, offers a compelling example of how living apart together can work. Four years ago, after a decade or more of misery, a marriage breakdown, another traumatic relationship and eight years of what she describes as “almost frenetic dating”, Sackville looked at her platonic friend Michael and had an epiphany. “I swear to god, it felt like I had been hit with the love stick,” she says. “I suddenly thought, ‘I want to touch his knee!’ ” They have been together since soon after that electrifying moment but still live apart. “From the start, we talked about how you can form your own ideas about what a relationship is and what it looks like.” They see each other most days, holiday together and are close to each other’s young adult children but don’t force them together. “As much as it would be nice to one day live together, there’s no urgency,” Sackville says. “We spend a lot of time together, but can then retreat back to our own places – I’m 57, he’s 61, we need space!” Still, she says, “it’s the first time in my life I can honestly say I’ve felt emotionally safe with someone else.”
One day while I’m writing this article I visit my literary agent, Fiona Inglis, at her Paddington office. She tells me a modern love story. As with so many such stories at our time of life – Inglis is 64 – it starts with a tragedy. In 2015, the father of her two young-adult sons died six weeks after being diagnosed with oesophageal cancer. For years, her boys were her sole focus. Soon after they had both finished high school, Inglis, the managing director of Curtis Brown Australia, signed up to Bumble.
Women in midlife aren’t rejecting love or men or relationships. They’re rejecting asymmetry in relationships.
In his dating profile, the man said he loved the ebb and flow of stories. “And I thought, ‘Well, stories are my life.’ ” Inglis met him in the Sydney beachside suburb of Coogee for a coffee. She remembers the blue of the sea and the sky and the red of his T-shirt, his thick grey hair. “Handsome, Irish.” She took him a book, a collection of short stories by the Irish writer Kevin Barry. At the end of the date, the man walked her to her car. “I said, ‘Well, that was fun, that was really fun’, and I put my hand out to shake his hand. He just pulled me into a big hug – he’s really tall, about six foot three – and said, ‘Yeah, me too.’ ” Inglis and Cathal (Karl) de Burca, a semi-retired microbiologist and IT consultant, were married last year at Wylie’s ocean baths in Coogee. He wore an Irish kilt, she wore Trelise Cooper. Her two boys walked her down the boardwalk. In her wedding speech, Inglis said: “I didn’t need to be rescued, I could quite easily have gone on living on my own perfectly happily, but now I have him in my life, I know I can lean on him for absolutely anything.”
The couple have what Inglis describes as “a daggy old house” on the NSW South Coast where de Burca spends most of his time. Inglis typically is in Sydney Monday to Wednesday and on the coast Thursday to Sunday. “I get down there and if I haven’t seen him for two days, we just fall into each other’s arms, we just love seeing each other.” When they swim in the ocean, Inglis slips in behind him. “He’s got really big shoulders and the way he swims is the way he lives; he’s really steady and strong and powerful, and I can just go in his wake.” They have a binding financial agreement but money is unimportant. “He brings absolutely everything else to the table; I feel so fulfilled by having him in my life.”
Women in midlife aren’t rejecting love or men or relationships. They’re rejecting asymmetry in relationships, the cost of love as it has been structured for generations. At multiple turns through the research for this piece, I come upon middle-aged women who have, in the past couple of years, fallen freshly and deeply in love. Book club member Claudia*, for example, who has never married and does not have children. At a pub one night in 2024, out with friends, she and an acquaintance, a widower, were the last to leave. “The seats were being packed up and we were still chatting,” Claudia, a 54-year-old researcher, tells the book club members. She’d not previously had a one-on-one conversation with the man. Within four months of the conversation, they’d both sold their houses and moved in together. “I could just tell he was solid,” she says. “This person is somebody I always want to stay with; I always want to be in the same room as him.”
But if there’s no man sufficiently solid or safe or emotionally literate to hand, midlife women are standing firm, holding on to their authenticity and refusing to compromise. Noon’s Eleanor Mills sees a woman at midlife as a chrysalis. “You finally get a chance to shake off everybody else’s expectations ... all the hoops you’ve had to jump through, and finally get a chance to say, ‘Well, what do I want?’ ” And women are having love affairs of a different nature – with tight groups of girlfriends bound by deep affection, big laughter, emotional support and common interests. “I’ve got the most wonderful girlfriends,” says The Golden Bachelor’s Terri Rippon, “my heart is so filled that men just don’t cut the mustard for me any more.”
The meeting to discuss the revolution is drawing to a close now; Sally and Rachel and Claudia are carrying plates into the kitchen while Lucy stacks the dishwasher. Sally mentions a woman she knows who walked away from her marriage just before she was 65. “She got absolutely caned by the kids and their friends but she just felt the marriage was dead; there wasn’t conflict, it was more just there was nothing. She wanted to travel, to live. He didn’t. She hasn’t stopped travelling since, she’s done the most amazing things.”
Lucy stops for a moment, mid-plate, thinks, and then says: “From birth, the biggest threat society says women face if they don’t conform is that they’ll end up on their own with cats. But, when you’ve been through shit with men, you think, ‘Actually, that sounds pretty good!’ ”

The Melbourne suburbs with the best chance of auction success

The Melbourne suburbs with the best chance of auction success
Leonie Bawden has lived in Dingley Village in Melbourne’s south-east since 1989, and describes her neighbourhood as “just a nice vibe”.
“I feel safe, it’s quiet, I’ve never had any trouble with neighbours or anything like that. And where my home is, it’s just a short walk to the shopping centre, and there are three schools around all within walking distance,” the 73-year-old retiree said.
Her home of 23 years is her third property in the suburb since 1989, and when she takes it to auction on Saturday, she will have reason to be hopeful.
Dingley Village is one of Melbourne’s most successful suburbs for auctions, recording a clearance rate of 89.7 per cent during 2025.
A string of Melbourne suburbs recorded ultra-high clearance rates last year, topped by Yallambie in the north-east with a 95 per cent clearance rate and just 20 auctions reported between January and November, on Domain data.
Clearance rates of 90 per cent-plus were achieved in Chelsea Heights, Jacana, Gladstone Park and Notting Hill. Melbourne’s overall clearance rate hovered in the high 60 to low 70 per cent range over the same period.
Bawden used to work in real estate and has been watching the local market. She thinks prices are on the mark, and not overinflated.
“I think auctions work better in this area, better than private sales,” said the Richmond Football Club Former Players and Officials Association secretary and treasurer. “It’s a bit of a sought-after area and there’s quite a bit of interest in every home that goes up for sale in the area.
“There has not been many times when things have been passed in around here.”
Domain’s chief of research and economics Dr Nicola Powell said most of the suburbs with high clearance rates were established, family-oriented areas in the middle to outer north-west corridor, offering an accessible price point.
“These areas would be popular with first home buyers, upgraders from neighbouring suburbs or families trying to get into a detached house,” she said. “When you’ve got a high clearance rate, it is telling us that there is high levels of demand relative to a tight supply that is there.”
While there are not enough home sales in Yallambie for Domain to calculate a median price (it is also one of the most tightly held suburbs in Melbourne) Powell said Chelsea Heights was a good example of the kinds of suburbs with high auction success rates.
“The median at Chelsea Heights is $980,000 – this is kind of a prime [price point], particularly in Melbourne,” she said.
“When you think about some of these suburbs, like Chelsea Heights, Caulfield East, Gladstone Park, Aspendale Gardens etc, they are all lifestyle-orientated, school zone-driven areas with infrastructure and connectivity.”
Ray White chief economist Nerida Conisbee said the mid-range pricing of the suburbs was consistent with what she was seeing in Melbourne more broadly.
“The top end of Melbourne is still fairly flat, not really seeing much price growth there,” she said. “Where we are seeing price growth is more at the cheaper end.”
Conisbee added that while Yallambie was a difficult suburb to characterise – “it does have a mix of homes, some beautiful big properties but some diversity in pricing” – it broadly fit in with the other suburbs, which have homes that fit into the 5% Deposit Scheme cap.
“This may also be a factor driving higher clearance rates,” she said.
Bawden’s selling agent, Nathan Arrowsmith of Buxton Real Estate Dingley Village, said the area’s schools were a drawcard, as well as its easy transport links to Brighton and the Mornington Peninsula.
“It is just a great community and a big attraction for first home buyers and also families, which is a big chunk of the market,” he said.
He said some potential buyers arrive in the area for its value for money after realising the nearby Cheltenham market is “quite heated”.
“They see value by rolling into the neighbouring suburb which is Dingley Village,” he said.
In Yallambie, there are also interested buyers who have expanded their search from better-known nearby suburbs such as Viewbank, Jellis Craig North East’s Daniel Cobern said.
“Obviously I think it is a great suburb. It has strong clearance rates for good reasons. It is pretty tightly kept,” he said.
“You do get a bit of overflow from larger suburbs around the area … that trickles into Yallambie.”
He thought the neighbourhood had become better known over the past few years, as it will benefit from the North East Link tunnels under construction.
“A lot of buyers would not have even known where it was even if they were looking in Greensborough and Montmorency,” he said.
“It is a great area now but it is going to be even better in a few years to come.”

Thinking of selling in Sydney this year? Why your postcode could make all the difference

Thinking of selling in Sydney this year? Why your postcode could make all the difference
By Robyn Willis
For Danielle Dalvi, buying a house in Marrickville is a dream come true.
“We used to come to Marrickville to do op shopping and visit the Vietnamese restaurants but I thought it was a bit out of reach,” Dalvi said. “We had been looking for six months. I was getting a bit overwhelmed.”
She and her partner, Khalil, were keen to move on from the one-bedroom apartment in Eveleigh they shared with their baby. And their eyes were firmly fixed on the popular inner west suburb.
In January 2025, the couple secured an unrenovated, single-storey three-bedroom cottage in the heart of Marrickville.
“This is our forever home,” Dalvi said. “I really like being close to the main shopping strip – there’s a dentist, doctor’s and places to eat but Marrickville Library is unbelievable. We have a two-year-old so it’s a great place to spend time. The community here has been wonderful.”
Marrickville recorded one of the highest auction clearance rates for suburbs in Sydney in 2025, comparable to properties sold, with 298 reported auctions resulting in an 81.9 per cent success rate, according to data from Domain.
Some suburbs of Sydney experienced an even higher clearance rate, as much as 100 per cent in Airds where just 20 properties were auctioned in 2025. In North Strathfield, the clearance rate was 93.9 per cent based on 33 reported auctions.
Nicola Powell, chief of research and economics for Domain, said three cuts to the cash rate in 2025 were reflected in greater buyer confidence with stronger bidding and more activity at auctions.
“As the cash rate reduced we saw the positive influence on the market and buyers,” Powell said.
While the year ended quietly, with a Sydney clearance rate of 56.6 per cent in December, Powell said it bounced back to 77 per cent last month.
“We tend to find clearance rates bounce earlier in the year which is reflective of lower volumes of stock,” she said. “We are likely to see clearance rates soften this year but I am expecting them then to firm. So I would not expect to see them in the 50s but they could be finding the floor in the low 60s.”
She said the reasons some areas had higher clearance rates than others were not universal.
“[For suburbs] like Airds and Bangor [it] would be about affordability, appealing to first home buyers and upgraded families looking for larger land sizes versus inner city unit alternatives,” she said. “Sales volumes aren’t huge in many cases, so a strong run of successful auctions can lift the clearance rate quickly.”
Buyer’s agent Penny Vandenhurk, who helped the Dalvis buy their home last year, said the high clearance rate reflected the popularity of the area, which has been further boosted by promised infrastructure, with construction of Marrickville metro station under way.
She said the style of housing in Marrickville also meant sellers tended to be well informed about the market.
“There are a lot of comparable sales and a lot of scrutiny about under quoting,” Vandenhurk said. “There are not as many unique properties [in Marrickville] so if your neighbour sold an unrenovated house for $2.5 million and you’ve renovated, you might reasonably expect $2.7 million.”
Nearby Newtown reported even higher auction clearance rates in 2025, with 82.6 per cent of properties going to auction resulting in a sale. That outcome is based on 235 reported auctions.
Property partner at The Agency Inner West, David Barndon, recently sold a property in Newtown just two weeks after it hit the market. While buyer demand was consistent, he said it was important to set a realistic price.
“It’s about supply and demand pressures. You see property sitting there if you don’t price them right.”
Buyer’s agent Bianca Field said the promise of a Metro station for Marrickville meant buyers who might have opted for Newtown are looking further west.
“Marrickville is becoming an extension of Newtown,” Field said. “Interest in Newtown is fairly consistent due to things like lifestyle, connectivity to the city is exceptional and a lot of people are employed around the university and the hospital so you can get good investor return.”
At the other end of the scale, Greenhills Beach near Cronulla experienced a 25 per cent clearance rate in 2025, one of the lowest recorded in Sydney.
Sales agent at Pulse Property Agents, Luke Lombardi, said while Greenhills Beach was a “niche” market, much of The Shire was experiencing limited interest in properties more than $2.5 million.
“We’re not worried by that auction clearance rate,” he said. “It’s an awesome area to live and reside in. You cannot develop much in the area so you have that peace and quiet. You can wake up in the morning and smell the salt from Elouera Beach.”

An alleged child rapist was arrested. Your DNA might have helped
Robert Wayne Kwan’s thumbs, forced together by handcuffs, twiddled in fits as detectives marched him down the long curve of a grassy driveway towards waiting police cars in South Kempsey, north of Port Macquarie, on Wednesday.
The alleged child rapist, 77, has been charged over a raft of historical sex crimes spanning more than a decade, from the targeting of an 11-year-old girl in Sydney’s west in 1991 to the sexual assault of a 26-year-old woman at Devil’s Hole Reserve near Dubbo in 2002.
His arrest is the latest chapter in the story of a technology that has jailed fabled serial killers, set those wrongfully convicted of murder free and granted anonymous bones the dignity of personhood.
The investigative tool, called Forensic Investigative Genetic Genealogy (FIGG), relies on people who have spat in a tube for commercial DNA tests choosing to dismiss privacy concerns and make their data available to investigators.
They become “genetic informants”, helping police build sprawling family trees that lead them to alleged perpetrators such as Kwan. It was the first arrest in NSW made using the technology.
Here’s how it works. Traditional genetic profiling targets sections of human DNA where sequences of the four base letters – A, C, G and T – always repeat. Everyone, for example, has a repeating sequence of “AGAT” on their third chromosome. However, the number of times that sequence repeats varies between people, acting as a kind of genetic “fingerprint”.
Standard DNA testing focuses on about 20 of these sequences – called short tandem repeats, or STRs – and the pattern of those repeats can match a suspect’s DNA to a drop of blood at a crime scene.
A problem arises, however, when investigators don’t have a reference sample of DNA. Police held DNA samples from Kwan’s alleged crimes, for example, but had nothing to match them to.
That’s where FIGG comes in. Instead of zeroing in on a handful of STRs, the test picks up a different kind of DNA variation called single nucleotide polymorphisms, or SNPs (pronounced “snips”). These are single-letter differences at specific points across our DNA – where you might have an A, someone else has a G – and we can detect over a million of them using specialised sequencing technology.
The key advantage for detectives is that this DNA map of more than a million SNPs is sensitive enough to identify someone’s very distant relatives – their third or fourth cousins, for example. (Think about that – do you even know who your fourth cousins are?) Finding family can help tie anonymous DNA to an actual person.
To do that, investigators match the DNA profile of a perpetrator or victim to distant relatives using online genealogy databases, made up of people who have used commercial ancestry tests and consented to law enforcement using their data. The databases have about 1 million to 2 million genetic profiles. That’s exponentially larger than DNA databases owned by law enforcement.
Once police find a relative, they turn to investigative genealogy – part genetic analysis, part family history sleuthing – to build a family tree linking the owner of the DNA and their distant relatives in the database.
Experts trawl back through the generations to find the last direct ancestors shared by the person of interest and their identified relatives, narrowing the search to a specific branch of the family tree. The process might take days or, in some cases, years. It’s how detectives can now find the owner of an unknown bone or semen sample.
This is how FIGG caught Kwan. An SNP profile was made using DNA gathered after his alleged crimes more than two decades ago. That profile matched a relative in the genealogy databases. Then police used what they knew about Kwan’s sex, age and location to prune the branches of the family tree until he was the only person left as a suspect.
This process famously busted the Golden State Killer, unveiling the serial murderer in 2018 as former California police officer Joseph James DeAngelo Jr. As put by human identification specialist Dr Jodie Ward, FIGG turns decades-old cases from cold to solvable.
FIGG has solved cold cases and tragic mysteries across Australia too.
Take the example of the “woman in the wall”. Her decade-old remains were discovered in 2022 by cleaners behind a wall in a Brisbane unit complex. She left a glass eye, prescription glasses, and size 10 clothes. But there was no DNA match in the police database and no linked missing persons report.
Using FIGG, police and forensic experts, including Ward, identified the remains as those of 38-year-old woman Tanya Glover. A woman was arrested over Glover’s death last year.
“What price can you put on restoring someone’s identity?” Ward, a DNA forensics expert, said. “You are providing answers to families, you are providing the deceased with a dignified burial, you are keeping the community safe because criminal investigations can ensue.
“At the moment, DNA testing is only offered by law enforcement or government forensic labs in Australia and not everyone can access those technologies, unfortunately.”
The process is expensive – about $10,000 compared to routine DNA testing, which might cost $100, she said. That’s why, in 2024, Ward founded the Forensic Human Identification Co., a social enterprise which provides the only independent end-to-end FIGG service in Australia.
Through the enterprise, Ward aims to help families find missing loved ones, exonerate those wrongfully convicted of crimes, advance cases of disappeared First Nations people, and use techniques borrowed from the study of ancient DNA to identify forgotten and degraded remains.
“Our goal is to make sure that it’s not just agencies with deep pockets that can access this technology, because we want to see every unknown deceased person given the opportunity to be identified,” she said.
Following Kwan’s arrest, police have called for people to consider uploading their DNA profiles to databases investigators can use for FIGG, including GEDmatch PRO and FamilyTreeDNA.
People can choose to upload their genetic information to those databases after using a commercial service like 23andMe or AncestryDNA, which police cannot generally access. About 5-10 per cent of the profiles on the databases are believed to be Australian.
There were privacy issues when FIGG first came to prominence. Some genealogy services automatically opted users in to have their data used by police. A lack of transparency meant some of the “genetic informants” used to catch the Golden State Killer did so unwittingly – they uploaded data to track down relatives and ended up identifying a murderer. Since then, most databases have switched to a more transparent opt-in system, although in Germany, FIGG remains largely banned due to privacy concerns.
Any DNA data uploaded to GEDmatch PRO is opted in to identify human remains, but users must opt in manually for their data to be used to find the perpetrators of violent crimes.
“FIGG is only used for homicides, sexual assaults or unidentified human remains,” Detective Superintendent Jayne Doherty, Sex Crimes Squad Commander at NSW Police, said after Kwan’s arrest.
“People thinking about opting in – you could be helping us to solve those serious problems.”

The world knows how they died. Their families share how they lived
These are the stories of the 15 people killed at Bondi Beach, in the words of those who knew them best and loved them most.
The singer who couldn’t resist a microphone. The mother with Bond girl good looks. The father who woke at dawn to ride alongside his paperboy son. A lolly man, an ideas man, a Holocaust survivor, and a big sister who daydreamed of capybaras.
These are the 15 innocent people killed by two gunmen in a terror attack at Bondi Beach that terrible day, December 14, 2025. Their deaths are known to the world, but their lives are worth remembering.
Their loved ones are the custodians of their memories. Here we have compiled interviews, testimonials, eulogies, family photos, and tenderly crafted words that these memory-keepers were willing to share.
Boris Tetleroyd
Anyone who met Boris Tetleroyd heard him sing. With a tremendous voice and skilled at playing the guitar and piano, he captivated friends, family, and colleagues with renditions of The Beatles and Russian songs from his youth.
“He was just fearless. He didn’t have any kind of stigma, any kind of inhibition. He would just go up and perform,” son Ya’akov remembers.
Niece Jenny Roytur said whenever the family went out and there was a band playing, Boris would find a way to get involved.
“If there was a microphone available … he would grab it,” she said.
Music was how he met his wife, Svetlana. He regularly played at the restaurant where she worked in their home town, now Tashkent, Uzbekistan.
They had three sons – Ya’akov, Roman and Michael – before fleeing the crumbling Soviet Union in 1989, travelling through Italy before landing in Australia and settling in Sydney’s eastern suburbs.
Boris worked as a draftsman for Transport for NSW for 30 years. He had planned to retire by the end of the year.
He loved living on the coast and would walk from Bronte to Maroubra regularly. Surviving colon cancer in the early 2000s “ignited” Boris’ wellness journey, and he began attending yoga retreats and discovered meditation.
He was also detail-oriented, which he attributed to his time in the USSR military. He would tell stories of navigating the Black Sea, peeling thousands of potatoes, and mentoring his shipmates through rough waters.
“His time in the army really served him well throughout his life. He was a very disciplined man,” Ya’akov says.
He was diligent. Boris archived more than 100 years of family history, and stored records and photos to bring out at family gatherings. He loved adding to the cache, snapping photos at family events.
Faith was a big part of his life. His sons were circumcised in secret under Soviet rule, and Boris underwent the procedure aged 60 in Australia.
“He was a very holy man, and he had a lot of wisdom … people just went to him with questions, and he would listen. He was one of the best listeners I know,” Ya’akov says.
“My father died celebrating his Judaism. He came there to celebrate light and happiness. And so my father died the way he lived, with light and happiness.”
Rabbi Eli Schlanger
Two hours before he was killed, Rabbi Eli Schlanger was leaning over the gate in front of his sister’s pool, confiding in his brother-in-law, Rabbi Mendel Kastel.
While the kids swam and nagged for jam doughnuts, Eli was wrestling with his future: The 41-year-old was reckoning with letting go of control of an event he had nurtured for almost two decades, Chanukah by the Sea.
“He was very involved. But this was the first year where he wasn’t running around schlepping chairs and dragging stuff an hour before,” says his sister, Tzippy Kastel.
Instead, Eli was by the pool in the Kastel home near Bondi, as he was most Sundays, with one of his five children hanging off him, playing pranks and imitating family members.
The Kastels remember their last moments with Eli because they were recorded: the final sun-drenched glimpses from four decades spent together, captured forever by the home security cameras necessary for a Jewish family to live safely in Bondi.
“He had a lot of chutzpah. He was cheeky. He had no filter,” Kastel says. “He lived on Bondi Beach, for God’s sake, he was running around there with a beard, dressed in black and white, and everyone else is wearing whatever, he didn’t care, he would rock it with confidence.”
Eli, the little boy with a lisp, became a peacemaker within his family and a counsellor to hardened criminals in the prison system. He was “like a cushion”, Kastel says.
When Eli was still in primary school, the family of 11 moved from London to New York. After studying in France, he joined his family in Sydney, where he not only ran the festival at which he was killed, but also helped build the Chabad centre where his funeral was held.
“He was obsessed with that building. He chose the Jerusalem stone, the materials, and the fabric,” she says. “Everything was personal to him.”
He was a devout religious scholar of the Torah and a Zionist. He hosted barbecues for Israeli soldiers near the border with Gaza and toured controversial Israeli settlements in the West Bank, as the conflict in the Middle East reverberated around the world.
When Anthony Albanese recognised Palestine as a state last year, he wrote to the prime minister urging him to “rescind this act of betrayal”.
“He just absolutely loves Israel,” Kastel says. “When you go there, your soul’s on fire. He had that passion for that reason.”
Two months on from his death, there is still passion in the family, but there is also grief. It’s in security footage at the Kastel home, the family photos, the last $5 note from a Hanukkah raffle that he let Kastel’s son keep. It’s in the streets of Bondi and in the synagogue.
Every time family members go to the kosher shop or Jewish school, they are confronted by others who have lost someone who was once an indispensable part of their lives.
“We’re just feeling a gaping hole,” Kastel says.
Rabbi Yaakov Levitan
Eli Schlanger was an ideas man; Rabbi Yaakov Levitan got them done.
Their wives were close, very close. They had been best friends since high school. Eli and Yaakov would form their own formidable partnership, becoming the driving force behind not only the Chabad of Bondi but also the Chanukah by the Sea festival, where they were both gunned down.
“How do we make any sense of it?” says his brother-in-law, Rabbi Mordechai Guth.
“What was he doing at the moment his soul left his body? He was involved in an event designed to strengthen, inspire, and bring people together.
“Specifically, he was a man with a hot dog stand. Not because he made hot dogs, but because somebody had to man the hot dog stand. And to be involved with something so pure and so special, at the moment that, as providence would have it, turned out to be his last moments, that actually gives a little bit of comfort.”
Guth says Yaakov was a person who brought out others’ potential, and made it real in the name of “making the world more luminous in the spirit of Hanukkah”.
His role in the community spanned everything from running the synagogue and organising trips to Israel, to checking torah scrolls and making funeral arrangements.
When a dozen of their own were massacred on Bondi Beach, Yaakov would have been the person the community turned to for the painful logistics. Instead, the 39-year-old father of four was being buried himself.
“If you go to the Chabad at Bondi today, six weeks after the event, there are certain things that nobody really knows how they work because he was the one who would maintain them,” Guth says.
Yaakov’s small acts of kindness, known as a mitzvah in the Jewish tradition, extended beyond the Chabad. They ranged from helping neighbours rewire their internet cables buried underground to establishing tapNgive, a company that provided tap-and-pay donation kiosks for fundraising.
“The greatest reward for him was that something got done, not that he received recognition,” friend Avremi Joseph told the Chabad. “He was the spine of all Jewish organisations in Sydney.”
Marika Pogany
Roman Benuska speaks tenderly of his mother’s divine red fingernails.
“She was always beautifully manicured from the day I can remember,” he says.
Benuska holds up his phone displaying his favourite photograph of his mother, taken decades earlier. His friends were on the money when they described her as a Bond girl. Marika is breathtakingly beautiful as she leans against a brick wall in bright sunlight. Her blonde hair was perfectly coiffed, with half-moon curls over her ears and leopard print trimming around the collar and button-down front of her white outfit.
“I just can’t believe that’s my mum,” he says proudly.
The feeling was mutual. Her son was the greatest achievement of her life.
“I’d say the most common memory I’ve got in my mum is a protector, defender, whenever you fall, whenever you’re hungry, whenever you want a toy,” Benuska says. “She was there at the drop of a hat. That would be my mum.”
Known lovingly as “Omi”, the mother and grandmother came to Australia from Czechoslovakia in 1968 with her son and her own protector, her older brother, Ivan.
Marika became a citizen four years later and embraced her “Aussie” life with pride.
“She always worried about others, especially as she was getting older, more so than herself,” Benuska said in a video played at the Light Will Win commemoration held at Sydney Opera House in January.
Talk to anyone who worked with her in the kitchen or tuckshop, Benuska says. They’d tell you that she was very bossy.
“She used to get the mums, sort of boss them around.”
She loved working with Meals on Wheels and Sydney COA, a volunteer service for Jewish seniors.
“Twice a week, she was off driving around … making meals for those who needed them,” Benuska told mourners at Marika’s funeral at the St Joseph’s College Chapel in Hunters Hill.
“She was welcoming. She would take you in and have a chat. That person you know is always there. Now I look back, that is the part you miss.”
Friend Susie Berger described Marika, 82, as happy to help anybody without being asked.
“I spoke to her on the Saturday before that terrible Sunday,” Berger recalled. “It makes my sorrow so much more bearable to know I told her 24 hours before her death that I loved her.”
Describe a social butterfly, and like the kaleidoscopic patterns of a butterfly’s wings, the refracted hues of Marika’s identity (Australian, Hungarian, Slovenian, Jewish, Catholic, non-religious) drew all manner of people to her.
“It didn’t matter who you were. She would welcome you into her circle,” Berger says.
“She would never just have coffee with one or two friends. You would arrive and find that she would have invited 10 or 15 more.
“Now we have to find a new boss.”
Reuven Morrison
To his three grandchildren, his name was “Zaida”. To them, he was everything.
When they won awards at school, he was the first person they would call. He let his twin granddaughters wrap him in bandages when playing doctor. They told their mother they liked to go shopping with him, “because Zaida had no budget”.
“He would move heaven and Earth to get them what they wanted,” daughter Sheina Gutnick says. “But at the same [time] … he gave them so much of their heritage and their identity.”
Reuven Morrison, born in 1963 in the former Soviet Union, knew the cost of that identity. At school, he was singled out by classmates as a “dirty Jew”. Teachers stamped his school reports with marks branding him Jewish. His family shared an apartment overlooking the schoolyard and, when Reuven’s mother saw him in a scuffle with other children, she came down and beat them with a rolling pin.
Seeking safety, Reuven emigrated with his parents to Australia. He was 14. On a visit to Bondi Beach, he met another young Jewish refugee from the Soviet Union. Her name was Leah. They were wearing the same Levi’s jeans. The teenage Reuven playfully suggested that, one day, “that ass is gonna be mine”. They were married two years later.
With Leah by his side, Reuven built an empire from the ground up. He started as a 14-year-old locksmith’s apprentice, then sold cigarettes at Kings Cross. He ran a potato processing plant in Queensland, an apple orchard, a printing and fax business, and then a petrol station. Slowly, he built a sprawling development empire across Sydney.
Reuven and Leah were blessed with one daughter, Sheina, “born after many years of praying and waiting”, friend Chanie Hebel says. Sheina was the centre of his universe, and “Papa Morrison” to her friends. The family moved to Melbourne in 2006, but Reuven commuted to Sydney for work and stayed close to the city’s Russian Jewish community. He was part of a group of philanthropists who built and donated the $30 million Chabad synagogue in Bondi, which opened in 2024. “His other baby,” Sheina calls it.
Sheina grew up, got married, and moved into the house across the street. When the twins were born, Reuven gave the couple a walkie-talkie to call them during the night.
“I have this image of him and Mum on the couch at like 2am, each with a baby in their hand, giving them a bottle,” Sheina says.
Reuven’s upbringing under Soviet rule gave him a relentless work ethic and moral compass. The 62-year-old worked between Sydney and Melbourne. Sometimes, he was gone for weeks at a time. His grandchildren reminded him it was worth it.
“Having the kids walk in the door after school and jump into his arms just meant the world to him,” Sheina says. “They meant the whole world. They were [his] continuation. They were the light.”
Adam Smyth
The two oldest children of 50-year-old Adam Smyth, Harry and Matilda, shared these words about their Dad.
“We are not able to speak at this time because of grief, but we would like to share these words in writing. They can be printed exactly as written:
“Adam was a devoted father. He was proud of us, his children – Harry (27), Matilda (21), Angus (17) and Olivia – and of who we were becoming. He showed up – coaching junior sport, helping at schools, at clubs, at charities – not because he wanted praise, but because he believed that being part of a community meant carrying some of the weight.
“Dad was hardworking. One of our earliest memories of this was when Harry got his first job at 11 years old, delivering newspapers. It meant 5am starts, riding a heavy bike loaded with newspapers – more than a young kid could easily handle. Dad woke him up every morning and rode alongside him the whole way. He didn’t just tell him he could do hard things – he showed him.
“Dad valued effort, movement, and showing up – especially in sport. He ran multiple marathons, Oxfam Trail 100km events, triathlons, played junior soccer for Avalon, senior soccer at college, and later for Old Melburnians in Melbourne. He loved his teams – Liverpool and the Sydney Swans – and followed them with loyalty. But more than any of that, there was nothing better for him than watching us play our sports. On sidelines, in cold mornings and hot afternoons, he was there either as coach, team manager or cheerleader.
“In Dad’s passing, we hope that his life was not lived in vain – that from this horror we take away a true desire to be more compassionate, more aware of our community, and more willing to stand with one another. Not only the grieving, but all Australians.
“We hope we become more grateful for the freedoms we have, and more respectful toward those of every faith, colour, and creed. For our generation – and for the children who come after us – we must build this culture.
“If this is read in 10 years, we want people to know this: Adam’s life mattered. It should be remembered for what he gave, not how he died.
“Adam believed in helping. He believed in showing up. He believed in community.
“His life will not have been lived in vain if we choose to become more compassionate, more aware, and more respectful of each other – not just in grief, but always.”
Tibor Weitzen
Tibor Weitzen was fond of saying, “Life is too short, eat ice-cream”. And so he did. Every evening, wife Eva Weitzen says.
She has plenty of ice-cream in the home she shared with her devoted husband of 56 years.
Eva never doubted his love for her: “For him, I was something very special”.
Tibor, 78, was born in 1947 in the Soviet Union and migrated to Israel, then to Australia in the late 1980s.
He was the proud father of two, with 11 grandchildren and great-grandchildren.
“He was [an] absolutely crazy grandfather,” Eva says of his doting ways.
“Family was everything to him,” daughter Hanna Abesidon said in the commemoration video. “He was a selfless person. Everybody [else] came first.”
For 18 years, Tibor ran a weekly club called Friends of Refugees of Eastern Europe (FREE), which brought elderly Russian-speaking members of the Jewish community together to foster a sense of belonging.
In 2015, he was honoured with an award for his commitment and volunteering at a Chabad Bondi Gala dinner.
Grandson-in-law Mendy Amzalak says Tibor brought joy to everyone he met, especially the children at the Bondi Shul.
“In every Shul, there’s someone called the ‘lolly man’ whose job is to keep the kids quiet by giving them lollies so as not to disrupt the sermons,” Amzalak says. “In the Bondi Shul, that was Tibor.”
Tibor would be remembered for the light he brought to others.
“My wife’s pregnant and to think my second child won’t meet their grandfather is heartbreaking,” Amzalak says.
“He was a very warm person,” Abesidon says. “Don’t judge anybody. Give everybody the benefit of the doubt. He didn’t want anybody to be harmed; he didn’t want anybody to suffer. And I think these days, with what we’re going through. I think he would say: stop it.”
Matilda Bee Britvan
When Michael and Valentyna Britvan named their firstborn Matilda, they chose a middle name that captured her spirit: Bee. She was as bright and busy as her namesake, bringing sweetness and joy wherever she went.
Her first toy was a bumblebee, and for special events, she could often be found in her favourite yellow dress with zebra patterns.
The 10-year-old had wavy brown hair, her face framed by a fringe, and bright blue eyes. She wore a gold necklace bearing her name and loved the colour purple.
Her parents, who moved separately from Ukraine to Australia before settling in Sydney’s east, remembered her at an emotional memorial at the Sydney Opera House. “[The sisters] love to sing, they love to dance,” Michael said. “She was very, very peaceful and kind.”
Matilda was a devoted older sister. Her sibling shared memories of the pair racing scooters and playing games in the park. That adventurous streak defined Matilda; she was an active child who spent her time rollerblading, practising acrobatics, and training in judo. She loved to travel.
Matilda had started a diary “talking about ‘my crush’ and pages about capybaras”, Michael says. “It was all happy stuff.”
At La Perouse Public School, Matilda was so beloved by her classmates that they gave her an Indigenous nickname: “wuri wuri”, meaning the little ray of sunshine. Her favourite subject was maths.
It was a sentiment echoed by Valentyna, who remembered her daughter as the light of their lives.
“Her smile was bringing the light. She lights up everyone who walks past and she was bringing the light in this world. No one seen her with no smile on her face.”
Alex Kleytman
Alex Kleytman gave his family a new life when he uprooted them and left his home of 54 years in the former Soviet Union.
“It was a gift to our family,” daughter Sabina says. “My dad fell in love with Australia. You couldn’t say anything bad about it.”
Alex, 87, survived the Holocaust and a Siberian work camp during World War II. In the former USSR, the family were deemed refuseniks – the word for the Russian Jews who were prevented from migrating to Israel and spied on.
Larisa, Alex’s wife, was forced out of a teaching job. “She was no longer ideologically approved,” Sabina says.
Just as the family thought life was improving after the collapse of the USSR, a death threat prompted them to leave Lviv.
“Dad applied to migrate to Australia the next week. He was so proud to be able to bring us here,” Sabina recalls.
His family – his wife, two children and 11 grandchildren – want Alex to be remembered as more than the oldest person to die. He died a hero, trying to save Larisa, his wife of 57 years.
Alex was an engineer known for ingenious solutions, a daredevil, a near-daily swimmer, a champion table tennis player, a ballroom dancer, a teller of bad dad jokes and an author. He loved to travel, and the family’s favourite place was Katoomba in the Blue Mountains. After he was killed, Sabina and Larisa returned there for three days.
As a small child, Sabina remembers asking her father the questions she is asking herself now: “Why am I here? What does life mean?”
Her father would answer seriously. Nearly 50 years later, she doesn’t remember his answers.
Later, she asked: “Dad, are we Jewish?”
This answer she remembers. “He told me to be proud of being a Jew. It has stuck with me for the rest of my life. Being Jewish at the Hanukkah family event was what killed him.”
Life in Australia brought peace and joy. In the past decade, Alex researched and wrote two books, interviewing survivors of the Holocaust and others on the impact of antisemitism. He wanted to record it and prevent it.
When antisemitism increased in Australia, Alex was distressed.
“It was like he was travelling back in time,” Sabina says. “We came here to be safe. And my mum saw my dad bleed to death at Bondi Beach.”
Tania Tretiak
Tania and Pavel Tretiak moved to Bondi Beach the day they migrated from Tashkent, Uzbekistan, with their two children, Dennis and Julia, in 1992. The couple bought a home in Randwick six years later, but returned most weeks to stroll by the sea.
“They loved Bondi Beach. Isn’t it [ironic], my mum started her life here in Bondi, and her life ended at Bondi Beach,” Dennis Tretiak says of his mother’s death.
Tania, 68, was born in Chechnya, Russia, and moved to Tashkent as a child. She trained as a nurse and met her husband of nearly 50 years, Pavel, a tram driver, on her way to work. They were in their mid-30s when the family moved to Sydney.
“They were very brave to leave everything – their friends, everything they built,” Dennis says.
“It’s a big change, they had to start from scratch – new jobs, new friends, new culture. But they did very well here. They never regretted one day that they had left. They knew what they were going for. They wanted to build a better life, and they knew it would be a better future for us.”
Dennis says his parents were devoted to each other. The couple was together at the fateful Hanukkah event with their granddaughter, Amelia, 4.
“She really loved my dad. They were always together. I don’t remember one day when they were apart. My sister says they were joined by the hip. She adored him.”
Pavel, 70, sustained head injuries and remains in hospital. “She would not be able to live through what he’s going through now, she wouldn’t be able to take it,” Dennis says.
Pavel was Jewish; Tania was not. But she embraced Jewish traditions and celebrations. The couple had enjoyed taking their grandchildren to the Chanukah by the Sea event each year.
“It wasn’t the religion so much, it was more about family and the community. It was all the people they knew who came here at the same time in the ’90s. Mum really enjoyed it all.”
Dennis said his mother had filmed a video, which they found on her phone, of her granddaughter getting her face painted during the festivities that afternoon.
“Mum asked if it was a princess, and Amelia said: ‘Baba … this is a unicorn’. She was so serious about it,” he smiles at his young niece’s comment to her grandmother.
“It must have been just a few minutes before the shooting started.”
Tania and Pavel worked full-time providing community transport for people who were elderly or had a disability. Dennis says his mother loved entertaining and “cooking up a storm”, particularly traditional Uzbek cuisine such as plov (pilaf). She adored Dennis and his wife Tammy’s children, Gabriel, 16, and Liana, 9, and Julia’s daughter Amelia.
Tammy says her mother-in-law was always busy and loved going to events. The couple travelled to Korea last year and went on cruises; they often visited Tashkent. “They were very active and healthy people. They were travelling a lot and enjoying life, and their grandkids.”
Edith Brutman
Edith Brutman was a principled, gracious, caring and passionate woman devoted to her family, community and tackling discrimination, say those who knew and loved her.
Her family was adamant their “beloved Edith” should be remembered as “a woman of integrity who chose humanity, every day”.
“She met prejudice with principle, and division with service,” they said in a statement.
“Our family mourns her deeply, but we ask that her life, not the senseless violence that took it, be what endures. We hope her memory calls us as a nation back to decency, courage, and peace.”
Edith was a member of the NSW branch of B’nai B’rith, an international Jewish organisation that aims to combat antisemitism and discrimination, and provides humanitarian aid.
She was “a gracious woman and a devoted member” of the NSW chapter, the group said after the shooting. B’nai B’rith International said in a tribute:
“Edith was a cherished leader in the community and a devoted member of B’nai B’rith NSW, where she led the organisation’s anti-prejudice and anti-discrimination committee – work that now carries an even more painful and profound significance.”
Ernie Friedlander, the president of the organisation’s Alfred Dreyfus Unit, worked closely with Edith and described her as a “good, caring human being”.
“She was a very clever lady, and she was very, very passionate about dealing with prejudice and discrimination. She was always there, and she had very strong opinions.”
Rabbi Yehoram Ulman knew Edith for nearly two decades. It was “truly difficult for me to imagine she isn’t here”, he said at her funeral at All Souls Chapel at Rookwood Cemetery on December 19.
“Edith wasn’t just a part of our lives, she was a very, very vocal part of our lives. But her love, her loyalty, her devotion, was really unique in every way.
“Edith was a person who did everything in a very full way. She wanted to be charitable in every way.”
Dan Elkayam
French national Dan Elkayam, 27, played his beloved football in much the same way he approached his life off the field: with lightning speed, an insatiable sense of adventure, and a ready smile.
His partner, Krystal Troyano, whom Dan met at a Sydney hostel soon after arriving in Australia in 2022, said his outlook made her feel the pair’s time together would never run out.
“You made me think we were infinite. Death? Not a word for us. We only knew how it [was] to be alive, and very, very fully alive,” Troyano said at his funeral at Ashdod Cemetery in Israel on December 25.
“With you, [no] day was like the other. I dare to say that we were immortals, and that we are forever … Even living so much, your bucket list only grew and grew and grew.
“You were thirsty for living, and you were running for life like you were hungry for it. You lived intensely, but in fast and slow motion at the same time. I love you so much. More than I can say. Thank you for the adventure. Now, go live your next one.”
Dan was an IT engineer at NBC Universal, a travel enthusiast, and a passionate footballer who played for Rockdale Ilinden FC’s Premier League side. His family said he had played at the 2022 Maccabiah Games and for various teams in France and Australia, including Waverley. He was in the process of signing with Dolls Point before he died.
He was born and raised in Le Bourget in Paris, where his parents, brothers, nieces and nephews still reside. In a statement after his death, his family said Dan “loved life – fully and intensely”.
“He travelled the world and was known for his gentle, kind, fun and loving nature, making friends wherever he went. Alongside football, he had a deep connection with nature. He was a certified scuba diver and an explorer at heart, always eager to discover new places, cultures and experiences.
“Dan brought light wherever he went and inspired countless people through the way he lived. His smile could light up any room. He was pure joy – a beautiful and humble soul.
“To say that Dan will be missed is not enough. He was a person who truly wanted to do good in the world, to share his love of life and his sense of adventure with everyone around him.”
His close friend, Jesse Singer, recalled how Dan spent his final hours doing what he loved: playing football in the sun by Bondi Beach with his friends, and celebrating his Jewish faith. “People meeting [Dan] for the first time would say he’s shy but happy, always smiling,” Jesse says.
“When all this happened, my wife and I spoke, and we just said we have to live life to the fullest. That’s what we have to do because that’s what Dan did.”
Boris and Sofia Gurman
The public knows Boris, 69, and Sofia, 61, as two of the bravest heroes at Bondi Beach, having confronted one of the attackers, only to be killed for their courage.
To Alex Gurman, they are the parents he would choose a million times over.
“Every good characteristic that I embody now I owe entirely to them,” he says.
“I would choose the same upbringing, the same parents, the same value set. Nothing would change because, candidly, I think I’d hit the jackpot.”
Boris was roughly his son’s age when he fled Ukraine with Sofia and Alex.
“They kind of took the ultimate risk moving to a foreign country, no money, no language, with a child and no idea how they were going to make it work, but their values and principles guaranteed success,” he says in his parents’ commemoration video.
“Their view of what having a fulfilling life would look like is to just have a positive impact on those around you.”
Family was the core of everything they did. They had planned to celebrate Sofia’s birthday the day after the terror attack. The couple would have celebrated their 35th wedding anniversary in January.
Alex describes his mother as the “go-to person” who always seemed to have the most sensible answer to a problem, even if it took you weeks or months to realise she had been right all along.
“From a young age, Sofia was always the one a little further ahead,” Alex shared in a statement read at his parents’ funeral by Rabbi Yehoram Ulman at the Chevra Kadisha in Woollahra. “The first up the tree, the one you trusted with responsibility, the one others instinctively followed. That instinct followed her through life.”
Sofia would cook recipes from myriad cuisines, from Africa to Asia, but every year, her family looked forward to savouring her traditional Soviet wafer cake.
Boris, a retired mechanic, was a calming presence within the family. He was “very organised, tremendously handy” and loved his garden of lemons, chillies and a banana tree.
“In his younger years, he was something of a troublemaker,” Alex’s statement says. “But over time, that energy matured into a deep sense of responsibility and care for the world around him.
“He loved a chat, and it didn’t matter how well he knew you or [how] fluent the shared language was, Boris always found a way to connect. His English was sometimes broken, but his meaning never was.”
Alex says that even in their final moments, the couple showed the depth of who they were.
Peter Meagher
It is hard to find someone who doesn’t wish they had known “Marzo” once they hear about him.
A former police officer and Randwick Rugby coach, Peter Meagher was fulfilling his dream working as a photographer at Bondi on December 14.
His death was violent and horrific, yet Peter was “none of those things”, says his widow, Virginia Wynne-Markham. “He was an honourable man, thoughtful, generous with his time and energy, and he was a considered human being. That is how he should be remembered. He was compassionate, day in and day out.”
In 34 years with the NSW Police, Peter rose to become a much-decorated detective sergeant, yet he never drew his gun. He would have preferred to police without one. “He didn’t like it,” Virginia says.
The last image she has of Peter is a screengrab of a video of the terror attack showing her late husband – wearing his hat backwards – trying to save someone.
“Peter was right there. I found a video that shows Peter face down, trying to help someone, pretty much in full view of those bins and that bridge. In the next photo, he is on his haunches, moving a fellow into a recovery position.
“There’s red on the white shirt that Peter has his hand on.
“In the next shot, Peter is down.
“And in the video, I can see his leg move. Then he is still.”
A woman called her on Christmas Day to say she had seen Peter being shot. That made her stay down and protect her four-year-old daughter. “I believe your husband saved my life,” she said.
Virginia says, “With his last breath, he was being selfless. He was an unassuming sort of chap, but he was a good egg.”
To encourage players at Randwick Rugby to aim high, Peter stuck photos of those who had worn the club’s myrtle green and later played for the Wallabies to the lockers.
“On Monday, Tuesday, [and] Thursday nights, he’d go to rugby training,” Virginia says. “He’d be there before anybody else to help set up the cones and make sure everything was where it should be. The water bottles were filled. He’d been doing it for so long that it was kind of effortless for him.”
Had Peter survived, he would have turned 62 on January 18. On that day, Virginia fell apart and sobbed. Her body broke from sadness.
Together since 2009, it was the first significant relationship for both. They met on the matchmaking site eHarmony in 2009, and after months of emails and talking, their first date was the Waratahs v the Hurricanes on May 14, 2010, Virginia says, recalling the exact date.
“We were going to be on the life journey together as companions, as best friends, as lovers of the same things.”
Their chocolate Labrador, Vada, brought him joy every day. And when Virginia walks Vada, the loss of Peter hits her, and she has a good cry. “Other times, I think I should have told him more that I loved him, hugged him more. So I hug her instead.”

How digital data is giving airlines the power to sell you the fares they want

How digital data is giving airlines the power to sell you the fares they want
There is a behind-the-scenes tug of war going on between airlines and customers over the vast amounts of data people generate when they search for and purchase tickets.
And whoever best exploits this information in coming years will gain an advantage – even as artificial intelligence begins to rewrite the rules of the game again.
To understand this shift, you have to understand how flight booking systems have mirrored the internet’s growth.
Thirty years ago, during the dotcom era, the emergence of online ticket sales gave an edge to low-cost carriers like JetBlue in the US and Virgin Blue (today’s Virgin Australia). Passengers, empowered to book their own fares and compare prices, disrupted the old business models of travel agents and the airlines themselves.
“Online booking moved the work to the customer,” said UNSW senior aviation lecturer Ian Douglas. Since those bookings required immediate payment, the “practice of the airline holding the reservation pending later ticketing pretty much vanished.”
Today, online habits have spread from desktop computers to phones and social media. The troves of personal and consumer data online are a rich source of marketing information that airlines can layer with insights from loyalty programs to build nuanced profiles of customers.
During the late 1990s, companies like Expedia, Travelocity, and Booking.com (all founded in 1996) allowed savvy and patient consumers to find and book their own tickets, cutting out travel agents. Passengers were incentivised to show up for the flights they purchased and the risk of empty seats for airlines “significantly reduced”, Douglas said.
The boom in low-cost carriers, with passengers in their seats, helped drive up industry average load factors — the number of passenger miles on global flights as a share of available seat miles. They jumped from about 68 per cent in 1998 to about 83 per cent in 2020.
Then, in 1998, Webjet joined the fray, selling cheaper fares directly to consumers, allowing passengers to bypass expensive ticket-selling processes based on the global distribution system (GDS) that underpinned the Amadeus, Sabre and Travelport booking systems that agents relied on.
“[Business] must make the system work for everyone but at the individual level, the lone, savvy consumer only needs to score a win for themselves.”Travel futurist Carolyn Childs
At the time, GDS had “green screen” interfaces (which weren’t always green) with complex text-based codes that were incomprehensible to the average person. “Fare buckets” existed with codes like F or A for full-fare first class. Discounted economy tickets were coded K, L, or Q.
Airlines in the US were among the first to create apps for the iPhone, and they soon established direct business-to-consumer relationships through their own company apps and websites. The website-based online distribution model “really fostered low-cost airlines”, Douglas said. JetBlue in the US launched in 1998 and grew rapidly by offering point-to-point, no-frills flights.
Eventually, consumer behaviour changed for all airlines, including larger, legacy carriers such as Qantas, American, Delta and United. As consumers and the aviation industry embraced the internet more deeply, a tug of war played out in the background: consumers, and then the industry, variously benefited from successive waves of tech innovation.
Eventually, larger legacy carriers used their real-world scale to fight back and gain an advantage. Qantas, for example, started flights on low-cost carrier Jetstar in 2004.
At the dawn of air travel, tickets included things like luggage, meals and seat selection. With online booking, airlines started charging separately for meals, luggage and different seat choices. Customers accepted the change and embraced the control over – and savings on – their purchases.
Since then, the information revolution has, if anything, only intensified for aviation. And the industry must now face the impact of AI.
Former Qantas chief executive Alan Joyce alluded to the challenge in a speech in August: “If airlines don’t own the customer interface in the age of AI, someone else will, and we’ll become just the plumbing behind the platform.”
The launch of Google Flights in 2011 brought the power of the internet closer to ticketing by providing aggregate price comparisons, alongside Skyscanner (dating from 2002) and Kayak (created in 2004).
The next year, the International Air Transport Association introduced the new distribution capability (NDC), a travel data transmission standard designed to supersede the long-standing GDS, which could not handle the amount of personalised detail becoming commonplace on orders.
GDS also held back airlines from bundling together detailed offers — the kind that online travel agencies specialised in.
While the emerging NDC allows airlines to communicate more effectively with travel agents, it has, to the degree it’s been implemented, benefited larger airlines. Corporate Traveller said that more than 95 per cent of its corporate travel customers today use NDC. The uptake elsewhere is less clear.
Travel futurist Carolyn Childs said the significance of NDC in a time of technological disruption was not clear. “I wonder if NDC is going to get overtaken by AI but creates a common language and architecture to let other things operate.”
Accelya, an aviation retail software provider, in January said almost 50 per cent of airline NDC programs failed because they weren’t scaled up or given a dedicated team, among other reasons.
NDC promised airlines greater control over inventory and pricing strategies. NDC shifted the balance of power away from intermediary travel agencies and websites and gave it back to the major airlines. Airlines were no longer blindly issuing tickets to be sold on online travel agents’ websites. They were controlling more of the selling.
Major airlines adopting NDC could then change prices instantly based on current demand, bypassing the limitations of the old fixed-price model.
NDC aimed to transform the way airline products are sold, making the process more like modern online retail.
The current era is defined by AI, which enables automated pricing shifts without human oversight. This has given rise to the concept of offer-order.
In this model, a unique offer (flight, specific class bookings, et cetera) is made to an individual customer, which becomes an order when the customer selects it.
Childs describes offer-order as the “point where consumer need and market’s need really combine”.
Will this prompt worries from travellers about privacy-crushing “surveillance marketing”? Experts like Australian Travel Industry Association chief executive Dean Long are sceptical that the technology will lead to “surveillance” targeting of passengers.
While airlines could identify customer “personas” – such as a “young adventurer” or a “parent travelling during school holidays” – they still struggled to achieve a truly individual marketing experience, he said.
As technology continues to evolve, questions remain on who will benefit most between airlines and passengers.
“There will continue to be this tug of war between the consumer and the airline that won’t go away.” But as we get into the era of AI and large language models, business has the advantage, Childs says.
At the same time, the airlines’ advantage is ripe for disruption by AI. “[Business] must make the system work for everyone but at the individual level, the lone, savvy consumer only needs to score a win for themselves,” he says. And so, the tug of war continues.

The science of sunlight: Why the new Footscray Hospital is built differently

The science of sunlight: Why the new Footscray Hospital is built differently
For 104 days, as he fought for his life in an intensive care unit, Rama El Souki didn’t know if it was night or day.
“It was a pretty dark place,” the father of four said of his lengthy stay at the old Footscray Hospital.
“I kept on asking, ‘What day is it? What is the time?’ I asked my wife to buy me a little digital clock that I put next to my bed.”
El Souki spent a total of six months in the dimly lit hospital in Melbourne’s west in 2024 after suffering a life-threatening bout of pancreatitis, a rare side effect of a popular weight-loss drug he was using. The 53-year-old lost most of his pancreas, his lung collapsed and he experienced kidney failure.
Next Wednesday, that “dark place” will be replaced by the new Footscray Hospital, a $1.5 billion health service on the corner of Ballarat and Geelong roads that harnesses natural light to help patients heal faster.
The design is backed by extensive research showing natural light helps patients establish a healthy circadian rhythm, leading to better sleep and a faster recovery time.
The Age this week toured the intensive care unit, which has sweeping views of the city and western suburbs. Unlike a traditional ICU set-up where the foot of the bed faces inwards, the ward’s 11 beds have been turned 90 degrees so that patients can see outside.
Professor Craig French, the intensive care unit director at Western Health, jokes that one of the rooms will be reserved for keen Bulldogs fans.
“It has a view directly over Whitten Oval,” said French, who treated El Souki during his hospitalisation.
The new hospital will accommodate more than 500 beds, with ICU patients able to be wheeled outdoors while in the comfort of their beds. More than 55,000 plants line the hospital’s balcony and ground level gardens.
A “medical services panel” housed in a glass box extends the ICU’s reach into the outdoors. It allows patients to remain tethered to oxygen and other medical equipment while experiencing natural light and fresh air. There’s also an outdoor button they can press if they need a nurse.
“They will be able to feel the sensation of having a breeze across their face,” French said.
French said intensive care units had traditionally done a poor job of providing a quiet place where patients can sleep.
“This will change that,” he said of the new hospital, which is just over a kilometre away from the old hospital on Gordon Street.
Every bed in the intensive care unit is located in a private, sound-proofed room. At the touch of a button, the windows running along the corridor can be frosted for privacy.
International research has found that hospital patients average only five hours of sleep per night, and fail to reach the seven to nine hours recommended for healthy cognitive and immune function.
This shortfall is often driven by environmental stressors such as noise. An Australian study found that noise levels in shared rooms in hospitals sometimes reached more than 100 decibels, which is comparable to the roar of a lawnmower.
Poor access to natural light has also been identified as an issue in hospitals.
Research has found that patients with beds near a window spend less time in hospital than those near a door. And those with access to high levels of natural light experience less distress. Light has also been found to prevent viral and staph infections and decrease a patient’s heart and pulse rates.
The 12-storey hospital, which was designed by Billard Leece Partnership and COX Architecture during the height of the pandemic, also includes a pandemic pod in the ICU. This pod can be used for patients with infectious diseases and is the only ICU room in Victoria that can be transformed into a completely negatively pressured space.
“It’s an insurance policy,” French said of the design. “It means that in a pandemic we’ll be able to completely separate the critically ill, infectious patients from the non-infectious patients.”
The growing prevalence of obesity in the community has also informed the design. The corridors and doorways have been widened for patients, and there’s a bariatric room with a larger chair and bed, and hoists in the ceiling that can be used to lift patients who weigh up to 500 kilograms.
Health Minister Mary-Anne Thomas said the new Footscray Hospital was one of the largest health investments in Victoria’s history.
“[It] will support families in the west for generations to come,” she said.
Footscray MP Katie Hall has strong family ties to the old red-brick Footscray Hospital. Her great-grandmother was on the hospital’s fundraising committee in the 1950s, and many of her relatives were born and died there.
She said while the old site had done a wonderful job servicing the community, the building was no longer fit for contemporary healthcare.
“To have this new hospital in the heart of Footscray is really important,” Hall said.
El Souki is now in a much better place with his health, and also visited the new hospital this week.
He’s a fan of the new family rooms, where people can be privately briefed by doctors about the condition of their loved ones. Medical scans can be flashed up on large screens in these rooms, to help families understand what is going on.
“It is a good environment for families,” El Souki said. “There are plenty of windows, and it is very spacious.”

Trump brings Epstein island-tarred Cabinet member Lutnick with him on visit to troops
President rewards Commerce Secretary for giving conflicting accounts of his Epstein ties with coveted seat on Air Force One
- Bookmark
- CommentsGo to comments
President Donald Trump on Friday offered a strong show of support for embattled Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick by bringing him along on a visit to special forces troops at Fort Bragg en route to his Palm Beach, Florida home.
The whisk-away on Air Force One comes despite calls for Lutnick to resign over his ties to and misleading comments about his relationship with dead sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.
Trump declined to answer a reporter’s question as he departed the White House on whether he would ask Lutnick to step down or outright fire him after the Cabinet secretary confirmed having made a 2012 visit to Epstein’s infamous private island — seven years after he claimed to have cut ties to the notorious underage sex trafficker.
But a list of the people traveling with Trump to North Carolina and then Florida this weekend shows Lutnick as one of the president’s guests, along with North Carolina Sen. Ted Budd, Reps. Richard Hudson, Brad Knott and David Rouzer, plus first lady Melania Trump and a range of White House staff.
Lutnick has been under sustained fire since Tuesday, when he admitted to the Senate Commerce Committee that he’d made the trip to Epstein’s home on Little Saint James (part of the U.S. Virgin Islands) for lunch with his wife and children 14 years ago.
Documents released by the Department of Justice had revealed how Lutnick had been in contact with Epstein, his onetime nextdoor neighbor in New York, via email to arrange the visit.
The emails contradicted statements Lutnick had made to the New York Post during a podcast appearance in October when he said he’d cut off contact with Epstein — who died in a New York jail cell while awaiting sex trafficking charges in 2019 — after a 2005 encounter that he claimed had left him so unsettled that he’d vowed to “never be in the room with that disgusting person ever again.”
The commerce secretary has long been known to have had ties to Epstein, who was his next-door neighbor in New York at one point, years before he pleaded guilty to prostitution charges in Florida as part of a sweetheart deal with a George W Bush-era prosecutor who later became Trump’s first Secretary of Labor during his first term.
But the documents reviewed by The Independent show that Lutnick not only planned to visit Epstein’s island in 2012 but maintained ties with Epstein as late as 2018 — the year before he was indicted on federal sex trafficking charges and long after he’d spent time in jail for state-level offenses related to his preying on young girls.
Trump’s decision to host Lutnick on board the presidential aircraft — a highly sought-after perk for cabinet members — comes a day after he claimed not to have known about Lutnick’s trip to the pedophile financier’s private getaway but moments later told a reporter he had heard about details of the trip.
Speaking from the Roosevelt Room during an event to announce the repeal of a longstanding climate rule reviled by the fossil fuel industry, Trump was asked if he’d been aware of Lutnick’s travel to Little Saint James and whether he still has confidence in the former bond trading executive.
“No, I wasn’t aware of it ... I actually haven't spoken to him about it ... but from what I hear, he was there with his wife and children,” Trump said, just days after Lutnick was forced to admit he had traveled to the notorious locale.
He added: “I was never there — somebody will someday say that I was never there.”
Trump notably did not answer the second part of the question as to whether he has confidence in Lutnick, a longtime friend who had pushed to become Treasury Secretary after serving as the finance chief for the president’s 2024 campaign.
But White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters on Tuesday that Trump “fully supports” Lutnick and described him as “a very important member of President Trump's team.”

Mandelson asked to testify to US Congress over Epstein links
Former Labour cabinet minister was sacked as US ambassador last year because of his ties to Epstein
- Bookmark
- CommentsGo to comments
Peter Mandelson has been asked to testify to the US Congress over his relationship with the disgraced paedophile financier Jeffrey Epstein.
In a letter, US politicians told the ex-Labour grandee they thought he had “critical information” that would assist their investigation into Epstein.
Two members of the House of Representatives, Suhas Subramanyam and Robert Garcia, have written to Mandelson asking him to answer questions from the House’s oversight committee.
They wrote: “While you no longer serve as British ambassador to the United States and have stepped down from the House of Lords, it is clear that you possessed extensive social and business ties to Jeffrey Epstein and hold critical information pertaining to our investigation of Epstein’s operations.
“Given the appalling allegations regarding Epstein’s conduct, we request that you make yourself available for a transcribed interview with committee staff regarding the crimes of Jeffrey Epstein and his co-conspirators.”
Mandelson has been given until the end of the month to respond.
He has previously said he was “wrong to believe Epstein following his conviction and to continue my association with him afterwards. I apologise unequivocally for doing so to the women and girls who suffered.”
Last week, Sir Keir Starmer said he was sorry for believing Mandelson’s “lies” and for appointing him to the role of Britain’s ambassador to the US.
Following a barrage of criticism from his own MPs, the prime minister also issued a frank apology to the victims of Epstein.
He also admitted that he knew Mandelson had had contact with Epstein before giving him the job, but said: “None of us knew the depths and the darkness of that relationship.”
Mandelson is also being investigated by the Metropolitan Police after the government handed over a dossier of extraordinary emails that suggested the former Labour peer had leaked sensitive government information to Epstein.
Officials are also thought to be reviewing 25 years of records to find evidence linking Mandelson to Epstein. Civil servants are examining correspondence that dates back to his time as Northern Ireland secretary under Tony Blair between 1999 and 2002, as well as when he was business secretary under Gordon Brown nearly a decade later.
Mandelson was sacked in September when details about his relationship with Epstein emerged.
But the most recent release of documents, which indicate that he shared market-sensitive information with the financier in 2009 during the global financial crash, sent shockwaves through Westminster.
The files also suggest that a year later, he tipped Epstein off about an imminent €500bn (£435bn) deal to prop up the European single currency. Payments reportedly totalling $75,000 (£55,000) from Epstein to accounts linked to Mandelson or his partner, Reinaldo Avila da Silva, are also revealed.
Since the scandal erupted, the prime minister has lost his chief of staff, his top civil servant and his director of communications. On Monday, Sir Keir himself also faced calls to resign from the leader of Scottish Labour, as the party tries to move on from the crisis.
A representative for Mandelson has been approached for comment.

Poroshenko urges deployment of NATO troops to Ukraine only way to stop war
Ukrainian MP and leader of the European Solidarity party Petro Poroshenko believes the deployment of NATO troops to Ukraine is the only way to end the Russian-Ukrainian war, the party said on the website on Friday.
"The only way to stop the war is 'boots on the ground' on Ukrainian territory. It is cheaper and more reliable to have NATO troops on Ukrainian soil than NATO troops in Poland," Poroshenko told reporters on the sidelines of Munich Security Conference, which is taking place on February 13-15 and in which he is participating.
He also stressed the importance of preserving transatlantic unity. "If we are divided, we will lose. "We' are NATO, Ukraine, the USA. And then Putin will win. But when we are united, Putin simply has no chance... We have no other way out but to reach an agreement, to stick together is our goal," the politician said.
Poroshenko also stressed that the future of not only Ukraine, but also Europe and global security in general is being decided now. He also warned the West against Vladimir Putin's illusion of appeasement. "This is impossible. I know this for sure, because I have five years of experience in negotiations with Putin. A great success was simply stopping the war by signing a ceasefire agreement, understanding that there can be no peace agreement with Putin, because this is impossible," he said.
According to him, it is impossible to stop the war simply with money or weapons, and without troops on the ground, instead, it is possible to do this using the mechanism of NATO's Article 5. "Day after day, month after month, more and more people understand this, including in the United States. They will not be able to avoid the presence of troops on Ukrainian territory if they want to stop the war," Poroshenko said.

University expels student who called for accountability over Hong Kong fire

A Hong Kong university student who had called for accountability over a deadly fire at an apartment complex in the city has been expelled by the school for disciplinary offences.
Miles Kwan, a politics student, was detained for two nights by the city’s national security police last year for “seditious intent” after handing out flyers calling for an independent investigation into a fire that killed 168 people in November.
After he was released on bail, his school, the Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK), conducted a disciplinary review and referred the case to a student discipline committee.
The committee decided to terminate him from studies on Thursday due to “multiple acts of misconduct”, according to a letter from the university.
CUHK said in a statement on Friday that it would not comment on individual cases, adding that a student who is given three demerits due to disciplinary actions may be terminated from studies.
Kwan, 24, said the university did not penalise him for the arrest in November 2025.
According to Kwan, he received demerits for calling the committee a “kangaroo panel” and a “disgrace”, and for being charged for “criminal damage” in 2023 after he placed stickers on lamp-posts in 2022 to mark the anniversary of the Tiananmen Square crackdown.
Kwan said he had completed his studies and was to graduate in March.
“It is shameful of CUHK to use graduation certificates to suppress its former students,” he said in a statement. “You can take away qualifications, but you can’t take away dignity.”
He was among several people behind a petition issued after the fire that broke out in high-rise towers of Wang Fuk Court housing estate in November, the world’s deadliest residential building fire since 1980.
The petition called for government officials to be held accountable, an independent investigation into possible corruption, proper resettlement for residents, and a review of construction oversight.
The Chinese city’s authorities have formed a judge-led “independent committee” to investigate the fatal blaze.

HUR intercepts another order by Russian commander to kill civilians
According to Ukrinform, the Main Intelligence Directorate of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine stated this on Facebook and released an audio recording.
The radio intercept obtained by HUR specialists documents new evidence of the deliberate destruction of civilians in Ukraine's temporarily occupied territories.
HUR identified the unit that received the criminal order as the Storm detachment, composed of former prisoners, within Russia's 57th Separate Motor Rifle Brigade.
The events took place in the Oleksandrivka sector, near the settlement of Zelenyi Hai in the Donetsk region.
"The intercepts once again confirm the systematic nature of war crimes committed by Russian occupiers against Ukraine's civilian population, with comprehensive support from the Kremlin authorities," HUR emphasized.
As previously reported, HUR intercepted an order from a Russian commander regarding Ukrainian fighters near Huliaipole.

Cardi B brings up Epstein files during online fight with White House
- Rapper Cardi B is engaged in an online dispute with the US Department of Homeland Security (DHS) after she stated she and her fans would confront Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents at her concert.
- During a recent performance, Cardi B told her audience she would use “bear mace” if ICE agents attempted to detain her fans, a clip of which went viral on X.
- DHS responded on X, referencing Cardi B's past admission of drugging and robbing men, stating they would consider it an improvement if she didn't “drug and rob our agents.”
- Cardi B retaliated by invoking the DHS's own scandals, asking why they wouldn't discuss the recently released Epstein files concerning the drugging and rape of underage girls.
- The article also highlights a broader trend of celebrity political engagement, contrasting Cardi B's stance with Nicki Minaj's public support for Donald Trump.

The Independent journalists shortlisted for prestigious Press Awards 2026
The Independent’s health, foreign and travel correspondents in the running for top industry awards

Three of The Independent’s journalists have been shortlisted for this year’s prestigious Press Awards.
The annual ceremony in London recognises the best of British national journalism, with The Independent nominated across four categories in total.
Judged by academics, editors, journalists and other industry figures, the awards – now in their 64th year – remain one of the most significant moments of recognition for UK news organisations.
The Independent journalists shortlisted are: health correspondent Rebecca Thomas, for health journalist of the year; chief international correspondent Bel Trew, for foreign reporter of the year; and global travel editor Annabel Grossman, shortlisted for travel journalist of the year.
Thomas was shortlisted and won in the same category last year, and has since only added to her record of bringing in important and unflinching exclusives that get under the surface of the challenges healthcare in Britain faces. Judges previously noted her “contacts at all levels of the health service have allowed her to reveal the truth behind the spin as hospitals face increasing pressure”.
Trew, who has covered the Middle East since 2011 as well as the Russian invasion of Ukraine and more recently, the Trump administration's ICE operation in Minneapolis, has also previously won in her category, with the judges recognising that her work means she is often “risking her life to report from some of the most dangerous conflicts, focusing on lesser-reported stories and smashing damaging stereotypes”.
Grossman was promoted to global travel editor in 2023, and her focus on adventure travel has seen her report on skiing in some of Japan’s least-known resorts, how to escape the hordes on an Italian holiday, and the best way to road trip through the US.
The Independent has also been shortlisted for campaign of the year, for its Brick by Brick campaign, which, in partnership with the charity Refuge, has built two new safe homes for domestic abuse survivors fleeing the horror and fear of abuse.
The initiative has secured high-profile support, including from the Queen, as well as celebrities including Dame Helen Mirren, Sir Patrick Stewart, and Olivia Colman.

Florida couple arrested after country club pickleball brawl involving 20 people: cops
A Sunday morning pickleball game in Port Orange descended into chaos after a couple allegedly attacked their opponents
- Bookmark
A Florida couple are facing felony charges after a Sunday morning pickleball game allegedly descended into a huge brawl.
Cops were called to reports of a physical fight involving more than 20 people at Spruce Creek Country Club in Port Orange on February 8.
Obscenities were hurled, one person was hospitalized and even the fire department was in attendance when the chaotic scene unfolded at around 11 a.m, cops say.
An affidavit from the Volusia Sheriff’s Office obtained by The Independent states that one victim was left with “permanent scarring” after being hit.
Anthony Sapienza, 63, and his wife Julianne, 51, were arrested following the altercation and taken into police custody.
According to authorities, it all started when Anthony Sapienza accused his opponents of stepping into an area of the court where people are banned from volleying the ball, known as the “kitchen.” He used foul language to insult his opponent’s wife, the affidavit says.
Police claim he “approached [the opposing player] and punched him on the left side of the face and struck him with a pickleball paddle, causing significant bleeding.”
The victim was taken to hospital for treatment after receiving a laceration by his eye and is pursuing charges.
Authorities say Anthony Sapienza also pushed his opponent’s wife to the ground when she attempted to help her husband, and punched a 70-year-old onlooker in the face when he tried to break up the fight, resulting in his nose bleeding “profusely.”
Multiple witnesses spoke to police, per the affidavit, stating that they observed the verbal insults and the physical altercation including the paddle strike and punching.
The Sapienzas are accused of fleeing the scene, with police tracking them down to their residence in the nearby town of Ponce Inlet.
Anthony Sapienza is facing charges of aggravated battery causing bodily harm and battery on a person 65 or older. His wife is facing one count of battery on a person 65 or older. The couple’s charges are classed as felonies in the state of Florida.
Penalties for aggravated battery include up to 15 years of prison time and up to $10,000 in fines.

Can we make a plea for 'thank yous' | Letters

I do not agree with Sangeeta Pillai (The hill I will die on: Britons love saying thank you – I think we should ban the phrase, 7 February). I do not like sarcastic or passive aggressive “thank yous”, but what is wrong with thanking people in the service industry for the service they give? I do not believe that it is overworked or meaningless. I love to thank baristas, shop assistants, bus drivers or other people because they more often than not provide a very good service. They work hard and are not paid a lot of money. They are often people doing jobs that are difficult for one reason or another.
Why not be kind and appreciative? Isn’t there enough hardship and negativity in these febrile times?
Deirdre Breen

Your article makes me incredibly sad. It most cases “thank you” does not mean “I’m infinitely grateful for your selfless act of service”. In most cases it just means “I see you”. It is a recognition that the other person matters and is not invisible.
It means, for example, that I see that the bus is driven by a person, not by a machine, and it means that I see that this person had to get up even earlier than me for driving this bus, facing a wind of ice cold air anytime they open the front door for new passengers. I hope we will never give up on too many “I see yous” during a day, as they do matter.
Lotte Lina Kaiser
Geneva, Switzerland
While I might agree with some of Sangeeta Pillai’s comments, I maintain that it’s necessary in a civilised society to show appreciation and gratitude. It’s nice to be thanked; and even nicer if one’s name is used. However, it can be excessive. I recently heard a shop assistant in New York say: “Thank you so very much, now you enjoy your underwear.” I assert that we as a nation apologise far too much. I lived on and off in France for nearly 20 years. I think I heard “je suis désolé” maybe three times. But they are generous with “merci”.

I enjoyed Sangeeta Pillai’s piece. Have you noticed that, these days, a simple “thank you” will no longer suffice? It’s now “thank you so much”?

I am sorry, Sangeeta, people in this country say “sorry” a lot more than they say “thank you”!

Israel determined to disarm Gaza, ready for offensive operations — top brass

TEL AVIV, February 13. /TASS/. The objective of Israel’s actions in the Gaza Strip - to demilitarize the enclave - remain unchanged and the Israeli army is prepared to proceed from a defensive posture to offensive operations, if necessary, Chief of the General Staff Lieutenant General Eyal Zamir said.
"We are not relinquishing the objectives of the war - the full demilitarization of the Gaza Strip and the disarmament of Hamas. We are operating in accordance with the directive of the political echelon, while maintaining military plans for their defeat and we stand ready to act defensively as required," he said while visiting the Rafah area.
According to Zamir, Israeli forces deployed in the Gaza Strip are safeguarding the security at border crossings and are "precisely dismantling terror infrastructure" in the enclave. "We are prepared to transition from a defensive posture to an offensive one. For any violation, we will respond and degrade their capabilities," he warned. Recently, we eliminated numerous terrorists, including senior operatives from the terrorist organizations."
He stated that the Israeli army has achieved serious successes in all arenas over the past two years. "There is no immunity for terrorism. What applies to terrorists in Gaza applies to the terrorists in other arenas as well. We will continue to remain focused and remove threats, with determination and a proactive approach," he pledged.
Tensions flared up in the Middle East on October 7, 2023, when militants from the Gaza Strip-based radical Palestinian movement Hamas launched a surprise attack on Israel, killing residents of border settlements and taking more than 250 hostages. In response, Israel initiated a military operation in the Palestinian enclave to dismantle Hamas' military and political structures and free all hostages.
Israel and Hamas resumed Egypt-, Qatar-, United States-, and Turkey-mediated indirect talks on settling the situation in the Gaza Strip on October 6, 2025. On October 9, the parties to the conflict signed an agreement on the implementation of phase one of US President Donald Trump’s Gaza ceasefire plan. The ceasefire came into effect on October 10. Under the agreement, Israeli troops withdrew to the so-called Yellow Line but retained control over more than 50% of the enclave’s territory. On October 13, Hamas released 20 living hostages and handed over the bodies of four out of 28 deceased hostages. The remains of the last Israeli hostage were handed over to Israel on January 26.
Phase two of the Gaza peace plan envisages the disarmament of Palestinian radical, the withdrawal of Israeli troops from the enclave, and the deployment of an "international stabilization force," as well as the launch of the enclave administration structures. US special presidential envoy Steve Witkoff announced the beginning of the implementation of the second phase of the plan on January 14.

UN rights office ‘worried’ after calls for anti-Israel rapporteur Albanese to resign
Czech Republic joins other European nations in demanding resignation, accuses independent expert of referring to Israel as ‘common enemy’ of humanity, which she denies
A UN human rights spokesperson on Friday said she was “very worried” about personal attacks on independent UN experts, after a growing number of European governments called for the resignation of Palestinian territories rapporteur Francesca Albanese over recent anti-Israel comments.
“We are very worried. We are concerned that UN officials, independent experts and judicial officials are increasingly subjected to personal attacks, threats and misinformation that distracts from the serious human rights issues,” UN human rights office spokesperson Marta Hurtado said at a Geneva press briefing.
UN rapporteurs are commissioned by the Geneva-based Human Rights Council to monitor and document specific human rights crises but are independent of the organization itself.
There is no precedent for removing a special rapporteur during their term, although diplomats said that states on the 47-member council could, in theory, propose a motion to do so. However, they said strong support for Palestinian rights within the body means that such a motion was unlikely to pass against Albanese, who was appointed in 2022 and is set to complete her term in 2028.
Speaking via videoconference at a forum Saturday in Doha organized by the Al Jazeera network, Albanese, who has been repeatedly accused of antisemitism and extremist rhetoric toward Israel, cited a “common enemy” that enabled Israel’s “genocide” in Gaza — a charge Israel has strongly rejected.
Pro-Israel activists accused Albanese of referring to Israel as the “common enemy,” which she denied.

— Francesca Albanese, UN Special Rapporteur oPt (@FranceskAlbs) February 9, 2026
Albanese herself posted an unedited clip of her comments on social media, with the caption: “The common enemy of humanity is THE SYSTEM that has enabled the genocide in Palestine, including the financial capital that funds it, the algorithms that obscure it and the weapons that enable it.”
Nonetheless, the Czech Republic’s Foreign Minister Petr Macinka, whose country is one of Israel’s strongest supporters in the European Union, on Friday quoted Albanese on X as having called Israel a “common enemy of humanity,” and called for her resignation.
German Foreign Minister Johann Wadephul said on Thursday that Albanese’s position was “untenable,” while French Foreign Minister Jean-Noel Barrot accused her of making “outrageous and reprehensible remarks” against Israel. Austria and Italy, Albanese’s home country, also said her comments showed she was unsuitable for her post.
“Patience has its limits. UN Special Rapporteur Francesca Albanese should resign from her position.
Her latest statements, in which she described Israel as a ‘common enemy of humanity,’ are unacceptable and indefensible. pic.twitter.com/gKguvqq9xC
— Czech Ministry of Foreign Affairs (@CzechMFA) February 13, 2026
Albanese has a long history of making statements accused of being antisemitic, anti-Israel and pro-Hamas.
On October 11, 2023, four days after the attack, Albanese said she doubted reports of rape and sexual violence. Instead, she said the US and Israel were spreading these claims to escalate tensions. She said Israel had no right to self-defense immediately after the Hamas invasion of Israel; said Israelis should be “considered suspect” and investigated when they are abroad; said other countries should halt pharmaceutical exports to Israel; characterized Israel as a “genocidal society”; and positioned the Jewish state as an impediment to global justice.
She told a Harvard University gathering that when Hamas refers to killing Jews (Yahudi), they do not actually mean Jews.
She has called accusations that UNRWA employees participated in the October 7 massacre “fallacious allegations,” though there has been clear evidence supporting it.
Last November, she posted a cartoon denouncing Israel, depicting what appeared to be a global spiderweb, its strands draped with cash and weapons, in an image that experts said echoed age-old antisemitic tropes.
She was sanctioned by the US government last year for her “unabashed antisemitism” along with other anti-Israel international legal figures.
The European calls for Albanese’s resignation came after US President Donald Trump’s administration in June penned a letter to UN chief Antonio Guterres demanding Albanese be removed and alleging she engaged in “virulent antisemitism and support for terrorism.”
Responding overnight to the new calls for her resignation, Albanese said on X that European governments “accuse me — based on statements I never made — with a virulence and conviction that they have NEVER used against those who have slaughtered 20,000+ children in 858 days” since the Hamas-led onslaught of October 7, 2023, which sparked the war in Gaza.
Albanese was citing figures from Gaza’s Hamas-run health ministry, which puts the death toll in Gaza at more than 72,000 people, including over 500 since the October 2025 ceasefire. The toll does not distinguish between civilians and combatants.
The Israeli military believes Hamas’s overall toll is largely accurate, with IDF officials estimating that two to three civilians were killed for every combatant.
The IDF says it has killed over 23,000 combatants in Gaza and another 1,600 terrorists inside Israel during the October 7 onslaught.
Israel has said it seeks to minimize civilian fatalities and stresses that Hamas uses Gaza’s civilians as human shields, fighting from civilian areas, including homes, hospitals, schools, and mosques.

Trump’s ‘wrecking-ball politics’ are center stage at Munich Security Conference
- World leaders at the annual security conference in Munich have been greeted with a report warning about President Donald Trump’s “destruction” of the international order.
- The Munich Security Report 2026, titled “Under Destruction,” warns that the world has entered a period of “wrecking-ball politics.” It heavily criticizes the Trump administration, stating it is actively undermining global security structures and international law, leading to transactional deals over principled cooperation.
- “Sweeping destruction – rather than careful reforms and policy corrections – is the order of the day,” the report reads. “The most prominent of those who promise to free their country from the existing order’s constraints and rebuild a stronger, more prosperous nation is the current US administration. As a result, more than 80 years after construction began, the US-led post-1945 international order is now under destruction.”
- The view is widely shared in Europe and among America’s allies in Canada, Japan, and above all, Ukraine. Surveys across G7 nations indicate low public trust in governments, with no surveyed country believing the US administration's policies are beneficial for the world.
- The report sets a discordant tone for the weekend of discussions between world powers, which will include the US.

MILAN, February 13. /TASS/. The Swiss-based Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) has turned down an appeal from Ukrainian skeleton racer Vladislav Geraskevich contesting his recent disqualification from the 2026 Winter Olympic Games in Italy, the court said in a statement on Friday.
"The CAS Ad hoc Division has denied an application by Skeleton athlete Vladislav Geraskevich (Ukraine) against the International Bobsleigh & Skeleton Federation (IBSF) and the International Olympic Committee (IOC)," the court’s statement reads.
"The Sole Arbitrator, whilst fully sympathetic to Mr Geraskevich’s commemoration, is bound by rules in the IOC Athlete Expression Guidelines," the statement continued. "The Sole Arbitrator considers these Guidelines provide a reasonable balance between athletes' interests to express their views, and athletes' interests to receive undivided attention for their sporting performance on the field of play."
"The Sole Arbitrator is bound by such proportionate rules and has no means to override them. As a consequence, the application was dismissed. The Sole Arbitrator adds that it was unfair to withdraw Mr Geraskevich’s accreditation in these circumstances and supports the decision of the IOC to return it," according to the CAS.
The IOC announced in a statement on February 12 that Geraskevich had been barred from participating in the 2026 Winter Olympic Games in Italy for wearing a prohibited helmet, also revoking his Olympic accreditation.
However, later that day the IOC Disciplinary Commission partially amended its verdict regarding the competition ban and Olympic accreditation revocation, allowing Geraskevich to stay at the 2026 Winter Games, while still barring him from competing.
Earlier in the week, the IOC prohibited Geraskevich from wearing the controversial helmet. His helmet featured images of fallen Ukrainian athletes which, the IOC claimed, breached the regulations of the Olympic Charter. The athlete, nevertheless, wore it again for the final test runs before the start of the competitions.
After that, the IOC representatives held a second meeting with the skeleton racer, and he declared that he intended to race wearing this helmet. He also had a meeting with IOC President Kirsty Coventry on Thursday morning to discuss the same issue.
Following his meeting with Coventry, Gerskevich demanded that the IOC apologize and also finance the installation of power generating units at sports facilities across Ukraine.
Geraskevich, 27, has never medaled in international competition. The Ukrainian athlete finished fourth at the 2025 IBSF World Championships; on two occasions he also finished in 4th place at the IBSF World Cup stages, and his best result at the Bobsleigh and Skeleton European Championships was 8th place, which he accomplished earlier this year.
The Ukrainian participated in the last two Olympics before this year's Games, finishing 12th at the 2018 Winter Games and 19th at the 2022 Winter Games. Geraskevich was the Ukrainian national team’s flagbearer at the 2026 Winter Olympic Games Opening Ceremony.
The 2026 Winter Olympic Games are taking place in Milan and Cortina d'Ampezzo, Italy, from February 6-22, 2026.

Sahara autonomy plan revealed after Morocco-Polisario meeting

Morocco autonomy plan for Western Sahara unveiled after secret Madrid meeting with Polisario
Morocco has released details of its autonomy plan for the disputed Western Sahara region after attending a secret US-sponsored meeting in Madrid with the participation of delegates from Algeria, the Polisario Front, and Mauritania.
The meeting that took place behind closed doors in the Spanish capital beginning on Sunday was coordinated with the effort of Morocco’s King Mohamed VI and presented by the country’s foreign minister, Nasser Bourita.
The framework envisioned working on the basis of UN Security Council resolution 2797, which recognises Morocco’s autonomy plan as the primary basis for resolving the decades-long Sahara conflict.
According to reports, the meeting extended to Monday after failing to conclude on schedule.
From broad political framework to detailed autonomy statue
Morocco’s 40-page proposed plan for Western Sahara was seen by Madrid-based outlet Atalayar, which outlined its shift from the original 2007 proposal into a detailed, quasi-constitutional autonomy statue with precise institutions, powers and safeguards.
According to the Spanish outlet, the plan aims to distance itself from previous broad political frameworks vis-à-vis Western Sahara into a highly detailed, legally structured autonomy statue, tightly anchored in the constitutional order and sovereignty of the State.
The plan includes legal definitions, interpretive clauses, transitional provisions, and detailed mechanisms of constitutional and judicial control.
Where the 2007 plan spoke in general terms about autonomy under Moroccan sovereignty, the new Rabat-proposed plan envisions a national referendum involving the entire Moroccan electorate and the integration of the statue into the Constitution.
The text lays out stronger constitutional principles and safeguards, where the principle of constitutional loyalty is stated as a strictly guiding norm.
Constitutional safeguards would allow the State, in exceptional and temporary circumstances, to suspend certain regional powers in case of serious harm to the territorial integrity. Atalayar argues this is far more elaborated than in 2007.
Furthermore, the report says an entire section of the plan is centred around the concept of reconciliation and return of native populations, which envisions regulating registration of the Tindouf camps through an established permanent return committee working alongside a disarmament and demobilisation mechanism.
The protection of Hassani identity is further strengthened through its explicit recognition as part of the wider Moroccan heritage.
The new plan also aims to close any ambiguity on the community’s security by stating that regional security will remain limited to local police powers under national coordination.
Shift of mediation efforts from UN to US
Director of the Center for Sahara and Africa for Strategic Studies, Abdelfattah El Fattah El Fatihi, told The New Arab’s sister site Al-Araby al-Jadeed that the event marked a milestone in the negotiations due to previous failed attempts by the UN for the parties to take part in meetings to "produce a roadmap and an agreed political solution on it".
The fact that both Algeria’s and Mauritania’s foreign ministers, as well as a delegation from the Polisario independence movement, sat around the Spanish roundtable, "reflects a qualitative shift in the way this file is managed at the international level", the head of the Maghreb Centre for Research and Strategic Studies, Nabil Andaloussi, said in an interview with Al-Araby Al-Jadeed.
"The discussion is no longer confined to the traditional international corridors in New York, but the centre of gravity has begun to tilt towards direct American leadership from Washington", Andaloussi said, emphasising that this shift carries deep political implications for Morocco and the region.
Algeria has for years refused to participate in discussions previously supervised by the United Nations during the era of former special envoy for Western Sahara, Horst Köhler.
Sahrawi activist and former official of the Polisario, Mostafa Salma Ould Sidi Mouloud, told Al-Araby Al-Jadeed that he was sceptical of the American-led process due to US President Donald Trump’s keenness to add another dispute settlement to his list of achievements.
To achieve this, Mouloud argues, the Americans "may jump a lot of steps, and impose what they see as serving the American interest first, reducing tension to a minimum and leaving the final outcome to the time".
The former member of the Polisario, which is backed by Algiers and claims representation of the Sahrawi people, nevertheless welcomed the US ability to bring all parties to the table and "what [they] saw in the foreign ministers' leadership of the delegations as an affirmation of seriousness".

Epstein strongly advised Saudi against 2018 Aramco Wall St. IPO

'Cow to slaughter': Epstein strongly advised Saudi Arabia against 2018 Aramco Wall Street IPO
Jeffrey Epstein advised senior Saudi officials against the state-owned oil giant Saudi Aramco's planned 2018 IPO, an analysis by The New Arab of recently released emails has found.
Emails released by the US Department of Justice show that from 2016, Epstein frequently communicated with Saudi royal advisor Raafat Al-Sabbagh and Aziza Al-Ahmadi, another advisor to the kingdom about Aramco and the future of Saudi Arabia's economy.
Mohammed bin Salman (MbS), then Deputy Crown Prince, first spoke publicly about selling of parts of Aramco in January 2016. Saudi officials expected the company to be valued at $2 trillion, and investors thought it would be one of the biggest IPOs in stock market history.
Talk of an IPO for the ninety-year-old oil giant came shortly after MbS, son of King Salman bin Abdulaziz, became Deputy Crown Prince.
Then in April 2016, bin Salman announced Vision 2030, an initiative to diversify and reform Saudi Arabia's economy, society and culture.
Based on recently released documents, Epstein first discussed Aramco in an email sent to Al-Sabbagh on 26 May, 2016. Epstein suggested that, rather than selling parts of Aramco, Saudi Arabia should form a new currency based on oil.
Other documents show Al-Sabbagh was in the US at the time of this initial email and met Epstein the following day. He also tried to arrange a meeting with Al-Sabbagh's unnamed 'boss', to whom the pair often refer in their communications. Though this boss is not named, later communications suggest the pair may be referring to the then Deputy Crown Prince.
Epstein's communications with the Saudi official started long after he pleaded guilty to sexual offences against a minor. Though the full extent of Epstein's crimes was not publicly known at the time, messages from Al-Sabbagh suggest he maye have been aware of his reputation.
In one message from 2016, Al-Sabbagh said to Epstein, "I am sure you are opening so many legs" in Florida. In another, Al-Sabbagh sent a link to a news article titled, "Russian Beauty Queen Flees to Dubai to Sell Her Virginity for $13,000." Epstein responded, "finally you send me something worthwhile."
In August of that year, Epstein worked with Aziza Al-Ahmadi, a UAE businesswoman advising some Saudi government departments, to draft a letter to an unnamed person about the Kingdom's finances. Epstein said foreign investors would see an Aramco IPO as "taking a cow to slaughter," adding "shareholders are the last thing the kingdom needs." Instead, Epstein says Aramco's oil should be exchanged for "land, knowledge and currencies."
It's unclear who the intended recipient of this letter was, or indeed if it was sent. However, in October 2017, Epstein and Al-Ahmadi once again worked on a similar letter containing advice about Saudi Arabia's finances, this time explicitly to Mohammed bin Salman, now the Kingdom's Crown Prince.
In this letter, Epstein describes the IPO as "silly," saying a public listing would make Aramco's valuation volatile. He instead suggests selling options to China, or forming a "shariar [SIC] compliant" digital currency.
/
By the time Epstein wrote this second letter, plans for Aramco's IPO were clearer. Five per cent of the company would be sold at a valuation of $2 trillion in a listing planned for 2018.
The London and New York stock exchanges were vying to host the IPO. Major banks, including JPMorgan Chase, Morgan Stanley and HSBC, were acting as financial advisors. Yet Epstein repeatedly expressed his scepticism both to Saudi officials and to outside sources.
A key concern for Epstein was the potential for Aramco shares to serve as collateral in a lawsuit against the Kingdom. In September 2016, the US Congress passed the Justice Against Sponsors of Terrorism Act (JASTA), which allowed foreign states to be sued in US courts for acts of terrorism.
The law was backdated to allow lawsuits for acts of terrorism from September 11, 2001, the date of attacks on the US by the terrorist group al-Qaeda, onwards. This was seen as opening Saudi Arabia up to liability due to allegations that the Saudi government were involved in the attacks, including by funding al-Qaeda. Saudi Arabia has repeatedly denied having any involvement in the attacks though 15 of the 19 hijackers were Saudi citizens.
In an email sent to Aziza Al-Ahmadi and former UN official, Terje Rod-Larsen, Epstein says it would be a "nightmare" if a lawsuit were brought against Saudi Arabia while Aramco was public.
As Epstein was communicating directly with Saudi officials, he was also discussing Aramco's IPO with other sources. From 2017 onwards, he shared news articles about the listing with several people, including Terje Rod-Larson, and former White House Chief Strategist Steve Bannon.
Though Epstein typically shared links without comment, replies to his emails suggest he often spoke about the Aramco IPO. In response to an August 2018 email with a link to a news story saying the IPO had been cancelled, former Kuwaiti Information Minister Anas Al-Rasheed said, "this was your opinion too."
Replying to a September 2018 email from Epstein saying Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund was borrowing money, then-New York Times journalist Landon Thomas Jr. said, "Why didn't MbS listen to you?
From August 2018 until Epstein's death the following August, there was little news about the IPO coming from Saudi Arabia.
Epstein continued discussing the listing with third parties, but after the 2018 cancellation, Epstein spoke to Raafat Al-Sabbagh about Aramco just once more before his death. On 8 April 2019, Epstein shared a link to a news story about Aramco selling bonds, to Al-Sabbagh, saying, "my idea from day one." Epstein was by then under investigation by the FBI.
Aramco was eventually listed on the Saudi stock exchange in November 2019, three months after Epstein's death. The company fell short of it's $2 trillion valuation, though it was the largest IPO in the stock market's history.
In the years since the IPO, Aramco briefly became the most valuable company in the world, after European sanctions hit Russia's oil industry following the country's invasion of Ukraine. Since then, the company's value has fallen by $800 billion, and its share price reached an all-time low in September 2025.
A class action lawsuit against Saudi Arabia by 9/11 survivors has been ongoing since March 2017, but in the nine years since it was issued, the court has been reluctant to find in the defendants' favour.
Saudi officials have previously denied Epstein advised the government on financial matters. Following the recent releases, they have decliend to respond to comments when approached by various media outlets.
On Friday, the Epstein scandal engulfed one of the biggest names in Gulf business, Sultan Ahmed bin Sulayem, CEO of DP World.
Dubai's DP World named a new chairman and chief executive officer on Friday, replacing its former leader Sultan Ahmed bin Sulayem, after the Epstein files revealed frequent correspondence between him and the convicted sex offender.

Zelensky visits German, Ukrainian drone joint venture
Sign up now: Get ST's newsletters delivered to your inbox
- Ukrainian President Zelensky visited a new German-Ukrainian drone plant (QFI) aiming to produce 10,000 Linza 3.0 drones for Ukraine within a year.
- German Defence Minister Pistorius called joint ventures like QFI a "blueprint" for defence, providing crucial battle experience and boosting Germany's military.
- Zelensky called the co-production a "great result" for Europe, reflecting allies' rearmament and learning from Ukraine's conflict experience.

MUNICH, Germany – Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky on Feb 13 visited a new drone production site established by a German and Ukrainian joint venture that aims to mass produce the equipment for Ukraine’s military.
Since Russia’s 2022 full-scale invasion of Ukraine, drones have become a crucial part of the conflict
Germany’s Quantum Systems and Ukraine’s Frontline Robotics announced in December the establishment of the joint venture, Quantum Frontline Industries (QFI).
The German plant, outside Munich, is in the early stages of manufacturing and is aiming to produce 10,000 drones for the Ukrainian armed forces within a year.
Mr Zelensky, paying a visit ahead of a security conference
“That’s great that we have the first production, big co-production in Europe,” Mr Zelensky said. “We’ve got, today, I think, a great result.”
Kyiv’s European allies have also looked to learn practical lessons from the conflict as they rearm in the face of a perceived threat from Moscow and increasing disinterest in European security from the United States.
Speaking alongside Mr Zelensky, German Defence Minister Boris Pistorius said defence cooperation would boost his country’s efforts to rebuild its military.
“We are supporting Ukraine in its fight, but we are also benefiting ourselves, learning from the incredible amounts of data and the wealth of experience gathered on the battlefield in Ukraine,” he said.
“Joint ventures between German and Ukrainian companies are the blueprint, the right way to generate more bang for buck,” he added.
More than 60 of the Linza 3.0 drones, also in production in Ukraine, are already in service on the front lines. AFP

MOSCOW, February 13. /TASS/. The Russian government approved the principle of determining rates of seaport dues in 2026-2030 based on the "inflation minus" approach, the Federal Antimonopoly Service said.
"The Russian government approved the resolution developed by the authority on the annual indexation pace for rates of tonnage, navigation, canal, lighthouse, icebreaking, and seaport water area transport safety dues," the regulator said.
To ensure financial stability of companies, the service developed the approach to determining long-term indexation parameters for port dues at the level of "inflation minus 0.1 percentage point," the authority noted. "In 2026, rates of port dues will be adjusted upward by 5.02%," the regulator added.

- The next round of Ukraine-US-Russia talks in Geneva on 17-18 February was announced by the head of the Ukrainian delegation, Rustem Umierov.
- Earlier this week, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said that the new round of talks will include discussions of territorial issues.
- Zelenskyy also said earlier that the United States has proposed ending Russia's war against Ukraine by the summer, as they will have a different priority later – the US congressional elections.

Trump sends second aircraft carrier to Middle East in effort to increase pressure on Iran

Donald Trump has ordered the world’s largest aircraft carrier to sail from the Caribbean Sea to the Middle East in an effort to increase pressure on Iran amid discussions over curbing its nuclear and ballistic missile programmes.
The USS Gerald R Ford and its supporting warships should take about three weeks to return to the region, where they will join the USS Abraham Lincoln, dramatically increasing the military firepower available to the US leader.
On Tuesday, Trump said in an interview with Axios that he was “thinking” about sending a second carrier strike group to the Middle East, though at that point he said he believed Tehran was willing to strike a nuclear deal.
The US and Iran held a round of indirect negotiations in Oman last week, and further discussions were expected to follow, but so far no date has been scheduled.
Reports began circulating in US media on Thursday that the Ford was the carrier that had been nominated to set sail, a day after Trump met Israel’s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, in Washington to discuss the emerging negotiations with Iran.
Iran has indicated it is willing to curb its nuclear enrichment programme in return for sanctions relief, but has rejected other demands. Israel wants Iran to limit its ballistic missile programme and cut support for Hezbollah and other proxy groups.
Trump’s rhetoric about Iran has changed markedly over the past month. At first he appeared to suggest that he wanted to intervene – telling people protesting against the country’s regime that “help is coming”. But at the time the US had few military assets available.
That changed with the arrival of the Lincoln carrier strike group, but by then the Iranian regime had largely regained control of the streets by killing thousands of people – possibly tens of thousands – in the most brutal crackdown in the country’s recent history.
Meanwhile, the US president’s focus appeared to have moved to curbing Iran’s nuclear programme – already set back in a summer bombing campaign by Israeli and US air forces during last summer’s 12-day war.
The Ford carrier strike group had been sent from the eastern Mediterranean at the end of October, and arrived in the Caribbean Sea in mid-November as Trump increased pressure on Venezeula’s former president Nicolás Maduro.
It played a central role in the extraordinary seizure of Maduro by US forces in early January, and had remained in the Caribbean. However, sending the carrier and its allied warships back to the Middle East makes for an unusually long deployment: it left the US in June 2025 and has no obvious date of return.
On Thursday Trump warned Iran that failure to reach a deal with his administration would be “very traumatic” and said he hoped that talks would conclude shortly.
“I guess over the next month, something like that,” Trump said in response to a question about his timeline for striking a deal with Iran on its nuclear programme. “It should happen quickly. They should agree very quickly.”
Then, on Friday, on a visit to the Fort Bragg military base in North Carolina, Trump said a change of government in Iran would be the “best thing that could happen”.
“For 47 years, they’ve been talking and talking and talking. In the meantime, we’ve lost a lot of lives while they talk,” he told reporters.

Farmers protest in Greek capital over rising production costs
Sign up now: Get ST's newsletters delivered to your inbox
ATHENS, Feb 13 - Greek farmers drove dozens of tractors into central Athens on Friday to protest over rising production costs and tough competition from abroad, saying that what the government had offered them so far was not enough to stay afloat.
People lined up and applauded as tractors arrived in front of the parliament building. The farmers said they would stay overnight.
Stavros Kozoutzis, a farmer from Komotini, in the north of the country, said: "Unfortunately, the summer cultivation period is about to begin, and we do not have the money to plant this year’s crops."
Last month, the farmers ended weeks of nationwide blockades over delayed farm aid payments. The Greek government says it has disbursed much of the overdue payments and announced cheaper fuel and cover for future output losses.
But the head of the farmers' union in the central agricultural region of Larissa said on Friday that many farmers had not yet received full compensation for last year's crop and livestock losses, while guaranteed minimum prices for their products and investment in irrigation and infrastructure against future floods were core demands the government has not met.
"We are giving a battle for our survival. We left the blockades... but our fight continues as our main demands have not been satisfied," Rizos Maroudas told public broadcaster ERT, hours before farmers reached Athens.
The sector has also been hit by rolling outbreaks of sheep and goat pox with hundreds of thousands of animals being culled since 2024.
Footage from local television showed veterinarians dressed in yellow uniforms spraying tractors with disinfectants before they reached the Greek capital. REUTERS

In an interview with FRANCE 24, Azerbaijani President Ilham Aliyev declared that "peace is achieved" with Armenia following an August White House summit. "For me, it is done," he said. Aliyev however firmly refused to grant clemency to imprisoned Nagorno-Karabakh separatist leaders, an issue that was raised during a meeting he had this week with US Vice President JD Vance.
Speaking to FRANCE 24 on the sidelines of Munich Security Conference (MSC), the Azerbaijani leader compared the trial of Nagorno-Karabakh separatist leaders to the Nuremberg trials.
"These people committed serious crimes against humanity," he stated. When asked to "turn the page" and grant them clemency, Aliyev asserted: "Their crime was even worse than what the Nazis did during World War II."
Pushing the 'restart button' with France
Aliyev expressed confidence in the TRIPP project, a road and rail link through Armenia connecting Azerbaijan's exclave of Nakhchivan to Europe. "I have no doubt that it will happen," he said, noting that it "carries the name of President Trump".
Asked about France, with which relations deteriorated sharply over the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict back in 2023, Aliyev confirmed progress after meeting President Emmanuel Macron in Copenhagen in October 2025: "We agreed to put a restart button. We are ready for that."

MUNICH, Germany — European countries need to create a “rapid reaction force” of up to 100,000 troops to replace American soldiers currently stationed on the continent, EU Defense Commissioner Andrius Kubilius said in an interview with POLITICO on Friday.
Kubilius shied away from calling such a force a “European army,” a term that is rejected in many countries and even causes deep dissent among his fellow European commissioners.
“We need to have clarity about what we are talking about, because this title of 'European army' has some kind of historical legacy and sometimes it's misleading," he said, speaking at the POLITICO Pub during the Munich Security Conference.

Risk of missteps hangs over US-backed ceasefire deal in north-east Syria
Sign up now: Get ST's newsletters delivered to your inbox
DAMASCUS – A US-backed ceasefire agreement in north-eastern Syria
The progress of the deal tests the ability of Syria’s new leaders to stabilise a nation fractured by 14 years of war, following several bouts of violence pitting it against minority groups who are suspicious of the Islamist-led government.
The struggle for Syria’s north-east has brought the biggest shift in control since former leader Bashar al-Assad was ousted in December 2024.
After months of deadlock, Damascus seized swathes of territory from the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) before agreeing to the plan that foresees its remaining enclave being integrated into the state.
Preliminary steps have gone smoothly since the Jan 29 agreement: small contingents of government forces have deployed into two Kurdish-run cities, fighters have withdrawn from front lines, and Damascus on Feb 13 announced the appointment of a regional governor nominated by the Kurds.
But a dozen government and Kurdish officials said core issues had yet to be tackled, including precisely how SDF fighters will be integrated, the fate of SDF heavy weapons, and arrangements for a border crossing to Iraq that has been an SDF lifeline.
For now, the SDF has a firm grip over areas it still holds. But the question of how much authority the SDF would retain had yet to be answered, said Mr Noah Bonsey of International Crisis Group, a think-tank.
He said further progress in implementing the deal currently looked like the most likely scenario, “but the risk... of missteps, and thus, ultimately the risk of renewed escalation is still high”.
Washington pleased with progress, urges flexibility
Syria’s President Ahmed al-Sharaa has now brought almost all of Syria back under central control.
A Western official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Washington, which withdrew some forces from Syria this week, is pleased with progress toward integration and has urged Mr Sharaa to be as flexible as possible with SDF requests.
The US advice is: avoid taking a hard line as a sign of goodwill, since a degree of autonomy for Kurds is desirable as long as it does not threaten the core need for central authority in Damascus, the official said.
Asked for comment, the US State Department referred to a statement by Syria envoy Tom Barrack in which he said the agreement paved the way for lasting peace for all Syrians. Syria’s information ministry and the SDF did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
The agreement, a copy of which was seen by Reuters, foresees the defence ministry establishing a division for the north-east, integrating SDF forces into three brigades.
It stipulates that 15 government security vehicles would deploy into each of the SDF-held cities of Qamishli and Hasakah, and that “integration of SDF security forces” would begin.
Deployments in February were largely incident-free, in stark contrast to the government’s attempt to enter Druze-majority Sweida in July 2025, which led to deadly violence. The US, meanwhile, has moved thousands of Islamic State prisoners formerly guarded by the SDF to Iraq.
But there are also signs of friction on the ground.
The SDF accuses the government of besieging Kobani, a Kurdish-run town cut off from the main SDF enclave, while Arabs living in SDF areas are resentful of its continued control, notably in ethnically mixed Hasakah city, according to two Syrian security officials.
SDF commander Mazloum Abdi has said the three brigades comprising SDF fighters will be based in Qamishli, Hasakah and Derik, near the Iraqi border. But officials on both sides said that while there was a tentative understanding on a location near Qamishli, the other two had yet to be agreed.
The SDF wants one stationed on Mount Abdelaziz near Hasakah city, overlooking its southern approaches and an extensive network of tunnels, Syrian military sources said. Damascus objects to this.
Kurdish official sees security in Kurdish hands
Arab-majority areas fell quickly to the government advance, including Deir al-Zor province and its oil fields. But the deal requires the SDF to hand over two other fields near Qamishli – Rmeilan and Sweidiya – and Qamishli airport. This has yet to happen.
A regional intelligence officer described SDF concessions so far as symbolic.
Mr Abdulkarim Omar, a senior Kurdish official, told Reuters that government security forces would withdraw after coordinating and finalising “integration mechanisms”.
“The Asayish (Kurdish security forces) will be part of the interior ministry, and they are the ones who will protect this region from within,” he said, adding that “lengthy discussions” were needed on the agreement’s implementation.
Turkey has also indicated lingering doubts. It views the Kurdish YPG militia, the SDF’s backbone, as an extension of the Kurdistan Workers’ Party (PKK), which staged a decades-long insurgency in Turkey before entering a peace process.
Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan said the YPG’s withdrawal created a “healthier” security map, but Turkey’s security concerns would only be fully addressed when YPG severs links to the PKK and undergoes a “historic transformation”. REUTERS

Indian man pleads guilty in US over plot to kill Sikh separatist leader

An Indian man charged with orchestrating an unsuccessful alleged Indian government-backed plot to kill a Sikh separatist in New York City pleaded guilty to three criminal charges, a spokesperson for the US attorney's office in Manhattan said.
Nikhil Gupta, 54, on Friday pleaded guilty to murder-for-hire, conspiracy to commit murder-for-hire and conspiracy to commit money laundering, which carry a maximum combined sentence of 40 years in prison, the spokesperson said.
Gupta entered his plea before US Magistrate Judge Sarah Netburn in Manhattan federal court.
Lawyers for Gupta were not immediately available for comment.
Gupta has been jailed in Brooklyn since his June 2024 extradition to the United States from the Czech Republic, where he had been arrested a year earlier.
He had pleaded not guilty immediately after his extradition.
US prosecutors accused Gupta of plotting with an Indian government official to kill Gurpatwant Singh Pannun, a US resident and dual US-Canadian citizen who advocated for a sovereign Sikh state in northern India’s Punjab.
India's government has dissociated itself from any plot against Pannun, saying it was against government policy.
The discovery of alleged assassination plots against Sikh separatists in the United States and Canada has tested relations with India, which has also denied involvement in such plots.
New Delhi has long been unhappy over Sikh separatist activity in Canada and the US.
Last year, Pakistan's top diplomat, in a news conference, claimed that his country has "credible evidence" of the Indian government's involvement in killings in the country.
The Washington Post reported last year that an officer in India's intelligence service was directly involved in a foiled plan and that Vikram Yadav, an officer of India's infamous Research and Analysis Wing (RAW), had orchestrated the failed assassination plot of Gurpatwant Singh Pannun by enlisting a "hit team" to carry out the operation.
British news outlet The Guardian also claimed in an investigation that agents of New Delhi's RAW had been involved in up to 20 extrajudicial killings of individuals in Pakistan since 2020.

Wendy’s becomes latest fast food joint to close hundreds of locations
Many fast food chains are intensifying efforts to attract ‘inflation-weary customers’
- Bookmark
Fast-food giant Wendy's is embarking on a significant restructuring, announcing the closure of hundreds of its US restaurants and a renewed focus on value deals following a disappointing fourth-quarter performance.
The Dublin, Ohio-based company revealed plans to shutter between 5 per cent and 6 per cent of its US outlets – equating to 298 to 358 locations – in the first half of this year.
This follows the closure of 28 restaurants in the final quarter of last year, bringing its US footprint to 5,969 locations by the end of 2025. These actions come on top of 240 US Wendy’s locations that ceased operations in 2024, with the 57-year-old chain acknowledging many of its sites were simply "out of date."
The strategic shift comes after global same-store sales, for locations open at least a year, plummeted by 10 per cent in the October-December period, falling short of analysts' expectations of an 8.5 per cent drop. US same-store sales experienced an even steeper decline. Despite this, the company's revenue for the fourth quarter, at $543m, slightly exceeded forecasts, though it represented a 5.5 per cent decrease.
In response, Wendy's, much like rivals McDonald’s and Taco Bell, is intensifying its efforts to attract "inflation-weary customers" through more competitive pricing. Ken Cook, Wendy’s interim CEO and chief financial officer, stated in an investor call: "One learning from 2025 around value, we swung the pendulum too far towards limited-time price promotions instead of everyday value." The company has already launched a permanent "Biggie Deals" value menu, featuring three price points: $4 Biggie Bites, $6 Biggie Bags and an $8 Biggie Bundle. New products, including a chicken sandwich, are also anticipated this year.
Despite the challenges, Wendy's expressed confidence that its US turnaround plans and international expansion will help reverse its sales decline. The company projects global systemwide sales, encompassing both company-owned and franchised restaurants, to remain flat this year, an improvement from the 3.5 per cent fall recorded last year. Investors reacted positively, with Wendy's shares climbing nearly 5 per cent in mid-day trading on Friday.

Labour MP calls for NATO ‘neighbourhood’ model for decisions

Labour MP Graeme Downie has argued that NATO’s consensus-based decision-making needs reform, warning that the pace of modern crises is outstripping the Alliance’s ability to respond.
Writing in PoliticsHome, Downie said: “Crises in Europe now develop faster than political structures respond. Decisions that could once take days are now needed in hours.” While describing NATO as “the most successful military alliance in history”, he argued its strength is also a vulnerability, writing: “Its greatest asset, 31 democracies acting together, is also its strategic Achilles heel.”
He warned that unanimity creates operational risk: “Unanimity binds allies politically, yet slows them operationally. Vladimir Putin believes he can exploit that gap.” Downie proposed what he called a “neighbourhood” model, where allies closest to a theatre are empowered to respond rapidly, stating NATO should embrace “regional leadership, a ‘neighbourhood’ model where the allies best placed to act in specific theatres are empowered to do so quickly.”
He argued the UK is well placed to lead this shift, writing: “This approach is already emerging organically. Nato now needs to formalise it, and the UK should be leading.” Highlighting the High North, he said: “The Greenland, Iceland, UK gap is once again central to Nato’s ability to track and deter Russian submarines.” He cited British anti-submarine capabilities including Astute-class submarines and RAF Poseidon aircraft, noting: “British P-8s have flown joint missions with US and Norwegian aircraft to shadow Russian submarines.”
He also raised concerns over NATO’s ability to respond quickly in the Baltic, asking: “How long could Nato take to respond to Russia seeking to occupy an uninhabited island in the Baltic…?” and warning: “The fait accompli would be that Russian troops now occupied Nato territory.” Downie suggested a smaller grouping response could prevent delay, writing: “What if there were a ‘neighbourhood’ response through a grouping such as JEF or just a small group of Nato members?”
He concluded that NATO must adapt to ensure deterrence remains credible, arguing: “If Nato wants to deter effectively in the decade ahead, it needs to embrace regional leadership, accelerate its decision-making, and turn speed into its advantage rather than its vulnerability.”

Zelensky meets exiled Crown Prince of Iran
Zelensky stated this on Telegram, according to Ukrinform.
He expressed condolences to the victims of the Iranian regime and noted that Ukraine supports the Iranian people in their struggle for their future.
"During our conversation, we focused on the situation in Iran and the areas where the Iranian people need support. We discussed the importance of strengthening sanctions against the Iranian regime and any other dictatorial regimes," Zelensky said.
The interlocutors condemned cooperation between Russia and Iran, in particular the supply of Shahed drones by the Iranian regime to Russia and the transfer of licenses for their production. They emphasized that such a partnership poses a real threat not only to Ukraine but to the entire region.
Zelensky thanked the Crown Prince of Iran for supporting Ukraine's territorial integrity. "It is vital to make every effort to protect human lives. Ukraine is ready to help on its part," he noted.
For his part, as reported by the Office of the President, the Crown Prince thanked Ukraine for recognizing the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps as a terrorist organization.
As previously reported, the 62nd Munich Security Conference began on February 13 – a leading global forum for discussing key international security challenges.
About 1,000 representatives from nearly 120 countries are taking part in the three-day event, including nearly 60 heads of state and government, 56 foreign ministers, more than 30 defense ministers, and leaders of over 40 international organizations.

CEO of Dubai's largest port replaced after ties to Epstein revealed
The head of one of the world's largest port operators has been removed from his position, following revelations from the Jeffrey Epstein files about the extent of his ties to the convicted sex offender.
On Friday, Dubai's government media office announced in a statement that it had appointed a new chairman of the board of directors and a new CEO of the company, DP World, replacing Sultan Ahmed bin Sulayem, one of the Middle East's most prominent business figures. The company, which is overseen by Dubai's ruling family, operates ports in the Gulf and all over the world.
Bin Sulayem has served as chairman of DP World since 2007 and was named joint chairman and CEO in 2016.
The statement does not mention bin Sulayem by name. CBS News has reached out to DP World for comment.
Bin Sulayem's ties to Epstein were well publicized during the newest release of Epstein files by the Justice Department. According to a department spokesperson, bin Sulayem's name appears in the files more than 4,700 times.
In one email from bin Sulayem to Epstein, he asked Epstein, "where are you? are you ok , I loved the torture video." In a separate email exchange, Epstein called bin Sulayem "one of my most trusted friends in very sense of the word," and added that "I greatly appreciate the time we spend together."
"Thank you my friend I am off the sample a fresh 100% female Russian at my yacht," Bin Sulaymen replied to Epstein.
Documents indicate the relationship between the men dates back to the early 2000s and involved consulting each other for business input and arranging meetings with influential people, including former Israeli prime minister Ehud Barak, Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor (formerly Prince Andrew), and investor Tom Barrack, who is now the ambassador to Turkey.
Other email correspondence shows the men discussing different masseuses and a possible visit to Epstein's island. One exchange shows bin Sulaymen helping to arrange for one of Epstein's masseuses to be trained at a luxury hotel in Turkey, for "better experiences."
In one email to bin Sulayem from a redacted sender, the sender wrote "Jeffrey is wondering what time you would like your massage today in new york." Epstein offered to take him to his island after an event he referred to as "the Clinton Forum." Bin Sulaymen asked Epstein about Sept. 15-20, 2005, and that year, the annual Clinton Global Initiative took place from Sept. 15-17.
In a speech on the House floor Tuesday, Democratic Rep. Ro Khanna read the names of six "wealthy, powerful men" that the Justice Department had initially redacted in its most recent release of Epstein-related files. One of them was bin Sulaymen. The redactions have since been removed and all six names revealed.
The files referenced by Khanna and reviewed by CBS News do not appear to directly implicate the six men in any crimes, and Khanna did not allege any specific criminal wrongdoing.
When previously contacted about the communications between Epstein and bin Sulayem, DP World declined to comment.

Let the revelry begin: Rio mayor hands city's key to King Momo as Carnival kicks off
Rio de Janeiro has kicked off Carnival celebrations as the mayor hands the city key to King Momo for a playful five-day reign
- Bookmark
The mayor of Rio de Janeiro gave King Momo the key to the Brazilian city on Friday, ushering in the symbolic Carnival monarch’s five-day reign over the festivities.
Until Wednesday, Momo is charged with presiding over the revelry, participating in the parades and promoting the joy of partygoers. His ruling over the metropolis in the South American country symbolizes society being turned upside down during Carnival.
This year’s Momo is 30-year-old Danilo Vieira, a Rio native who will be taking charge of the celebrations.
“The rules still apply, of course," Vieira told The Associated Press before his symbolic coronation. "We have to follow the rules of our city, our country, but Carnival is run by me."
In 2024, Rio de Janeiro Mayor Eduardo Paes issued a decree making the key ceremony an annual official event, obliging his successors to participate.
Rio City Hall expects about 6 million revelers to participate in the raucous street parties, where groups made up of musicians, percussionists and stilt artists draw thousands of partygoers, many scantily dressed and covered in glitter.
Many will head to Rio’s famed Sambodrome, where samba schools will showcase their parades — prepared diligently for months — complete with ginormous floats and elaborate costumes, to judges who will dish out points and eventually announce a winner.
This year's parades celebrate diverse themes including sex workers, late singer and songwriter Rita Lee and Black communities in the Amazon.
While Rio’s Carnival is the most well-known, the festivity is a nationwide phenomenon. Samba schools in the world’s largest tropical rainforest are also preparing parades, and festivities in the colorful, colonial city of Olinda began on Thursday.
In Rio, a recent wave of thefts by young people acting in groups have raised security concerns, with some calling on the mayor and Gov. Cláudio Castro to do more to guarantee revelers’ safety.
“Carnival is meant to be a time of joy, but what we’ve been seeing at the street parties in Rio, beyond the fun, is fear,” former councilwoman Luciana Boiteux said on Instagram earlier this month. She called for better lighting and preventive community policing.
Rio City Hall’s secretariat of public order and the municipal guard said that they have set up a special operation involving around 1,100 agents for patrols. The teams will monitor street parties from start to finish, when the risk of thefts tends to intensify.
Teams specializing in violence against women will also be present at key locations to offer support and guidance, City Hall said.
At Friday’s ceremony, Vieira said that Carnival is also about inclusivity.
“Carnival is love, carnival heals," he said. "A kind of magic happens, bringing joy to every heart, to all races, to everyone.”

EU says no shortcut to Ukraine reforms amid 2027 membership speculation
Unknown

02:37:07 KST

A top EU official said there is no shortcut to Ukraine carrying out reforms, amid speculation over Kyiv's accelerated entry to the European Union as soon as next year.
"Let's have this discussion, with one baseline — full membership comes only after full reforms," Marta Kos, the European Commissioner for Enlargement, said on Feb. 13 in Tallinn.
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said at the end of January that the country would be ready to join the bloc by 2027, and membership of the EU would serve as an economic security guarantee in the event of an eventual peace deal with Russia.
Reports have since emerged that the EU is exploring a membership plan for Ukraine that would allow the country to join before completing all the necessary reforms required as part of the so-called accession process.
But some national leaders, including German Chancellor Friedrich Merz, have pushed back on the speedy timeline.
In a speech highlighting the tensions between a fast moving and hostile geopolitical environment, and the lethargic pace of the EU, Kos said she was "glad" that debate around new models of membership was taking place, and appeared to leave the door open to a more flexible approach to membership.
"We need to reach citizens in our candidate countries much faster and more directly, by rewarding those who deliver on reforms and alignment with EU rules with faster integration into EU policies and structures," she said.
Her speech comes as Ukraine's parliament fails to vote through unpopular reforms required to unlock a new International Monetary Fund program — a necessary condition for receiving a 90 billion euros ($107 billion) lifeline from the EU.
One senior European Commission official, speaking to the Kyiv Independent this week on the condition of anonymity, expressed concern over Ukraine's weakened appetite to pursue reforms in recent months, saying it would undermine both European support for the country's membership and future private sector investment in the country.
Ukraine's record on aligning with the EU was tarnished last summer when Zelensky moved to strip the country's anti-corruption agencies of their independence. Although he backtracked after a fiery reaction from civil society, the episode looms large in the minds of EU policymakers.
Kos outlined five crucial "ingredients of success" for any future accession process, including safeguards to prevent democratic backsliding.
Ukraine was granted EU candidate status in 2022. The country completed the legislative screening process last year, and has advocated for a fast-track accession amid ongoing peace talks with Moscow, arguing that EU membership is essential for post-war recovery and security.
However, Hungary continues to block the opening of "accession clusters," the next stage in the protracted process of joining the bloc.

‘Handmaid’s Tale future’: Reform’s Matt Goodwin sparks outcry with fertility comments

Reform UK’s candidate in the Gorton and Denton byelection has been accused of wanting a “Handmaid’s Tale future” after unearthed YouTube footage revealed he called for “young girls and women” to be given a “biological reality” check.
In a clip posted to his personal YouTube channel in November 2024, Matt Goodwin stated that “many women in Britain are having children much too late in life”.
He said: “We need to also explain to young girls and women the biological reality of this crisis. Many women in Britain are having children much too late in life and they would prefer to have children much earlier on.”
The comments, first reported by the Independent, have sparked a furious backlash, with one MP describing it as an “alt right fantasy” and an equality campaigner calling it “truly troubling”. The revelations come days after the paper revealed Goodwin previously suggested people who don’t have children should be taxed extra as punishment.
Sarah Owen, the chair of the Commons women and equalities committee, said the comments were “deeply offensive” and appeared to blame women for the declining birthrate.
“For anyone with fertility issues, like me who struggled with miscarriage after miscarriage, to say [to them] we should be paying more tax for not having children or that it is our fault is deeply offensive, as it is for LGBT+ people or women who can’t afford to have kids,” she said. “It’s clear he didn’t run this grotesque idea past any women in real life.”
Natalie Fleet, the Labour MP for Bolsover, who was groomed and became pregnant as a 15-year-old, said her pregnancy had happened at a “biologically great age” and she had experienced a “physically perfect pregnancy and easy birth”. But, she added, she had been through “hell on earth”.
Addressing the former academic on social media, she wrote: “Is this the kind of thing you’ll be wanting to see in our Handmaid’s Tale future?” A reference to the Margaret Atwood novel set in a dystopian future.
In a separate podcast with the rightwing author and commentator Jordan Peterson, Goodwin also appeared to agree with the host’s claim that universities have become hotbeds of “politically correct authoritarianism” because they are full of “childless women”.
In a February 2025 clip, Peterson said there were three predictors of “politically correct authoritarianism”, of which the first was “being female”, at which point Goodwin interjected and added: “I was going to say that.”
Peterson added that an “ethos of harm avoidance” had proliferated because universities “became dominated by not only women – this is even worse, I might as well go in all the way – childless women”.
Goodwin responded: “Yeah, actually there are a couple of papers on that Jordan, I’m sure you’ve seen, I think Cory Clark. I’ve read a couple I think showing basically the feminisation of higher education over the last 50 years.”
A Reform spokesperson said the two men “were discussing peer-reviewed academic studies showing clear psychological differences between men and women, which influence their views of cancel culture”.
Responding to queries about Goodwin suggesting in 2023 that the government “remove personal income tax for women who have two or more children”, the party said Goodwin had not called for childless women to be taxed more but it was time for a “grown-up, mature debate about how we can encourage people to have more children and support British families”.
Hannah Spencer, the Green party candidate in Gorton and Denton, said women were struggling with the cost of living, caring responsibilities and health inequalities in NHS services. “I wish the Reform candidate put more time into addressing problems and less into looking for divisive, easy answers,” she said.
Penny East, the chief executive of the Fawcett Society, said the “idea that we should be telling young girls they have a moral obligation to have children earlier is both dystopian and deeply sexist […] Suggesting early motherhood is a civic duty is truly troubling.”
Writing on social media, the Walthamstow MP, Stella Creasy, said: “I long for the days when a midlife crisis for men like this meant getting a motorbike and a leather jacket, not trying to [get] elected so they could indulge their alt right fantasies about ensuring women were pregnant as soon as they were fertile and then didn’t go to university.”

‘Monumental victory’: Activists welcome High Court ruling against Palestine Action ban
Activists and rights groups in the UK have welcomed a "monumental victory" after the country’s High Court ruled that a ban on the Palestine Action group was unlawful, citing breaches of free speech and rights to protest.
On Friday, several prominent campaigners hailed the legal victory by Palestine Action co-founder Huda Ammori in her challenge against the government’s decision to proscribe the group under anti-terrorism legislation, although the organisation remains banned for the time being pending an appeal by the UK government.
In a statement, Ammori warned the government against any attempt "to try to delay or stop the High Court’s proposed Order quashing this ban", after Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood said she was “disappointed” by the ruling and intended to appeal the decision.
The judgment has prompted renewed calls for charges against protesters accused of supporting Palestine Action to be dropped.
Ammori raised alarm over "the futures of these thousands of people hang in the balance, many of whom are elderly or disabled and facing up to 14 years’ imprisonment for this entirely peaceful protest".
Since the ban came into force last July - following an incident in which Palestine Action activists entered a British military base and spray-painted two military aircraft - more than 2,700 people have been arrested for holding signs supporting the group, according to protest group Defend Our Juries.
Ammori added that "It would be a draconian overreach and a blatant affront to the rule of law for more people to be arrested today and in the coming weeks for defying a ban which has been ruled unlawful".
The new High Court ruling has been welcomed by groups including Greenpeace UK, Amnesty International and the Stop the War Coalition, all of which described the decision as significant for protest rights and civil liberties.
Yasmine Ahmed, UK director of Human Rights Watch, also called for a "thorough and independent investigation" into the government’s decision to proscribe Palestine Action, stating that the ruling “reinforces what many of us having been saying all along - that the government’s misuse of terrorism legislation was a brazen and gross abuse of power that served to stifle legitimate criticism of Israel and those profiting from its atrocities".
Meanwhile, Defend Our Juries said in a statement provided to The New Arab that the ruling showed there was "no longer any reason for Palestine Action-linked prisoners, including those who went on hunger strike, to be held in prison without trial on unsubstantiated ‘terror’ charges. They should be released immediately."
Saeed Taji Farouky, a former Palestine Action spokesperson and filmmaker, rejected the government’s justifications for the ban prior to the ruling, describing them as "incredibly fake and unconvincing".
Speaking to The New Arab, Farouky pointed to the acquittal last week of six Palestine Action activists charged with aggravated burglary over a break-in at Elbit Systems UK as evidence of "a crumbling case before this High Court judgment was passed down".
"Now with this judgment passed down, we can see the extent of the government's lies and manipulation. We can see that the government lied to the people. They lied to Parliament. They lied to their own lawmakers," he said.
Farouky has also joined growing calls for former Home Secretary Yvette Cooper, who authorised the proscription last year, to resign from her current position as Foreign Secretary.
"[Yvette Cooper] lied to the British public, she lied to the High Court, she lied to Parliament. She said there was secret evidence that would prove clearly and unequivocally that Palestine Action was violent, that they should be categorized as terrorists. The evidence was so secret, the British public weren't allowed to see it".
Farouky further accused Cooper of "constructing a framework for prescription", adding that "she should be humiliated”.
He continued: "And if she has any sense of self respect, she won't represent the UK as Foreign Secretary anymore." Cooper has not publicly responded to the ruling or the mounting criticism.
Despite this, Farouky expressed optimism that the judgment could influence other Palestine Action-related cases, including those of eight remand prisoners affiliated with the group who took part in what campaigners describe as the largest coordinated hunger strike in the UK since 1981.
Looking ahead, the filmmaker said the ruling could also "embolden people to take up their rights, their rights to protest and their rights to dissent from this government".
He added: "The government has tried not only to crush Palestine Action and the pro-Palestinian movement, but even more generally, to crush dissent and the right to protest and the more basic principles of democracy in this country."
Following the judgment, PA news agency reported that a senior judge postponed plea hearings at London’s Old Bailey for four alleged pro-Palestine protesters, granting a request from defence lawyers to allow time to consider the implications of the ruling.
The defendants face charges of criminal damage relating to protests last August.
In its decision, the High Court found that the then home secretary had made a "significant" error by focusing on the perceived benefits of proscribing Palestine Action without adequately considering the drawbacks- most notably the risk posed to the right to protest.
While the ban remains in force pending the appeal process, British police said on Friday they would prioritise gathering evidence of alleged offences linked to the banned direct action group rather than making arrests in the immediate aftermath of the ruling.

Unvaccinated child dies of complications from measles disease, 15th death since outbreak started

A nine-year-old unvaccinated child died of measles on Friday, the Health Ministry announced, in the 15th recorded death of an unvaccinated child caused by an ongoing measles outbreak.
The child was hospitalized in critical condition and was declared dead after several attempts by the medical staff to resuscitate him.
The ministry noted that the previous 14 children who died from measles were not vaccinated, with most of them being healthy before the disease and without underlying complications.
"The vaccine saves lives," the ministry added, assuring the population that the vaccines were safe and effective in fighting measles.
The statement also emphasized the importance of seeking medical treatment promptly when symptoms appear or an infection is suspected, and noted that early arrival may save lives.
Health Ministry recommends vaccinating children against measles
The Health Ministry's official policy recommends that all children be vaccinated against measles between the ages of 1 and 6 as part of the routine vaccination program.
In areas where a measles outbreak has been detected, the ministry recommends a second dose of the vaccine for children aged one and a half years and an additional dose for infants aged 6-11 months, especially before traveling to areas experiencing an outbreak.
In addition, the Ministry recommended that those who are not vaccinated, as well as parents of infants who received one dose at 6-11 months of age, avoid participating in large-scale events in outbreak-prone areas due to the risk of infection.

The United States is still not clear about how it sees the future role of the United Nations Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA), its chief said on Friday, warning that jettisoning it would create a black hole similar to Iraq after 2003.
Washington was long UNRWA's biggest donor, but froze funding in January 2024 after Israel uncovered strong proof indicating that multiple members of UNRWA staff took part in Hamas's October 7 massacre.
"There is no definitive answer, because the interest of the US is also to be successful in this process, and if you get rid of an agency like ours before you have an alternative, you are also creating a huge black hole," UNRWA head Philippe Lazzarini told Reuters on the sidelines of the Munich Security Conference.
"Remember what happened in Iraq in 2003 when the entire administration had been dismantled. There was no alternative, and people were left without any services," he said in an interview.
No more cuts foreseen, Lazzarini says
Lazzarini, who leaves his post at the end of March, said UNRWA did not foresee any more cuts in the immediate term and will continue to offer public health and education services.
He urged Gulf Arab countries to increase their support because their contribution did not match their strong expression of solidarity with Palestinian refugees.
Israel's parliament passed a law in October 2024 banning the agency from operating in the country and prohibiting officials from having contact with it.

Saudi Arabia scales back Red Sea luxury resort plans amid reassessment

Saudi Arabia is revising its ambitious Red Sea tourism strategy, scaling back plans to build 81 luxury resorts by 2030 as the kingdom reassesses the scope and pace of its multi-billion-dollar diversification projects, according to sources familiar with the matter.
Stubbornly low oil prices and patchy demand have forced a rethink of the flamboyant "giga-projects" – centrepieces of Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman's Vision 2030 program to diversify Saudi Arabia's economy.
Red Sea Global (RSG) denied plans to downsize, saying the project would continue after the initial phase of 27 resorts is completed this year.
But sources with knowledge of the plans said construction would halt at the end of 2026, costing dozens of jobs at RSG and hundreds at contracting firms.
The sources spoke on condition of anonymity due to the sensitivity of the matter.
"A decision was taken to stop work on Phase Two of the Red Sea projects," a senior RSG source told AFP.
"Current operating costs exceed revenues in a way that has become unsustainable," another source at the company added.
Seven sources at RSG, other giga-projects and related companies and consultancies said the Red Sea construction would be put on pause.
However, RSG insisted that it was pressing on with phase two of construction, including on the residential development of Laheq Island.
"As with any large-scale, long-term destination, Phase Two is being delivered through a sequenced approach," RSG said in a statement to AFP.
"Several projects are currently in design development, approvals, and commercial structuring, which is exactly where they should be at this stage."
Government officials acknowledge a pullback in the sprawling giga-projects after Saudi Arabia also took on board the large-scale infrastructure commitments of Expo 2030 in Riyadh and the 2034 World Cup.
"Some (giga-projects) will be scaled down. Some will be delayed," Finance Minister Mohammed al-Jadaan told AFP last month in Davos.
Low oil prices are also impacting Saudi budgets. Profits have fallen for 11 straight quarters at Saudi Aramco, the world's top oil exporter and the country's main earner.
"The consensus is that it's impossible to work on all these projects at the same time," a source at a company backed by the country's wealth fund told AFP.
"It was believed that the Red Sea project would attract more capital and generate huge returns, and that it would eventually become financially sustainable," another source working with a government project added.
"But this never happened."
The Red Sea developments include Amaala, envisaged to stretch along 68 kilometres (42 miles) of coast and cover 4,155 square kilometres (2,582 square miles), with 30 resorts and a yacht club all powered by renewable energy.
Further south, the Red Sea Project has an international airport and plans for 50 resorts, some of them on three islands.
Just north of the two sites lies another giga-project: Neom, the futuristic new city whose ambitious design is reported to have hit major problems.
The downscaling could deal a blow to Saudi hopes of transforming its Red Sea coast into a top destination for wealthy tourists, competing with the likes of the Maldives.
RSG sources said dozens of staff will lose their jobs when work stops at year's end. Dozens more are being transferred to the Diriyah and Qiddiya giga-projects in Riyadh, according to sources at those projects.
A senior employee at a project management company affiliated with the Public Investment Fund, which backs the giga-projects, said the Saudi sovereign wealth fund is "re-evaluating the whole Red Sea project."
"No more construction is approved. They are holding work on Phase Two and treating Phase One as 'proof of concept'," the source said.
RSG did not reveal occupancy rates at the 10 resorts completed so far. However, one consultant said they were "mostly sitting empty".
"The lack of alcohol played a role,m but it wasn't the main factor," the consultant said.
"High pricing and the enormous scale of the projects was a problem. They massively overestimated how many people would pay these prices."
Problems have been seen with other giga-projects. In Riyadh, work has halted on Mukaab, a cuboid skyscraper 400 meters (1,300 feet) high and wide, an architect on the project told AFP.
"From the very start, this project was unrealistic. It was just a fantasy," he said.
Neom has also pulled out of hosting the 2029 Asian Winter Games at Trojena, its under-construction ski resort, after reported problems in building it.
However, RSG said it was in "strong operational and commercial shape". The company hired more than 3,000 people in 2025, including over 900 in the last four months of the year, it said.

Rain or shine, Jerusalem’s new indoor tennis courts are a game changer

There was no better time to check out the new indoor tennis courts at Jerusalem’s Tennis and Education Center than on a rainy Wednesday afternoon.
The 14 wet outdoor courts and the padel court didn’t look very happy on this rainy day. In contrast, the indoor courts were bustling with happy children who were doing drills and playing games with their coaches.
I would have never even known about this gym had a fellow passenger in the elevator of a Jerusalem hotel, who thought I looked like his tennis coach, not mentioned it to me!
I ventured to the somewhat hard-to-get-to tennis center on that rainy day right after the school day ended, when the buses were painfully slow.
I hadn’t been back to the Jerusalem Tennis Center in the Katamon Tet neighborhood – founded in 1981 – since I spent a year of college here in 1986-1987.
What a difference 40 years makes!
The Jerusalem center is located near many buildings and complexes, such as Teddy Stadium, the Arena, and the Malha Mall, which did not exist in the mid-1980s.
To get to the new Stuart Weitzman Tennis Complex from the bus stop near Malha, I had to walk around and through the massive light rail station construction site – very much a work in progress.
When I finally found my way in, through a side entrance, what I discovered was very impressive: 18 illuminated tennis courts, a 2,000-seat stadium, a spectator gallery, a multi-purpose room, a fitness room, a practice wall, dressing rooms, offices, a sporting goods store, and a snack bar.
Beautiful gardens and plaques paying tribute to the many donors who made this fabulous complex possible were also very visible.
The four new courts at the Stuart Weitzman Tennis Complex bring the total number of indoor courts in the country to under 10. Indoor courts (like clay courts) in Israel are, simply stated, not a thing.
However, given the country’s extreme summer heat and the occasional winter rain, indoor courts make sense.
According to Dani Mizrahi, who has been manager of the tennis center for two years, indoor courts in Israel exist only in Haifa and Kiryat Shmona. In contrast to the courts in the complex, he said, “Those are under a balloon!”
Mizrahi is pleased that these courts are not fully enclosed (they have slatted facades), so they provide ventilation. However, by not being fully enclosed, they let rain come in, to which Mizrahi offered, “We are working on solutions.”
Sports facility is multipurpose
The two-story sports facility features six tennis courts on the upper level, four of which are covered. The ground floor is dedicated to other sports and provides various spaces such as a gym, four squash courts, judo facilities, and sports accommodations.
It also houses a wide range of supporting amenities, such as sports clinics and multipurpose spaces for athletes.
In addition to tennis, and very much in line with the mission of ITEC – the Israel Tennis and Education Centers, which are located in 25 centers and satellite locations throughout Israel – the Jerusalem center operates programs for children at risk, those with developmental disabilities, and Ethiopian immigrants from local absorption centers.
It also offers the Living Together Program, a national effort to bring Arab and Jewish children together through the medium of sports and informal education. And the center operates the Twinned Kindergarten Program that brings together classes of Arab and Jewish children aged four to six years and their teachers to participate in weekly motor skill development games and activities.

Former Shin Bet chiefs, officials call out Netanyahu, Zini for 'conspiracies against Ronen Bar'

Several retired Shin Bet (Israel Security Agency) chiefs and 31 former department heads issued a public letter on Friday opposing Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's comments about former Shin Bet head Ronen Bar and calling out "the silence from the current Shin Bet chief, David Zini."
"We express astonishment at the silence of the head of the Shin Bet, David Zini, in light of the unprecedented slander against former head of the service, Ronen Bar, and managers, fighters, and employees who served in the organization on 7/10, from the Prime Minister's entourage and members of the coalition," the letter read.
They also demanded a "strong response from Zini" against the comments attacking Ronen Bar, intelligence officials, soldiers, and Shin Bet employees who served in the organization before and during the October 7 massacre.
"With his actions and behavior, the Prime Minister is harming the entire security establishment and, in particular, the General Security Service - this is despicable and vile behavior," they added.
The letter mainly cited the "spread of conspiracy theories" against Shin Bet officials and the document that Netanyahu submitted to the State Comptroller.
Netanyahu's pre-October 7 intel documents
Netanyahu's office published a selection of intelligence documents, which aimed to shed light on Israel's strategic blindness leading up to the October 7 massacre, some of which were also read aloud during the Defense and Foreign Affairs Committee meeting.
The documents, spanning from February 2023 to an hour before the attack, indicate that Israel's defense echelon misread Hamas’s intentions, characterizing the terror group as deterred and seeking long-term economic arrangements.
He reportedly said during the Knesset discussion that the events of October 7 “were a severe intelligence failure, but not a betrayal.” The meeting sparked outrage among opposition MKs on the panel who left the discussion early. It went on for approximately five hours.
Among the quotes Netanyahu reportedly read were those from former prime minister Naftali Bennett. party leader and ex-IDF chief of staff Gadi Eisenkot, and former Shin Bet (Israel Security Agency) director Ronen Bar.
The Knesset confirmed that Netanyahu dedicated a significant portion of the discussion to the state comptroller’s review regarding October 7, and presented the committee with materials he had shown to the comptroller.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky met with Iran's opposition leader Crown Prince Reza Pahlavi on Friday during a trip to Munich, Germany.
"Ukraine supports the Iranian people as they are fighting for their future; we also express our sympathy to all the victims of the Iranian regime," Zelensky said in a statement.
"During our conversation, we focused on the situation in Iran and the areas where the Iranian people need support. We discussed the importance of strengthening sanctions against the Iranian regime and any other dictatorial regimes," he disclosed.
Pahlavi has been a central figure in the current round of anti-regime protests in Iran, which began at the end of December, pushing for regime change and the establishment of a democratic government.
Zelensky points out Russia-Iran cooperation
In his statement, Zelensky also called out the Russian-Iranian cooperation agreements, which include the exchange of resources and the development of military equipment.
"We condemned the cooperation between Russia and Iran, in particular the supply of 'shaheds' [drones] by the Iranian regime to Russia and the granting of licenses for their production," Zelensky wrote.
The Russian army has been using the Iranian drones for the last couple of years, with the most recent models being developed in Russia instead of Iran.
The Iranians have also been developing weapons with Russia's help, with their existing ballistic missile arsenal being recently increased amid the threat of a potential US or Israeli strike, foreign reports have said.
Among other systems, Tehran possesses a missile series with ranges of about 2,000 kilometers that place all of Israel within reach, as well as a missile that carries an especially heavy warhead and is considered among the most accurate in Iran’s arsenal.
Since Operation Rising Lion, Iran has been working intensively to rehabilitate its ballistic missile arsenal on several fronts to ensure its capabilities in a future confrontation.

Ukraine’s Heraskevych has appeal for Winter Olympic reinstatement dismissed
Ukraine’s Vladyslav Heraskevych had his appeal dismissed as images on his helmet breached an Olympic ‘sacred principle’.
The Court of Arbitration for Sport on Friday dismissed an appeal by Ukrainian skeleton racer Vladyslav Heraskevych to be reinstated in the Milano Cortina Olympics after he was disqualified over his “helmet of remembrance”.
The 27-year-old was removed from the Olympic programme on Thursday when the International Bobsleigh and Skeleton Federation jury ruled that imagery on the helmet — depicting athletes killed since Russia invaded Ukraine in February 2022 — breached rules on political neutrality.

“The CAS ad Hoc division dismissed the application and found that freedom of expression is guaranteed at the Olympic Games but not on the field of play which is a sacred principle,” CAS Secretary-General Matthieu Reeb said, reading from a statement following an eight-hour hearing.
Heraskevych, who was seeking reinstatement or at least a CAS-supervised run, pending a decision by sport’s highest court in advance of the final two runs set for Friday evening, said he would look at his legal options now.
“CAS has failed us. We will consider our next steps,” Heraskevych told Reuters.
The case has dominated headlines in the first week of the Olympics, with the International Olympic Committee President Kirsty Coventry meeting the athlete on Thursday morning at the sliding venue in Cortina d’Ampezzo in a last-minute attempt to broker a compromise and have him race without the specific helmet.
The IOC instead offered that he wear a black armband and display the helmet before and after the race, but said using the helmet in competition breached its rules on political protests and slogans in the field of play.
In a statement, CAS said the IOC guidelines for athletes’ expression in the Games were fair.
“The Sole Arbitrator found these limitations reasonable and proportionate, considering the other opportunities for athletes to raise awareness,” CAS said.
“The Sole Arbitrator considers these Guidelines provide a reasonable balance between athletes’ interests to express their views, and athletes’ interests to receive undivided attention for their sporting performance on the field of play.”
Ukraine’s Olympic Committee has backed their athlete, who is also the team’s flagbearer for the Games and also displayed a “No War in Ukraine” sign at the Beijing 2022 Olympics, days before Russia’s invasion. Heraskevych has also received support from Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy.
CAS was established in 1984 by the International Olympic Committee as an independent judicial authority to settle sports disputes worldwide.
The case has dominated headlines in the first week of the Olympics.
Before the ruling, Heraskevych accused the Milano-Cortina Games as acting as “propaganda” for Russia.

UK set to increase spending on long-range missiles
United Kingdom

The UK will spend more than £400 million this financial year on long-range precision and hypersonic weapons, as the government moves to scale up joint missile development programmes with key European allies.
In a statement issued on 13 February, the Ministry of Defence said the investment will support a range of collaborative projects with France, Germany, and Italy, with a focus on developing next-generation deep strike weapons intended to strengthen NATO deterrence and improve the UK’s ability to engage high-value targets at range.
Central to the effort is the Stratus programme, a joint UK-France-Italy initiative intended to develop a stealthy replacement for the Storm Shadow missile. According to the MOD, the project is working on both stealth and high-speed missile variants and already sustains more than 1,300 high-skilled jobs in the UK. The MOD said the missiles under development are intended to defeat high-value targets, strike enemy warships, and suppress hostile air defence systems.
Alongside this, the government said work is also progressing on a long-range strike programme with Germany, with a new joint study phase expected to begin shortly. This effort is linked to the Trinity House Agreement, signed in 2024, which established a framework for closer UK-German defence cooperation. The future weapon system, described as “Deep Precision Strike”, is expected to have a range exceeding 2,000 km and is planned to enter service in the 2030s. The MOD described it as likely to be among the most advanced weapons systems ever designed by the UK.
Defence Secretary John Healey said the new spending reflects the lessons of Ukraine and the need to strengthen allied capability in the face of rising threats. “To meet this new era of rising threats, we need hard power, strong alliances and sure diplomacy.” He added: “We can see from the war in Ukraine the decisive impact of long-range precision weapons, so the UK is stepping up, investing more than £400 million for long-range and hypersonic weapons this year.”
Healey said the UK’s cooperation with Germany, France and Italy would help deliver advanced new capabilities for NATO. “Alongside Germany, France and Italy, we will deliver the cutting-edge weapons that will keep the UK and NATO safe, boost deterrence, and build a new deal for European security.”
The MOD said hypersonics funding will cover critical technology development, ground and flight testing, and support for academic training, including postgraduate study.
The announcement comes ahead of the Munich Security Conference, where Healey is expected to hold discussions with European and international partners on long-range weapons programmes, industrial cooperation, and continued support for Ukraine.

Egypt targets dissidents abroad, punishes families at home: report
Cairo is increasingly using transnational repression to target political dissidents and activists abroad, while also persecuting their families inside Egypt, a new report published by the Egyptian Human Rights Forum on Wednesday warned.
The report draws on primary and secondary data collected between January 2022 and September 2025, as well as surveys and testimonies from 34 Egyptian dissidents living across multiple countries. It sheds new light on how Egyptian authorities are tightening their grip on critics beyond the country’s borders.
EHRF documented systematic violations, including the denial of passports and identity documents, revocation of citizenship, prosecutions in absentia based on fabricated charges, placement on terrorism lists, cyber harassment, digital surveillance, hacking, and coordinated smear campaigns.
Almost two-thirds of those surveyed had been denied passports, identity papers, or basic consular services, the group said, leaving many in precarious legal situations in their host countries. This reflects a recurring and deliberate pattern rather than isolated incidents, the report added.
Around 72 percent of respondents said their relatives in Egypt had been subjected to police summonses, home raids, or travel bans in retaliation for their activism abroad.
Nearly half of those surveyed reported receiving direct threats via phone calls or messages, or being prosecuted in absentia.
Abdelrahman Ayyash, the lead researcher for the rights group, told The New Arab: "The regime has realised that they don't need to physically arrest a dissident in Europe or the U.S to silence them by putting them on a terror list, denying them a passport, or arresting their family members back home, they can create an open-air prison for activists anywhere in the world.
"And when an authoritarian regime uses international policing tools like Interpol diffusions to silence human rights defenders and journalists with European passports and residencies, it isn't just an Egyptian human rights issue, it is a direct violation of the host countries' sovereignty."
The report also highlights a growing trend of countries allied with Cairo arresting or deporting Egyptian activists despite being aware they could face persecution. EHRF named Bahrain, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, and the UAE among the states accused of cooperating with Egypt in such cases.
According to the report, the repression is carried out by several Egyptian state bodies, primarily the Security Agency and the General Intelligence Directorate, which it says work closely with the foreign ministry to "exploit diplomatic missions as tools of pressure against Egyptians abroad".
"Diplomatic missions have been weaponised and used as organs of intimidation, while smear campaigns and online trolling have escalated, targeting families inside Egypt to silence voices abroad," the report said. "This is not a series of isolated incidents, but a deliberate strategy to suppress dissent wherever it may be found."
EHRF said the targeting of activists has left some individuals stranded without citizenship or valid travel documents, placing their legal residency at risk. Others live in constant fear of surveillance or physical attack.
The rights group said Egypt’s actions violate its obligations under international human rights law, including the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, the Convention Against Torture, and the 1951 Refugee Convention.
A growing concern, the report added, is that law enforcement authorities in host countries often fail to recognise these cases as transnational repression, instead treating them as personal disputes or isolated incidents of harassment.
One case cited is that of Germany-based Egyptian journalist Basma Mostafa, whose situation has been documented by the UN. While the threat she faces has been acknowledged, EHRF said, institutional responses have failed to keep pace with the level of risk.
Kuwait was singled out as the country that has allegedly worked most openly with Egypt on the issue.
"In June 2023, Kuwait showed the same cooperation in the case of engineer Sayyed al-Shuwayhi, an Egyptian-Turkish dissident residing in Istanbul," the report said.
It said that similar cooperation was seen in June 2023, when Kuwait deported engineer Sayyed al Shuwayhi, an Egyptian-Turkish dissident who had been residing in Istanbul.
Turkey, which has long served as a refuge for Egyptian exiles, was also criticised for tightening residency and work permit procedures for some activists, particularly those with political or media profiles, creating what the report described as a climate of fear and uncertainty.
EHRF further accused Egyptian authorities of misusing Interpol by issuing Red Notices against dissidents based on politically motivated charges.
The report calls on the Egyptian government to end its intimidation practices, halt violations of international law, and stop punitive consular measures that deny citizens passports or basic documentation. It also urges other states to guarantee the safety of Egyptian activists and to review cooperation with Cairo that could expose individuals to persecution.

Restaurant diners left hangry after Costco gift card vendor goes bankrupt
‘We fully recognize and sincerely regret the impact this decision has had on our cardholders and the many local restaurants,’ the company said

The bankruptcy of a gift card vendor in six states has left consumers hungry for redemption.
San Diego-based Synergy World announced on its website that it was shutting down its restaurant gift card program due to bankruptcy. The company, which had been in business for 19 years, offered gift cards through Costco. Restaurants in its network were located in Arizona, California, Colorado, Nevada, New Mexico and Texas, according to its website.
“It is with a heavy heart that Synergy World has made the difficult decision to discontinue the Synergy Restaurant Gift Card Program,” the company said in an announcement on its website. “We fully recognize and sincerely regret the impact this decision has had on our cardholders and the many local restaurants.”
The Independent reached out to Synergy World and Costco for comment but did not receive a response.
Synergy World gave its restaurant gift card customers until January 31 to redeem their cards, but the rush of cardholders trying to use their balances before the deadline led the company to discontinue the program before the deadline arrived, according to a statement.
San Diego restaurant owner Joey Busalacci tried to redeem as many Synergy cards as he could before the deadline, but he told San Diego-based KUSI News that the company eventually stopped communicating with vendors and the cards no longer worked.
The decision to shut down operations led to confusion and urgency among customers, some of whom took to social media to find a solution.
Facebook group Albuquerque Foodies posted on January 30 that “Synergy gift cards are no more.” Several commenters noted that Costco was offering store credit or refunds for those with receipts, while others said at least one restaurant in the area was swapping the Synergy gift cards with the restaurant’s own gift cards.
Participants in a Costco subreddit on Reddit offered a flurry of responses to post alerting users to the Synergy shutdown. Several commenters confirmed that Costco was offering refunds on unused Synergy gift cards.
Synergy’s systems were slow in the final days of operation, alleged one commenter who said they returned 12 Synergy gift cards to a Costco on January 29. The Costco customer service associate handling the return had to verify over the phone that each of the 12 cards was unused and, allegedly, had to repeat some card numbers multiple times to get verification.

Review and forecast of the hryvnia exchange rate against key currencies by KYT Group analysts

Review and forecast of hryvnia exchange rate against key currencies by KYT Group analysts
Issue No. 1 – February 2026
The purpose of this review is to provide an analysis of the current situation on the Ukrainian currency market and a forecast of the hryvnia exchange rate against key currencies based on current data. We consider the current conditions, market dynamics, key influencing factors, and likely scenarios.
Analysis of the current situation on the currency market
International context
After the Fed left its key rate unchanged at the end of January, the number of forecasts for the rate to remain at its current level for the next few months increased in the US. The Bureau of Labor Statistics reported that non-farm payrolls in the US rose by 130,000 in January, while the unemployment rate fell from 4.4% to 4.3%. This indicates that interest rates are likely to remain unchanged, because if the labor market is improving, there are no fears of a market slowdown, which was a major reason for the Fed's rate cuts last year.
Recall that at the end of January, the Fed Committee left the central bank's base interest rate in the range of 3.50-3.75% after lowering it at each of the last three meetings in 2025. Moreover, the higher-than-expected job growth in January may give the Fed confidence in the stabilization of the labor market and motivate the central bank to focus on controlling inflation, which remains above the Fed's 2% target. The US consumer price index rose 0.3% month-on-month and 2.7% year-on-year in December last year, which is stable compared to November 2025.
As for the economy, US GDP grew by 4.4% year-on-year in the third quarter, and this pace is expected to slow slightly during 2026, but still exceed 2%. Some economists believe that the next Fed rate cut is likely to occur no earlier than mid-June 2026. However, everything will depend on labor market indicators and inflation rates in the US. Interestingly, according to media reports, in his five speeches on the economy since December, Donald Trump has claimed that inflation has been overcome and prices have fallen almost 30 times, which, of course, contradicts the actual economic data.
As for the EUR/USD pair, during the first half of February, the dollar managed to strengthen slightly compared to January, reaching 1.1874. This was facilitated by both the Fed's decision to leave the rate unchanged and the optimistic US labor market indicators and investors' hopes that inflation would not exceed the forecast for this year. However, there is no certainty about the Fed's future policy, and some analysts have already suggested that the Fed may start cutting rates more aggressively, causing the dollar to fall by 10% during 2026. Among the risk factors that will affect the dollar is the change in the Fed's leadership, as many believe that the successor to current Chairman Jerome Powell will face pressure from President Donald Trump to lower borrowing costs, leading to several rate cuts in 2026.
Meanwhile, in Europe, the ECB is keeping key rates unchanged, and most economists say the central bank will stick to this policy throughout 2026. The fact is that inflation in the eurozone is considered to be under control, although there are risks of a decline amid the strengthening of the euro. With interest rates already low at 2% and inflation hovering around the ECB's target of 2%, the ECB is in no hurry to change its monetary policy. The strong euro is not particularly welcome news for Europeans, as it makes imports cheaper for buyers in the eurozone, which affects inflation, and further strengthening of the euro could potentially require changes in interest rates. However, the EU is currently stable, and the economy is performing even better than expected: GDP in the fourth quarter of 2025 grew by 0.3% compared to the previous quarter, exceeding Bloomberg's consensus forecast by 0.2%.
Internal Ukrainian context
In the first half of February, there was no stress on the Ukrainian currency market, and the hryvnia depreciated insignificantly against the US dollar: at the beginning of the month, the official exchange rate was 42.84 UAH/USD, and at the end of the second week of February, it was 43.03 UAH/USD. The slow fluctuation was traditionally facilitated by NBU interventions: since the beginning of January, according to official NBU data, the regulator has injected more than $4.33 billion into the market.
Inflation rates in Ukraine are declining. The NBU forecasts that inflation will be 7.5% at the end of 2026 and will remain close to the 5% target in the future, reaching it in 2028. The economy will grow by 1.8% in 2026, and in the following years, the recovery will accelerate to 3-4% per year. National Bank experts believe that inflation will decline in the coming months, primarily due to the residual effects of crop growth in 2025. At the same time, the consequences of large-scale destruction in the energy sector will put pressure on prices through both market and administrative mechanisms.
The NBU's Inflation Report for January 2026 states that international aid will be sufficient to finance the budget deficit without resorting to debt issuance. The NBU has left its assumption regarding the budget deficit in 2026 unchanged at around 19% of GDP, which is in line with the State Budget Law. The NBU assumes that Ukraine will receive $51.4 billion from international partners in 2026, $42.7 billion in 2027, and $21.6 billion in 2028. This will allow international reserves to be maintained at a sufficient level to support the stability of the currency market. The main hopes for supporting the state budget this year are linked to the EU Council's decision to allocate €90 billion to Ukraine in 2026 and 2027, as well as the current ERA Loans mechanism.
As of early February, Ukraine's international reserves had grown to $57.66 billion. According to the National Bank, in January, they increased by $357.8 million compared to December, primarily due to external financing, which offset the National Bank's net currency sales and the country's debt payments in foreign currency. The current volume of international reserves provides financing for six months of future imports.
US dollar exchange rate: dynamics and analysis
General characteristics of market behavior
During the first half of February, the US dollar strengthened on the Ukrainian currency market. At the beginning of the month, the interbank exchange rate was 42.9 UAH/USD, and on February 12, it was already at 43.05 UAH/USD.
On the cash market, there were slight devaluation fluctuations between February 1 and 13, and the purchase rate in mid-February reached a range of 42.59–42.85 UAH/USD, while the sale rate remained within the range of 43.15–43.4 UAH/USD. Meanwhile, at bank cash desks and exchange offices, the spread between the buying and selling rates changed only slightly compared to January, amounting to 0.5–0.6 UAH/USD.
Key influencing factors
· International context. The dollar began to strengthen against the euro due to growing investor optimism about inflation and the apparent trend toward improvement in the labor market, which promises predictable Fed policy and no sharp changes in rates in the near future.
· International reserves are at a high level: as of early February 2026, they reached USD 57.66 billion.
· The National Bank supports the currency market with regular interventions: the interbank exchange rate is gradually weakening without any sharp movements, and since the beginning of the year, the NBU has injected more than $4.33 billion into the market.
Forecast
· Short term (1–2 weeks): base range of 43.3–43.8 UAH/USD with possible fluctuations towards a weaker hryvnia.
· Medium term (2–3 months): 43.50–44.60 UAH/USD. The dollar is expected to gradually strengthen on the international market due to the stabilization of the labor market and decent macroeconomic data, as well as the absence of sharp changes in the Fed's policy on the base rate. In Ukraine, the hryvnia exchange rate will be influenced by the level of demand for currency on the interbank market, which may increase in February–March, in particular due to another series of massive enemy attacks on energy facilities, which will lead to the need to purchase expensive imported equipment. The exchange rate will also be influenced by the situation on the front lines and political statements and forecasts regarding the possible end of the full-scale war.
· Long term (6+ months): A gradual devaluation of the hryvnia against the dollar is expected, as well as regular and large-scale support for the market through currency interventions by the NBU. The benchmark for the first half of 2026 is 43.5–44.95 UAH/$.
Euro exchange rate: dynamics and analysis
General characteristics of market behavior
During the first half of February, the euro fluctuated on the Ukrainian market: initially, the hryvnia strengthened against the euro, and the official euro exchange rate at the beginning of February was 51.24 UAH/EUR, and five days later it was already 50.89 UAH/EUR. However, in the middle of the month, the euro began to strengthen and reached 51.20 UAH/EUR. In the cash segment, the euro also fell in January. While at the beginning of February, the euro purchase rate in banks and exchange offices was 51 UAH/EUR, and the sale rate was 51.95 UAH/EUR, in mid-February, the purchase rate was 50.8 UAH/EUR, and the sale rate was 51.45 UAH/EUR.
Key observations
· Exchange rate geometry: The selling rate for cash euros in mid-February 2026 is at the level of 51.29–51.50 UAH/EUR.
The dynamics of the euro exchange rate were influenced by the strengthening of the dollar on the international market, as well as the narrowing of the spread between the buying and selling rates to 0.2–04 UAH/EUR.
· Supply and demand: Demand for the euro fell slightly on the interbank market in February 2026, and demand for the euro also declined on the cash market in Ukraine. Between February 10 and 12 alone, the euro exchange rate on the interbank market fell from 51.37 UAH/EUR to 51.03 UAH/EUR.
Key influencing factors
· Global context: The euro is falling against the US dollar, which is strengthening in February amid optimistic forecasts for the development of the US economy.
· Domestic market: the euro continues to follow the dollar in strengthening, but the pace of the euro's strengthening is currently quite limited, which is explained, in particular, by the relatively low level of demand.
· Behavioral factor: in Ukraine, there is no rush demand for the euro in mid-February, and spreads between exchange rates are steadily narrowing. However, everything may change if the recent massive shelling of energy infrastructure leads to an increase in the need to purchase equipment in the EU for euros, which will play on the growth in demand and, accordingly, lead to new exchange rate jumps.
Forecast
· Short term (1–2 weeks): the euro on the interbank market will remain in the range of 51.2–51.8 UAH/€ with a tendency to move towards the upper limit.
· Medium term (2–3 months): No significant strengthening of the dollar is expected on the international market, so the euro will remain strong. In Ukraine, the euro exchange rate will be influenced by demand for the euro due to the need to import from the EU, but relatively low demand on the cash market will not allow the euro exchange rate to deviate significantly from the interbank market.
The exchange rate benchmark is 51.6–54.5 UAH/EUR.
· Long term (6+ months): the euro may rise to 54.8–56.5 UAH/EUR in the first half of 2026.
Recommendations: dollar or euro — buy, sell, or wait?
USD/UAH
The dollar is strengthening on the international market thanks to optimistic expectations and updated data on the labor market and inflation, which showed stable development of the US economy and a reduction in risks. However, “black swans” in the form of a change in the Fed's leadership and further pressure from Donald Trump on the central bank to implement a significant reduction in rates during 2026 cannot be ruled out.
Overall, the dollar looks quite vulnerable, given the unpredictability of President Trump's policies and possible new tariff surprises from the US. However, positive sentiment prevails for now, which is reflected in the value of defensive assets.
In Ukraine, the hryvnia is under strong pressure from increased demand for foreign currency, and economic risks associated with the war, destroyed energy infrastructure, and the lack of even partial predictability of further developments in the hostilities do not give the national currency much room for strengthening. Building up savings in dollars will remain the basis for investors throughout 2026 as part of both medium- and long-term strategies. The expected weakening of the hryvnia exchange rate only adds to the appeal of accumulating dollars. Speculative income can be obtained both from fluctuations in the hryvnia against the dollar and from frequent and irregular fluctuations in the euro exchange rate.
EUR/UAH
The euro has been losing ground in recent weeks, but this is not a signal to exit euro savings, as the main forecasts for 2026 are still linked to the strengthening of the euro, although significant fluctuations cannot be ruled out. It is precisely these fluctuations that will allow investors to profitably enter into investments in euros and also exit them with a profit, especially when it comes to a medium-term strategy. The liquidity of the euro will remain high thanks to the stable development of the eurozone economy and the ECB's predictable conservative strategy.
Overall strategy
The Federal Reserve is not currently planning any changes to the base rate, which was left unchanged at the last meeting at the end of January.
Optimistic sentiments about the active development of the US economy are motivating investors to return to dollar assets, and the dollar's exchange rate against the euro is gradually strengthening. However, the temporary stability is fragile, and further fluctuations in the other direction are possible in the near future. Unlike the US, the EU economy is moving slowly but surely towards growth, and inflation in the eurozone is more controlled and predictable. All this gives reason to expect uneven and multidirectional fluctuations in the dollar exchange rate in the coming months.
Ukraine has accumulated a large amount of international reserves, sufficient for six months of imports, and has planned amounts of aid from partner countries, which are positive factors that may somewhat curb the devaluation trend. However, in the long term, the hryvnia will weaken in 2026 due to the ongoing war of attrition, problems with the state budget deficit, and negative investor expectations regarding the economic situation. Nevertheless, the pace of devaluation will be controlled by the NBU, which will remain the main player in the currency market. The NBU will carry out currency interventions to the extent necessary to satisfy demand and prevent sharp fluctuations in the exchange rate. In this situation, investors should focus on their own currency strategies, planning to buy dollars and euros in a timely manner, which will be the base currencies of their portfolios and will allow them to carry out profitable currency exchange transactions at any convenient time.

A US shipment of medicines and medical supplies to Venezuela signals a new era of cooperation
The United States has sent a shipment of medicines and medical supplies to Venezuela, reflecting what many say is a new spirit of cooperation between the two countries
- Bookmark
A shipment from the United States of medicines and medical supplies arrived in Venezuela on Friday, reflecting the new spirit of cooperation between the two countries following the stunning capture last month of then-President Nicolás Maduro.
Laura Dogu, the U.S. top diplomat in the South American country, and Venezuelan diplomat Félix Plasencia, received the shipment containing 6 metric tons of medications at the airport outside Venezuela's capital, Caracas.
“It’s very important to stabilize the health system here in Venezuela,” Dogu told reporters at the airport in Maiquetía. She added that the shipment was “the first of many donations” that will arrive “in the coming days.”
Venezuela's complex crisis, which began more than a decade ago, led to the collapse of the country's public health care system. Hospitals are so poorly equipped that patients are asked to provide supplies needed for their care, from syringes to surgical screws.
Plasencia described the donation as a "message of cooperation among two sovereign countries.
"We’re doing the best for our people," he said.

MOSCOW, February 13. /TASS/. The average maximal interest rate on ruble deposits with the ten Russian credit institutions having the maximal amount of private deposits declined to 14.49% per annum in early February 2025, the Central Bank of Russia said.
The rate was at the level of 14.88% per annum in the second ten-day period of January 2026 and 14.57% per annum in late January.
Deposit interest rates are monitored by the regulator in Sberbank, Sovcombank, VTB, Gazprombank, the Credit Bank of Moscow, Alfa-Bank, T-Bank, Promsvyazbank, Bank DOM.RF, and the Russian Agricultural Bank.
The regulator said earlier that it would keep an eye on cases when the bank’s interest rate for ruble deposits is more than 2 percentage points higher than the average one for ten monitored banks. The decision taken by the Central Bank is aimed at reducing the interest risk for banks arising when attracting retail deposits at rates above the market ones and contributes to financial stability of credit institutions, the regulator said.

Boots launches first high street service for weight loss jabs
Until now, almost all weight-loss prescriptions by Boots were issued after an online consultation, rather than face-to-face
- Bookmark
- CommentsGo to comments
Weight-loss jab users will now be able to pop into Boots for their prescriptions on their lunch break after the high street pharmacy launched an in-store service.
The pilot scheme, which started this week, saw drugs including Wegovy and Mounjaro being prescribed to customers in 17 stores across Britain.
About 1.6million adults in the UK use weight-loss drugs. The medication – which works by mimicking the natural hormone that regulates blood sugar, appetite and digestion – can’t be bought over the counter and must be prescribed by a qualified healthcare professional, such as a GP or pharmacist, following a consultation.
Until now, almost all weight-loss prescriptions by Boots were issued after an online consultation, rather than face-to-face. But this new scheme will see patients have a consultation in a private room where their medical history will be taken, and weight and height measured, to determine if they are eligible.
Jamie Kerruish, chief healthcare officer at Boots, believes the scheme will make it more convenient for customers to access weight-loss jabs, because people can “pop into a store on their lunch break or after work,” The Times reported.
The move to in-store consultations follows safety concerns that people are lying about their weight or submitting fake photos to obtain the injections from some online pharmacies.
Weight-loss injections, also known as GLP-1 receptor agonists, are a prescribed drug and to access them on the NHS a patient needs to have a BMI of 40 or more, but private providers offer them to those with a BMI over 30. As a result the demand for weight-loss jabs from private pharmacies has soared.
Boots has been selling Wegovy, manufactured by Novo Nordisk, for three years. It also sells Mounjaro, which is offered on the NHS.
Prices start at £99.97 for the lowest dose of Wegovy and £176.97 for the lowest dose of Mounjaro. The in-store service will offer access to the same treatment as the Boots Online Doctor service, and at the same price.
“We know that people have different preferences for how they access healthcare services – some seeking online support and some wanting in-person conversations with their local practitioner,” Mr Kerruish said.
“The launch of our in-store weight-loss treatment service alongside our digital offer delivered through Boots Online Doctor means we can now deliver convenient care to people both online or in person,” he added.
Mr Kerruish explained the service is for anyone whose lives are affected by obesity and in addition to offering weight-loss jabs, they also provide support to help people make lifestyle and behavioural changes.
Here is a list of Boots stores offering the weight-loss drug service:
- Nottingham, Victoria Centre, Nottinghamshire
- Cardiff, Queen Street, Wales
- Durham, Market Place, County Durham
- Belfast, Donegal Place, Northern Ireland
- Edinburgh, Princes Street, Scotland
- Newcastle, Sidgate, Tyne and Wear
- St Albans, St Peters Street, Hertfordshire
- London, Liverpool Steet Station
- Leicester, Fosse Park, Leicestershire
- Brighton, North Street, East Sussex
- London, Piccadilly Circus
- Dartford, Blue Water, Kent

Nuclear treaty that kept world peace just expired: What happens now?
Unknown

02:24:23 KST

Washington DC — A cornerstone of global nuclear restraint has quietly fallen away.
With the expiry of the New START treaty earlier this month, the United States and Russia have entered unfamiliar territory, with no binding caps, no verified limits, and rising uncertainty over how the world’s two largest nuclear powers will manage their arsenals in the years ahead.
Noted political analyst Dr Stephen J. Farnsworth, Professor of Political Science at the University of Mary Washington, told TRT World, “The expiration of the treaty may lead to a dangerous and expensive expansion of the nuclear arsenals of Russia and the US.”
The New START treaty, signed in 2010 by Presidents Barack Obama and Russia’s Dmitry Medvedev, capped each side at 1,550 deployed strategic nuclear warheads on up to 700 delivery systems, intercontinental ballistic missiles, submarine-launched missiles, and heavy bombers.
It included mechanisms for on-site inspections, regular data exchanges, and notifications that increased transparency and reduced the risk of deadly miscalculation.
These measures helped stabilise US-Russia relations after the Cold War, when earlier pacts like START I began reducing vast stockpiles.
The treaty entered into force in 2011 and was extended in 2021 for five years, running until February 5, 2026. Inspections halted during the COVID-19 pandemic and never resumed.
Voluntary limits continue
Russia suspended participation in 2023 amid tensions over Ukraine, though it said it would respect the numerical caps until expiration.
With the pact now lapsed, the US and Russia, which together hold nearly 90 percent of global nuclear warheads, more than 10,500 combined, face no binding restraints on deployments or modernisation.
China adds further complexity. Its arsenal, estimated at around 600 warheads, is growing by roughly 100 annually and could exceed 1,000 by 2030.
The expiration follows failed diplomacy.
In 2025, Russian President Vladimir Putin offered to voluntarily observe New START limits for another year if the US reciprocated, warning that a lapse could destabilise global security and spur proliferation.
US President Donald Trump rejected the proposal, calling New START a “badly negotiated deal” and insisting on a “new, improved, and modernised” treaty that includes China.
Beijing has rejected that condition, citing its smaller arsenal and urging bilateral US-Russia talks instead.
Russia says it will continue to observe the limits set under the recently-expired New START nuclear arms reduction treaty if the US does the same, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said on Wednesday.
"We proceed from the fact that this moratorium, on our part, which was announced by our president, will remain in effect, but only as long as the United States does not exceed the aforementioned limits," Lavrov said, addressing the lower house of Russia's parliament.
Lavrov described personal relations between Putin and Trump as "excellent," saying that their "mutual sympathy and respect helped create the atmosphere that allowed them to reach understanding" on specific issues during their August summit in Anchorage, Alaska.
He emphasised that while the Kremlin hasn't yet launched a "strategic dialogue" with the Trump administration, "we are always open for such dialogue."
Wider ripple effects
Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov also said last week that Russia would "retain its responsible, thorough approach to stability when it comes to nuclear weapons."
Even without treaty limits, both powers retain monitoring capabilities through satellites and intelligence systems. The absence of verified data sharing, however, raises the risk of misperception in an already low-trust climate.
A White House official told the US news network CBS News that Trump would decide the future course on nuclear arms control, adding he would clarify it "which he will clarify on his own timeline."
The end of New START closes a chapter that began with the 1972 SALT I agreement, when sustained dialogue gradually reduced arsenals from Cold War peaks.
Attention may now shift towards qualitative advances, more precise, survivable, or hypersonic systems, rather than sheer numbers.
Without renewed engagement among nuclear powers, experts fear a return to unchecked competition that could unsettle global stability for decades.
Farnsworth stressed the wider ripple effects, noting that “European nations and China, which were not part of the agreement, benefitted from the decades of reduced nuclear tensions between the US and Russia and before that the Soviet Union, when this treaty and others that existed earlier on were in place.”
He warned that “these nations may choose to expand their own nuclear arsenals in response to the greater international uncertainty that follows the end of the treaty.”

UAE harnesses AI to slash bureaucracy and speed up public services

The UAE is using AI to cut bureaucracy, speed up public services and test new technologies, presenting their work at the World Governments Summit in Dubai, which promoted global dialogue.
The United Arab Emirates has set out to be an innovator in implementing artificial intelligence and related new technologies to develop reforms in government services.
On the sidelines of the recent World Governments Summit in Dubai, where AI was one of the central focuses, Chief of Government Services of the United Arab Emirates Government Mohammed Bin Taliah, told Euronews that the global forum was a stage for governments to compare approaches to refining public services.
AI was the dominant theme across sessions on governance and digital transformation. Governments are increasingly using AI not only to automate workflows but to redesign how citizens interact with the state.
As reducing bureaucracy in public services has always been an objective for the UAE, the UAE government launched the zero-bureaucracy programme in 2023 as a practical attempt to remove unnecessary processes from public services.
“In 2023, the UAE launched the zero-bureaucracy program,” Bin Taliah said, adding that “this program is focused on eliminating bureaucracy and government procedures and processes in public services.”
From one week to 10 minutes
According to Bin Taliah, the programme's initial phase exceeded its targets.
Technology, particularly artificial intelligence, has played a growing role in enabling those changes, he said, allowing processes that once took days to be completed in minutes.
“With AI today, we have achieved improvement in services,” he said. “And in some cases, the services that take around one working week to be completed are now completed in less than 10 minutes.”
He said tools such as facial recognition and optical character recognition are now being used to automate processes that previously required multiple manual steps.
He pointed to everyday examples, such as airport processing, to illustrate how digital systems can reshape interactions between governments and the public.
“If you pass through Abu Dhabi or Dubai airport, you see that today our airports are queue-less,” he said. “Everything, you can pass through smart gates that use spatial biometrics, which allows you to pass through this.”
Bin Taliah told Euronews that the recent World Government Summit has grown into a convening platform for practical strategies to improve government services.
“The World Government Summit is a platform that brings everybody together in one place on a neutral platform to discuss how to make people's lives better, how to make governments more efficient, to serve people faster and deliver better value to citizens around the world," he said.
Not only innovate, accelerate
Meanwhile, UAE Minister of State for Artificial Intelligence, Digital Economy and Remote Work Applications and Vice-Chair of the World Governments Summit Omar Sultan Al Olama told Euronews that the UAE want to deploy AI at record pace.
“Well, if the UAE has to be in the same conversation or in the sentence, I'll say the UAE innovates, but not just innovates, it accelerates,” he said. “We want to deploy AI the fastest.”
He said the country’s diversity and agile governance model enable it to serve as a testing ground for new technologies while remaining open to collaboration across geopolitical divides.
“We can work with east, west, north, and south,” he said. “To be a common place where everyone brings their best AI tools and deploys, and sees how they can compete with the others, but also collaborate with others.”
On the UAE’s wider diplomatic role, Al Olama said the country aims to act as a neutral convener amid increasingly fragmented global dialogue.
“The world requires a place where, whether it's adversaries, whether it is different geographies, to at least have dialog,” he said. “The UAE prides itself on being that, being a place where the world can convene.”
He pointed to past and continuing diplomatic efforts as evidence of that approach.
“All of these things are possible because the UAE does not choose sides,” he said. “We try to be in the middle. We try to work with everyone.”
'We don't preach'
Asked how the World Governments Summit can help navigate worldwide turbulence, Al Olama said sustained dialogue remains the only viable route forward.
“So, if we think about turbulence, the only way through turbulence is, especially when it comes to geopolitical turbulence, is increased dialogue, trying to find the commonalities between leaders, between countries, trying to understand where the pain points are, and finding the bridges to that gap.”
He said the scale of participation at the summit shows a global demand for such engagement.
“A platform like the World Governments Summit that brings together more than 45 heads of state and government, that brings hundreds of ministers, so we have around 600 ministers from around the world participating this year, and thousands of CEOs and international organisations and others, is a platform for dialogue.”
Al Olama added that the event is designed to expose governments to policy approaches and solutions from across the world, encouraging learning and adaptation rather than prescription.
“We don't preach,” he said. “We want to make sure that everyone's point of view is represented, that we have the best-in-class ways of solving problems, the best-in-class government opportunities that exist in every corner of the world presented at the World Governments Summit.”
AI, climate intervention, flying cars, and education reforms dominated discussions at the World Governments Summit 2026, where more than 45 heads of state and around 600 ministers, plus over 500 CEOs gathered in Dubai.

How to follow: We’ll have all the buildup on Al Jazeera Sport from 17:00 GMT in advance of our text commentary stream.
Trent Alexander-Arnold’s Real Madrid career has not got off the ground yet, but fit again after injury, the England right-back could be crucial for the Spanish giants in the second half of the season.

With Alvaro Arbeloa’s side still taking shape following the coach’s arrival in January, Alexander-Arnold has the chance to make himself a key part of the club’s battle for silverware.
Pellegrino Matarazzo’s in-form Real Sociedad visit the Santiago Bernabeu on Saturday in La Liga, in what promises to be an enticing clash.
Arbeloa’s Madrid are looking to move two points clear of Barcelona and take the lead in La Liga before the Catalans visit Girona on Monday.
Al Jazeera Sport takes a look at Saturday’s headline fixture in La Liga.
Will Alexander Arnold start for Real Madrid against Sociedad?
Former Liverpool full-back Alexander-Arnold, who came off the bench last weekend as Madrid beat Valencia, could potentially start for the first time since December 3.
After a decent early showing for Madrid at the Club World Cup last year, hamstring and thigh injuries have stopped him from settling in, limiting him to 12 appearances across all competitions this season.
“After [he’s had] a long time out, we will proceed with caution,” said Arbeloa after Alexander-Arnold’s return, with Spanish newspaper AS reporting Madrid’s aim is for him to start against Benfica in the Champions League playoff round on February 17.
Even if Arbeloa uses veteran Dani Carvajal or youngster David Jimenez to start against Real Sociedad, the expectation is for Alexander-Arnold to get more crucial minutes under his belt.
How are Real Sociedad faring in La Liga this season?
Real Sociedad are unbeaten in nine matches but are eighth in the table – 14 points off fourth place and the crucial UEFA Champions League qualification spots.
Matarazzo’s side did, however, defeat champions Barcelona last month and have one foot in the Copa del Rey final after a semifinal first leg win at rivals Athletic Bilbao this week.
Sociedad are also coming off a 1-0 win at Basque Country rival Athletic Bilbao in the first leg of the Copa del Rey semifinals.
Will Vinicius and Mbappe’s dinner give Madrid food for thought?
Real Madrid is counting on a team-bonding dinner reportedly paid for by its biggest stars to boost its late-season pursuit of the La Liga and Champions League trophies.
Vinicius Junior and Kylian Mbappe paid the bill at the restaurant in Madrid on Tuesday, midfielder Dani Ceballos told reporters. The tab ran in excess of 1,000 euros ($1,100), according to accounts by Spanish media.
Vinicius posted a photo of the entire squad during the dinner near the city centre in a fancy location that features an “Art Dining Club.”
Fans waited outside the restaurant to try to talk to the players after the dinner, which went well past midnight.
Coach Alvaro Arbeloa and his assistants were not part of the dinner, Spanish media said.
The show of unity came a week before Madrid faces Benfica in the first leg of the knockout playoffs of the Champions League. The team dropped out of the top eight that automatically qualified for the round of 16 after a 4-2 loss at the same as Benfica in the final round of the league phase.
Defender Raul Asencio told media that after the dinner, the team was “very united.”
Why has Real Madrid struggled this season?
Madrid went through turmoil at the end of last year, with some players reportedly not on the same page with coach Xabi Alonso.
Under Arbeloa, Madrid was eliminated by second-tier Albacete in the Copa del Rey round of 16, and lost to Benfica in the match that relegated the team to the Champions League’s knockout playoffs.
With the bad-tempered Bernabeu crowd on their own team’s backs in recent weeks, the chance to move top of the table could settle the natives.
How is the La Liga race shaping up for Real Madrid and Barcelona?
Madrid has won seven in a row to be one point behind leader Barcelona.
Barcelona will look to win its fourth in a row in the league against a Girona that was in 12th place and was winless in its last three matches.
Barcelona is coming off a resounding 4-0 loss to Atletico Madrid in the first leg of the Copa del Rey on Thursday, when it conceded all goals in a disastrous first half.
It had won 17 of its last 18 matches in all competitions before the defeat. The last setback had been losing 2-1 at Sociedad in the league last month.
Third-placed Atletico will face lowly Rayo Vallecano on Sunday, while fourth-placed Villarreal is at mid-table Getafe.
What happened the last time Real Madrid met Sociedad?
Los Blancos were 2-1 winners against Sociedad in September’s reverse fixture in La Liga.
Kylian Mbappe and Arda Guler scored either side of Dean Huijsen’s sending off in the first half.
Mikel Oyarzabal’s 56th-minute penalty offered the home side hope, but they were unable to further make the most of their numerical advantage.
Head-to-head
This is the 184th meeting between the teams, with Madrid winning on 103 occasions and Sociedad claiming the spoils in 38 of the contests.
The first fixture was played in April 1905, with Madrid winning the Copa del Rey meeting 3-0.
Real Madrid team news
Mbappe trained separately from the squad on Thursday because of a knee issue and became doubtful for Saturday’s game.
He had already been held to gym work on Wednesday. The club did not immediately give any details about his condition.
Vinicius was set to be back with Madrid after missing the previous league game because of a yellow card suspension, but Jude Bellingham will remain sidelined with a hamstring injury.
Predicted Real Madrid starting lineup (4-3-3)
Courtois; Alexander-Arnold, Asencio, Huijsen, Carreras; Valverde, Tchouameni, Camavinga; Brahim, Mbappe, Vinicius
Real Sociedad team news
Brais Mendez is suspended for the trip to Madrid, while Takefusa Kubo and Unai Marrero are both absent with hamstring and facial injuries, respectively.
Arsen Zakharyan, Ander Barrenetxea and Luka Sucic have slight niggles and face late fitness tests.
Predicted Real Sociedad starting lineup (4-2-3-1)
Remiro; Odriozola, Martin, Caleta-Car, Gomez; Gorrotxategi, Turrientes; Marin, Soler, Guedes; Oyarzabal

Saudi foreign minister says ‘dying in Gaza has not stopped,’ calls for reconstruction
Prince Faisal bin Farhan tells Munich Security Conference that ceasefire has failed to halt killings in Gaza, urging end to violence
ISTANBUL
Saudi Foreign Minister Faisal bin Farhan called for an immediate halt to killings in Gaza and rebuilding the enclave, saying “dying in Gaza has not stopped” despite a ceasefire agreement with Israel.
Speaking Friday during a panel discussion at the Munich Security Conference, the minister said the ceasefire had failed to end fatalities in Gaza, stressing the need to stop the violence and begin rebuilding the devastated territory.
Prince Faisal also emphasized the need to preserve the unity of Gaza and the West Bank, saying stability in Gaza is essential to that goal. He underscored the importance of addressing Palestinian rights, including the right to self-determination.
His remarks come amid heightened tensions in the West Bank, after Israel’s government approved measures on Sunday aimed at changing the legal and civil reality there, including expanding enforcement powers into areas designated as A and B.
An Oct. 10 ceasefire agreement ended Israel’s two-year war that began on Oct. 8, 2023. Palestinian authorities say the conflict killed more than 72,000 Palestinians, wounded over 171,000 others and caused widespread destruction affecting 90% of civilian infrastructure. The UN estimates reconstruction costs at approximately $70 billion.
At least 591 Palestinians have been killed and over 1,578 others injured in Israeli attacks since the ceasefire, according to Gaza’s Health Ministry.
Munich is hosting the 62nd Munich Security Conference from Friday through Sunday under tight security, as diplomats describe the current period as the most turbulent since the end of the Cold War, marked by escalating conflicts and growing uncertainty over the future of the global order.

BEIRUT, February 13. /TASS/. A mechanized convoy of the Israeli army entered the Province of Al Quneitra in southern Syria to do a sweep of the area, the Al Mayadeen TV channel reported.
According to the broadcaster, Israeli armored vehicles raided the settlements of Ain Ziwan and Jubata Al Khashab and detained several people suspected of belonging to radical groups.
Al Mayadeen added that Israeli occupation forces fired numerous warning shots during the mop-up operation. There were no reports of casualties.
On February 12, an Israeli commando unit of 15 armored vehicles blocked the settlement of Ufania in southern Al Qunetira, where three Syrians were detained after searches.
The Syrian Arab News Agency (SANA) points out that the country's authorities believe all measures Israel has been taking in southern Syria since the change of government in Damascus on December 8, 2024, "have no legal force under international law." In January, the Syrian Foreign Ministry called on the UN Security Council to force Israel to respect the 1974 agreement on the disengagement of Israeli and Syrian forces on the Golan Heights.

The best supermarket wines, picked by experts and perfect for Valentine’s Day
From orange wine to champagne alternatives, these are the bargain bottles to buy
- Bookmark
Valentine's Day is imminent which means, as well as sharing the love, many of us will be sharing delicious food with a bottle of top-quality vino to toast to the occasion. And, whether you’re looking for a full-bodied red, a crisp white wine or a bang-on-theme rosé to serve on your date, you definitely don’t need to splash out to enjoy something superb.
From the viral £10.99 “chicken wine” (La Vieille Ferme rosé) to Aldi’s award-winning sauvignon blanc and Asda’s playful alternative to Whispering Angel, Screaming Devil, social media has played a major role in opening up the wine world.
TikTok creators such as Lucy Hitchcock, aka @Partnerinwineuk, often see bottles from M&S and Waitrose vanish from shelves, while wine influencers such as Hannah Crosbie and Tom Gilbey are making wine feel more approachable and less intimidating.
“Wine is a whole aisle now, as people want more variety as well as value, and supermarkets have wisely chosen to invest in their wine buyers and relationships with producers – because this is how most of us buy our wine,” says Libby Brodie, wine consultant and columnist. A similar trend is happening with supermarket champagne and whisky, where growing demand has led to a wider selection and higher-quality offerings.
According to Sinead Murdoch, sommelier and co-founder of restaurant Tasca, supermarkets are increasingly appealing to more discerning drinkers. “Now top wine buyers are working for supermarkets, and the growing competition is raising the standard of what ends up on the shelves.” This means that shoppers can now find bottles that rival those in specialist wine shops, without having to spend a fortune or hunt for rare finds.
That said, picking a truly exceptional bottle can still be tricky. So I asked the experts for guidance, ranging from sommeliers to wine influencers. Whether you’re looking to impress with a cava or woo with an orange wine this Valentine’s Day, keep scrolling to discover the best supermarket wines recommended by experts.

- Best crisp white wine
- ABV 12.5%

“If you like crisp and fresh wines, like sauvignon blanc or pinot gris, then this Albariño is one to try,” Brook suggests. “It's zesty, with a touch of apricot, lime and even a salty edge.” Perfect for summer, Brook recommends pairing it with seafood – “delicious”.
2Waitrose Loved & Found moschofilero rosé
- Best rosé wine
- ABV 12.5%
- Country Greece
“If you love a food-friendly wine, then you're going to love this,” says Hitchcock. “For those who love Côtes de Provence but want to step outside their comfort zone, this dry Greek rosé offers a fragrant, zesty twist with citrus, peach, cherry and a hint of rose.”
At less than £10, it’s an affordable and crowd-pleasing bottle to take to your next dinner party.
3La Balconne organic Provence rosé

“This elegant rosé blends seven grapes from across Provence into a silky-smooth wine bursting with raspberry, peach, citrus and a hint of rosemary,” Hitchcock says.

4LB7 vinho verde
- Best Vinho Verde wine
- ABV 10%
- Country Portugal
“Not only is this wine just 10% ABV, it's aromatic, zesty, and has a tiny spritz, too,” Brook explains. “Vinho verde is Portugal's flagship white, and it's possibly one of the most refreshing wines on a warm day.”
5Oxney Organic Estate brut rosé NV
- Best sparkling wine
- ABV 12%
- Country England
English wine has a bad reputation, but Murdoch describes this bottle from Sussex as “A wonderful fizz.” She adds that “There’s nothing better than enjoying something made closer to home,” Murdoch says. “This sparkling wine has a real energy to it. It’s full of exciting, racy lemon and green apple skin notes that are balanced out perfectly by raspberries and strawberries.”
On top of all that, “It has that classic English countryside orchard feeling to it. I’d recommend it as a summer barbecue aperitif.”

“As close to champagne as you can get, this Cremant blanc de blanc is made the same way, from the same grape, but from just down the road in Burgundy,” Brodie says. “Fresh, flavourful with a creamy effervescence – this is heaven with a baked camembert.”
8Gerard Bertrand Genora orange wine
- Best orange wine
- ABV 12.5%
- Country France
“If you're curious about orange wine but don’t know where to start, this is a fantastic introduction,” Murdoch says. “A blend of chardonnay, roussanne, viognier, and grenache blanc, it’s a true southern French mix. The white grapes are macerated on their skins, giving the wine a lightly spiced, citrusy character with a bright tangerine hum. It’s aromatic, textured, and a joy to drink alone or pair with grilled pork or fish.”
9Visio Vintners we the people Cape blend 75cl
- Best wine for barbecues
- ABV 13%
- Country South Africa
“It's barbecue season, and if there's anything the South Africans know how to do, it's cook over a fire,” Brook says. “This South African red blend is predominantly Pinotage - a bold grape native to the country. You'll find a bottle at every BBQ.”
Brook describes the bottle as smooth, fruity and a little smoky. “Pop yours in the fridge for 20 minutes then serve alongside your grilled lamb chops, burgers and charred veggies.”
10Codorníu gran crémant eco vintage brut

- ABV 11.5%
- Country Spain
“Cava offers exceptional value when you're looking for an alternative to champagne,” says Brook. “Made with the same method as champagne – a second fermentation in the bottle to get those vibrant bubbles – it's a refreshing alternative, and this one's rich, creamy, and delicious.” This cava from Co-op is perfect for a celebration.

Original Bramley apple tree ‘at risk’ after site where it grows is put up for sale

The future of the original Bramley apple tree, which is responsible for one of the world’s most popular cooking apples, is at risk now that the site where it grows has been put up for sale, campaigners have warned.
The tree is situated in the back garden of a row of cottages in Southwell, Nottinghamshire, which has been owned by Nottingham Trent University since 2018 and has been used as student accommodation.
The university said the site was for sale due to the “age and configuration” of the cottages, which made them no longer suitable for accommodation.
The great granddaughter of the man who first introduced the Bramley apple commercially said she was “very concerned” for the future of the tree and it needed to be protected.
“It’s a very famous tree. It’s a very well-loved tree and it means a lot,” Celia Steven, 85, said. “Sadly people are a bit prone to cut down trees and think about it later so I find it very disturbing.”
The more than 220-year-old tree was grown from a pip planted by Mary Anne Brailsford between 1809 and 1815. Its apples were discovered nearly 50 years later by local gardener Henry Merryweather in a garden owned by Matthew Bramley. Merryweather was given permission to take cuttings from the Bramley seedling as long as the apples he sold bore Bramley’s name.
Steven said her great-grandfather, Merryweather, “believed in that apple, he commercialised it, he marketed it, he promoted it … he called it the ‘King of Covent Garden’”. Since then, it has become one of Britain’s best loved cooking apples.
Despite the historic nature of the tree, it has never been granted a tree preservation order, which would protect it under law and prevent it from being chopped down.
It has, however, been recognised by the royal family. In 2002, the queen’s golden jubilee cited the Bramley as one of the 50 “great British trees” and two decades later it was recognised as part of a selection of 70 ancient trees dedicated to the queen for the platinum jubilee.
Steven said: “Our ancient trees are not protected in the way they should be. They’re not revered in the way they should be. They’re very special to this country and when we have got such things we do need to look after them and protect them for the future.”
Dan Llywelyn Hall, the founder of the Mother Bramley legacy fund, said such heritage trees should never be at risk like this. The 45-year-old artist, who is hoping to fundraise £400,000 with the Merryweather family to buy the site, said the tree had been “in a state of neglect” since the university bought the cottages.
Despite this, and the fact the Bramley was diagnosed with an incurable honey fungus, it is still alive and producing apples, he said.
“It can’t be understated, it’s the most important, most famous apple tree in the world. It’s produced a million-in-one apple which is highly regarded in the culinary world. The fact we have the original still alive is quite an extraordinary thing,” he said.
“It brings a bigger national discussion up here as to why we are terrible in this country at looking after our heritage trees,” he said.
A Nottingham Trent University spokesperson said: “NTU is proud to have been the latest custodian of the Bramley apple tree and to have played a part in helping to safeguard and celebrate its legacy.
“When the university became custodian it was well known that the tree had outlived its natural lifespan by quite some time. We have worked hard using our academic expertise to maintain it in the most careful and appropriate way for a tree of this age and condition and been delighted to provide access to members of the public and for annual events such as the Bramley apple festival and Heritage Open Days. Without the dedication and hard work of our colleagues, we believe it would have deteriorated significantly further.
“We were visited by an independent tree specialist last year who paid tribute to the work we have done to both maintain and celebrate it. We also reached out individually to people in Southwell with a special connection to the tree before the cottages were listed for sale and, again, people expressed support for the work we have undertaken.
“The university aims to ensure that the tree will remain in the care of a responsible custodian. We will also continue to provide expert guidance and support to them on how to care for the tree.”

Pro-Palestinian Jewish activists disrupt Nigel Farage event at London synagogue
Pro-Palestinian Jewish activists disrupted a speech by far-right politician Nigel Farage at London's Central Synagogue this week, accusing him of racism and warning against the normalisation of extremist politics within the Jewish community.
Farage was speaking on Tuesday night at the launch of the Reform Jewish Alliance (RJA), an initiative linked to his Reform UK party aimed at attracting Jewish voters.
The event, held in a function room at Central Synagogue and attended by around 200 people, marked what Farage said was a renewed effort to engage Jewish communities ahead of future elections.
As he began speaking, four activists from the group Na'amod stood up and interrupted him.
"The Torah says to love the stranger, for we were once strangers in Egypt," one protester shouted.
Another declared: "My grandmother fled Germany. You would deport her."
A third referenced the 1936 Battle of Cable Street, saying: "My mother didn’t fight the Mosley fascists for this."
Na'amod, which describes itself as a movement of Jews in the UK seeking to end support for Israel's occupation of Palestine and apartheid, said the disruption was intended to challenge Farage's anti-immigration rhetoric and the use of a synagogue as a political platform.
In a statement shared online after the event, the group said it would not "stand by while sacred spaces are used to sanitise the record of people who oppose everything our community stands for".
The group said it had carefully considered the decision to protest at a synagogue, particularly given heightened sensitivities around demonstrations at places of worship.
Na'amod said it confirmed no religious services were taking place at the time and sought to ensure that no one felt unsafe. While there were moments of tension between protesters and attendees, the disruption did not escalate into violence.
Footage from the event showed at least one activist being forcefully removed from the venue while attendees responded angrily.
Outside the synagogue, dozens of demonstrators from Jewish pro-Palestinian groups, including Jewish Anti-Zionist Action and the Jewish Bloc for Palestine, held placards reading: "Antifascism is a Jewish tradition" and "Reform UK are not your friends".
Josh Cohen, 32, one of the protesters, told the Guardian that he was "disgusted" by comments made during the event referring to Jews as "model immigrants", adding that such language had risked being used to marginalise other communities.
"We are disgusted by antisemitism," he said, "but we believe Reform are an active threat to the Muslim community and to immigrants and asylum-seeker communities in the UK.
Farage told attendees that "Judeo-Christian principles" formed the foundation of Britain's achievements and said the Reform Jewish Alliance could help the party secure up to 15 parliamentary seats in future elections.
Amy Kershenbaum, who attended the event, said: "Many of us would not be here if Reform policies were in place when our ancestors sought refuge".
Farage was introduced at the event by Alan Mendoza, executive director of the Henry Jackson Society thinktank.
Among those involved in heading up the Reform Jewish Alliance is Gary Mond, a former senior vice-president of the Board of Deputies of British Jews, who resigned from the organisation in 2022.
Research suggests a political divide is emerging among British Jews, with support for Reform rising in recent surveys, though still below the party's national polling figures.

Avalanche kills 3 skiers in French Alps
February 13, 2026Three skiers died in the French Alps after they went off piste and were caught in an avalanche, authorities said Friday.
They were part of a group of six that went into the mountains with a ski instructor in the Val d'Isere area in southeastern France.
The identities and nationalities of the victims were not immediately known.
According to local authorities, the group had mandatory safety equipment with them but set off despite a warning of increased avalanche risk.
Storm Nils brought heavy snow to the French Alps this week, prompting some ski resorts to close their slopes entirely on Thursday. Many ski areas in the region remained under the second-highest avalanche warning level on Friday.
The Val d'Isere municipality warned all skiers to stay on marked slopes and follow safety recommendations given the heightened danger.

UN Security Council gravely concerned over 'escalating violence' in South Sudan
Members 'strongly called on all parties to de-escalate and immediately cease renewed hostilities and to resolve issues through peaceful dialogue,' statement says
HAMILTON, Canada
The UN Security Council on Friday conveyed "grave concern" over the increasing violence across South Sudan, urging all parties to de-escalate.
"The members of the Security Council expressed grave concern at escalating violence in Jonglei and Eastern Equatoria, and throughout the country," a statement by the Security Council members said, recalling that "under international law, individuals who order the commission of war crimes may be held accountable."
"They strongly called on all parties to de-escalate and immediately cease renewed hostilities and to resolve issues through peaceful dialogue."
Emphasizing that ongoing "deterioration and continued violations of the peace agreement are undermining stability, worsening humanitarian needs," the members stressed that the escalation of violence also places "additional strain on UNMISS's (UN Mission in South Sudan) ability to carry out its mandate."
They expressed their "full support" for the UN mission in South Sudan, as they stressed "that continued constructive cooperation between the host government and UNMISS is essential to sustaining peace and stability, facilitating safe and timely humanitarian access, and ensuring the protection of civilians."
"The members of the Security Council have taken note of the recent developments in compliance with UNMISS’s Contingency Plans, including the near completion of the repatriation process," it said, urging the South Sudanese government to keep "full cooperation" with the UN "to complete these processes."
The members called on the South Sudan government to "address remaining impediments on UNMISS’s operations, avoid incurring additional costs, and facilitate the implementation of its mandate, consistent with South Sudan’s commitments in the Status of Forces Agreement (SOFA)."
"The members of the Security Council expressed concerns over demands to close critical bases in Wau and Bentiu, which would pose a serious threat to UNMISS and UNISFA, weakening their capacity to carry out their mandates, including protection of civilians’ component and facilitation of the delivery of aid," it said.
Reiterating their continued commitment to "South Sudan’s peace process and to work in partnership with the transitional government to achieve lasting peace and stability in the region," the members also called on the country's leaders to "engage in genuine inter-party dialogue about potential changes to the 2018 peace agreement, through an inclusive and transparent process."
South Sudan, the world’s youngest country, gained independence in July 2011 but descended into civil war in December 2013 after President Salva Kiir Mayardit dismissed then-Vice President Riek Machar, accusing him of plotting a coup.
Despite the 2018 peace agreement and the formation of a transitional unity government, clashes and political tensions have persisted.
Fighting between the SSPDF and the Sudan People’s Liberation Army-in-Opposition (SPLA-IO), led by Oyet Nathaniel, deputy chair of the SPLM-IO, has intensified since December in northern Jonglei.
Tensions escalated in 2025, exposing deep divisions within the transitional government formed under the 2018 peace deal. Clashes were first reported in January in Western Equatoria State before spreading north.
First Vice President Machar has been under house arrest since March 2025 and is facing trial.

Justice Department sues Harvard for data as it investigates how race factors into admissions
The Trump administration is suing Harvard University, saying it has refused to provide admissions records that the Justice Department demanded to ensure the Ivy League school stopped using affirmative action in admissions
- Bookmark
The Trump administration is suing Harvard University, saying it has refused to provide admissions records that the Justice Department demanded to ensure the Ivy League school stopped using affirmative action in admissions.
In a lawsuit filed Friday in federal court in Massachusetts, the Justice Department said Harvard has “thwarted” efforts to investigate potential discrimination. It accused Harvard of refusing to comply with a federal investigation and asked a judge to order the university to turn over the records.
Harmeet Dhillon, who leads the department's Civil Rights Division, said Harvard's refusal is a red flag. “If Harvard has stopped discriminating, it should happily share the data necessary to prove it,” Dhillon said in a statement.
Harvard officials did not immediately comment.
The suit is the latest salvo in President Donald Trump’s standoff with Harvard, which has faced billions of dollars in funding cuts and other sanctions after it rejected a list of demands from the administration last year.
Trump officials have said they're taking action against Harvard over allegations of anti-Jewish bias on campus. Harvard officials say they're facing unconstitutional retaliation for refusing to adopt the administration's ideological views. The administration is appealing a judge's orders that sided with Harvard in two lawsuits.
The Justice Department opened a compliance review into Harvard's admissions practices last April on the same day the White House issued a series of sweeping demands aligned with Trump's priorities. The agency told Harvard to hand over five years of admissions data for undergraduate applicants along with Harvard's medical and law schools.
It asked for a trove of data including applicants' grades, test scores, essays, extracurricular activities and admissions outcomes, along with their race and ethnicity. It asked for the data by April 25, 2025. The lawsuit said Harvard has not provided that data.
Justice Department officials said they need the data to determine whether Harvard has continued considering applicants’ race in admissions decisions. The Supreme Court barred affirmative action in admissions in 2023 after lawsuits challenged it at Harvard and the University of North Carolina.
Trump officials have accused colleges of continuing the practice, which the administration says discriminates against white and Asian American students.
The White House is separately pressing universities across the U.S. to providing similar data to determine whether they have continued to factor race into admissions decisions. The Education Department plans to collect more detailed admissions data from colleges after Trump signed an action suggesting schools were ignoring the Supreme Court decision.
Trump's dispute with Harvard had appeared to be winding down last summer after the president repeatedly said they were finalizing a deal to restore Harvard's federal funding. The deal never materialized, and Trump rekindled the conflict this month when he said Harvard must pay $1 billion as part of any deal, double what he previously demanded.

Lindsey Vonn says she will need at least 2 more surgeries after crash at Winter Olympics
American skier Lindsey Vonn said Friday she'll need at least two more surgeries after breaking her left leg in a crash during her downhill race at the Winter Olympics last weekend.
Vonn said earlier this week she was recovering from her third surgery for the injury.
The 41-year-old Olympic veteran from Colorado gave the latest update on her condition in a social media video, saying she expects to have another surgery Saturday. If that goes well, she can potentially leave Italy and return to the U.S., where she'll need another operation, she said.
Vonn said she's had a "hard few days" in the hospital and that she was "very much immobile."
"I'm finally feeling more like myself, but I have a long, long way to go," she said.
She thanked those who have been sending flowers, letters and stuffed animals while she is in the hospital. Friends and family members have also been visiting her while she's been receiving treatment.
"I feel very lucky and fortunate to have so many people around me that have really helped me get through this," she said.
Vonn said watching her fellow Americans compete in the Olympics has been lifting her spirits.
"Good job, team, and keep crushing it," Vonn said.
Vonn crashed seconds into her downhill Olympic race Sunday after she decided to compete despite rupturing her left ACL in a different crash during a World Cup event in the Swiss Alps last month.
The three-time Olympic medalist had come out of retirement to compete in the Milan Cortina Games, but said she felt confident she could still complete the race with the help of a knee brace.

According to an Ukrinforms correspondent, the German Chancellor Friedrich Merz stated this during the opening of the Munich Security Conference on Friday.
"Europe must become a global political actor with its own security strategy. By the way, as a reminder to those who may not know: in Article 42 of the Treaty on European Union, we commit to mutually assist one another in the event of an armed attack on Europe. We must clearly define how we want to organize this in a European way. Not as a substitute for NATO, but as an independent, strong pillar within the Alliance," Merz emphasized.
He stressed that a sovereign Europe is the best response to a new era of great-power politics, in which the rules-based international order is under threat of destruction.
According to him, Europe must focus on what matters most: preserving and strengthening freedom, security, and competitiveness. To achieve this, it is necessary to stop the limitless growth of European bureaucracy and regulation that hampers innovation and entrepreneurship.
Merz said that the day before he had held intensive consultations with European leaders, including President of the European Commission Ursula von der Leyen, and that a joint roadmap for a strong and sovereign Europe is now being developed.
"Russia's GDP currently amounts to about EUR 2 trillion. The GDP of the European Union is almost ten times higher. And yet today Europe is not ten times stronger than Russia," he stressed.
"Our military, political, economic, and technological potential is enormous. But for a long time we have been unable to realize it due to restrictive measures. The most important thing now is to abandon the limiter in our heads. We have the potential. In the era of great powers, our freedom can no longer be taken for granted. It is under threat. Firmness and determination are needed to defend this freedom."
As previously reported, Merz earlier stated that the Bundeswehr would become the strongest conventional army in Europe.

Alan Dershowitz gets into shouting match on Piers Morgan and threatens to sue over Epstein claim
Conservative lawyer in angry spat with comedian Bassem Youssef as host left looking on

Conservative lawyer Alan Dershowitz got into an angry shouting match with comedian Bassem Youssef on Piers Morgan Uncensored after the two men joined the show to discuss the Jeffrey Epstein scandal.
Dershowitz and Youssef began by examining the theory that Epstein, the billionaire pedophile who died in a New York City jail cell in August 2019, was secretly a Mossad agent, which the former rubbished as unlikely.
But the conversation quickly became bad tempered when the Egyptian, 51, accused the former Harvard Law School professor, 87, of practising “gaslighting”.
He invoked the lawyer’s own past connections to the disgraced financier, alleging that his fellow guest had once settled a lawsuit with a woman who accused him of sexual abuse for “nearly a million dollars.”
“Innocent men don’t pay. They go to trial,” the comic taunted Dershowitz, leading the latter to angrily deny the accusation and complain that Youssef was defaming him on live TV.
“You’re lying. You’re defaming me. You are now going to be sued for saying I paid a million dollars,” Dershowitz said, appealing to the host to cut Youssef off.
Morgan duly stepped in to try to make peace, only for the comedian to continue to press Derhowitz and shout over him, the situation becoming ever more heated.
“I’m instructing my lawyers to file a lawsuit against him for saying I paid a million dollars,” Dershowitz said. “What happened is a woman falsely accused me. She admitted she may have mistaken me and confused me for somebody else. She dropped all of her charges. Not a single penny was paid. Nothing.”
He was referring to a federal civil defamation lawsuit filed against him in the Southern District of New York in April 2019 by the late Virginia Giuffre, which was ultimately dropped in November 2022 when Giuffre conceded she may have wrongly identified Dershowitz as a past abuser. No fees were awarded to either side.
“You saying that I paid a million dollars is gonna result in you having to pay me many millions of dollars,” the lawyer continued, resuming his threat against Youssef, who, undeterred, insisted his information came from a New Yorker article about the case.
“The New Yorker never said anything like that,” Dershowitz fumed. “You know, you’re such a liar. You know, I thought you were a comedian. I thought at least you’d be funny. You’re just a liar.”
“You’re somebody who is prepared to make any kind of antisemitic, anti-Israel statement. Now I want you to justify the million. I want you to justify that I paid a million dollars. I want you to justify that. Will you justify it? Will you justify that I paid a million dollars?”
Youssef held his ground, prompting Dershowitz to challenge him to produce the New Yorker article in question while accusing him of “lying through his teeth.”
Youssef duly searched for and found an article entitled “Alan Dershowitz, Devil’s Advocate” published by the periodical in July 2019, but his readings from it only led to further inconclusive squabbling.
The conversation ended with Dershowitz speaking on genocide and the distinction between different 20th and 21st century atrocities, earning a sarcastic thumbs up from Youssef.
Dershowitz, who has a long history of representing controversial clients – from OJ Simpson to Julian Assange, Harvey Weinstein and President Donald Trump, whom he spoke in defense of at his January 2020 Senate impeachment hearings – is also well known for issuing legal threats.
Last summer, he announced his intention to sue a Martha’s Vineyard farmer’s market vendor for allegedly refusing to sell him pierogi, claiming he was being discriminated against because of his personal politics.

Ukrainian state postal service loses 418 vehicles since start of full-scale war

Ukrainian state postal service loses 418 vehicles since start of full-scale war
Since the start of the full-scale war, Ukraine's national postal service Ukrposhta has lost 418 vehicles, including 281 during the temporary occupation of Ukrainian territories by Russian forces in 2022.
Source: Ukrposhta
Quote: "Russia systematically attacks postal routes, primarily where a vehicle with the postal logo remains the only way for people to receive pensions, medicines, social payments and parcels. A strike on a postal vehicle here is not about equipment. It is an attempt to stop life near the front."
Details: The epicentre of attacks has been mobile branches known as "post offices on wheels". Since the start of the full-scale war, 103 such crews have come under fire, and 137 company vehicles in total have been affected.
In 2025 alone, Russian forces attacked 21 Ukrposhta mobile branches – civilian transport with no military purpose.
The highest number of vehicles, including mobile branches, were damaged in the following oblasts: Chernihiv – 29, Kherson – 25, Dnipropetrovsk – 24, Sumy – 18 and Donetsk – 13.
Another 281 vehicles were lost in 2022 during the temporary occupation of Ukrainian territories by Russian forces.
Quote: "The new year has not changed the tactics of terrorist attacks. In the first weeks of January, Russian forces struck postal crews in Sumy and Kherson oblasts twice. People survived. The vehicles did not. Each subsequent route departure is work under the constant threat of repeat strike."
Details: At the end of 2025, Ukrposhta received 160 new MAN and Iveco vehicles, partially compensating for vehicle losses. Thanks to team efforts and route restructuring, 95-98% of parcels are delivered on time even in regions where routes may change at any moment, the company noted.

Could Max Verstappen really quit F1? What we learned from second 2026 test in Bahrain
Verstappen’s critical assessment of the new generation of F1 cars is intriguing, just three weeks out from the season-opener in Australia - especially given the advantage Red Bull look to have over their rivals
- Bookmark
- CommentsGo to comments
Two tests down ahead of the new Formula One season, a single three-day window remains. And one thing is for certain: it’s not the usual case of uneventful on-track stints and dour media sessions from pre-season testing at the Sakhir circuit in Bahrain.
Three weeks out from the season-opening race in Australia, there is plenty to digest. Not just the new rules and regulations – requirements which are overly complex according to Lewis Hamilton, entering his 20th season in F1 – but chit-chat about illegal engines and star driver unrest as well.
Max Verstappen’s comments on Thursday, despite Red Bull’s strong running so far, certainly threw a grenade into proceedings. The four-time world champion described the new cars as being “anti-racing,” elaborating on the energy management element by saying F1 was now “like Formula E on steroids.”
Hamilton, a seven-time world champion, concurred with his arch-rival. Yet others, notably reigning champion Lando Norris, insisted the new cars were “fun to drive”, simply posing a different challenge to the best drivers in the world.
So, after three days of running in Bahrain, what have we learned?
Max Verstappen refuses to rule out quitting F1
It’s not been uncommon for the outspoken Dutchman to air his views in piercing terms on a myriad of issues. His initial views of the debut event in Las Vegas in 2023, F1’s new flagship race, spring to mind, describing the circuit as like “National League compared to Champions League.”
Yet his words this week will also sting the executives in F1’s hospitality unit. Beyond the specifics of his car, his long-term view will send alarm bells. “A winning car, for me, that doesn’t matter,” he said.
“It needs to be fun to drive as well. I think, at this stage of my career, also explore other things outside of Formula 1 [i.e. endurance racing at the Nurburgring] to have fun at. I know that we’re stuck with this regulation for quite a while. So, yeah, let’s see.”
Ominous early views from Verstappen. While he does have a contract at Red Bull until the end of 2028, his interest in endurance racing is growing and if these cars are not to his liking, it’s not unthinkable that he could call it a day after 12 consecutive seasons.
But here’s the catch: Red Bull actually look like the strongest team. Their straight-line speed has stunned their rivals, with Toto Wolff and George Russell both calling them the “benchmark” outfit, while their race runs were also impressive, with their new Ford-partnered power unit efficient in gathering energy and delivering it. At least, much more so than rivals.
Red Bull have also not yet utilised the aero package they plan to use in Australia; that’ll be added to the car at next week’s final test. While Verstappen wants a fun car to drive, a competitive car feels more important for someone of his standing and drive, despite his words on Thursday.
As such, any threats to quit should be taken with a pinch of salt at this point. After all, it’s fun to win, right?
A Mercedes reality check
The Silver Arrows, who were the standouts at the Barcelona shakedown event, finished Friday with a one-two finish but were undoubtedly surprised by Red Bull’s performance level.
The added complication of Red Bull joining Ferrari, Honda and Audi in complaining to the FIA over the engine compression saga is also looming in the next few weeks, with further meetings expected next week.
A late regulation change could be curtains for Mercedes’s challenge, though that appears unlikely at this stage. They also had a power unit issue, which limited their running on Thursday and, as a result, they completed the second-least amount of laps across the three days, at 282.
Ferrari status report? We are checking…
Optimism is slowly bubbling in camp Scuderia.
While Lewis Hamilton also complained about the new cars – and rightly referred to his shambolic race engineer situation as “detrimental” to the start of his season – the Briton put in some solid times, both over one lap and race-trim, though he did spin on day one.
Promisingly, both Hamilton and Charles Leclerc appear in tune with the car and, to the excitement of the tifosi, a new floor, front wing and diffuser is expected to arrive for the final test next week. That could put them right up with Red Bull and Mercedes.
Aston Martin are in trouble
It’s hard to make a decisive judgement on the front-of-the-pack during testing, but what often becomes clear is who is languishing at the back. Cadillac’s issues, as the slowest team throughout as well as a few mechanical problems, were expected. Aston Martin’s were not.
For the striking design implemented by Adrian Newey, it’s been a torrid testing period so far for the team decked in royal green. Just one day of running in Barcelona, a launch plagued by live-stream issues and, now, talk that they are “four seconds” off the pace.
That’s not a rumour, either. That’s a direct quote from driver Lance Stroll, son of team owner Lawrence. They also completed the least amount of laps by some distance – just 206 over 24 hours of on-track activity.
Some serious work to do over the next fortnight.
Williams bounce back
Having missed the shakedown in Barcelona, team principal James Vowles was keen to downplay the significance of the decision, saying he wanted to push the potential of the car’s capability.
It has been a strong rebound in Sakhir. Williams completed the joint-most amount of laps over three days – 422, alongside fellow Mercedes-engine user McLaren – and Carlos Sainz and Alex Albon have look enthused by the machinery beneath them.
In fact, they look ahead of Aston in the pecking order right now. Whether they can make a leap in performance to challenge the big boys, ahead of race one, is another matter altogether.

Europe's role in NATO leadership grows, with US maintaining its military presence — Rutte

MUNICH, February 13. /TASS/. Europe's role in NATO leadership will grow while the US maintains its military presence and nuclear forces on European territory, the organization’s Secretary General Mark Rutte said on the sidelines of the Munich Security Conference.
"Over the coming years, we will more and more see a NATO that is more European-led, but at the same time with the US absolutely anchored in the organization," Rutte said.
He pointed out that there has been a "shift in mindset," with "Europe really stepping up, Europe taking more of a leadership role within NATO, Europe also taking more care of its own defense."
At the same time, according to the NATO chief, the US is committed to maintaining its nuclear and conventional military presence in Europe.
Earlier this week, NATO decided to transfer command positions in three regional NATO headquarters to European generals. However, the command of NATO’s Supreme Headquarters Allied Powers Europe and the position of NATO Supreme Allied Commander Europe remained with the US.

US Homeland Security chief ends temporary protected status for Yemen
Allowing beneficiaries to remain temporarily in US is contrary to national interest, Kristi Noem says
WASHINGTON
US Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem on Friday announced a decision to end temporary deportation protections for Yemenis living in the country.
"After reviewing conditions in the country and consulting with appropriate U.S. government agencies, I determined that Yemen no longer meets the law’s requirements to be designated for Temporary Protected Status,” Noem said in a statement.
Allowing the beneficiaries to remain temporarily in the US is contrary to the national interest, she added.
The decision will take effect 60 days after it is published in the Federal Register and after the effective date of the termination, the department may arrest and deport any Yemeni national without status once their TPS has been terminated, according to the statement.
It was not immediately clear how many individuals could be impacted by the decision.
Yemen was first granted Temporary Protected Status on Sept. 3, 2015, due to ongoing armed conflict threatening the safety of returning nationals. The designation was subsequently extended or redesignated multiple times through 2024.

US allows oil majors to resume Venezuela operations
The authorisation does not allow transactions with companies in Russia, Iran or China
The US eased sanctions on Venezuela’s energy sector on Friday, issuing two general licences that allow global energy companies to operate oil and gas projects in the Opec member and for other companies to negotiate contracts to bring in fresh investments.
The Treasury Department’s Office of Foreign Assets Control issued a general licence allowing Chevron, BP, Eni, Shell and Repsol to operate oil and gas operations in Venezuela. Those companies still have offices in the country and stakes in projects, and are among the main partners of state-run company PDVSA.
The authorisation for the oil majors’ operations requires payments for royalties and Venezuelan taxes to go through the US-controlled Foreign Government Deposit Fund.
The other licence allows companies around the world to enter contracts with PDVSA for new investments in Venezuelan oil and gas. The contracts are contingent on separate permits from OFAC.
The authorisation does not allow transactions with companies in Russia, Iran, or China or entities owned or controlled by joint ventures with people in those countries.
The move was the biggest relaxation of sanctions on Venezuela since US forces captured and removed President Nicolas Maduro last month.

Israeli extremists enter southern Lebanon, call for settlements

Israeli extremists cross into southern Lebanon, call for settlements
Dozens of Israelis crossed the border into southern Lebanon on Thursday, calling for the establishment of Jewish settlements in the area, in a brazen violation of sovereignty.
Israeli Channel 12 reported that dozens of extremists from the far-right settler movement Uri Tzafon, which receives significant financial and ideological support from pro-Israel groups in the US and Europe, crossed the border fence near the Lebanese town of Yaroun.
The settlers, who included women and children, attempted to plant trees inside Lebanese territory in a staged act promoting Israeli settlement expansion, calling for the alleged "resumption" of settlement in Lebanon, framing it as a "historical correction".
The Israeli army confirmed that a group of around 20 Jewish settlers had gathered near the border, and said two individuals crossed the fence before being apprehended and returned to Israeli territory.
The army described the incident as "serious" and a criminal violation that endangered civilians and soldiers.
However, Israeli media reports and videos shared online showed that more than two individuals crossed into Lebanese land during the action.
Beirut MP Melhem Khalaf condemned the incident, saying that "when crossing the fence and violating sovereignty turns into a tree-planting outing, we know that audacity has reached its peak".
"Lebanon is not vacant land for correcting historical delusions, nor a backyard for sick settlement projects," Khalaf wrote on X. "Lebanon is not for sale, not for annexation, and not for bargaining."
Uri Tzafon has previously publicly advocated for Israeli annexation of parts of southern Lebanon. In recent months, it has circulated maps of south Lebanon labelled with Hebrew names and promoted plans for future settlements in areas south of the Litani River.
Settlement construction in occupied territory is considered illegal under the Fourth Geneva Convention.
Israel occupies five Lebanese hilltop points near the border despite a ceasefire deal in November 2024 outlighting the full withdrawal of its forces.
The incident follows previous attempts by extremist settler groups to cross into Syria and southern Lebanon, where they have staged provocative incursions and called for expansion under the banner of so-called "Greater Israel".
Some settler activists invoke alleged biblical claims to Lebanese and Syrian territory, pursuing expansionist ambitions which members of the far-right Israeli government have openly advocated recently.
Strike in al-Tiri
The border crossing came as Israel carried out another strike in southern Lebanon killing one person on Thursday in the town of al-Tiri.
Despite a November 2024 truce that ended more than a year of cross-border hostilities and two months of full-scale war between Israel and Hezbollah, Israeli forces have continued near-daily strikes in parts of Lebanon.
Al-Tiri lies south of the Litani River, the zone that Lebanese authorities and the UNIFIL say has no Hezbollah activity and is weapons-free.
In January, Lebanon's army announced it had completed the first phase of its plan to disarm Hezbollah in the area south of the Litani, roughly 30 kilometres from the Israeli border. The government is expected to meet on Monday to review further progress.
Israel has repeatedly said its strikes target Hezbollah positions, without presenting evidence.
Lebanon argues that the continued attacks and Israeli military presence in the south obstruct the Lebanese army's deployment south of the Litani River, disrupt reconstruction efforts, and prevent displaced residents from returning to their homes.

FTSE 100 closes in the green as UK plans big missile spend
The FTSE 100 index closed up 43.91 points, 0.4%, at 10,446.35.

Stock prices in London closed mostly higher on Friday following the news that US consumer inflation slowed more than expected last month.
The US annual CPI rate stood at 2.4% on-year in January, lower than 2.7% in December and below the FXStreet-cited consensus of a softer deceleration to 2.5%.
Monthly, consumer prices rose 0.2% after a 0.3% increase in December, below the consensus for another 0.3% increase.
The annual core index that strips out food and energy was up 2.5% as expected in January, slowed from 2.6%. Monthly, core goods prices were up 0.3%, also as expected, and accelerated from 0.2%.
The FTSE 100 index closed up 43.91 points, 0.4%, at 10,446.35. The FTSE 250 ended up 122.28 points, 0.5%, at 23,427.27, and the AIM all-share closed up 0.69 points, 0.1%, at 811.85.
NatWest was the lowest blue-chip, down 4.1% despite reporting better-than-expected annual results.
The Edinburgh-based lender reported £16.64 billion in total income for 2025, up 13% on-year and ahead of analyst consensus of £16.53 billion. Operating pretax profit increased 24% to £7.71 billion, also surpassing the consensus estimate of £7.49 billion.
Noting that NatWest’s results were “strong”, Shore said: “The print reinforces NatWest as a high‑teens‑return on tangible equity, capital‑generative UK franchise with growing tangible net asset value, benign credit trends, disciplined cost control and clear headroom for dividends and buybacks.”
On AIM, EPE Special Opportunities closed 9.8% higher.
The Epic Investment Partners-managed firm announced plans to undertake up to £3.0 million in share buybacks, using existing cash reserves. It said the programme may exceed 25% of the average daily trading volume, due to the low liquidity of its shares in issue.
Tern was down 10%, after launching an open offer to raise up to £384,408 through the issue of up to 96.1 million shares at 0.40 pence each, a 20% discount to the prior closing price.
Tern says the offer was not underwritten, and that shareholders are entitled to subscribe on the basis of one new share for every seven held.
In other UK news, Britain will spend £400 million developing long-range missiles this year as part of “a new deal for European security”, Defence Secretary John Healey has announced.
The funds will go toward replacing the Storm Shadow missile, including the Stratus “stealth” missile being developed with France and Italy, and the Deep Precision Strike system being built with Germany.
Mr Healey is expected to discuss both projects, as well as further industrial cooperation with European allies, at the Munich Security Conference, which began on Friday.

The yield on the US 10-year Treasury was quoted at 4.06%, narrowing from 4.12%. The yield on the US 30-year Treasury was quoted at 4.70%, narrowing from 4.76%.
Brent oil was quoted at 67.48 dollars a barrel at the time of the London equities close on Friday, down from 68.08 late Thursday.

UN urges parties to uphold commitments, resolve differences peacefully in Syria
'We shall never lose sight of the immense suffering and loss Syrians have endured over 14 years of conflict and decades of dictatorship,' says envoy Claudio Cordone
By Merve Aydogan
HAMILTON, Canada (AA) - The UN on Friday urged Syrian stakeholders to uphold their commitments and resolve differences peacefully, stressing that the country's transition period requires cooperation, respect for sovereignty and sustained humanitarian support.
"We encourage the parties to continue to uphold their commitments and resolve any implementation-related differences peacefully and expeditiously," UN Deputy Special Envoy for Syria Claudio Cordone said in his first address to the Security Council.
He said the UN looks forward to the "full and swift implementation" of efforts aimed at the peaceful integration of northeast Syria, the protection of the rights of Syrian Kurds, and the safe, dignified and voluntary return of displaced persons so that people can live "in dignity and free from fear."
Addressing developments in the south, Cordone said Israeli military activity remains a concern.
"Still in the south, Israeli incursions and search operations have continued. There are reports of the aerial spraying of herbicides by Israel, causing damage to crops and pastures," he said.
"We reiterate our call for full respect for international law, Syria’s sovereignty and territorial integrity. We also call on Israel to withdraw from areas it occupies in violation of the 1974 Disengagement of Forces Agreement," he added, voicing support for "the pursuit of mutually acceptable security arrangements between Israel and Syria."
Israeli forces have been carrying out near-daily incursions into Syrian territory, particularly in rural Quneitra, detaining civilians, setting up checkpoints, questioning those passing through, and destroying farmland.
After the fall of the Assad regime in late 2024, Israel expanded its occupation of Syria's Golan Heights by seizing the demilitarized buffer zone, a move that violated the 1974 disengagement agreement.
Syrians say the continued Israeli violations are undermining efforts to restore stability and hindering attempts to attract investment to boost the economy.
On the political track, Cordone said: "The next step in the political transition is the formation of the People's Assembly."
He reiterated the importance of ensuring that Syria's regions and diverse groups are meaningfully represented in the new body.
Highlighting the human toll of the conflict, Cordone said: "We shall never lose sight of the immense suffering and loss Syrians have endured over 14 years of conflict and decades of dictatorship."
He said Syrians hold "both hopes and fears, perhaps in equal measure," as the country moves forward in what he described as a new era that began in December 2024.
Cordone also stressed the need to maximize practical impact, avoid duplication and ensure that international efforts deliver tangible results, pointing to recent flash flooding in displacement camps in Idlib as a stark reminder of continuing humanitarian needs.
Briefing on behalf of UN relief chief Tom Fletcher, Lisa Doughten, director of the financing and outreach division at the Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, said recent clashes in the country forced tens of thousands to flee their homes last month.
"Over 90% of those displaced are women and girls. Two-thirds are staying with host communities, straining already stretched households and services," she said.
Despite persistent challenges, Doughten said "encouraging indicators of real, if modest, improvements in the humanitarian situation."
According to the 2025 Food Security Assessment, food insecurity has eased, but "some 700,000 people are still facing severe food insecurity, while 6.4 million are moderately food insecure."
She added that since December 2024 more than 3 million refugees and internally displaced persons have returned to their home areas.
Heavy rainfall earlier this week caused severe flooding across parts of Idlib and northern Latakia, killing two children and affecting more than 5,000 displaced people, she said.
"Syria can turn the corner on humanitarian need, but only with decisive support" in diplomacy, recovery investment and sustained humanitarian funding, Doughten stressed.

Netflix quietly scraps show after just one season, creator reveals
The series was cancelled due to low viewing numbers
- Bookmark
- CommentsGo to comments
Netflix has canceled one of its shows after the first season, leading the creator of the series to share the news on X.
Mattson Tomlin shared a post on social media announcing that Terminator Zero was axed by the streamer due to low viewing numbers, despite the series being well-received by critics.
“It was cancelled,” Tomlin wrote in a post on X, responding to a fan question about the status of season two of the series. “The critical and audience reception to it was tremendous, but at the end of the day not nearly enough people watched it. I would’ve loved to deliver on the Future War I had planned in seasons 2 and 3, but I’m also very happy with how it feels contained as is.
“Maybe someday I’ll do a big thread about the plans I had for the full five season run,” he continued. “The series finale was special and it was part of my pitch to get the job. I’ve written all of the season two scripts and outlined pretty much all of season three…Maybe I will return to that world in a different form. I really do love it, and it was extremely gratifying to see so many people connect with it the way they did.”
The show’s creator also explained that he had no ill will toward Netflix and were “good partners” to work with based on the amount of creative freedom they let him have. The streaming platform also offered him the option to make a final two or three episodes to properly wrap the series, which he declined.
“I felt the story I wanted to tell was much longer, and the finale of season one actually left things in a good place,” he wrote. “But they didn’t have to offer that. Good partners here.”
The show was a science-fiction anime series set in the Terminator universe originally created by James Cameron and Gale Anne Hurd. It followed the story of Malcolm Lee, who was developing an AI system in 1997. However, as he deals with the system’s creation, Lee is also being hunted by an assassin from the future who is after his three children.
The news of Terminator Zero’s cancellation comes as Netflix recently revealed the new films and TV series arriving every day throughout the month of February.
Among the new original releases are the return of smash hit series The Night Agent, the next show from Derry Girls creator Lisa McGee (How to Get to Heaven from Belfast) and the concluding chapter of Bridgerton season four. There will also be documentaries about Gordon Ramsay, Lucy Letby and Pearl Jam frontman Eddie Vedder (Matter of Time).
But the biggest addition is the long-running medical drama ER, which has seen a resurgence thanks to the Emmy-winning success of The Pitt, both starring Noah Wyle.

Angry passengers left high and dry after Star Cruises cancels Hong Kong sailing
Star Voyager’s two-night cruise cancelled because of ‘unforeseen technical issue’
Star Cruises cancelled a scheduled departure from Hong Kong on Friday evening because of “an unforeseen technical issue”, leaving angry passengers who had waited for hours to board complaining they had been treated like “refugees”.
The cruise operator apologised, offering customers the choice of rescheduling or a full refund.
On Saturday morning, the cruise ship remained docked at Ocean Terminal in Tsim Sha Tsui, with black smoke occasionally billowing from the vessel’s funnel, which a marine engineer attributed to engine testing.
The aborted voyage would have marked the cruise line’s return to using Hong Kong as its home port for a nine-month period ending on November 13.
“Star Cruises regrets to inform [passengers] that the Star Voyager sailing scheduled on February 13, for the ‘2 Night High Seas Cruise’ departing from Hong Kong Ocean Terminal, has been cancelled due to an unforeseen technical issue,” a spokesman earlier said.
“Star Cruises remains fully committed to delivering a safe and enjoyable travel experience. We appreciate the understanding and patience of our guests and partners.”

Rubio: 'Future linked to Europe' as US attacks hang over Munich

Rubio: 'Future linked to Europe' as US attacks hang over Munich
US Secretary of State Marco Rubio said transatlantic ties faced a "defining moment" in a rapidly changing world but struck a warmer tone ahead of the Munich Security Conference on Friday after a year of unprecedented upheaval.
At the same gathering of top security officials last year, Vice President JD Vance had attacked European allies, triggering a series of confrontations, with the US seemingly set on dismantling much of the international order it helped to build.
In response, Washington's partners have been pushing to chart a more independent course while preserving the basis of the alliance, as they face myriad threats from Russia's war in Ukraine to massive ructions in global trade.
"I think it's at a defining moment ... the world is changing very fast right in front of us," Rubio said before departing for Munich.
"The Old World is gone, frankly, the world I grew up in, and we live in a new era in geopolitics, and it's going to require all of us to re-examine what that looks like and what our role is going to be," he said.
"(The US is) deeply tied to Europe, and our futures have always been linked and will continue to be," said Rubio, who is a potential rival to Vance for the 2028 US presidential race. "So we've just got to talk about what that future looks like."
'Wrecking-ball politics' threaten alliance
This year's meeting comes against a backdrop of multiple conflicts, including wars in Ukraine, Gaza and Sudan. Transatlantic ties have long been central to the Munich Security Conference, which began as a Cold War forum for Western defence debate. But the unquestioned assumption of cooperation that underpinned it has been upended.
Wolfgang Ischinger, the former German diplomat who heads the forum, spoke this week of "wrecking-ball politics" in which "sweeping destruction – rather than careful reforms and policy corrections – is the order of the day".
Underscoring the damage, a YouGov poll on Friday of the six largest European countries showed favourability towards the US in Europe hitting its lowest since tracking began in 2016.
The latest figures are broadly comparable to – and in some cases higher than – the perceived threat from China, Iran or North Korea, although behind Russia, YouGov said.
US President Donald Trump has toppled Venezuela's leader, threatened other Latin American countries with similar military action, imposed tariffs on friends and foes alike and talked openly about annexing Greenland from fellow NATO member Denmark - a move that could effectively end the alliance.
"No one in Europe or in the United States wins from any kind of conflict between old allies," said Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen, who said she would meet Rubio in Munich.
"So we must do what we can to keep the Americans close to us, but this is a new world disorder that we live in. And that is why the most important thing for us Europeans is that we arm ourselves as quickly as possible."
The Trump administration's harsh new tone, including a dire warning that Europe faces "civilisational erasure", has shaken its allies, which have pledged to step up spending on their own militaries after decades of neglect.
Europe's dependence on US military support will take years to undo, however, leaving it vulnerable as the standoff with Russia over the Ukraine war persists.
Germany's foreign minister said on Friday that recent comments by US officials have caused irritation within NATO.
"This alliance is also under pressure. There is alienation, there is irritation about some of the things we hear from Washington. We need to talk about this here together," Johann Wadephul told German broadcaster ARD.
In another striking sign of the shifting rhetoric, the head of Germany's industry association BDI, Peter Leibinger, said in Munich that Europeans had to prepare their defence sector "with, without and possibly against Washington".
German Chancellor Friedrich Merz will open the conference with a speech on Friday afternoon, while around 70 heads of state and government and more than 140 ministers are expected under tight security in Munich.
Prominent attendees include Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy and French President Emmanuel Macron, who this week warned: "We have the Chinese tsunami on the trade front, and we have minute-by-minute instability on the American side."

Ukrainian troops defeated opponent with drones at 2025 NATO exercise – WSJ
During military exercises in Estonia in spring 2025, a group of Ukrainian drone operators demonstrated that drones and battlefield analysis systems are changing the approach to modern warfare.
Source: an opinion piece by Jillian Kay Melchior for The Wall Street Journal
Details: The article describes the Hedgehog 2025 exercise, which involved more than 16,000 service members from 12 NATO countries. Ukrainian drone experts also trained alongside them, including soldiers deployed from the front.
Quote: "In Ukraine the front line is largely frozen, but Hedgehog envisioned a battlefield where tanks and troops still have some ability to move. During one scenario, a battle group of several thousand troops, including a British brigade and an Estonian division, sought to conduct an attack. As they advanced, they failed to account for how drones have made the battlefield more transparent, several sources say.
The NATO battle group was 'just walking around, not using any kind of disguise, parking tents and armored vehicles', recalls one participant, who played an enemy role. 'It was all destroyed'."
Details: Melchior notes that during the exercise Ukrainian personnel used the Delta system, which gathers battlefield intelligence in real time, analyses it, identifies targets and coordinates strikes between command and units.
Quote: "A single team of some 10 Ukrainians, acting as the adversary, counterattacked the NATO forces. In about half a day they mock-destroyed 17 armored vehicles and conducted 30 'strikes' on other targets."
Details: One participant stated that the team managed to "eliminate two battalions in a day".
"Still, Hedgehog showed how visible the battlefield has become – and how vulnerable that makes anyone or anything moving on it. NATO will need to adjust its tactics and find better ways to protect its tanks and armoured vehicles," Melchior concluded.

Democrats say Trump’s foreign deportation deals cost taxpayers millions
Sign up now: Get ST's newsletters delivered to your inbox
WASHINGTON, Feb 13 - U.S. President Donald Trump's immigrant deportation agreements with foreign governments cost American taxpayers millions of dollars - at times more than $1 million per person shipped out of the country - and produce little benefit, according to a study from Senate Democrats released on Friday.
Trump aims to deport millions of immigrants in the U.S. illegally and his administration has sought to ramp up removals of immigrants to third countries that are not their country of origin.
Democrats on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee said in their report that the total cost of third-country removals is unknown, but that more than $32 million has been sent directly to five countries - Equatorial Guinea, Rwanda, El Salvador, Eswatini and Palau.
As of January 2026, the five countries received only about 300 third-country nationals - 250 of them Venezuelans sent to El Salvador - from the United States, the majority of whom have already been returned or are set to return to their home country, the report said.
In one example cited, a Jamaican was sent to Eswatini at a cost of more than $181,000 despite a U.S. court's finding that he should be returned to his homeland. Weeks later he was flown 7,000 miles back to Jamaica, also at U.S. expense, the report said.
The Jamaican government said it never objected to his return to his home country, according to the report.
The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the report. The White House has said that its mass deportation program was a central campaign promise in Trump's successful 2024 campaign for reelection and that it "is freeing up resources, revitalizing opportunity and restoring safety."
The 30-page report was released by Senator Jeanne Shaheen, the top Democrat on the foreign relations committee, and also signed by committee Democrats Chris Coons, Chris Murphy, Tim Kaine, Chris Van Hollen, Cory Booker, Tammy Duckworth and Jacky Rosen.
“This report outlines the troubling practice by the Trump Administration of deporting individuals to third countries — places where these people have no connection — at great expense to the American taxpayer and raises serious questions,” Shaheen said in a statement.
Critics say Trump's third-country deportation policy aims to stoke fear among migrants and encourage them to "self deport" to their home countries if they are in the United States and to stay home or go elsewhere if they are not.
But the administration has not provided detailed information about its plans or arrangements with third countries to accept migrants removed from the U.S. but unable to return to their home countries.
Reuters reported in January about people who are deported to their home countries despite fears of political persecution in their homelands. That included a woman from Sierra Leone first sent to Ghana and then forcibly returned to her home country from there despite a U.S. judge having granted her request to go elsewhere.
The Democrats' report said there is no evidence that the State Department is conducting follow-up oversight on the use of taxpayer funds, even with governments that have records of corruption and human rights abuses.
The report covers agreements and reported third-country removals through January 31, 2026, but said the Trump administration was expected to pursue more agreements.
"Minority Committee staff understand the State Department is pursuing third country removal agreements with 70 to 80 countries," the report said. REUTERS

‘They escaped!’: NGOs sound the alarm as families flee Islamic State camp
Unknown

02:06:00 KST

Most of the foreign families of suspected Islamic State fighters have left al-Hawl camp since the Syrian government took control of the facility, prompting security and humanitarian concerns over their whereabouts.
About 6,000 women and children from 42 different countries were previously held in the foreigners’ annexe of al-Hawl camp in north-east Syria, which housed some of the most radical former members of the extremist group. The foreigners’ annexe was separate from the part of the camp that contained about 20,000 Syrians and Iraqis.
All of those held in the camp are arbitrarily detained as they have not been tried or charged for their alleged involvement in IS, and many of the residents are young children.
On Friday, humanitarian groups said the foreigners’ annexe had been emptied almost entirely of its former residents and that most of the families left for Idlib. They said foreign women and children had been gradually leaving the foreigners’ annexe since the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) abandoned the facility to the advancing Syrian government forces on 20 January.
“All of the foreign women have escaped in this period,” said Jihan Hanan, who directed the al-Hawl camp until its takeover by Damascus last month. “Every day, cars would come and take them at night and take them to Idlib. It wasn’t done in an organised way.”
The escape of IS-linked individuals from al-Hawl and other detention facilities was a long-running concern for the international community, which warned that a mass-exodus could help IS reconstitute itself across Syria and Iraq. The US military had transferred about 3,000 IS detainees to prisons in Iraq over the past month and was expected to finish the transfer of about 4,000 more over the coming days, which could facilitate the exit of US military forces from Syria.
It was unclear how exactly the families left al-Hawl, whether they were let out or they escaped. A camp resident of central Asian descent told the Guardian that she was able to escape by “crawling through the fence” and that she was now in Idlib.
An NGO worker said they were aware of at least one case where a woman who escaped the camp crossed into Turkey and suggested others may have done the same, but cautioned that the lack of oversight made it impossible to know where residents ended up.
The Syrian government has been approached for comment. It has previously blamed escapes on the SDF, which it said abandoned the facility without coordinating with Damascus.
Beatrice Eriksson, a spokesperson for the rights organisation Repatriate the Children, said: “The past two weeks, children and mothers have been moved or released in a highly chaotic context, without clarity on who is responsible or what protection measures are in place.”
During two visits to the camp in the week after its handover to Syrian government forces, the Guardian saw cut fences and frequent escape attempts by residents of the foreigners’ annexe. Fighters of central Asian descent were taking women from the annexe into their cars, with their destination unknown, while others clamoured at the outer walls of the camps, arguing with guards to let their relatives out.
Of the dozen or so women the Guardian spoke to in the camp, almost all expressed their desire to be released to Idlib, where they said relatives were waiting for them. Security guards and fighters expressed sympathy for the detainees, saying their continued detention was an injustice.
Outside the camp’s gates, security officers from the interior ministry guarded the gates. Some took off running as their walkie-talkies squawked: “They escaped, they escaped!” Their supervising officer laughed as the men ran, joking that if it were up to him, he would just open the gates.
It was unclear where the families who left the camp would go next. Some women told humanitarian workers they believed they would be repatriated – something that would require the consent of the home government.
Eriksson said the disorganised nature of the release left women and children vulnerable to trafficking or recruitment to violent extremist groups and urged states to intervene to repatriate their citizens.
She added: “Ending arbitrary detention is necessary, but the immediate priority must be to identify and protect these children and families, and to move them through safe, dignified processes involving international cooperation – not to leave them to navigate a conflict zone on their own.”
Many states have refused to take back their nationals, despite the pleas of Kurdish forces who guarded the camp and humanitarian groups who said detention conditions were substandard and unlawful.
“We’ve lost everything, all those years that we’ve been working on this issue,” said Hanan. She shared a video of a camp resident standing in her ransacked office, with the man vowing to find and kill her, referring to her by name and calling her a “pig”.
“I know this man. I tried to get him released from the camp, but the security agencies said he was a risk. Now that he’s out, I and all the humanitarian workers are in danger,” Hanan said.

Armenia asks Russia to brief its experts on modular NPP technology — Pashinyan

YEREVAN, February 13. /TASS/. Armenia has requested Russia to provide an onsite briefing to an Armenian expert delegation on Russia’s floating modular reactor technology, Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan announced at a news conference.
"We also discussed this topic - the construction of a modular nuclear power plant - with our Russian colleagues," Pashinyan explained. "Russia possesses this technology, which is uniquely characterized by its floating design, adapted from submarine reactor technology. If I’m correct, this technology is implemented in Chukotka (at the world’s only floating nuclear power plant, the Akademik Lomonosov, located in Pevek - TASS). We have asked our Russian counterparts to facilitate a visit for our expert delegation, so we can gain direct access to this innovative technology," he added.
Pashinyan also highlighted that during US Vice President JD Vance’s visit to Yerevan, Armenia joined the 123 Agreement on civil nuclear energy cooperation. This agreement enables Armenia to access comprehensive information about various modular reactor technologies developed in the United States.
"For countries not party to this agreement, such information remains classified. This means that outside the framework of the 123 Agreement, no one has access to the details of US modular reactor development," Pashinyan noted.
Nuclear power in Armenia
On February 3, Armenia's Minister of Territorial Administration and Infrastructure David Khudatyan announced that Armenia has decided on a modular reactor option for its future nuclear power plant (NPP), which will replace the current Metsamor facility. The country is currently reviewing proposals from Russia, the United States, China, South Korea, and France.
During Vice President Vance’s visit to Yerevan on February 9, an agreement was signed between Washington and Yerevan concerning civil nuclear energy cooperation. This agreement is expected to enable US companies to provide Armenia with approximately $9 billion worth of products and services in this sector, including small modular reactors.
The operation of Armenia’s existing Metsamor NPP is being extended through cooperation between the government and Russian firm Rusatom Service. This decision was finalized in December 2023 following a meeting of the Armenian-Russian intergovernmental commission. The Armenian government allocated $65 million to extend the lifespan of the plant’s second power unit until 2036.
Furthermore, on February 11, Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan stated that the Metsamor NPP’s operation could potentially be prolonged until 2046, ensuring Armenia’s continued nuclear energy capacity in the coming decades.

Cardi B and DHS get into online feud after she threatens to ‘jump’ ICE if they come to her concert
‘Why [y’all] don’t wanna talk about the Epstein files?’ Cardi B asked the Department of Homeland Security
- Bookmark
- CommentsGo to comments
The U.S. is at a point in its history where a federal agency is having an online slap flight with a famous rapper on a website that was spite-bought by the richest man on the planet.
Let's examine.
Cardi B is now feuding with the Department of Homeland Security on X after she said she and her fans would "jump ICE" — Immigration and Customs Enforcement — agents if they came to her concert to detain her fans.
ICE, which is under the umbrella of the DHS, and U.S. Customs and Border Protection have been the vanguard of President Donald Trump's immigration crackdowns during his second term. Their heavy-handed tactics — like brutalizing protesters and stalking around workplace, schools and courthouses to try to catch migrants at their most vulnerable — have left them deeply unpopular with a majority of Americans.
During a recent show in Palm Desert, California, the Grammy-winning Cardi B told her fans what they'd do if ICE agents showed at the event.
“If ICE come in here, we’re gonna jump they a****… I got some bear mace in the back. They ain’t taking my fans, b****. Let’s go!” she said, before launching into her hit song "I Like It."
A clip of Cardi B's comments went viral on Elon Musk’s X social media app and eventually made it back to the DHS.
“As long as she doesn’t drug and rob our agents, we’ll consider that an improvement over her past behavior,” the agency wrote on X, referencing that the rapper had previously admitted to drugging and robbing men before she made it big.
Cardi B fired back, invoking the DHS's own scandals.
“If we talking about drugs let’s talk about Epstein and friends drugging underage girls to rape them. Why yall don’t wanna talk about the Epstein files?” she wrote back, referencing the recently released — and in some places heavily-redacted — tranche of Epstein documents.
The black hole of modern politics has not only vacuumed up Cardi B, but her longtime nemesis Nicki Minaj. The two have had issues for nearly a decade, and now find themselves on opposite sides of national politics as well.
While Cardi B wants her fans to "jump" federal agents, Minaj has been literally holding hands with Trump on stage and insists he will not be bullied.
In December, Minaj appeared at a TurningPoint USA event with Erika Kirk, the widow of the organization's founder, Charlie Kirk.
Then, on January 28, Minaj spoke at the U.S. Treasury Department’s "Trump Accounts" Summit, where she held the president's bruised hand and promised no one would bully him.
“We’re not going to let them get away with bullying him, and … the smear campaigns," Minaj told the crowd. "It’s not going to work.”
She insisted at the time that she is “probably the president’s No. 1 fan, and that’s not going to change. And the hate, or what people have to say, does not affect me at all.”
Cardi B has been less vocal about politics over the last year. In September, she explained her reluctance to speak on political topics in a Billboard magazine interview.
"You know the reason why I've been so silent about politics?" she said. "There's a president that knows I've never supported him and it's like if I say something, he's not going to care. I tried to give people warnings and it is what it is. What I can do? What I can say?"

Attack on Muslim prayer protest ‘demands full explanation’: Albanese
Prime Minister Anthony Albanese has demanded an explanation from NSW police after officers broke up Muslim prayers at a chaotic protest in Sydney, also rebuking hard-left activists for defying laws designed to keep the protests peaceful and Jewish Australians safe.
Violent skirmishes broke out between demonstrators and police on Monday at a Sydney protest against the visit of Israeli President Isaac Herzog, which was criticised by pro-Palestine Labor backbenchers, the Greens and some independent MPs.
They said Albanese should not have invited a head of state who represents a nation accused of war crimes, and whose visit would compromise social cohesion.
In an interview on this masthead’s Inside Politics podcast, Albanese took a harder line on police actions at the protest than NSW Premier Chris Minns, who has repeatedly defended police. Nearly 30 people were arrested and 10 were charged. The police watchdog will investigate the actions of officers. Vision showed kneeling worshippers being pulled to their feet and then thrown to the ground.
“I’m concerned at the great deal of hurt which the Muslim community are feeling about the disruption of prayers,” Albanese said. “I think that is something that needs a full explanation. I know that that has caused a great deal of distress.”
In what turned into the latest flashpoint in more than two years of domestic brawling over the conflict in Gaza, the prime minister was condemned by a handful of teal independents this week for allowing the Herzog visit. The Jewish community asked for the head of the Jewish state to visit Bondi to mourn one of the deadliest attacks on Jews outside Israel in modern history.
The heat surrounding Herzog’s visit prompted NSW to use extraordinary powers to ban protests from the Sydney CBD to the eastern suburbs, where Sydney’s Jewish community is based. The rules give police more powers to move people on, to close specific locations and to search people.
The protesters were offered a nearby venue of Hyde Park, but Palestine Action Group organiser Josh Lees said that was inadequate because Town Hall was the most visible location. “We will not be shunted off to some park – out of sight, out of mind – on a dark weeknight,” he said this week.
Albanese described Lees as “far left” and sought to contrast activists from the many mainstream protesters who are peaceful and who hold genuine concern. The more hardline activists, Albanese said, had repeatedly shown disregard for social cohesion since October 7, 2023, including by picketing outside his Marrickville office and forcing it to be moved.
“The organisers were engaged with the police. They chose not to come up with or participate in a sensible way that would have ensured separation by having the meeting in Hyde Park and then walking to Belmore Park. It is beyond my comprehension why that would not be taken up, that suggestion by the New South Wales Police,” Albanese said.
“They need to comprehend that sometimes the actions don’t actually advance a cause. They undermine it, and that is what has occurred.
“You can have a strong position on the Middle East and on justice for Palestinians. And I support a Palestinian state being alongside the Israeli state, and my government is the first government to recognise Palestine. That doesn’t mean that you can’t empathise and understand that the Jewish community are really hurting in Australia.”
Albanese, who has also been criticised by conservatives for recognising a Palestinian state and for his response to the massacre, has passionately defended his decision to invite Herzog. He was compared unfavourably to Minns during the Bondi response. The NSW Labor figure was perceived to have acted with greater speed and more direct rhetoric, a charge Albanese rejects.
Herzog has no role in the military chain of command, although he has spoken in favour of the war effort, which one United Nations report found to constitute a genocide.
Herzog is a centre-left politician in Israel and “not a member of the Netanyahu government”, Albanese said, making him “the equivalent of Governor-General Sam Mostyn”.
“It doesn’t mean that, you know, I endorse all views or anything else. That’s not what it was about. Overwhelmingly, President Herzog, and I might say Ms Herzog as well, were comforting ... women who were grieving. That … was very moving,” he said.
“Can you imagine the message that that would send to the world, frankly, that we denied the head of state of Israel the opportunity, upon invitation, particularly from the families at Bondi, to come and grieve with them?”

I Watched 10 Wuthering Heights Adaptations.  Here’s What’s Worth Your Time
Unknown

The mark of a great, tough book may not be how many literature classes it’s taught in but how many film or TV adaptations you can drape on its branches without breaking them. Dramatizations are tricky business: No film-viewing experience can match the way an individual imagination—yours or mine—brings a writer’s words to life. Yet dogged faithfulness isn’t the goal, either. A film can be spiritually faithful to a book even when it jettisons whole shards of plot. A good adaptation is a lover, not a fighter; it entwines itself with a work, rather than clawing away at it.
Emily Brontë’s 1847 wind-thrashed sycamore of a novel, Wuthering Heights, holds power even over those who haven’t read it. No wonder filmmakers have been drawn to it almost since the advent of movies, beginning with the first known version—a 1920 British silent, now lost—and ending, for now, with Emerald Fennell’s candy-colored bodice ripper starring Margot Robbie and Jacob Elordi, which barely holds a dripping, gothic candle to any of the others (but more on that later). That means, whether you’ve read the middle Brontë sister’s novel or not, there’s a Wuthering Heights film or TV dramatization for you.
In fact, there are dozens, including a 1988 Japanese incarnation, a 2015 retelling set in a California high school, and several versions from India, a Bollywood musical among them. That said, not everyone loves Brontë’s book: For every reader who adores its intricate plot and discomfiting view of humanity, there’s at least one more who trudged through it in high school or college, never to return. Yet its polarizing effect may be the key to its magnetism; even those who dislike it have certainly absorbed some of its fragrant dolorousness into their bones. And although scholars are still debating whether Brontë set out to write a romance—she may have been more fixated on dissecting Victorian societal strictures—nearly everyone connects with the romantic, if dangerous, allure of the lovers at the heart of this story.
There’s Cathy, the spirited Yorkshire lass who’s fully in tune with the brutal, beautiful landscape in which she was born, though she also yearns for genteel comforts; and Heathcliff, the outsider of low birth who grows into a vengeful young man and, let’s just admit it, a smoldering symbol of unattainability and hotness. Did I mention that their imperishable bond involves necrophilia and an angry ghost? Though Brontë couldn’t have imagined the idea of movies in her lifetime, she created two characters—living, breathing phantoms of our own faults and desires—who were made for this particular interplay of shadow and light.
Let’s start with a Wuthering Heights that’s not for neophytes: Peter Kosminsky’s 1992 film features two dazzling stars—Juliette Binoche and Ralph Fiennes—but it’s curiously inert on the screen. It also highlights some of the problems of adapting this elaborately plotted work, a highwire act on Brontë’s part that involves a multigenerational revenge scheme enmeshing Cathy’s daughter and Heathcliff’s son, individuals born of the two lovers’ mixing with outsiders. Unless you’re mounting a 10-episode miniseries, some plot points will have to go, but Kosminsky’s reading is just too truncated. And though Robert Fuest’s 1970 version, starring future James Bond Timothy Dalton, has the nastiest psychosexual undertones of the 10 adaptations addressed here, it’s still a dud: Dalton’s wily Heathcliff, though handsome, is not particularly alluring. For a compact yet full-bodied blast of the Wuthering Heights experience, try the relatively faithful 2009 BBC adaptation starring Tom Hardy and Charlotte Riley, who met on set and became a couple in real life. Their scenes together have an erotic earthiness unmatched by almost any other onscreen Heathcliff-Cathy combo.
Which Wuthering Heights best matches the story’s jagged, haunting landscape to the fighting spirit of its central lovers? That would be Andrea Arnold’s 2011 version, starring James Howson and Kaya Scodelario. Though Brontë described Heathcliff as being “dark,” and it’s generally assumed that he’s meant to be Romani—or perhaps Irish—Arnold entertains another possibility: in this chilly, bracing reading, Heathcliff is a Black man, a choice that reinforces his outsider status. And for sheer spookiness, Peter Sasdy’s 1967 made-for-BBC-TV Wuthering Heights—starring Angela Scoular and Deadwood’s Ian McShane—is calling across the moor. This four-part series—whose director would go on to make several Hammer horror films—demands patience; it’s one of the few adaptations that attempts loyalty to Brontë’s plot, and it sometimes feels stiff and stagy. But the fact that it exists only in a spectral black-and-white version (the original color version no longer exists) makes it weirdly haunting. And its sound design is killer: The howling winds of the countryside figure in nearly every scene, indoors and out. This is also the version that inspired Kate Bush to write “Wuthering Heights,” a song that captures, like the flame inside a well-cut jewel, the story’s romantic obsessiveness.
Brontë’s novel has so much atmospheric power that it can survive translation to settings beyond hardscrabble Yorkshire. New wave master Jacques Rivette’s languorously alluring 1985 version sets the story in the sun-dappled Cevennes region of France. And Luis Buñuel’s deliciously named 1954 adaptation, Abismos de pasión, generates even more heat: Irasema Dilián and Jorge Mistral bring shimmering midcentury glamour to a story set in a hot, shrubby yet frequently rainswept desert.
Yet of all the Wuthering Heights adaptations, two stand tall—if, befitting the story, they’re still admirably twisted. David Skynner’s 1998 version, made for British TV and starring Robert Cavanah and Orla Brady (as well as a young, pre–Pride and Prejudice Matthew Macfadyen), leans into Heathcliff’s cruelty by including crucial details—the way, for instance, he confesses to having killed a nestful of baby lapwings by placing a net over their nest, preventing their parents from reaching them. This Wuthering Heights is visually gratifying (you’ve never seen more fabulous moonlit curls than on Cathy’s ghost) while also being a little florid and suitably sick.
But the finest Wuthering Heights is also perhaps the most famous—and, in terms of plot, possibly the least complete. In his 1939 version, William Wyler shaves away huge chunks of the story. But his lead characters breathe on the screen as they do in no other adaptation: Merle Oberon captures both Cathy’s capacity for earthbound delight and her desire for earthly finery; you might disapprove of her, but you can’t hate her. And Laurence Olivier may be the most sympathetic of all onscreen Heathcliffs. With his stern brow and unyielding gaze, you know he’s bad news, but his vulnerability is implied. Olivier’s Heathcliff is the ultimate “I can fix him!” boyfriend—not a good model for reality, but deeply alluring in fiction.
Which brings us to Emerald Fennell’s fan-fiction Wuthering Heights. Fennell has said that her version is intended not as a faithful re-creation but a reimagining, a good starting point for any adaptation. (As the critic Robin Wood once put it, “To reduce a great novel to its plot is merely to reveal a total incapacity for reading it.”) But that doesn’t mean you have to love Fennell’s creation. Her Cathy and Heathcliff, played by the admittedly gorgeous Robbie and Elordi, play slapstick jokes on one another, including a bit involving raw eggs: this, and some running to and fro through the craggy countryside, is supposed to indicate their connection to nature’s raw power. There’s lots of clandestine sex—after being separated and reunited, this Heathcliff and Cathy go at it like cartoony rabbits—but no carnality. Their assignations bump along methodically, PowerPoint-style. Even Cathy’s wardrobe disappoints: after she leaves the gloomy homestead where she and Heathcliff were raised and moves into her rich husband’s house, she’s decked out in a series of stiff, shiny dresses that look to have emerged from the $1.99-per-yard fabric bin, beloved by broke community-theater costumers everywhere.
Fennell also doesn’t bother dramatizing the way Heathcliff digs up, and embraces, Cathy’s corpse, a missed cinematic opportunity if ever there were one. And there are no ghosts here, though you will see a random hanged corpse with an erection. Brontë’s Wuthering Heights is a bleak book, but it’s not an ugly one: beneath its cloud cover of misanthropy, there’s feral, wildflower grace. Fennell has tossed all of that out, substituting her own unimaginative vision, plus a bunch of crappy dresses. A pretty dismal Valentine to a book a filmmaker ostensibly loves, this Wuthering Heights is hate-reading in movie form.

UN Security Council strongly condemns deadly mosque attack in Pakistan
'The members of the Security Council reaffirmed that terrorism in all its forms and manifestations constitutes one of the most serious threats to international peace and security,' says statement
HAMILTON, Canada
The UN Security Council on Friday condemned in the "strongest terms" the Feb. 6 suicide bombing that targeted a Shia mosque in Pakistan's capital Islamabad.
"The members of the Security Council condemned in the strongest terms the heinous and cowardly suicide bombing terrorist attack ... This reprehensible act of terrorism resulted in the grievous loss of at least 32 Pakistani nationals and 92 injured," a statement by members of the Security Council members said.
Extending condolences to the families of the victims and wishing a "speedy and full recovery" to those injured, the statement said: "The members of the Security Council reaffirmed that terrorism in all its forms and manifestations constitutes one of the most serious threats to international peace and security."
"The members of the Security Council underlined the need to hold perpetrators, organizers, financiers and sponsors of these reprehensible acts of terrorism accountable and bring them to justice," it added, urging all member states "to cooperate actively with the Government of Pakistan in this regard."
Reiterating that "any acts of terrorism are criminal and unjustifiable, regardless of their motivation wherever, whenever and by whomsoever committed," the members also noted "the need for all States to combat by all means, in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations and other obligations under international law, including international human rights law, international refugee law and international humanitarian law, threats to international peace and security caused by terrorist acts."
At least 32 people were killed, and 169 others injured when a suicide bomber blew himself up at the Khadija Tul Kubra Imambargah last week.
Pakistan said it arrested four facilitators, with Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi saying "terrorist organizations are operating from Afghanistan," and accused India of providing them financial support.
Both India and Afghanistan have denied any involvement in the attack.
The bombing was the second major attack in Islamabad in less than three months.

One in three French car manufacturing jobs was lost in dramatic 13-year decline

Employment in the French automotive industry fell from 425,500 in 2010 to 286,800 in 2023, representing a loss of nearly 139,000 full-time jobs or 33%.
According to a report released Thursday by the French National Institute of Statistics and Economic Studies (INSEE), the workforce in the country's automotive industry diminished by a third between 2010 and 2023.
This includes manufacturers, equipment makers and other suppliers, with the bulk of the disruption being caused by car manufacturers who cut 46,000 jobs during the 13-year period observed in the study.
Falling sales due to Chinese competition, among other factors, exacerbated the issue and led to consequent factory closures and relocations.
Renault and Stellantis, which includes over a dozen car brands such as Citroën, Fiat and Peugeot, set up operations in other parts of Europe where labour is cheaper such as Romania, Slovenia, Spain, Portugal and Slovakia.
The research conducted by the INSEE was the first to identify all types of industrial production related to the French automotive sector and depicts a bleak scenario.
The data becomes far worse when contrasted with the numbers from the non-automotive industry, where the workforce remained stable with only a 1% decrease.
Dire future for the French automotive industry
The contraction and consequent relocation of the French car manufacturing business has negatively affected several associated industries in the country and since 2023 the trend has only accelerated.
Parts suppliers in France were even more impacted by the relocation of the car manufacturers, with equipment and component makers reducing their workforce in the country by 31.5%, representing a loss of 92,700 full-time jobs.
Additionally, Michelin, Valeo, Forvia, Bosch, Lisi and Dumarey are all in the process of closing sites in France.
The contrast is stark between the jobs dependent on the success of the French automotive industry and the employment numbers for the non-associated sections of the same industrial sectors.
Manufacturers of rubber and plastics for the automotive industry have lost 43% of their workforce, while those outside the automotive sector only saw a 3% decline.
The same disparity can be observed in the metallurgy sector, where a 42% decrease in jobs was noted for car-related production but, again, only a 3% decline in employment for other parts of the same sector.
For metal products there is a 27% fall in the automotive-based sector but jobs are virtually stable in other areas.
Even more striking, in chemicals there is a 29% decline in employment for automotives but a 19% increase in jobs servicing other businesses.
Ultimately, these clear-cut disparities underscore a deepening structural crisis, illustrating how the French automotive sector is rapidly decoupling from the stability of the broader industrial landscape, with no signs of recovery and many indicators of aggravation.

Czech president says Europe cannot yet replace US role in NATO defense
Pavel calls for stronger European pillar with coordinated timelines to avoid security gaps if Washington reduces presence
MUNICH
Czech President Petr Pavel said Europe is currently unable to replace the US' military role within NATO if Washington were to withdraw its forces, warning that closer coordination is needed as transatlantic defense ties face growing strain and uncertainty.
Speaking to Anadolu on the sidelines of the Munich Security Conference, Pavel said the US remains central to the alliance’s security architecture.
"The United States is presenting significant part of NATO defense, and if all US presence and capabilities are withdrawn today, then we could say Europe will not be able to substitute this gap," he said.
His remarks come amid renewed debates in Europe about strategic autonomy and concerns that Washington could scale back its commitments, increasing pressure on European allies to boost their own capabilities.
Still, Pavel stressed the 32-member alliance operates through partnership and consultation rather than abrupt shifts.
"As partners and allies, we always work in coordination," he said.
He voiced support for strengthening what he described as the European pillar of NATO, provided any transition is carefully managed and communicated in advance.
“I truly believe that the idea of strengthening the European pillar of NATO will be well coordinated in a way that whatever capacity United States would like to withdraw, they will inform us about the timeframe, which will be realistic enough for European countries to build our own enabler so that we can effectively defend ourselves even if United States decide to withdraw partially or totally their presence from Europe," he said.
He indicated that with realistic timelines and preparation, Europe could gradually assume greater responsibility for its own defense even if the US decides to reduce its presence.

UK ad agencies undergo their biggest exodus of staff as AI threatens industry

UK advertising agencies had their biggest annual exodus of staff last year, led by younger workers, as artificial intelligence tools threaten to replace workers and force the industry to cut jobs and costs.
Staff numbers at creative agencies, which are facing acute pressure from the rollout of AI tools that reduce or even replace the need for agency staff, fell more than 14% in 2025.
The Institute of Practitioners in Advertising (IPA), which has been reporting on staffing in the UK ad industry since 1959, said it was the biggest year-on-year slump since it started separately reporting staff numbers at creative and media agencies in 2004.
The IPA, which is made up of member agencies that handle more than 85% of the UK’s £22bn annual ad spend, said the total number of employees fell to 24,963, down from 26,787 in 2024.
At creative agencies, many of which are based in the industry’s heartland of London, staff numbers fell by more than 2,000, from 14,775 to 12,659.
The decline has been particularly pronounced among younger workers, with the number of employees aged 25 or under falling by 19.2% last year, as the march of AI either cost jobs or led many to re-evaluate their long-term prospects in the industry. Staff numbers in that demographic fell from 3,632 to 2,936.
The overall figures showed that almost 60% of staff that left agencies last year chose to resign.
The IPA said 24% of agencies expected to cut jobs directly as a result of AI this year – a threefold increase on the number that did owing to the technology in 2025.
There was a 41% decrease in advertised jobs across all levels of seniority in the industry last year, led by a reduction of almost half at creative agencies.
Creative agencies are also giving up on graduate recruitment – as trainees, apprentices or school-leaver apprentices – with just 43% saying they took on any as employees last year. This is a considerable slump from the 56% reported in 2024.
“These numbers confirm that the agency model is gasping for air,” said James Kirkham, the founder of the agency Iconic. “The mistake everyone is making is still treating AI like an efficiency play – shave a few numbers, strip some cost, reduce headcount to get the same output but with fewer people.”
He added: “Death by a thousand cuts with a spreadsheet is not the transformation needed. The real, and only, move is proper creative coexistence. Agencies need to learn to co-create with AI, not outsource the process to these tools, and then they will find they can punch above their weight.”
WPP, which dropped out of the FTSE 100 last year for the first time in almost three decades as it struggles to retain clients and catch up with the AI and data capabilities of rivals, is expected to announce sweeping changes to its creative agency operations later this month.
The group, which has already scrapped prestigious agencies such as J Walter Thompson and Young & Rubicam, is to bring its three remaining ones – Ogilvy, VML and AKQA – together under the banner of WPP Creative.
After the publication of the IPA figures, Trent Patterson, the chief executive of Publicis London, turned to LinkedIn to remind the ad sector that the French-headquartered group continued to perform strongly compared with rivals.
He said the IPA figures were a reminder of how challenging the market was for “many talented people at the moment”.
“We’re fortunate to be in a moment of real momentum and we don’t take that for granted,” he added, in a post that contained information about a range of roles for which the London agency was hiring.
Paul Bainsfair, the director general of the IPA, said the fall in staff numbers, the rate of staff turnover and the steep fall in entry-level roles “raises real questions about future capability, particularly as AI reshapes skills and ways of working”.

Man admits rape of former Conservative councillor’s ex-wife
Police said Dean Hamilton’s offences relate to wider criminal proceedings involving Joanne Young, who has waived her right to anonymity
- Bookmark
A man has admitted raping and sexually assaulting the ex-wife wife of a former councillor.
Dean Hamilton, 47, admitted one charge of assault by penetration, two of sexual assault and one of rape relating to June 30 2015 at Winchester Crown Court on Friday.
Wiltshire Police said Hamilton’s offences relate to wider criminal proceedings involving Joanne Young, who has waived her right to anonymity.
Judge Christopher Parker KC granted Hamilton conditional bail ahead of sentencing at a later date.
He told the defendant, of no fixed abode, to expect a “very lengthy prison sentence in due course”.
Her former husband, Philip Young, 49, previously admitted multiple charges including rape, sexual assault, assault by penetration and voyeurism.
Young, formerly of Swindon, but now of Amberley Road, Enfield, also admitted multiple counts of administering a substance to his then-wife with intent to stupefy her – with all offences taking place between 2010 and 2023.
He admitted 48 of the 56 charges against him, pleading guilty to 14 counts of voyeurism, 11 of rape, 11 of administering a substance with intent, seven of assault by penetration, four of sexual assault and one of publishing obscene articles.
Young also published more than 500 intimate images and videos of his ex-wife and recorded her doing private acts for his own sexual gratification without her consent between 2010 and 2024.
Young, who served as a Conservative Swindon borough councillor for Covingham and Nythe between 2007 and 2010, pleaded not guilty to eight further charges.
He denied three charges of making indecent images of children, alleged to have occurred in July 2024.
Young also pleaded not guilty to possessing a prohibited image and four charges of possessing an extreme pornographic image between January 2019 and January 2024.
Four other men have appeared in court charged with sexual offences against Ms Young.
Norman Macksoni, of Wood End Close in Sharnbrook, Bedfordshire, 47; and Richard Wilkins, 61, of Toothill, Swindon, Wiltshire, have both pleaded not guilty to one count of rape and one charge of possessing an extreme pornographic image.
Wilkins has also denied one charge of assault by penetration.
Connor Sanderson Doyle, 31, of Crofton Road, Swindon, has pleaded not guilty to sexual assault by penetration and sexual touching.
Mohammed Hassan, 37, of Torun Way in Swindon, has pleaded not guilty to sexual touching.
Police are also appealing for help to identify another man wanted in connection with the case, describing him as being of large build, with scarring on the back of his head and a distinctive tattoo on the left side of his chest.
Young, Macksoni, Wilkins, Doyle and Hassan are due to stand trial in October.

Stubb: Putin fails strategically
This was stated by the President of Finland, Alexander Stubb, during a speech at the Munich Security Conference, Ukrinform’s correspondent reports.
As Stubb noted, he would not give advice to Ukrainians, but he believes they will win this war.
"First of all, Putin has failed strategically. He wanted to make Ukraine Russian, it became European. He wanted to prevent the enlargement of NATO, he got Finland and Sweden. And he wanted to keep our defense expenditure down, and it's now going up to 5%," Stubb emphasized.
He stressed that Russia is also losing in the military dimension. He noted that Russia's territorial gains on the front in Ukraine are minimal. At the same time, in December last year alone, Ukraine managed to eliminate about 34,000 Russian soldiers in just one month, while Russia was unable to compensate for these losses with new recruitment.
"So my answer is – just keep on what you are doing, and at the end of the day you will prevail and win this war," Stubb addressed Ukrainians.
As previously reported, German Chancellor Friedrich Merz called for a reset of the transatlantic partnership, acknowledging a deep divide between Europe and the United States.
The 62nd Munich Security Conference began on February 13, a leading global forum for discussing key international security challenges.
About 1,000 representatives from nearly 120 countries are taking part in the three-day event, including almost 60 heads of state and government, 56 foreign ministers, and more than 30 defense ministers, as well as leaders of over 40 international organizations.
The Ukrainian delegation is headed by President Volodymyr Zelensky.

Boss of P&O Ferries owner DP World leaves over Jeffrey Epstein emails
- DP World, the global logistics and transport giant and owner of P&O Ferries, has removed its chairman, Sultan Ahmed bin Sulayem, following the publication of messages exchanged with convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.
- Essa Kazim has been appointed as the new chairman of the Dubai-based firm, which also operates major container ports in London and Southampton, with Yuvraj Narayan named as the group chief executive officer.
- The decision followed intense pressure on DP World after the US justice department released fresh files detailing communications between Sulayem and Epstein.
- These messages included an email from Epstein referencing a 'torture video', and Sulayem's emails discussing attempts to meet a supermodel, sending links to fetish porn websites, and describing women.
- DP World stated the new appointments support its strategy for sustainable growth, while the company had previously faced criticism in 2022 over P&O Ferries sacking 800 staff.

US inflation cools more than expected, kindling hopes of Fed rate cut
The consumer price index rose 2.4 per cent year-on-year, the lowest level since May, though affordability concerns still weigh on households
Consumer inflation in the US cooled slightly more than expected in January, government data showed Friday, as energy prices dipped.
Analysts say the figure allows the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates again later this year, but warn that policymakers need to see sustained improvement to do so – despite US President Donald Trump’s insistence that there is virtually no inflation.
The consumer price index (CPI) rose 2.4 per cent year-on-year, the Department of Labour said, down from December’s 2.7 per cent and slightly below analysts’ median forecast. This was the lowest level since May 2025.
The White House swiftly lauded the report, with deputy press secretary Kush Desai saying it proves that Trump “has defeated” an uptick in inflation that took place under his predecessor Joe Biden.
Yet, affordability worries have come to the fore in recent months as price increases in areas like food weighed on households, and as Trump’s tariffs flowed through the world’s biggest economy.
Although tariffs have not triggered a broad inflation surge, firms have reported higher business costs. Many companies, however, tried to soften the blow by stocking up on inventory ahead of planned levy hikes and avoided passing on additional costs in full to consumers.

MSC: Germany's Merz urges new 'trans-Atlantic partnership'
February 13, 2026German Chancellor Friedrich Merz urged a new "trans-Atlantic partnership" during his address at the Munich Security Conference (MSC) on Friday.
He stressed not even the US was powerful enough to go it alone in an increasingly tough world.
'The culture war of the MAGA movement is not ours'
Merz referenced a speech by US Vice President JD Vance during last year's MSC, where Vance chided Europeans over the state of free speech on the continent and migration.
"A rift has opened up between Europe and the United States. Vice President JD Vance said this very openly here in Munich a year ago," Merz said.
"He was right. The culture war of the MAGA movement is not ours," Merz said, referring to US President Donald Trump's "Make America Great Again" slogan. "Freedom of speech ends here with us when that speech goes against human dignity and the constitution. We do not believe in tariffs and protectionism, but in free trade."
The Trump administration in December imposed visa entry bans on five prominent European figures over accusations they are "censoring" Americans online. Trump in his second term also announced 20% tariffs on EU goods until a trade framework deal was reached later in the year between the two sides.
Trump's push for the US acquisition of Greenland, a territory of NATO member Denmark, has also prompted alarm in Europe. Merz said that Danish Prime Minister Mette Fredriksen "knows that she can rely on European solidarity. There is no limitation to that."
US not powerful enough to go it alone in era of 'great power rivalry'
Merz said the old international rule-based order was being destroyed.
"This order, however, imperfect it was even at its best, no longer exists in that form," Merz said, speaking of a dangerous new era of "great power politics" where freedoms are "endangered."
Merz's comments come as Russia's invasion of Ukraine will soon enter its fifth year. China is also becoming more aggressive toward the self-governing island of Taiwan, which Beijing views as its territory.
"Being a part of NATO is not only Europe's competitive advantage," Merz said. "It's also the United States' competitive advantage. So let's repair and revive trans-Atlantic trust together."
"In the era of great power rivalry, even the United States will not be powerful enough to go it alone," the German chancellor said.
Merz meets with Rubio on MSC sidelines
US Secretary of State Marco Rubio is leading a group of officials from the Trump administration to the Munich Security Conference. Rubio is often seen as more diplomatic and less abrasive towards Europe than JD Vance.
Merz and German Foreign Minister Wadephul met with Rubio on the first day of the MSC.
"The United States and Germany are close friends & steadfast partners," Wadephul said in a post on X. "Today's meeting with Secretary Rubio and the chancellor reaffirmed our strong trans-Atlantic ties, based on our shared interests, and our agreement on many key issues — including a strong NATO & a strong Europe."
Also in attendance at the MSC are Democrats such as California Governor Gavin Newsom, New York congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Arizona Senator Ruben Gallago who may push for the Europeans to take a tougher stance towards the Trump administration.
UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer, French President Emmanuel Macron, NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy will also take part in this year's MSC.

A sexually transmitted ringworm is spreading in one US state
It can take months to treat the fungal infections, which were first reported in the U.S. in 2024
- Bookmark
- CommentsGo to comments
Minnesota is seeing the largest outbreak of sexually transmitted ringworm in the U.S., with infections disproportionately affecting men who have sex with men.
More than 30 confirmed or suspected cases of the fungal infection have been reported in the state since last July, according to the Minnesota Department of Health, and all were within the Twin Cities metropolitan area.
The ringworm - known as trichophyton mentagrophytes genotype VII, or “TMVII” - was first reported in New York City in June 2024.
Minnesota’s Health Department said that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is aware of other sporadic cases in larger cities across the U.S.
California’s Department of Public Health previously said the first patient with TMVII had traveled to California before he was diagnosed in New York.
TMVII has been circulating in Europe and among people who traveled to Southeast Asia for sex tourism for several years, but is not currently considered widespread in the U.S.
A coin-like rash
TMVII is the only known sexually transmitted fungal infection, according to the Cleveland Clinic.
Sometimes confused for eczema or psoriasis, TMVII spreads through skin-to-skin contact or exposure to fungal spores. The ringworm can spread through genital contact, as well as to the face, bottom, torso, arms and legs.
It can cause painful and itchy red, coin-like rashes, sometimes with bumps or pimples on top.
Infections can vary in severity, sometimes leading to complications even with treatment.
Patients may see lesions and open sores that increase the risk for secondary bacterial infections and lead to harmful inflammation.
“Some patients might develop painful and persistent rashes that can lead to scarring or worsening infections that need to be treated with antibiotics,” health officials warned last month.
A lengthy treatment process
Diagnosing TMVII infection requires advanced testing, although most labs have trouble distinguishing TMVII from two other fungal infections known as T. mentagrophytes and T. interdigitale, according to the CDC.
Patients may require weeks or even months of oral medication, and people should avoid using steroid creams, as they will worsen TMVII infection.
To prevent exposure, people should avoid sexual contact if they or their partner has a new rash and avoid sharing personal items, such as clothing, towels, bedding and razors.
Items should be washed and dried on high heat, and fungal spores can be killed with common disinfectants or strong detergents.
People who believe they have a rash should make sure it is covered with bandages or clothing and wash their hands with soap after touching the infected area to reduce the risk of spread to other areas of the body.
“While the overall public health risk is low, state health officials say MSM, people who use anonymous apps, and people with a history of sexually transmitted infections may be at higher risk,” according to the University of Minnesota’s Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy.

From Arena Mexico to the World Cup, a wrestling-mask boom is taking shape
A Mexico City mask maker is gearing up for a World Cup sales boom
- Bookmark
Guadalupe Zuñiga has been around wrestling masks for as long as she can remember.
It is a relationship that began when she watched her father performing in the ring and she has now transformed it into a business eagerly awaiting the start of soccer's 2026 World Cup.
The 42-year-old Zuñiga, daughter of the famous late wrestler Angel Azteca, owns a factory in the popular barrio of Iztapalapa on the outskirts of Mexico City, where her team produce an average of 300 wrestling masks a week.
“We expect a very large increase in sales with so many foreigners because wrestling and masks are a Mexican symbol. We hope the stores we work with will ask us for more of this product,” Zúñiga told The Associated Press.
Zuñiga works closely with well-known wrestlers like Tinieblas, Blue Panther, Ultimo Guerrero and Mascara Sagrada. She produces customised masks that are hand made and can take up to two days to make.
“There are more collectors now. Fifteen years ago there were not many people saying, ‘I have 30 masks at my place’, now you have fans with 50 or 100 masks at home,” she said. “I think in the past six years the business has grown. You have tourists coming and they stop by the shops that sell them to get one.”
Around the Arena Mexico wrestling venue, and other tourist spots around the city like the Angel de la Independencia, there are cheaper versions of the masks that sell for as low as 50 pesos (around $3). Custom-made versions can sell for hundreds of dollars depending on design.
Like Zúñiga, the street vendors outside the Arena Mexico are also aware sales are going to go up during the World Cup.
“We always have many foreign customers, but we expect many more during the World Cup. We’ll try to give them a nice souvenir to take back to their countries,” said Clementina López, who sells masks near the Arena Mexico.
Mexico will host 13 World Cup matches. Guadalajara and Monterrey have four games apiece and the capital Mexico City has five.
Authorities expect five million tourists during the tournament.
History behind the masks
Late Mexican writer Carlos Monsivais, a fan of Lucha Libre freestyle wrestling, said wrestlers liked to use masks because it provided them with an intimidating face.
“The mask has magic. It’s like having two identities,” wrestler Star Black said. “We can lead a double life, one in the ring and another outside of it.”
It is believed the first person to wear a mask in Mexico was American wrestler Corbin James Massey, who in 1933 lost on his debut under the nickname “Cyclone Mackey”.
A year later he wanted to fight again but did not wish to be recognized so he asked for a mask made by Antonio Martinez, a local craftsman.
Massey then started wrestling under the alias “Maravilla Enmascarada” (Masked Marvel) to start a tradition that was followed in 1938 by fellow competitor Jesus “Murcielago” Velazquez of Mexico and then in the 1950s by icons Santo, Blue Demon and Huracan Ramirez.
Crossover to other sports
It is still unclear the exact moment when fans started wearing masks at soccer matches, but that sport and the lucha libre are two favorite pastimes for Mexicans.
Adidas, the German clothing company that sponsors the Mexican national team, created a jersey inspired by Rey Mysterio, a Mexican-American wrestler popular on both sides of the border, for the 2014 World Cup.
But soccer stadiums are not the only places where masks are popular. At the Mexican Formula 1 Grand Prix two years ago, local driver Sergio Pérez and Max Verstappen wore one and George Russell did the same last year.
For the 2024 race, Perez also wore a special helmet that featured a wrestling mask.
“This helmet is special because I really love Mexican culture and lucha libre. We love lucha libre, I’m a wrestler and I wanted to add a mask to it,” Pérez said at the time.
The helmet featured a blue mask with a red-eye mask on top. It also displayed the words “Minister of Defense” and “Never Give Up.”
“When I showed it to my children, they really liked it,” Perez added.
Another high-profile athlete known for donning a wrestling mask is the Seattle Mariners outfielder Randy Arozarena, who wore Ignacio Uribe Mistico’s mask in the dugout during Mexican team games as a lucky charm. He said the wrestler's “mystical magic” could help them win.
Professional wrestlers who wear them in Mexico are aware of the euphoria surrounding the marks outside the ring.
“It’s no secret that where you see a person wearing a mask, you see a Mexican," professional wrestler Magnus said. "You see it in soccer and baseball. People wear masks because that’s what characterizes us.
“It’s a great gesture that lucha libre is crossing borders. It’s a sign of respect because they see us as heroes and it also helps them express their emotions.”
Zúñiga’s factory made the masks for Perez, Verstappen and Russell and more work is coming her way.
“I’ve already had special requests for the World Cup, there are several designs that we are working on. We’ve ordered certain fabrics to make special products, special models for the World Cup,” Zúñiga said. “I cannot show them to you, but they are going to be very special”.

In Munich, IAEA Chief Says Nuclear Inspection Regime With Iran 'Technically Possible'

Developing a inspection regime to underpin any new Iran nuclear arrangement is "absolutely possible," though extremely difficult, the head of the United Nations atomic watchdog said.
Speaking at a panel discussion at the Munich Security Conference, Raphael Grossi, of the International Atomic Energy Agency, said Iran's nuclear landscape had changed drastically following the US bombing of Iran's nuclear facilities in Fordow, Isfahan, and Natanz last year.
"This is absolutely possible, and it is terribly difficult, but it is technically possible and it is politically even viable," Grossi said on February 13, referring to the challenge of establishing a credible inspection regime.
The physical infrastructure of Iran's nuclear program has been largely damaged, he said, and that future monitoring would need to focus not only on what remains but on how Tehran's nuclear capabilities could evolve going forward.
Grossi noted that while agency inspectors have returned to Iran and are monitoring all undamaged facilities, they still lack access to sites struck during the bombing.
His remarks come as diplomatic engagement between Tehran and Washington continues. The United States, meanwhile, has bolstered its military presence, deploying a second aircraft carrier to the Middle East in preparation for a potential strike.
Grossi underscored the delicate balance facing negotiators: upholding Iran's right to peaceful nuclear activity under the Nuclear Non‑Proliferation Treaty while ensuring robust verification to build confidence and avoid escalation.
"We know perfectly well what needs to be checked and how to check it," he said, adding that light may be visible "at the end of the tunnel" if progress continues.
Iran insists that any agreement with the United States can only focus on the nuclear program, rejecting demands to negotiate restrictions on its ballistic missiles.
White House special envoy Steve Witkoff and Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araqchi held indirect talks in Oman on February 6. Both sides said more talks would be held soon, though no date has been set.

The Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) has rejected Vladyslav Heraskevych’s claim against the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and the International Bobsleigh and Skeleton Federation, Suspilne Sport has said.
The court’s decision was made at 17:15 local time: Heraskevych’s claim against the IOC and IBSF has been rejected.
"We confirm that freedom of expression is allowed at the Olympics, but not at the competition venue. The judge listened to the arguments of both sides and made a decision in accordance with the IOC guidelines," CAS Secretary General Matthew Reid said.

Heraskevych loses appeal, but already knew his chance of racing in Olympics is over

Ukrainian skeleton racer loses his appeal over helmet honoring war victims at the Olympics
Ukrainian skeleton racer loses his appeal over helmet honoring war victims at the Olympics
CORTINA D’AMPEZZO, Italy (AP) — Ukrainian skeleton athlete Vladyslav Heraskevych took his case to sport’s highest court on Friday, detailing the reasons why he wanted to race at the Milan Cortina Olympics in a helmet that paid tribute to his country’s war victims.
The arbitrator was moved by his story but ruled against him anyway, denying him his last chance for a win of any kind at this year’s Olympics.
The Court of Arbitration for Sport denied Heraskevych’s appeal of his disqualification from the men’s skeleton race, agreeing with the International Olympic Committee and the sliding sport’s federation that his plan to wear a helmet showing the faces of more than 20 Ukrainian coaches and athletes killed since Russia invaded their country four years ago would violate Olympic rules.
“The court sided with the IOC and upheld the decision that an athlete could be disqualified from the Olympic Games without actual misconduct, without a technical or safety threat, and before the start,” wrote Yevhen Pronin, Heraskevych’s attorney.
CAS said the sole arbitrator who heard the case sided with IOC policy about what athletes at an Olympics can say on a field of play — and that the “memory helmet” Heraskevych brought to the Milan Cortina Games would not align with the rules.
The arbitrator, CAS said, “found these limitations reasonable and proportionate,” especially since Heraskevych could show his helmet away from the racing surface, such as in interview areas and on social media. Heraskevych also wore the helmet in training runs.
CAS added that the arbitrator “is fully sympathetic to Mr. Heraskevych’s commemoration and to his attempt to raise awareness for the grief and devastation suffered by the Ukrainian people, and Ukrainian athletes because of the war.”
The appeal, which Heraskevych felt he would win, was largely moot anyway. He was disqualified from the competition 45 minutes before its start on Thursday, and whatever CAS said on Friday wouldn’t have changed that.
“Looks like this train has left,” Heraskevych said after Friday’s hearing, knowing there was no way he could race.
He left Cortina d’Ampezzo’s Olympic Village on Thursday night with no plans to return, then headed to Milan and arrived in Munich on Friday night — helmet in hand — for a dinner with Ukrainian officials at a security conference. He met with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy as well and was presented with his country’s Order of Freedom.
“Ukraine will always have champions and Olympians,” Zelenskyy said on social media. “But above all, Ukraine’s greatest asset is Ukrainians — those who cherish the truth and the memory of the athletes killed by Russia, athletes who will never compete again because of the Russian aggression.”
Heraskevych was blocked from racing by the IOC and the International Bobsled and Skeleton Federation on Thursday after the slider and his father emerged from a last-minute, last-ditch meeting with IOC President Kirsty Coventry — who was unable to get Heraskevych to change his mind.
His disqualification was justified, Coventry reiterated Friday. The IOC made its decision, one that moved Coventry to tears, off the guidelines for athlete expression at the Olympics.
They say, in part, “the focus on the field of play during competitions and official ceremonies must be on celebrating athletes’ performances.” Heraskevych never made it to the field of play — not in competition, anyway.
“I think that he in some ways understood that but was very committed to his beliefs, which I can respect,” Coventry said. “But sadly, it doesn’t change the rules.”
The IOC contends the rule is in place for multiple reasons, including protecting the athletes from pressure from their own countries or others about using Olympic platforms to make statements.
“I never expected it to be such a big scandal,” Heraskevych said.
He also said he found his accreditation for the games being taken away, then returned in short order on Thursday in what seemed like a goodwill gesture, was puzzling.
“A mockery,” he said.
CAS did agree that Heraskevych should keep his accreditation.
Heraskevych said he felt his disqualification fed into Russian propaganda, noting he and other Ukrainian athletes have seen Russian flags at events at these games — even though they are not allowed by Olympic rule. He has previously spoken out against the IOC’s decision to allow Russians and Belarusians to compete at Milan Cortina as “neutral” athletes and said the IOC empowered Russia by awarding it the 2014 Sochi Games.
He also wondered why other tributes from these Olympics, such as U.S. figure skater Maxim Naumov displaying a photo of his late parents — killed in a plane crash last year — have been permitted without penalty.
Italian snowboard competitor Roland Fischnaller had a small Russian flag image on the back of his helmet during these games and Israeli skeleton athlete Jared Firestone wore a kippah with the names of the 11 athletes and coaches who were killed representing that country during the 1972 Munich Olympics.
Pronin wrote that IOC representatives at Friday’s hearing said “they were not punished because they did not declare this in advance, but did it after the fact, so there was no point in disqualifying them.”
The IOC said those cases were not in violation of any rules. Naumov showed his photo in the kiss-and-cry area and not while he was actually on the ice, Fischnaller’s helmet was a tribute to all the past Olympic sites he competed at with Sochi included, and Firestone’s kippah “was covered by a beanie,” IOC spokesman Mark Adams said.
The IOC offered Heraskevych the chance to compete with a different helmet and bring the tribute one through the interview area after his runs. He also could have worn a black armband, which the IOC typically bans. It says it just didn’t want him making a statement by competing in the helmet.
“I think it’s the wrong side of history for the IOC,” Heraskevych said.

Top Saudi diplomat points to breakdown of Eurocentric rules-based world order

MUNICH, February 13. /TASS/. The breakdown of the Eurocentric rules-based order became clear to many countries long before the current conflicts, Saudi Arabia's Foreign Minister Prince Faisal bin Farhan Al-Saud said, addressing the Munich Security Conference.
"Obviously it came out of the crisis in Europe and World War I that World War II is what gave us the United Nations and the foundations of that world order, so fair enough, there was a certain Eurocentric or transatlantic focus. But the reality is, many of us have seen the breakdown of that rules-based order and the reality that might makes right being very much front and center well before the crisis," he pointed out.
According to the top Saudi diplomat, many countries have long been convinced that the current system of international relations "isn’t working, that it hasn’t delivered." He noted that the breakdown of international law had largely affected developing nations in the past two decades, while Europe and the US could stand aside. In his view, the conflict in Ukraine made it clear.

Palestinian paramedic detained in Gaza dies in Israeli prison
A Palestinian paramedic from Gaza has died while in Israeli detention amid reports of torture and medical negligence.
Hatem Ismail Rayyan, a 59-year-old paramedic, was pronounced dead at the Negev prison, a press statement from the Commission of Detainees’ Affairs and the Palestinian Prisoners Society announced on Thursday evening.
Rayyan was detained by Israeli forces on 27 December 2024 from the premises of Gaza’s Kamal Adwan Hospital in Beit Lahia, alongside his injured son Moaz Rayyan who remains in Israeli detention.
The hospital had been under siege by the Israeli military and then was forcibly closed by Israeli authorities after they stormed the premises at the end of December. Israel set the facilities on fire, forcibly removing and arresting dozens of patients and staff.
At the time, Kamal Adwan Hospital had been the last major functioning medical facility serving northern Gaza.
Dr. Hussam Abu Safia, the hospital’s director, was detained on the same day as Rayyan.
According to his family, Rayyan had suffered a stroke shortly before his detention, yet chose to continue delivering medical assistance until his detention.
The two Palestinian organisations that announced his death said they hold Israel "fully responsible" for what happened to him, renewing calls for international human rights organisations to investigate mounting evidence of torture and abuse at the hands of Israeli authorities.
Dr. Muneer Alboursh, the director of Gaza’s health ministry, condemned Rayyan’s death and said, "Prisons have become another arena of suffering, marked by allegations of torture, starvation, medical neglect, and prolonged detention without trial".
Israeli prison authorities have not issued an official statement detailing the circumstances around his death.
Rayyan is the third medical officer to have died in Israeli detention.
At least 88 Palestinian detainees have died since Israel’s war on Gaza began in October 2023, 52 of whom were arrested in Gaza.
Mounting evidence of torture and violations
Human rights organisations have raised concerns over signs of torture seen on prisoners’ bodies after they were returned to Gaza by Israel during prisoner exchanges. Dozens of other bodies of deceased detainees are still being withheld by Israeli authorities.
Israeli NGO B'Tselem says many detention facilities have turned into "torture camps" with Palestinians subjected to sexual, physical and psychological abuse, inhuman detention conditions, deliberate starvation and denial of medical care.
At least 325 Palestinian detainees have died since 1967, not including the toll among prisoners reported to have been killed in the field, something which groups like the PPS argue amount to conclusive evidence of systematic field executions.
Rayyan’s death comes amid accelerated efforts by the far-right government of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to push for a bill formalising the execution of Palestinian detainees.
The bill mandates the death penalty for prisoners convicted of murder on crimes that Israel defines as having a "terrorist motivation" as part of a legal framework that applies exclusively to Palestinians.
More than 9,300 prisoners are currently being held in Israeli prisons, an estimated 50% of whom are currently held without trial, either under arbitrary administrative detention orders or under the classification of being so-called "unlawful combatants".

Inflation expectations to decline slowly, gradual rate cut needed — Bank of Russia

MOSCOW, February 13. /TASS/. The decline in inflationary expectations will occur rather slowly, requiring a smoother trajectory for reduction of the key rate, Russian Central Bank Governor Elvira Nabiullina said.
"Over the past four years, when inflation targets were not met due to inflationary shocks, inflation expectations became entrenched at elevated levels. Their decline will occur quite slowly, including due to the increased rate of adjustment of regulated services and tariffs in the coming years," she told a press conference following the meeting of the regulator’s Board of Directors.
"All this will require us, all things being equal, to pursue a smoother trajectory for reduction of the key rate. It will enable us to return stable inflation to 4% in the second half of the year, and to bring the economy back to a balanced state," Nabiullina added.
Meanwhile Russian households’ inflation expectations remained unchanged this January, while the price expectations of businesses, after the January surge, fell significantly in February and even returned to October levels, she noted.

Palestinian FM urges empowerement of govt to run Gaza administration

Palestinian Foreign Minister Varsen Aghabekian Shaheen on Friday called for empowering the Palestinian Authority to govern the Gaza Strip, saying the government is prepared to take over responsibilities and warning that continued marginalization would undermine any postwar arrangements.
Speaking during a panel discussion at the Munich Security Conference, Shaheen said the Palestinian leadership has long been planning for the "day after” in Gaza and is not starting from scratch.
"Yes, we’re ready,” she said in response to a question about timelines for taking over Gaza’s governance. "We’ve been thinking about the day after in Gaza for some time. We’ve had plans that were endorsed by the Arab League, the Muslim world and the international community at large.”
Shaheen said the key requirement is for the Palestinian government to be empowered to carry out its responsibilities, arguing that the current sidelining of the Palestinian Authority is "unsustainable.”
"Today, the Palestinian government is marginalized, and you cannot continue marginalizing a government,” she said, adding that developments in Gaza are inseparable from those in the West Bank.
She pointed to practical governance issues, including population records and passport issuance, which are administered through the West Bank, saying this underscores the need to involve the Palestinian Authority from the outset.
"If you talk about the population registry, you need to go to the West Bank. If you talk about issuing passports, you need to go to the West Bank,” she said. "So you might as well bring in the Palestinian Authority early on, rather than in the middle of the process or at the end.”
Her remarks come as senior Palestinian officials stress that Gaza, the West Bank and East Jerusalem constitute a single political and geographic unit and reject alternative governance arrangements that bypass the established Palestinian leadership.
Last week, Bassem al-Salhi, a member of the Executive Committee of the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO), said that there is "no political communication” between the PLO and the National Committee for the Administration of Gaza (NCAG).
"The PLO, as the sole legitimate representative of the Palestinian people, sees that its political and legal jurisdiction over the West Bank and Gaza has not changed, even under Trump’s Gaza plan or the establishment of the ‘Board of Peace’”, he told Anadolu.
"Gaza, the West Bank and Jerusalem form one political and geographic unit that cannot be divided,” he added.
The NCAG is a nonpolitical body tasked with overseeing daily civil services in the enclave.
It comprises 11 Palestinian figures and is led by Ali Shaath. The committee began operating from the Egyptian capital, Cairo, in mid-January but has yet to start work inside Gaza, where about 2.4 million Palestinians face severe humanitarian conditions.
The committee is one of four bodies proposed to manage a transitional phase in Gaza, alongside a Board of Peace, a Gaza Executive Council and an International Stabilization Force, under a plan put forward by US President Donald Trump.
It was part of Trump’s plan to end Israel’s two-year war on Gaza, which has killed more than 72,000 people, mostly women and children, injured over 171,000 others, and destroyed about 90% of Gaza’s civilian infrastructure.

I’ve found the best portable power stations for home and outdoor adventures
From camping trips to home blackouts, these are my tried-and-tested picks
- Bookmark
Portable power stations have become hugely popular with outdoor enthusiasts, campers, remote workers, and those living off-grid. They also offer reassurance to homeowners who regularly experience power outages or blackouts. But which one should you buy? As a tech expert with more than 15 years of experience, I’ve tried, tested and chosen my top picks.
While power stations can be expensive, they’re useful in so many different scenarios. Imagine being able to use the hedge trimmer to the home projector outside without long extension leads, or to work and charge all your gear in your car off-site. You can also enjoy safer, cleaner and quieter camping trips without the noise and fumes from a heavier generator.
Better yet, you can pair a portable power station with solar panels for cleaner and cheaper off-grid living. And in the event of a power cut in your home, you can keep the household going by charging phones, boiling kettles, keeping the lights on and ensuring frozen food stays frozen.
However, choosing the right model requires some consideration of your power needs and balancing that against cost and weight. To get a head start in your search, keep reading for the portable power stations that passed my tests.
The best portable power stations for 2026 are:
- Best overall – EcoFlow delta 3 plus: £599, Amazon.co.uk
- Best budget buy – EcoFlow river 3 plus: £219, Amazon.co.uk
- Best for camper vans – Jackery explorer 2000 V2: £899, Amazon.co.uk
- Best for off-grid living – DJI power 2000: £959, Amazon.co.uk

How I tested
For this review, I tested each model by plugging in a range of everyday devices, including smartphone chargers and laptops, to see how they performed and how long they lasted on a full charge. I also ran high-power appliances such as hairdryers and tower fans to stress-test the units, paying close attention to fan noise and any signs of overheating. You can find my full testing criteria at the end of this article.

1EcoFlow delta 3 plus
- Best portable power station overall
- Capacity 1024Wh
- Outputs Four x 1800W AC, two x 140W USB-C, two x 36W USB-A, one x 126W 12V
- Recharge time 56 minutes
- Dimensions 15.6x7.8x11.1in
- Weight 12.5kg
- Why we love it
- Ideal capacity for most people
- Good selection of ports
- Take note
- Socket arrangement can lead to messy wiring
The delta 3 plus is a top-notch performer, being reasonably portable and offering plenty of power and versatility. It also features lots of ports, including fast-charging USB-C ports, and will charge completely in under an hour. Plus, its 10ms uninterruptible power supply (UPS) feature helps ensure a constant and reliable power supply when you need it, whether for computers, fridges or security systems.
I plugged in my laptop, monitor, phone charger and hair dryer simultaneously, and it maintained its composure without overheating, though the wiring isn’t super neat as the sockets are arranged perpendicularly to fit its tall frame better. I could get around 18 to 20 hours with my laptop and monitor plugged in, which is what I’d expect for a station like this. The fan only kicks in beyond heavy loads of around 1,500W, and I found it fairly quiet and non-intrusive.
There’s very little difference between this and the Solix C1000 as far as performance and stats go, and while the latter has slightly better portability and design, the delta 3 plus beats it for its expandable batteries and quieter fan. It’s still not enough for proper home backups, but for pretty much everything else, this is a solid power station at a reasonable price.
2EcoFlow river 3 plus
- Best budget portable power station
- Capacity 286Wh
- Outputs Three x 300W AC, Two x 12W USB-A, One x 100W USB-C
- Recharge time One hour
- Dimensions 9.21in x 9.13in x 5.75in
- Weight 4.7kg
- Why we love it
- Super compact
- Decent light
- Take note
- Not for high usage appliances
- Socket placement not ideal
If you need power quickly at your fingertips, the dinky river 3 plus is for you. It impressively packs in three AC sockets, three USB ports, and even a light to use should you find yourself by the roadside in the dark. Its battery is expandable if you need to bulk out the capacity without buying another power station.
It displayed around two and a half hours of runtime with my laptop and phone on fast charge (when not in the trickle charge mode). So while it’s not suited for long trips away from an electrical outlet or for high-wattage appliances, it’s good for less demanding jobs such as powering a cooler for a garden party or a TV for a few hours. And like most power stations, there’s a digital display showing your output, battery level and remaining runtime.
I’m also really impressed with its portability and compact form. You can easily carry it around, courtesy of its large handle, and it can even slip into a backpack without much fuss. It’s handy for keeping in the car or shed when you need power outdoors in a pinch. The low price adds to its charms, too. I’d advise getting the plus model, as the standard version only carries one AC output.
3Jackery explorer 2000 V2
- Best portable power station for camper vans
- Capacity 2042Wh
- Outputs One x 2200W AC, one x 100W USB-C, one x 30W USB-C, one x 18W USB-A, one x 126W 12V
- Recharge time 102 minutes
- Dimensions 13.2in x 10.4 x 11.5in
- Weight 17.5kg
- Why we love it
- Lots of power for its size
- Great value
- Take note
- Limited mains sockets
- Small light
I recommend the Jackery explorer for camping enthusiasts in vans or estates with limited space to work with, as I’m astounded that a 2,000Wh power station is the size of a small cooler box. And, with a lightweight rubberised handle, most people will be able to shift it around a short distance unassisted.
The longest runtime was around 26 hours when fast-charging a laptop and phone, which is fairly impressive. And when I plugged in a hairdryer at maximum power and heat, that swiftly went down to one hour (assuming continuous use), which is par for the course, considering the load.
The fan tends to turn on even with lighter loads, but it’s nearly silent, so it’s fine to work around. Its display is a little small and simplistic, but it provides a clear picture of your use, runtime and charge status. My only gripe is that there are only two mains outlets, when rivals offer three or even four.
Still, the explorer 2000 V2 is great to bring camping, in trucks and when you need to power energy-sapping appliances such as kettles and stoves, particularly where space is at a premium.
4DJI power 2000
- Best portable power station for off-grid living
- Capacity 2,048Wh
- Outputs Four x mains AC, two x 140W USB-C, two x 65W USB-C, two x 24W USB-A, two x SDC
- Recharge time 45 minutes from zero to 80 per cent, 75 minutes for a full recharge
- Dimensions 17.64in x 8.86in x 12.76in
- Weight 22kg
- Why we love it
- Plenty of ports
- Fast-charge for drones
- Quiet fan
- Take note
- Strange charger port placement
It makes total sense for a company heavily focused on drones and action cameras to get involved in the portable power station game, so here comes DJI with the power 2000.
This 2,048Wh station comes with a massive number of ports, including four mains, four USB-Cs, four USB-As and two of DJI’s proprietary SDC ports for fast charging drones. It displayed 15 hours of runtime while fast-charging a laptop and phone, and with trickle charge the runtime extended to around 33 hours, though the number did sporadically fluctuate. I then plugged in a hairdryer on max power and heat, and it had just over an hour of runtime.
It’s got lots of power to run almost any appliance, and you can combine it with a DJI solar panel for living independently off the grid, provided you get enough sunshine. Plus, its generous ports ensure everyone’s power-hungry devices get charged.
It’s also excellent for videographers and photographers who want to charge multiple devices such as laptops, drones, cameras and phones simultaneously while on the go. However, the placement of the main charging port at the front of the unit is a questionable choice. It kind of spoils the neatness of the machine, and restricts the reach and practicality of the station.
5Anker solix C1000 gen 2
- Best portable power station for remote work
- Capacity 1,024Wh
- Outputs Four x 2,000W, two x140W USB-C, one x15W USB-C, one x12W USB-A, one x120W 12v
- Recharge time 49 minutes
- Dimensions 15.1in x 8.2in x 9.6in
- Weight 11.3kg
- Why we love it
- Rapid charging
- Lots of outputs
- Take note
- No battery expansion
Well designed and both modern and robust in look and feel, the second-gen C1000 boasts the 2025 Guinness World Record for the fastest recharging portable power station, able to fully charge its 1,024Wh battery in just 49 minutes.
I tested it with my laptop and mobile, which it could comfortably keep powered for more than 16 hours. When they both reached more than 90 per cent capacity and reverted to a slow charge, that time further extended to more than 20 hours. I also tested the fan by running my laptop, second monitor, mobile charger, tower fan and hairdryer simultaneously – this vastly cut down its battery longevity to about 30 to 40 minutes – and while it wasn’t too loud, it’s definitely audible.
It’s fairly weighty to carry, and it lacks the capacity to keep multiple household appliances running for long periods during a power outage, so it’s best to look elsewhere if you need that high-capacity backup. But this is a great little unit for weekend work or overnight remote use, with plenty of plug outlets and USB ports to charge your camera, phone and laptop with no hassle.
6Anker solix F3000
- Best Portable power station for home backup
- Capacity 3,072Wh
- Outputs Four x 2,400W, two x 100W USB-C, two x 12W USB-A, one x120W 12v, one x Anderson DC output
- Recharge time 120 minutes
- Dimensions 25.6in x 11.8in x 14.8in
- Weight 41.5kg
- Why we love it
- Wheeled design is great
- Huge capacity
- Take note
- Pricey
- Not many USB-C ports
This absolute beast of a power station can keep a home running in the event of a blackout. I could run my standing fridge-freezer for more than four days – so no more melted peas. It could fast-charge my phone and laptop for 23 hours, extending to more than 42 hours once it hit trickle charge mode, and with a fully cranked hairdryer added into the mix, you get one and a half hours of runtime. Still, with only two USB-C ports, if the power goes down, you might have a fight on your hands deciding who gets to charge their phones.
The F3000 is also super heavy, so I’ve never been more thankful for Anker incorporating a retractable long handle and a pair of wheels into the design, making shifting it about far more doable. However, clearing high thresholds and stairs is often a two-person job.
The inflated price tag of £3,000 makes it a tough sell, but with a discount, it becomes more tempting, particularly for off-grid users, campervan owners or those who need high-capacity and reliable power backup at home. However, note that its 20ms UPS switch time (how long it takes for the battery to take over once the mains fails) is on the slow side, meaning you may need to look elsewhere if you have critical appliances.
7Bluetti elite 200 V2
- Best portable power station budget home backup
- Capacity 2,073Wh
- Outputs Two x 2,600W AC, two x 100W USB-C, two x 15W USB-A, two x126W 12V
- Recharge time 66 minutes for up to 80 per cent, two hours 24 minutes for a full charge
- Dimensions 13.78in x 9.84in x 12.74in
- Weight 24.2kg
- Why we love it
- Quick charging
- Quiet operation
- Compact for a 2000Wh station
- Take note
- Could do with more mains sockets
- Uncomfortable to carry
The elite 200 V2 is as compact as the Jackery explorer 2000, another 2,000Wh station mentioned above. In my test, I got 22 and a half hours of runtime while fast-charging a laptop and mobile, and one hour of concurrent use with a hairdryer. Once fast-charging was complete (and without the hairdryer), that extended to more than 37 hours in trickle charge mode.
I also plugged my fridge into the elite 200, which yielded very efficient results, with barely any power draw when idle and a reported runtime of at least 75 hours (as there’s no days option on the display readout).
However, its 24kg weight and the angle of its handles make it uncomfortable and awkward to carry. Some wheels and a retractable handle would have made this a great choice for mobile use, as moving it from a car or camper can be hard work. Still, it’s a solid home backup option, but I’d have liked to see one or two more mains sockets added to the existing two alongside the four USB ports.
Your questions on portable power stations answered
What is the best portable power station?
While I prefer the modern stylings of the Anker solix C1000, the EcoFlow delta 3 plus pips it. Stats and performance-wise, there’s very little separating them, though the latter features expandable batteries, a quieter fan and a slightly cheaper price tag. Still, both have great portability, affordability and versatility and should do fine for most users.
What kind of power station do I need?
It really comes down to what you need it for. If you need it for the odd night or weekend away, consider a 500Wh station for easy portability. If you’re on the road a lot and have lots of devices hungry for power, plump for a 1,000Wh device for more power and versatility. And if you love to live off-grid or need solid, reliable home power back-up, a 2,000Wh or even 3,000Wh station is your best bet.
How the best portable power stations were tested in full
I tested these devices according to the following criteria:
- Capacity: Easily the most important aspect, a station’s capacity determines how much power they store, directly translating to how long it can run your electrical devices. It’s measured in Watt-hours (Wh). I examined how much power the power stations store, how well they retain that capacity over time and how long they can keep going when using certain devices.
- Portability: Many stations have handles, but the bigger varieties are often bulky and cumbersome to carry. During testing, I looked at their size, weight and how easy they were to carry, and balanced that against how much power they offer. When choosing from my top picks, it’s also worth considering where you’ll be storing it, as they take up lots of room.
- UPS: If you have critical appliances, such as medical devices or servers, you’ll want a power station with a low switch time, which is how long it takes for the battery to “take over” once the mains fails. Ideally, you’d want a switch time of less than 10ms for crucial gear. This was something I paid attention to when testing.
- Outputs: If you have lots of devices, you’re going to need several AC plugs and USB ports. And the more devices that need charging, the bigger your power draw, so you’ll need a higher capacity model. In my tests, I explored whether the power stations had enough ports for their intended use and whether they were capable of fast charging.
- Charging speed: I looked at how fast they could get to 100 per cent under typical inside conditions. If you’re living off grid, solar panels are your friend here, but make sure they’re compatible with your station – some manufacturers sell adaptors if you’re going to be mixing brands. Otherwise, you’ll be looking at charging off a mains or 12V vehicle socket.

'EU energy infrastructure is as vulnerable as European defence,' industry warns
Unknown

Industry bosses warn Europe's energy infrastructure is as vulnerable as the continent's security after a series of attacks and sabotage to networks.
Europe’s energy security should be treated with the same urgency as defence, industry bosses said Friday on the sidelines of the Munich Security Conference.
The call for action follows Russia's barrage of attacks on Ukraine's energy infrastructure, which have exposed the European Union's own weaknesses.
“We live in a new reality of increasing threats. This requires a fundamental shift in our mindset,” the electricity industry’s Eurelectric president Markus Rauramo said.
“Preparing for, responding to and recovering from both physical and hybrid attacks must be a key element of power companies’ strategies going forward.”
Europe's energy infrastructure must be reinforced and its repair capabilities strengthened, they added, noting that cyber resilience should be embedded by design.
Europe has been facing a rising number of hybrid threats, including sabotage, cyberattacks, and disinformation, with experts suggesting Russia is testing Europe's resilience.
In 2024, at least 11 attacks damaged critical infrastructure. Since 2022, 23 cyberattacks have targeted Europe’s energy sector, according to the industry.
Early this year, approximately 45,000 households in Berlin were left without electricity after high-voltage power lines were damaged in a fire.
Regardless of who is behind, Eurelectric said these incidents are increasing in scale and frequency, putting pressure on power utilities to maintain a reliable supply.
Clean power, inverters and cybersecurity
As the bloc moves toward clean power production, inverter devices have become essential as they convert direct current electricity from sources like solar panels, batteries and wind systems into alternating current electricity that can be used as power.
Without inverters, it's not possible to integrate clean power into the grid, making these devices a key pillar of Europe’s energy security and power system stability.
However, China's dominance in inverter production is a source of concern for Europe.
EU lawmakers urged the European Commission last November to restrict Chinese solar inverter manufacturers’ access to the bloc’s energy infrastructure, due to cybersecurity concerns.
Through companies such as Huawei, Sungrow and Growatt, China controls the majority of inverter installations in Europe — roughly 70–80% of the market — while European producers compete for the rest, according to data from PV wholesale platform sun store.
Energy and security 'hand in hand'
The urgency to protect energy infrastructure is palpable.
For the first time, last December, NATO officials have joined EU energy ministers at the last Council to discuss the link between energy and security amid current geopolitical tensions and Russia’s war against Ukraine.
Discussions centered on protecting critical energy infrastructure, in response to attacks on underwater cables and pipelines. The goal is to foster cooperation between defense and energy policies, increasingly linked by common threats.
Attending the meeting, NATO's deputy secretary general Radmila Šekerinskavsaid maintaining contact with energy ministers is "crucial" to ensure the integrity of critical infrastructure, which the alliance says it will protect.
"We're worried seeing the Russian industry more entangled with China as well as its ties with Iran and North Korea. It's time to shift to a more war mindset," Šekerinska said, according to an EU diplomatic source familiar with the discussions.

Ukrainian Drone Operators Defeated NATO Combat Group During Joint Exercises

During the Hedgehog 2025 exercises in May 2025, Ukrainian drone operators defeated a combined combat group of several thousand NATO troops, including British and Estonian soldiers, who were attempting to carry out a mechanized attack.
This was reported by The Wall Street Journal.
The Hedgehog 2025 exercises brought together more than 16,000 troops from 12 NATO countries, who trained alongside Ukrainian drone operators, including military personnel temporarily seconded from the front lines. They simulated a ‘contested and congested’ battlefield with various types of drones.
“The goal was to create friction, stress for the units, and cognitive overload as quickly as possible,” said Lieutenant Colonel Arbo Probal, head of the Estonian Defense Forces’ Unmanned Systems Forces program.
In one of the training scenarios, a combat group of several thousand soldiers, including troops from the British brigade and the Estonian division, attempted to launch a mechanized attack. However, according to sources, they did not take into account that the drones had made the battlefield much more “transparent.”
“The NATO combat group simply moved without any camouflage, setting up tents and armored vehicles. All of this was destroyed,” recalls one of the participants in the exercises.
During the exercises, the Ukrainian military used Delta, a modern Ukrainian battlefield management system. It collects intelligence in real time, uses artificial intelligence to analyze large amounts of information, identifies targets, and coordinates strikes between command and units. This ensures a fast ‘chain of destruction.’
According to the publication’s sources, one of the Ukrainian units, consisting of about 10 soldiers, attacked NATO forces. In about half a day, drone operators conditionally destroyed 17 armored vehicles and delivered 30 strikes on other targets.
Overall, the results for NATO forces were ‘terrible,’ said Aivar Hanniotti, coordinator of unmanned aerial systems for the Estonian Defense League, who led a unit of about 100 ‘simulated enemy’ troops, including Estonian and Ukrainian military personnel. Overall, the ‘opponent’ forces “were able to destroy two battalions in a day,” so that “within the scope of the exercise, they effectively lost their combat capability.” Meanwhile, NATO units “didn’t even get to our drone operators.”
According to Sten Reiman, former commander of the Estonian Military Intelligence Centre, who helped bring Ukrainian drone experts to Hedgehog, it was Estonia that forced its NATO partners to confront these weaknesses.
The Hedgehog exercises also demonstrated how Ukraine can contribute to pan-European security. According to him, the results of these exercises came as a ‘shock’ to military leaders and personnel.
As a reminder, at the end of January 2026, it became known that during NATO’s annual winter exercises — Joint Viking — in northern Norway in 2025, American troops ‘encountered difficulties.’ The organizers of the exercises were forced to ask Finnish reservists, who were playing the role of the enemy, to go easier on the Americans.
“The Finns had to tell them to stop beating up the Americans because it was humiliating and demoralizing,” the source said.

Peter Murrell: Nicola Sturgeon’s estranged husband accused of embezzling £459,000 from SNP over 12 years
Peter Murrell is accused of embezzling the funds between August 2010 and January 2023
- Bookmark
Former Scottish National Party (SNP) chief executive Peter Murrell is accused of embezzling £459,000 from the party over more than 12 years, according to reports.
Mr Murrell, who is Nicola Sturgeon’s estranged husband, is alleged to have used the money to buy items including a motorhome and luxury goods, and to partially fund the purchase of two cars.
He is accused of embezzling the funds between August 2010 and January 2023, according to an indictment seen by the BBC and first reported in The Sun.
The 61-year-old, who became the party chief executive in 1999, is expected to appear at the High Court in Glasgow for a preliminary hearing on 20 February. He was first arrested in April 2023 as part of the police investigation into the SNP’s finances, and was charged in April 2024.
Mr Murrell, who was responsible for the day-to-day running of the SNP, entered no plea when he appeared at Edinburgh Sheriff Court in March 2025 on a charge of embezzlement.
The indictment is said to include allegations that Mr Murrell used party funds to buy a £124,550 motorhome for his own personal use.
It is also alleged that he used £57,500 of SNP money in the purchase of an £81,000 Jaguar I-Pace in 2019, and £16,489 towards a £33,000 Volkswagen Golf bought in early 2016, according to the reports.
Until he stood down in 2023 during the leadership race to succeed Ms Sturgeon, Mr Murrell had been chief executive of the SNP for more than 20 years.
In January last year, Ms Sturgeon announced that she and Mr Murrell had “decided to end” their marriage. The former SNP leader said at the time: “With a heavy heart I am confirming that Peter and I have decided to end our marriage. To all intents and purposes we have been separated for some time now and feel it is time to bring others up to speed with where we are.”
The Crown Office warned against commentary and speculation on the case, saying: “Commentary, analysis or conclusions about evidence, witnesses or the accused risks prejudicing proceedings and may amount to contempt of court.”
Police Scotland launched an investigation into the SNP’s finances in July 2021 after receiving complaints about how donations were used.

US pressure on Hungary, Slovakia goes against ‘Anchorage spirit’ — Russian senator

MOSCOW, February 13. /TASS/. US Secretary of State Marco Rubio’s statement about his plans to discuss with Hungarian and Slovak authorities the abandonment of Russian energy supplies runs counter to the de-escalation efforts initiated at the meeting between Russian President Vladimir Putin and US President Donald Trump in Anchorage, Deputy Head of the Russian Federation Council Committee for Defense and Security Konstantin Basyuk told TASS.
"Statements about intentions to persuade Hungary and Slovakia to abandon Russian energy supplies run counter to the de-escalation trend set in Anchorage. If on one hand there is a declared readiness for dialogue, and on the other hand steps are taken to exert further economic pressure, this inevitably casts doubt on the real willingness of the US to reach agreements," Basyuk said.
According to the senator, the energy sector is a matter of sovereign choice for states and their economic security. "Attempts to politicize it and force decisions on allies do not contribute to stabilizing the situation or to restoring trust in international relations," Basyuk added.

Low expectations as Ukraine, Russia confirm new round of talks with U.S.

As Ukraine and Russia confirm new round of peace talks with U.S., Zelenskyy says its up to Trump
Kyiv — The governments of Russia and Ukraine confirmed Friday that they would participate in a third round of U.S.-mediated peace talks next week, on Feb. 17 and 18 in Geneva. There have already been two rounds of talks under this trilateral format so far this year, held in Abu Dhabi, but next week's session will be the first on European soil, and it will come just days before Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine enters its fifth year.
Neither side has voiced any optimism that the negotiations will yield a comprehensive ceasefire agreement, but there has been some progress on other issues. Most notably, both sides agreed to a temporary pause in attacks on energy infrastructure in late January, and then after the last round of talks, they carried out the first prisoner exchange in five months.
The mere fact that the negotiations continued, with relative continuity in the teams sitting around the table, had also suggested room for progress.
But there has been plenty to fuel doubt in Kyiv since the discussions began.
President Trump said the pause in strikes on each other's energy infrastructure would last a week. But it ended after just four days, with Russia hitting Ukraine with a fresh barrage of 450 drones and more than 60 missiles.
The Free Press: Meet the Ukrainian Refugees Being Forced Out of the U.S.
Asked by journalists in Kyiv this week whether future talks could at least yield a more enduring truce, even if it was still limited to strikes on power infrastructure, President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said: "We have not received any response from the Russians. If anything, one could say the opposite — we received responses in the form of drones and missile attacks. This indicates that, for now, they are not ready for the energy ceasefire."
The composition of the negotiating teams, which some analysts have looked to as an indicator of potential progress on more technical issues, has also changed.
During both of the meetings in Abu Dhabi, Ukraine's team included Kyrylo Budanov, the former head of military intelligence who now serves as Zelenskyy's chief of staff, while the Russian delegation was led by Igor Kostyukov, the head of the GRU military intelligence service.
"When military guys meet military guys, they can make progress, they speak the same language," Yuriy Sak, an adviser to Ukraine's Ministry of Strategic Industries, told CBS News last week. "The concrete measures and steps within security guarantees — the military guys on both sides are well placed to discuss."
Next week in Geneva, however, presidential aide Vladimir Medinsky will replace Kostyukov as the head of the Russian delegation, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Friday.
Medinsky led the Russian team for a round of talks with Ukrainian officials in March 2022, in Belarus and Istanbul, that went nowhere as his team made sweeping claims to occupied Ukrainian territory and demanded that Kyiv effectively give up its sovereign military power. He is known for writing ultra-nationalistic school textbooks questioning Ukraine's right to exist, and for his close relationship with President Vladimir Putin.
Zelenskyy has said the Trump administration wants both sides to agree to a deal to end the war by June. But in Kyiv, officials question whether Washington is prepared to exert the kind of pressure on Moscow that would make such a timeline feasible.
"As for whether I believe the war can be brought to an end," Zelenskyy told journalists this week, "it does not depend only on Ukraine. It also depends on the United States, which must put pressure — forgive me for saying 'must,' but there is no other way to put it — must put pressure on Russia."

- An avalanche in the French Alps on Feb 13 killed three off-piste skiers, including two Britons, in Val d'Isere.
- The incident followed a rare "red alert" on Feb 12 due to Storm Nils dumping heavy snow, creating very unstable conditions.
- This brings the French Alps' avalanche death toll to at least 25 this winter, with most fatalities occurring since January.

PARIS – An avalanche killed three off-piste skiers, including two Britons, in the French Alps on Feb 13, prosecutors said a day after several ski resorts shut down due to the risk of snowslides.
The avalanche in Val d’Isere swept away six skiers, killing one French national and the two Britons, prosecutor Benoit Bachelet said.
A third British citizen suffered minor injuries, he added.
Emergency services responded quickly but could not prevent the deaths, a resort official said, noting that all of the victims had avalanche transceivers.
There have now been at least 25 avalanche deaths in France this winter season, with the majority occurring since January.
The deaths followed a rare, day-long red alert across the south-eastern Savoie region on Feb 12 – a danger level issued only twice before since the system was introduced 25 years ago.
The warning prompted several resorts to close all or part of their pistes.
On Feb 13, the red alert was lifted in Savoie but the risk level remained high across the Alps, with “very unstable snow cover” especially above 1,800m to 2,000m altitude, according to the Meteo France weather service.
Storm Nils, which passed through France on Feb 12, dumped 60cm to 100cm of snow, according to the weather service. AFP

Trump, Musk and now UK billionaire Jim Ratcliffe – they are the enablers, making racists feel great again | Jonathan Freedland

It lacks the elegance of “greed is good”, but as a distillation of the spirit of the age, it’s right up there. “I feel liberated,” a top banker told the Financial Times shortly after Donald Trump’s victory in the 2024 US presidential election. “We can say ‘retard’ and ‘pussy’ without the fear of getting cancelled … it’s a new dawn.”
So that’s what they meant by “vibe shift”. Though, as the Epstein files reveal daily, the top 0.01% were hardly primly biting their tongues before Trump’s win, at least not in private. Those with telephone-number fortunes and great power felt able to speak, and write, to each other about women in language so vicious, so filled with hate – women discussed as body parts, as “less than human”, in Gordon Brown’s apt phrase – that they didn’t need the encouragement of a “grab ’em by the pussy” president to cast off their inhibitions.
Still, as that unnamed banker made clear to the FT, women are not the only group the powerful and privileged have been itching to disparage. This week it was migrants who were the target, accused by the billionaire Monaco resident Sir Jim Ratcliffe of having “colonised” Britain.
He may have got his stats wrong – he was in quite a muddle about the size of the UK population – but he did usefully debunk one stubbornly persistent assumption. For a while, it was taken as read that anti-immigrant sentiment was a function of economic anxiety: indeed, that was the instant explanation offered for Trump’s victory in 2016. But Ratcliffe, whose fortune is estimated at £17bn, won’t be feeling too much angst in the economic department. That is truer still of Elon Musk, who is simultaneously the backer of anti-immigration parties across Europe and the world’s richest man.
Indeed, the data shows no correlation at all between hostility to immigration and income. In January, Ipsos found that it was the most affluent fifth of voters in Britain who, more than any other group, named immigration as their most pressing concern.
The increasingly uninhibited musings of the super-rich are, alas, just one factor in a shift that is becoming ever more apparent. While of course we must say that Sir Jim’s comments did not specify the racial origins of immigrants, that’s inevitably how they were heard. We are, in the words of Sunder Katwala, who as the director of the British Future thinktank observes these trends more keenly than most, “going backwards on racism”.
The evidence is all around you. It’s there in the 116,000 hate crimes recorded by police in England and Wales, but excluding London, for the year to March 2025 – up on the previous year, and a fifth of it involving violence.
It’s there in the “ugly”, 1970s-style racism directed at NHS staff, incidents of verbal and physical abuse based on skin colour so frequent that the health secretary, Wes Streeting, warned last November that it was becoming “socially acceptable to be racist”.
It’s there in a changed public discourse, where the bounds of acceptability have shifted to include notions that most thought had been left behind two generations ago. Suddenly there’s a debate, drawing in mainstream commentators, over whether Rishi Sunak is English. A former cabinet minister, Robert Jenrick, can lament not seeing “another white face” in a Birmingham neighbourhood. A former prime minister, Liz Truss, appears as a guest on an online show where she chats with Connor Tomlinson, who believes, among other things, that British citizens from ethnic minorities should not be allowed to become members of parliament. The Sun’s Harry Cole hosts that same far-right figure on his online show.
It’s there on social media, where it has become routine to hurl the P-word at politicians from the Tories’ Priti Patel to Labour’s Shabana Mahmood, from onetime Corbynite Zarah Sultana to Reform’s Zia Yusuf. And it’s there in the daily, lived experience of Britain’s minorities, measurable in both data and anecdote. Figures released this week, for example, showed yet another rise in antisemitic incidents, including a spike straight after October’s deadly attack on a synagogue in Heaton Park, Manchester, which left two dead on Yom Kippur, the holiest day of the Jewish calendar – more than half of that spike made up of incidents directly referring to, or celebrating, the killings at Heaton Park. Last autumn, Katwala wrote: “I personally get so much more racist abuse most weeks in 2025 than I ever did in 2005.”
Of course, there will be multiple and varied explanations for all this, but there are a few common threads. When it comes to the discourse, the shaping effect of online influencers is unmistakable. The likes of Tomlinson would once have been handing out badly stencilled leaflets in pub backrooms. Now he can reach millions, with TV production values previously the exclusive preserve of the major broadcasters. But the medium affects the message.
Put simply, the loudmouths of the far right are competing in an attention economy. Saying something shocking wins attention, but to keep it they have to say something more shocking still. There is a ratchet effect, which ensures the conversation becomes ever more extreme. Note the latest effusion from the white supremacist US influencer Nick Fuentes. Holocaust denial worked for him for a while, but his audience demands more. This week, he provided it by directing his fire at women, whom he castigated for encouraging sympathy for the poor and minorities. “The number one political enemy in America is women,” he told his audience on the Rumble platform. And so, “Every woman and girl is sent to the gulags. We will determine who the good ones are after the fact.” But first, to the gulags. “They go to the breeding gulags.”
These figures should be far beyond the fringe, but they keep getting amplified. Tucker Carlson hosted Fuentes on his show; Musk regularly promotes some of Britain’s most extreme voices, including Advance UK, a political party that now includes Tommy Robinson and that vows to ban indefinite leave to remain, ban the foreign-born from becoming British citizens and encourage all settled migrants to leave. Musk seems to think Advance is the real deal, preferable to the “weak sauce” of Nigel Farage. All the while, his X platform barely stirs as users racially abuse others, in the foulest language.
Throw in the brain-boiling effect of the pandemic period, when a small, extremely online minority became radicalised by conspiracy theories of every flavour, with anti-vax talk as the gateway drug, and you have some of the causes of this retrograde shift.
It’s important to hold on to the fact that most people do not think this way, that attitudes of tolerance are now deeply embedded in Britain: the data shows that too. Still, that led too many to become complacent, to assume that this was a problem of our past, one that we’d solved. But racism and prejudice are not like that. The battles against them have to be fought, and re-fought, in every generation. They are light sleepers – and some loud, powerful voices are determined to shake them awake.

Ukraine struck $100 million Russian Nebo-U radar system in occupied Crimea, General Staff claims
Ukraine struck a Russian 55Zh6U "Nebo-U" long-range radar station, estimated to cost around $100 million, near Yevpatoriia in occupied Crimea, the General Staff of Ukraine’s Armed Forces reported on Feb. 13.
The Nebo-U is a strategic early-warning radar designed to detect aerodynamic and ballistic targets at long distances and forms part of Russia’s layered air defense architecture. Similar systems have previously been targeted by Ukrainian forces in an effort to weaken Russia’s surveillance and air defense capabilities.
The General Staff said the strike took place on Feb. 12 as part of "systematic measures to reduce the offensive potential of the Russian aggressor."
"Each of the targeted facilities ensures the energy, aviation, or communications stability of enemy groupings in the temporarily occupied territories. Systematic strikes on such infrastructure disrupt command and logistics, reducing the Russian army’s ability to sustain combat operations," the military said.
In addition to the radar strike in Crimea, Ukrainian forces reported hitting multiple targets in occupied territories overnight on Feb. 13.
In Zaporizhzhia Oblast, areas of Russian troop concentration were struck near Solodkovodne and Liubymivka. Positions of Russian drone operators were also reportedly targeted near Tokmak and Mykhailivka.
In Donetsk Oblast, Ukrainian forces struck a logistics warehouse near Selydove and a concentration of military equipment near Komyshuvakha, according to the General Staff.
The military said the extent of the damage and Russian losses is being clarified. The claims could not be independently verified.
Kyiv has stepped up strikes on Russian military assets on Russian and occupied territories.
Earlier today, Ukraine’s Unmanned Systems Forces also reported strikes on a Russian airfield in occupied Crimea, an electrical substation in Luhansk, and an ammunition depot in Zaporizhzhia Oblast.
Ukrainian long-range drones struck the Ukhta oil refinery in Russia’s Komi Republic on Feb. 12, approximately 1,750 kilometers (1,087 miles) from Ukraine’s border – a new record for a Ukrainian strike inside Russian territory, according to a source in the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU).

Ukrainian slider's Olympics over as helmet appeal dismissed
- Published
Ukrainian skeleton racer Vladyslav Heraskevych will not compete at the Winter Olympics after the Court of Arbitration for Sport (Cas) dismissed his appeal to wear a helmet depicting images of athletes killed during Russia's invasion of his home country.
Heraskevych asked Cas to reinstate his place at the Olympics after he was banned by the International Olympic Committee (IOC) before the first heat of the men's skeleton on Thursday.
Having worn the helmet, which the IOC say breaks rules in the Olympic charter, during training sessions this week, IOC president Kirsty Coventry visited him at Cortina's sliding track in a final attempt to convince him not to wear it in competition.
But the 26-year-old refused to back down, believing the helmet to be within the rules and an emergency ad-hoc Cas meeting took place on Friday.
Cas said while they are "fully sympathetic" to Heraskevych's case and his right to "freedom of expression", it is not permitted "on the field of play".
The IOC said Heraskevych could show his helmet in mixed zones, news conferences and on social media, but that "the field of play is sacrosanct".
Initially, the IOC had withdrawn his accreditation but eventually returned it and Cas agreed it was "unfair" to rescind it "under these circumstances".

Heraskevych's appeal to Cas asked for his ban to be overturned, to be able to wear the helmet and to complete the two skeleton runs he missed out on on Thursday under the supervision of Cas.
He said his disqualification was "disproportionate" and claimed other athletes had been able to express their grief during competition at the Games.
For example, American figure skater Maxim Naumov held up a photograph of his parents, who were killed last year in a plane crash in Washington DC, as he waited for his score to come in earlier this week.
But the IOC say Heraskevych has contravened the 'athlete expression' guidelines, external, which were drawn up in 2023 and are part of Olympic law, which state "focus at the Olympic Games must remain on athletes' performances".
The law states: "It is a fundamental principle that sport at the Olympic Games is neutral and must be separate from political, religious and any other type of interference."
On Thursday, IOC spokesperson Mark Adams said that if the committee allowed athletes to wear kit commemorating those killed in war, it would open the Games up to exploitation.
But Heraskevych has accused the Milan-Cortina Games of acting as "Russian propaganda" while Ukraine president Volodymyr Zelensky, said, external the IOC are "playing into the hands of the Russian aggressor".
Heraskevych, who was his nation's flag bearer in the opening ceremony, has received support from his compatriots at the Games with Alpine skier Dmytro Shepiuk displayed a note reading "Ukrainian heroes with us" after competing while the Ukrainian mixed relay luge team took the knee and held their helmets aloft in a display of solidarity.

Trump administration ends temporary protected status for Yemen
Sign up now: Get ST's newsletters delivered to your inbox
Feb 13 - U.S. President Donald Trump's administration has ended temporary protected status for Yemen, Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem said on Friday, the latest move targeting immigrants.
The decision to end humanitarian protections that grant deportation relief and work permits to more than a thousand Yemeni nationals was taken after determining that it was against the U.S. "national interest", Noem said.
TPS provides relief to people already in the U.S. if their home countries experience a natural disaster, armed conflict or other extraordinary event. The Trump administration has sought to end most enrollment in the program, saying it runs counter to U.S. interests.
"After reviewing conditions in the country and consulting with appropriate U.S. government agencies, I determined that Yemen no longer meets the law's requirements to be designated for Temporary Protected Status," she said.
Around 1,380 Yemeni nationals were covered by the temporary protected status as of March 31, 2025, according to the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services. The status was last extended in 2024 and was set to expire on March 3 this year. REUTERS

Island visit, NYC flat and 'Belarusian girls': Ex-Israel PM Ehud Barak addresses Jeffrey Epstein ties
Unknown

01:40:46 KST

Former Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak addressed his relationship with convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein on Thursday, after a trove of official documents revealed the scope of their ties, including repeated and extended stays by Barak and his wife at an apartment owned by the disgraced financier in New York in the years following Epstein's initial conviction.
In an interview with Channel 12 News, Barak, who served as Israel's prime minister from 1999 to 2001 and as defense minister from 2007 to 2013, said he "regrets" not "having exercised better judgment," while reiterating that he never encountered anything improper and was unaware of the nature of Epstein's offenses until his second and final arrest in 2019.
However, Barak acknowledged that he had known since 2008 that Epstein was on trial and had spent over a year in prison. Despite Epstein's conviction for soliciting underage sex, Barak said, "I saw the American elite treating him as someone who had committed an offense, been punished, paid his debt to society and returned to operate within that very society."
"Only in 2019," Barak said, "did the depth of this man's truly abhorrent crimes become clear. That was when I cut off contact with him."
"I am responsible for my actions and regret ever having met him. But regret is not enough, so I sincerely apologize to my friends, supporters and citizens who feel deep discomfort," he added.
According to hundreds of messages reviewed by Haaretz, Barak's visits to the apartment in Manhattan took place between 2015 and 2019. Emails between Barak's wife, Nili Priel, and Epstein's personal assistant show that the financier's staff referred to the apartment as "Ehud's apartment."
Barak said in the interview that "from time to time, when we visited the U.S., we stayed in an apartment belonging to Epstein. I never hid the fact that I met him dozens of times. The apartment was in an old residential building with 100 or 120 units, at least a dozen of which were Epstein's. He would make them available to people he chose to host from time to time."
He added: "I am a private citizen; I was not holding office. … A private citizen can stay in a house or apartment offered by someone with whom he has social or business ties. … It was not a financial matter. It was about convenience… There is nothing else to it."
He later said, "I should have exercised better judgment, and I regret that I did not."
Barak also addressed a visit he made to Epstein's island, Little Saint James, a small private island in the U.S. Virgin Islands that has been alleged to have served as a base of operations for underage sex trafficking.
Barak said: "There was one visit to the island, during the daytime, for three hours, accompanied by my wife and three security guards. On the island, there was only Epstein and a number of local employees who worked in gardening and maintenance."
Barak also responded to recordings that were published of conversations between him and Epstein, as well as with former U.S. Secretary of the Treasury Larry Summers.
In one such conversation in 2014, that lasted three and a half hours, Barak discussed Jewish immigration to Israel, saying that "we can control the quality much more effectively, much more than the founding fathers of Israel did," adding, "They took whatever came. They had to save people. Now, we can be more selective."
The recording also captured Barak saying: "We need, dramatically, the million Russians. I see that many prefer to be Belarusian, or maybe young, handsome girls will come."
The former prime minister said in the interview that "it was certainly an unfortunate choice of words and metaphor, with associations of inappropriate stereotypes," but added, "I suggest that anyone watching us now look in the mirror and ask themselves whether they speak that way in private conversations. This was not a speech delivered in an official capacity."
He further claimed that "the way it was described in our media is distorted, based on excerpts taken out of context from a conversation," adding, "It is a fragment taken from a conversation… concerning the long-term demographic challenge facing Israel."

CAS dismisses Ukrainian skeleton racer Heraskevych's appeal against IOC
The Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) has dismissed an appeal by Ukrainian skeleton racer Vladyslav Heraskevych against the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and the International Bobsleigh and Skeleton Federation (IBSF).
Source: Ukrainian public broadcaster Suspilne Sport
Details: The decision was announced at 17:15 local time.
CAS Director General Matthieu Reeb said that freedom of expression is allowed at the Olympics, but not at the competition venue, and that the judge had heard the arguments of both sides and made a decision in accordance with the IOC guidelines.
CAS has published the arguments put forward by Judge Annett Rombach from Germany, who took the decision to dismiss Heraskevych's appeal.
Key points:
- The IBSF disqualified Heraskevych due to his intention to "wear in competition a helmet displaying portraits of Ukrainian athletes who lost their lives in the war". As confirmation of this intention, Heraskevych is cited as saying on 10 February that he would compete wearing his helmet.
- The helmet was deemed by the IBSF and IOC to be "inconsistent with the Olympic Charter and Guidelines on Athlete Expression".
- The CAS Arbitrator considered the limitations proposed by the IOC for Heraskevych – highlighting the issue in the mixed zone, at press conferences and on social media, and wearing the helmet during training runs – to be "reasonable and proportionate".
Heraskevych's lawyer, Yevhen Pronin, provided more details on the ruling, stating that "the case was far broader than an individual dispute".
Quote from Pronin: "The court sided with the IOC and confirmed the decision that an athlete may be removed from the Olympic Games without committing an actual violation, without posing a technical or safety threat, and even before competing. This case was far broader than an individual dispute. It concerned athlete freedom of expression, the limits of discretion of sports bodies, and the very understanding of Olympic values."
Background:
- Heraskevych was disqualified from the 2026 Olympics after wearing his "remembrance helmet", which features portraits of 20 Ukrainian athletes killed due to Russian aggression, at several official training runs. He was not allowed to compete in his first race.
- The Ukrainian athlete appealed the suspension. On 12 February, the day before the verdict was announced, he met with IOC President Kirsty Coventry, but they were unable to reach an agreement. The IOC later restored his accreditation, but Heraskevych was still not allowed to participate in the competition.

Apple secures trademark rights in Russia until 2036
US tech giant extends legal protections for iconic logo and brands despite halting official sales in the country
ISTANBUL
US tech firm Apple has extended its rights to at least eight trademarks in Russia through 2036, according to records from the Russian Federal Service for Intellectual Property (Rospatent) released on Friday.
The document showed that the California-based corporation successfully renewed the validity of its iconic "bitten apple" logo alongside several established brand names, including iWeb, Time Machine, and Mac Pro.
Under the renewed registrations, Apple maintains the legal framework to sell a range of products and services in Russia, including mobile phones, computers, headphones, software, and games, as well as the provision of communication services.
Apple continues to navigate a complex legal landscape in Russia, where it suspended all official product sales and exports in early 2022 due to the war in Ukraine.
Despite the absence of official retail operations, Apple devices remain available in the country through parallel import mechanisms authorized by the Russian government.
In January, the company also registered a new trademark in Russia for the first time in over a year, following an application process that is said to have begun in late 2023.

Energy workers restore power to critical infrastructure facilities in Odesa region, with 130,000 customers remaining without electricity
According to Ukrinform, Ukraine's Prime Minister Yulia Svyrydenko stated this on Telegram, following a daily energy coordination meeting.
"The situation remains difficult after last night’s shelling in the Odesa and Mykolaiv regions following the nighttime attack, as well as in Kyiv and the Dnipropetrovsk region after yesterday's strikes," Svyrydenko wrote.
In particular, more than 60 crews are working in Kyiv to restore electricity supply, and repair work is also ongoing to restore heating.
"In the Odesa region, energy workers are working to restore power to more than 130,000 customers who were left without electricity. Critical infrastructure facilities have already been reconnected," she noted.
She also drew attention to the return of freezing weather next week. According to Svyrydenko, repair crews are doing everything possible to speed up repairs at all energy facilities.
"I have instructed the relevant ministries and heads of regional military administrations to prepare all necessary resources for a rapid response to possible new attacks amid severe cold. If necessary, additional invincibility centers and high-capacity generators will be deployed," she added.
As reported, Russian forces have been attacking energy infrastructure in the Odesa region for the second consecutive day. A facility in Odesa targeted in the attack on the night of February 13 sustained significant damage.

AI video of Russian attack on Brussels and Davos shown at Munich Conference – video
The Ukraine House, operating within the framework of the Munich Security Conference, is welcoming visitors with an exhibition featuring a real Shahed drone and a generated video of its possible use.
Source: European Pravda correspondent
Details: The exhibition is located at the entrance to the Ukraine House, one of the venues of the Munich Conference, where part of its official events are held, arranged so that all visitors must pass by a downed Russian drone. Behind the unmanned aerial vehicle, from which the warhead has been removed, a two-minute AI-generated video is shown on a large screen on a loop.
The video, created using artificial intelligence, begins with the large-scale launch of Shahed drones somewhere in Russia.
It then shows combat drones flying over the streets of Munich and Vienna (including shots of St. Stephen's Cathedral, Allianz Arena and the Bayerischer Hof, where the Munich Conference is held).
The AI video then depicts drones striking targets in Davos and Brussels. In the Belgian capital, one of the targets hit multiple times is the building of the European Parliament.

The diet experts suggest could help people with diabetes
Vegan diets can cut daily insulin use by almost 30 per cent for people with type 1 diabetes

Switching to a low-fat vegan diet can cut daily insulin use by nearly 30 per cent for people with type 1 diabetes, a new study has found.
Insulin is a hormone that moves glucose, a type of sugar, from the bloodstream into muscle and liver cells, where it is used for energy. People with type 1 diabetes must inject insulin because their bodies do not produce enough of it.
Researchers compared the effect of a low-fat vegan diet and a portion-controlled diet on type 1 diabetics. They found the vegan diet reduced their total needed daily insulin dose by 28 per cent or 12.1 units per day, whereas the control group experienced no meaningful change.
A reduced insulin requirement likely means the body has improved insulin sensitivity, which refers to how effectively the body responds to insulin, according to the Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine, which published the study in the journal BMC Nutrition.
Dr Hana Kahleova, the lead author of the study, said: "People with type 1 diabetes should consider a low-fat vegan diet, which can help improve their insulin sensitivity and reduce the amount of insulin they need.”
The new analysis was a follow-up to a 2024 study also conducted by the Physicians Committee, which found additional benefits to having a vegan diet.
Participants lost an average of 5kg and showed improvements in insulin sensitivity and glycemic control. Cholesterol levels and kidney function also improved among those following the plant-based plan.
Previous studies have also shown that plant-based diets had a 32 per cent lower incidence of type 2 diabetes and 18 per cent lower greenhouse gas emissions linked to their diets.
Professor Louise Goff, from the Leicester Diabetes Centre, told The Independent: “The reduction in insulin dose seen in the vegan group is certainly noteworthy — but it’s crucial to understand why that likely occurred.
“Over the 12 weeks, participants following the vegan diet lost weight. Even in people with type 1 diabetes, weight loss improves insulin sensitivity. When the body becomes more insulin sensitive, less exogenous insulin is required to achieve the same glucose control.
“So, the reduced insulin dose is very likely a reflection of improved insulin sensitivity secondary to weight loss, rather than a direct effect of eliminating animal products per se.”
Ms Goff also noted a significant increase in fibre intake in the vegan group, which is strongly associated with weight loss and improved insulin sensitivity — both of which would naturally reduce insulin requirements.
“This doesn’t diminish the potential benefits of plant-based eating, but it suggests that the mechanism is metabolic (weight loss and improved insulin sensitivity), not specific to veganism itself,” she added.
“It would be interesting to see whether similar results occur with other high-fibre, calorie-controlled dietary patterns.”
Professor Stefanie Baldeweg, former clinical lead of the department of diabetes at University College London, said: “Nutrition can be a powerful adjunct in diabetes management. But it is one tool among many – and should be approached thoughtfully.
“The findings are promising but preliminary. Patients should not alter insulin regimens without medical supervision, and clinicians should view this as an area for continued research.”

Pentagon adds Chinese firms to military list, then withdraws filing
Move weeks before Trump-Xi summit highlights mixed signals from Washington and injects fresh uncertainty into fragile US-China truce
Giants like Alibaba Group Holding, Baidu and BYD are among the firms added to the list. Alibaba is the parent company of the South China Morning Post.
The updated designation also names firms spanning the biotech, AI, drone and semiconductor sectors, including WuXi AppTec and RoboSense Technology. Chinese memory chip manufacturers Yangtze Memory Technologies and ChangXin Memory Technologies were removed from the list.
The document was removed from the Federal Register on Friday morning upon agency request for withdrawal. According to a letter acquired by the SCMP, the US Defence Department’s Privacy, Civil Liberties and Transparency Directorate requested the removal of its notice on Friday without explaining the reason. The Pentagon told the SCMP in an email that it had nothing to announce at this time.
Friday’s move underscores the inconsistency and mixed messaging emanating from the Trump administration, as some in Washington policy circles suggested that arms of the administration had not coordinated on the announcement.
Washington’s Section 1260H list identifies companies the US government believes are “Chinese military companies” or contributors to China’s military-civil fusion efforts.

Indian man pleads guilty in New York over plot to kill Sikh separatist who’s US resident

NEW YORK – An Indian man charged over orchestrating an unsuccessful Indian government-backed plot to kill a Sikh separatist in New York City pleaded guilty on Feb 13 to three criminal charges, a spokesperson for the US Attorney’s Office in Manhattan said.
Nikhil Gupta, 54, pleaded guilty to murder-for-hire, conspiracy to commit murder-for-hire and conspiracy to commit money laundering, which carry a maximum combined sentence of 40 years in prison, the spokesperson said.
Gupta entered his plea before US Magistrate Judge Sarah Netburn in Manhattan federal court.
Lawyers for Gupta were not immediately available for comment.
Gupta has been jailed in Brooklyn since his June 2024 extradition to the United States from the Czech Republic, where he had been arrested a year earlier. He had pleaded not guilty immediately after his extradition.
US prosecutors accused Gupta of plotting with an Indian government official to kill Mr Gurpatwant Singh Pannun, a US resident and dual US-Canadian citizen who advocated for a sovereign Sikh state in northern India.
India’s government has dissociated itself from any plot against Mr Pannun, saying it was against government policy.
The discovery of alleged assassination plots against Sikh separatists in the United States and Canada has tested relations with India, which has also denied involvement in such plots. REUTERS

Trump's repeal of climate rule opens a 'new front' for litigation
The Trump administration's repeal of an Obama-era scientific finding that greenhouse gases pose a public health threat could open up a new pathway for filing lawsuits against power-plant operators and other companies.
Legal experts said the policy reversal could lead to a surge in lawsuits known as "public nuisance" actions, a pathway that had been blocked following a 2011 Supreme Court ruling that regulation of greenhouse gas emissions should be left in the hands of the Environmental Protection Agency instead of the courts.
Now that the EPA has abandoned that regulatory effort, the legal shield created by the 2011 decision will likely unravel, legal experts said.
"This may be another classic case where overreach by the Trump administration comes back to bite it," said Robert Percival, a University of Maryland environmental law professor.
The Environmental Protection Agency on Thursday repealed a 2009 scientific determination known as the endangerment finding, which has been the foundation for federal climate regulations.
The endangerment finding is what led the EPA to take action under the Clean Air Act of 1963 to curb emissions of carbon dioxide, methane, and four other heat-trapping air pollutants from vehicles, power plants and other industries.
EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin has called the rescission of the endangerment finding "the largest act of deregulation in the history of the United States." Power companies have generally favoured President Donald Trump's deregulatory agenda, but have expressed concern about the repeal of the endangerment finding, triggering a wave of lawsuits.
The Edison Electric Institute, which represents publicly traded electric utilities, said in September that rescinding the endangerment finding comes with the "potential for increased litigation alleging common-law claims, regardless of the merits of those suits."
'New front' opening
US courts have long recognised a legal theory known as "public nuisance," which prohibits activities that unreasonably interfere with the health and safety of a community.
Public nuisance lawsuits are typically brought by state and local governments and seek to make the party responsible for the nuisance pay to abate, or fix, the condition.
The cases are hard to win, in part because of difficulties in proving direct causation between a specific defendant's emissions and particular climate harms. But legal experts have said they are one potential tool for environmental activists to hold greenhouse gas emitters liable for climate harms.
In a 2004 lawsuit, California and five other states alleged that big power companies had created a public nuisance by contributing to climate change. The defendants included American Electric Power and Xcel Energy.
The case eventually ended up before the US Supreme Court, which ruled against the six states in a unanimous 2011 decision.
Writing for the court, Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg said regulating greenhouse gases should be left to the EPA under the Clean Air Act. That law and subsequent EPA actions like the endangerment finding, Ginsburg wrote, "displace the claims the plaintiffs seek to pursue."
That 2011 decision allowed power companies to escape public nuisance lawsuits filed in federal courts, though some cases brought in state courts have survived.
The policy reversal could give public nuisance cases a new lease on life, legal experts said.
"This has the potential to change the stakes of the game," said University of Pennsylvania law professor Sarah Light. "If the Clean Air Act no longer applies to greenhouse gas emissions, then there's no comprehensive statutory scheme in which Congress intended to displace nuisance claims, so they would likely be able to proceed in court."
Jenner & Block environmental lawyer Meghan Greenfield agreed that a "new front" for lawsuits may be opening up.
"This is an area where things had been settled for the past 15 years, and, especially as the EPA steps out of this space for regulation, you can imagine others wanting to push those fronts ever harder," Greenfield said.

MOSCOW, February 13. /TASS/. A storage building housing art pieces at the Kiev-Pechersk Historical-Cultural Preserve has been flooded due to a burst pipe, Ukraine’s Liga-net media outlet reported, citing the Culture Ministry.
According to the news outlet, a water heating pipe burst in the building’s attic, flooding the first and second floors, where exhibits in the Negatives, Drawings and Paintings categories are stored. A total of about 4,000 pieces were at risk.
The water largely affected the outer surface of cabinets and caused plaster to crumble in some places, while support structures weren’t damaged. After the accident, the humidity level reached 90% on the second floor and 69% on the first floor, while the temperature stood at about 4.5 degrees Celsius (40 degrees Fahrenheit).
Efforts are now underway to deal with the aftermath of the burst pipe. Workers have started to dry the premises, temporarily removing the sodden exhibits to safer areas, while art restorers and custodians are examining all items one by one to figure out the level of damage and make a plan to restore and conserve the works.

MOSCOW, February 13. /TASS/. Russia’s pipeline gas supplies to Turkey slightly increased in 2025 compared with the previous year to 21.2 bln cubic meters (bcm), according to TASS’ calculations based on figures provided by Turkey’s Energy Market Regulatory Authority (EPDK).
In December, Turkey imported a total of 2.3 bcm from Russia via the Turkish Stream and Blue Stream, according to the agency.
In 2025, Russian gas shipments to Turkey reached 21.16 bln cubic meters (+0.4%). Including liquefied natural gas (LNG) shipments (none were made in 2025), overall Russian gas supplies to Turkey fell by 2% last year.
Russia supplies gas to Turkey via two pipelines through the Black Sea. Blue Stream was commissioned in early 2003. The design capacity of the pipeline spanning 1,213 kilometers is 16 bln cubic meters per year. The export gas pipeline TurkStream consists of two lines, one of which is designed for delivering gas to Turkish consumers, while the second one supplies gas to southern and southeastern European countries. The total capacity of TurkStream commissioned in January 2020 amounts to 31.5 bcm, with its operation starting in January 2020.
Turkey's gas consumption in 2025 set an all-time record, according to TASS calculations based on data from the Turkish EPIAS exchange. Last year’s domestic gas demand in Turkey approached 64 bln cubic meters (+13% compared to 2024).

UN accuses paramilitary RSF of committing war crimes in Sudan’s el-Fasher
UN rights chief urges probe as new report details mass killings, sexual violence and targeted attacks against civilians.
The Sudanese paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) carried out war crimes and a possible crime against humanity in its takeover of Sudan’s western city of el-Fasher last year, the United Nations human rights office has said.
In a report (PDF) released on Friday, the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights said “there are reasonable grounds to believe” the RSF and allied armed groups committed acts amounting to war crimes.

Those acts include murder, intentional attacks against civilians, sexual violence such as rape, torture, and the use of starvation as a weapon of war, the report found.
“If committed as part of a widespread or systematic attack directed against any civilian population, these acts may also amount to a crime against humanity,” it said.
The RSF seized control of el-Fasher, the capital of North Darfur state, on October 26, 2025, after the withdrawal of the Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF), which have been fighting the paramilitary group for control of Sudan since April 2023.
The takeover came after an 18-month siege that cut el-Fasher off from food, medicine and other critical supplies and prompted warnings of mass starvation.
Tens of thousands of residents fled the city after the RSF took control, according to UN figures, with many describing widespread violence on their journeys out of el-Fasher. Human rights advocates and other experts also warned that mass killings had taken place.
‘Like a horror movie’
Friday’s report, which the UN said was based on interviews with more than 140 victims and witnesses, described the mass killing of hundreds of people at an El Fasher University dormitory called Al-Rashid.
According to survivors of the attack, RSF fighters besieged the building, which had been sheltering about 1,000 civilians, and opened fire with “heavy weapons”, the report found. About 500 people were killed, and many others were wounded.
“One witness described how bodies were thrown into the air by the force of the assault, ‘like a scene out of a horror movie’,” the UN rights office said.
The report also documented several instances of summary executions, with survivors and witnesses describing how the RSF killed civilians accused of collaborating with the Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF) and allied groups.
In one case, on October 26, a witness reported seeing RSF fighters round up about 300 young men in el-Fasher’s Daraja Oula neighbourhood before dividing them into groups of 30.
“The RSF fighters then opened fire on each group until there was no longer any movement, lobbed grenades at some groups, and deployed a gas burner against others, systematically executing all of those that had been detained,” the report said.
The RSF and its supporters initially tried to downplay the atrocities committed in el-Fasher, accusing allied armed groups of being responsible. The group’s leader, Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo, also known as Hemedti, has also promised an investigation.
UN calls for probe
Volker Turk, the UN human rights chief, on Friday called for “credible and impartial investigations” into what happened in el-Fasher.
“These must lead to meaningful accountability for perpetrators of exceptionally serious crimes, through all available means,” said Turk, including in Sudanese courts, third states, or at the International Criminal Court or other mechanisms.
Turk also called on all parties to the conflict in Sudan to end human rights violations and on third countries “with influence” to take action to prevent further atrocities.
“This includes respecting the arms embargo already in place, and ending the supply, sale or transfer of arms or military material to the parties,” he said.
Deadly violence has continued in several regions of Sudan, with a Sudanese doctors’ group saying this week that at least two children were killed in an RSF drone attack on a mosque in North Kordofan state.
Sudan has accused the United Arab Emirates of providing military and financial support to the RSF, an allegation that Abu Dhabi has vehemently denied.

Russia Stops Publishing Officials’ Salary Data

Russia’s state statistics agency Rosstat has stopped publishing data on the salaries and headcount of federal and municipal officials, the independent research platform To Be Precise reported, in the latest move to limit the public’s access to information about the public sector.
Rosstat has also removed data on the share of women among municipal employees, an indicator previously used to track progress toward the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals.
Salary information for the social sector and academia has also been made unavailable, the project said, with pay data for medical personnel, teachers, university lecturers, orphanage staff, cultural workers and scientists vanishing.
Statistics for the third quarter of 2024 were due at the end of November, but the platform instead carried a notice of a temporary suspension of publication.
Rosstat has not disclosed salary data for civilian employees of government agencies, which were previously published annually, since 2022.
According to the latest available figures, these officials’ average monthly income stood at 79,800 rubles ($1,040), rising to 197,000 rubles ($2,570) in federal bodies.
By comparison, the nationwide average monthly salary in 2022 was 65,300 rubles ($850), while the median wage was 40,300 rubles ($526).
Sberbank CEO German Gref said Wednesday that Russian civil servants live in “impoverished conditions” and called for them to be paid more, arguing this would reduce the number of “corrupt fools” in government.
At the same time, Gref acknowledged that “It’s human nature to always be figuring out how to get rich.”
The exiled news outlet Faridaily reported that 246 million rubles ($3.2 million) had been allocated in the 2025 federal budget to cover the salaries of Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin and his 10 deputies. On average, each received a post-tax income of around 1.3 million rubles ($17,000) per month.
President Vladimir Putin allowed himself, lawmakers and other officials to stop filing public income declarations in December, scrapping rules in place since 1995.
Declarations are now required only upon entering public service, appointment to a new post, transfer to another government body or for inclusion in higher-level federal management bodies.
Officials must also report income when conducting transactions exceeding their family’s combined earnings over three years.
Transparency International has ranked Russia 157th out of 182 countries for public-sector corruption.

US expects Europe to spend more on defense, world order — envoy to UN

MUNICH, February 13. /TASS/. The Washington administration expects its European allies to increase spending on defense and maintaining the current world order, US permanent representative to the UN Mike Waltz said at the Munich Security Conference.
The diplomat assured that Washington would actively seek to preserve the existing world order but questioned the willingness of its European allies to do so. "Are the Europeans willing and able to take tough financial steps necessary?" he pointed out.
Waltz argued that Washington has shouldered the main financial burden of maintaining "the rules-based order since World War II." "However, with 37 trillion [dollars] in debt and counting the massive debt load that the Western world is facing, I think it is fair on their behalf to ask 450 million Europeans with the same size economy as the United States, to be more self-sustaining in their own defense," he added.
"We’re asking the rest of the world to be there with us in a fair way financially, because there is a cost of the status quo, and the status quo is not sustainable anymore," the diplomat emphasized.

Issued on: Modified:
Europe's regions are in danger of being squeezed as the EU considers sweeping changes to the way its 27 member states spend their money, warns the European official tasked with reducing inequalities among the bloc's hundreds of towns and regions.
Kata Tütto, a Hungarian socialist, and president of the European Committee of the Regions, tells Talking Europe's Douglas Herbert that the EU's next long-term budget, which runs from 2028 to 2034, risks quietly shrinking the money that underpins local investment under the EU's region-focused Cohesion Policy.
At the centre of the controversy is a proposed "mega-fund" worth roughly €865 billion, which would pool money for farmers and poorer regions in a single pot.
That may sound vast. But spread across seven years and 260 regions, the reality is far less impressive, Tütto says. Under the current proposals, funding for regions would fall to roughly half of today's level. It's a shift that could hollow out the EU's cohesion policy, the main tool designed to reduce economic gaps between Europe's cities and regions.
The timing, Tüttő argues, could hardly be worse. Every region – rich or poor – is undergoing a demographic, climate and technological transition. In a world of constant crisis and mounting threats, she warns, governments are tempted to sacrifice long-term investment for short-term fixes, centralising decisions and draining attention and money away from the local level.
While Tüttő accepts that defence and security now dominate the political agenda, she challenges the definition of what security means. It is not only about tanks, borders or drones, she says, but also about safe drinking water, affordable housing, clean energy and resilient infrastructure – the everyday needs that allow societies to function when shocks hit.
Tütto's message to Brussels is blunt: Europe cannot project strength abroad if it allows inequality and instability to grow at home.
Undermining Cohesion Policy, she warns, would weaken the very base that allows the European Union to act together economically, politically and strategically.

Are your Valentine’s chocolates costing more this year? Blame Trump and a weak supply chain
Chocolate makers such as Mondelez and Hershey hedge cocoa months in advance, so they still pay above market rates, limiting how much savings reach shoppers
- Bookmark
- CommentsGo to comments
Skyrocketing Valentine’s Day chocolate prices are turning gift-giving into a bittersweet affair for lovers across the U.S., even though global cocoa prices have dropped sharply from record highs.
A recent study by online loan marketplace Lending Treefound that boxed chocolate assortments have risen 11.8 percent on average since last February, with some products nearly doubling in price.
There are a couple of factors experts say are responsible - the Supply claim and policy coming from the White House.
Not many commodities have dropped as sharply this year as cocoa, the main ingredient in chocolate. After hitting record highs that really hurt West African exporters, prices have been falling for months. A few years of tight supply had pushed cocoa costs to eye-popping levels, peaking at $10,000 per metric ton in May, far above the $2,500-$3,000 range seen for most of the 2010s, Axios reports.
While supply has begun to loosen, pushing prices downward, nearly 30 percent over the past month alone, much of the chocolate available to consumers today was manufactured with cocoa purchased at these record-high rates.
Large chocolate makers hedge their cocoa purchases months in advance to protect against market swings. As a result, companies such as Mondelez, maker of Cadbury and Toblerone and Hershey are still paying above current spot-market rates. This lag between commodity prices and retail costs limits how much manufacturers can pass on savings to shoppers.
Consumers may see relief in the future seasons rather than this Vanetine’s Day, Mondelez CEO Dirk Van de Put suggested to investors this week, Axios reports.
“There’s not a lot we can do anymore, but 2027 certainly will benefit from this,” Van de Put said.
Hershey CEO Kirk Tanner said last week that last year’s price increases didn’t fully cover “cocoa price inflation in 2026,” according to the outlet. He added that if cocoa prices continue to fall, the company may not need to raise prices further in the future.
Trade policy has also played a significant role in the price of Valentine’s Day chocolate. Some chocolate manufacturers say inventory purchased under Trump‑era tariffs added to their cost burdens.
The administration lifted tariffs on cocoa beans, paste and butter in mid-November, giving companies such as Ghirardelli and Hershey some year-end relief. However, imported brands such as Cadbury, Valrhona, Nestlé, and Lindt still carry an additional 15 percent cost, according to the Progressive Policy Institute, a centrist think tank in Washington, D.C.
Despite these higher costs, consumers are largely absorbing them, and Valentine’s Day spending is expected to rise by $1.4 billion, showing that demand for chocolate remains strong even amid tariffs, weather-driven shortages and modest declines in confectionery employment.

Fire in Budapest suburb kills at least 3 and injures 22
Hungarian authorities say a fire has killed at least three people and injured 22 others near Budapest
- Bookmark
At least three people died and nearly two dozen others were injured after a building used as temporary lodgings for workers caught fire early Friday in a suburb of Hungary's capital, authorities said.
Firefighters extinguished the fire in Budakeszi, about five miles (eight kilometers) west of Budapest, after it engulfed the two-story building in the early morning hours, according to Hungary's National Directorate General for Disaster Management.
More than 40 paramedics and 18 emergency vehicles were dispatched to the scene. Firefighters pulled several survivors and three gas cylinders from the building. The bodies of two men and a woman were found beneath the collapsed roof of the building, a spokesperson for the disaster management authority said.
In a news conference Friday, a spokesperson for the Pest County Police Headquarters said an explosion in one of the rooms likely caused the fire. He added that several irregularities were discovered in the building, including gas usage that was out of compliance with regulations.
A criminal investigation has been launched in the case, police said.
Paramedics treated 22 people for injuries sustained during the fire, including four whose injuries were life-threatening. The injured were transported to eight hospitals in Budapest for further treatment.

How Emerald Fennell Changes the Villain of ‘Wuthering Heights’
Unknown
Unknown Publisher

01:25:34 KST

Warning: This post contains spoilers for "Wuthering Heights."
If you go into Emerald Fennell's "Wuthering Heights" expecting a faithful page-to-screen adaptation of Emily Brontë's classic 1847 gothic romance novel, you may come away from the film, now in theaters, feeling a mix of confusion, shock, and, depending on your sensibilities, maybe even a little disgust.
Fennell's maximalist bodice-ripper instead embodies the story the Promising Young Woman and Saltburn filmmaker felt she experienced when she first read Wuthering Heights at age 14. Starring Margot Robbie and Jacob Elordi as Catherine Earnshaw and Heathcliff, the star-crossed lovers/tormenters at the center of Brontë's timeless tale of all-consuming yearning turned monstrously vengeful obsession, Fennell's "Wuthering Heights" (quotation marks intentional) is a conspicuously loose interpretation of its source material.
"I wanted to make something that made me feel like I felt when I first read it, which means that it's an emotional response to something. It's, like, primal, sexual," Fennell told the BBC. "I know that if somebody else made it, I'd be furious. It's very personal material for everyone. It's very illicit. The way we relate to the characters is very private, I think."
Knowing this was Fennell's approach may make it easier to digest the significant liberties she took with the book, including casting age-inappropriate—and in Heathcliff's case, arguably race-inappropriate—leads, eliminating Brontë's use of unreliable narrators to relay the events of the story, and cutting the entire second half of the novel in order to bypass the suffering inflicted on the next generation of characters. These choices allow Fennell to indulge in a raunchy, BDSM-infused version of the narrative that centers on the tumultuous love-hate relationship between Cathy and Heathcliff. They also raise questions surrounding Fennell's framing of the true villain of the windswept English drama.
In Brontë's Wuthering Heights, Heathcliff is the overt antagonist of the story. Described in the novel as black-haired, black-eyed, and dark-skinned—characterizations that, while racially ambiguous, are widely interpreted by scholars as intended to convey otherness—Heathcliff is introduced as an orphan of unknown origins who is adopted into the Earnshaw family by Catherine's father and raised alongside her. Following Mr. Earnshaw's death, Heathcliff is forced to endure extreme physical and psychological abuse at the hands of Cathy's alcoholic, gambling degenerate of an older brother, Hindley (a role that is subsumed by Martin Clunes' Mr. Earnshaw in Fennell's film).
Heathcliff flees Wuthering Heights as a teenager, in the wake of overhearing Catherine's apparent rejection of him and announcement that she has accepted a proposal from the wealthy, fair-haired, and fair-skinned heir to the neighboring estate of Thrushcross Grange, Edgar Linton (played in the movie by English, Scottish, and Pakistani actor Shazad Latif). Heathcliff then returns, years later and bearing a mysterious windfall of newfound wealth, with the express goal of inflicting as much cruelty and pain as possible on the remaining members of the Earnshaw and Linton families. He behaves abominably, manipulating Edgar's naive sister Isabella into a loveless and severely abusive marriage, and later mercilessly tormenting Hindley's son, Hareton; his own son with Isabella, Linton; and Cathy and Edgar's daughter, also named Catherine, up until nearly the moment of his death.
Of course, this is only the full truth of the matter if you take the word of Catherine's handmaid and confidante, Nelly, at face value. As a longtime servant of the Earnshaw and Linton families—and Wuthering Heights' primary narrator—Nelly offers a firsthand but highly biased accounting of the events of the novel. While she presents herself as the story's voice of reason and morality, she frequently interjects her own opinions, prejudices, and emotions, leaving the reliability of her retelling up to reader interpretation. And these interpretations certainly vary. While some see Nelly as an empathetic and motherly caretaker, others view her as a manipulative, calculating instigator who shapes the narrative to justify her own actions. Fennell, for her part, seems to side with the latter sentiment.
Played by Vietnamese American actor Hong Chau, the Nelly of Fennell's film is reframed as the illegitimate daughter of a lord, and she is directly involved in the misunderstandings that drive the movie's central tragedies. First, in a moment of spiteful vindictiveness, she goads Catherine into confessing that it would "degrade" her to marry Heathcliff, despite having just heard Catherine's ardent profession of love for him and knowing he has begun eavesdropping on the conversation. This leads to the fracture in Catherine and Heathcliff's relationship that dooms them all to ruin.
Later, when a pregnant Catherine falls ill and subsequently tells Nelly she has lost the baby, Nelly doesn't believe she is actually sick and treats her as though she is playing up her heartbreak for attention. Nelly burns all the letters Heathcliff attempts to send Catherine, gets out of being fired by Catherine by using her infidelity against her, and convinces Edgar he shouldn't see her for months on end, a series of decisions that ultimately result in Catherine's death from sepsis.
Fennell doesn't portray this behavior as coming out of nowhere; Nelly's actions appear to be driven by her long-held bitterness at having been cast off as Cathy's closest friend as soon as Heathcliff entered the picture. As far as grudges go, this one runs dangerously deep.
Fennell's Heathcliff, on the other hand, is stripped of the majority of his villainy. Not only is there no next-gen of children for him to torture, but rather than a battered wife, Isabella (played by Alison Oliver) is presented as a seemingly willing participant in his sadomasochism. Introduced as Edgar's gleefully unhinged ward rather than his sister, Isabella enters into what appears to be a consensual dominant-submissive marriage with Heathcliff in which she gets off on his mistreatment of her. Heathcliff's greatest crime in Fennell's version? Loving Catherine with uncontrollably reckless abandon.
As far as true evil goes, that's not much of a crime at all. Manslaughter by neglect, on the other hand? Pretty unforgivable.

10 best supermarket wines for Valentine’s Day, according to sommeliers and experts

Experts share the best supermarket champagne and sparkling wine, perfect for Valentine’s Day
From award-winning Aldi to Co-op bottles of fizz, these are the bargain bottles to try
- Bookmark
If you're about to celebrate the big day of love (aka, Valentine’s Day) with a delicious dinner and a bottle of something fizzy, rest assured it doesn’t need to be a flute of Laurent Perrier or Veuve Clicquot to be special. The best supermarket champagne and sparkling wines are more than impressive enough to add to your shopping basket, and more budget-friendly, too.
Last year, Co-op’s champagne was crowned one of the world’s best at the International Wine & Spirit Competition, while Aldi’s £15 bottle won at the World Champagne Awards 2025, and Tesco was close behind with its Clubcard-favourite premier cru. Indeed, ask any sommelier or industry insider, and they’ll tell you that supermarkets and independent houses are producing some of the most exciting and award-winning bottles on the market.
“Supermarket own labels often offer a great entry point for Champagne,” explains wine critic Rosamund Hall, “as they’re working with highly respected producers to source high quality wines for the best value available – you won't find quirky ‘grower champagne’ finesse, but you can expect well made, highly enjoyable wines that will be a perfect pour for any occasion.”
The marrying of affordability and quality is thanks to better wine-making technology and warmer climates (particularly for English sparkling wine from Dorset, Kent and Sussex), but also higher consumer demand. “Consumers are becoming more knowledgeable, more savvy; they can look anything up on the internet,” says Libby Brodie, wine consultant and columnist. This doesn't just apply to champagne – the supermarkets are brimming with fantastic prosecco, sommelier-approved wines, premium-quality whisky.

So, when faced with a giant supermarket aisle, where do you start when selecting a fizz? “I personally like to look outside of champagne when it comes to value for money, as even with supermarket own brands, I find you get much more bang for your buck,” says Lucy Hitchcock, the wine influencer behind the @Partnerinwineuk social media account. “To find those hidden gems, look out for words like traditional method, crémant, and method cap classique (MCC) on the label. All of these wines are made in the same way as champagne, often using similar grape blends.”
To narrow down your search further, Hitchcock highlights South Africa for wine-making. “The very best is Graham Beck's pinot noir rosé 2018/19, which has this richness and depth of flavours that rivals Laurent Perrier rosé.”

Also offering stellar value for money are regions just outside of Champagne, including Hitchcock’s favourite, crémant from Limoux. “This vintage from Laithwaites is made from champagne grapes but is a fraction of the price of your usual vintage champagnes. Five years ageing for £13.99 on offer is a very good deal indeed.”
Whether you’ve got a special occasion in the calendar or are stocking up for 2026, I’ve asked industry experts to choose their favourite bottles of supermarket champagne and fizz.

1Graham Beck pinot noir rosé 2018/19
- ABV 11.5%
- Grapes Pinot noir, chardonnay
- Region Western Cape, South Africa
Graham Beck is fast becoming one of the world’s best independent sparkling wine brands, and this is “South Africa’s answer to rosé champagne – all pinot noir with four years ageing,” says Hitchcock. Describing it as having “creamy bubbles, juicy strawberry and raspberry with a pink grapefruit twist, plus that champagne-style brioche note”, it sounds delicious. “If you love Laurent Perrier rosé, you’ll love this.”
2M&S Collection St Gall champagne brut
- ABV 12.5%
- Grapes Pinot noir, chardonnay
- Region Champagne, France
“This gorgeous champagne is made by one of the best cooperatives, Union Champagne, whose members are working across some of the best sites in the regions of Côte des Blancs and Montagne de Reims,” Hall explains. “A chardonnay-heavy blend alongside pinot noir, you can expect a wine that delivers an uplifting bite of fresh green apples alongside warming buttered toast and a delicate nutty note.”
3Les Pionniers vintage champagne brut 2013
- ABV 12%
- Grapes Pinot noir, chardonnay
- Region Champagne, France
Co-op’s own champagne, the Les Pionniers vintage brut 2013, was the only supermarket champagne to win an IWSC trophy this year. “It outperformed wines nearly three times the price and hugely over-delivers for the price,” says Brodie. “They've taken their time, ageing it for over a decade, resulting in these gorgeous, delicate brioche and lemon curd notes, crisp citrus and refined bubbles.”
Hall agrees: “I am consistently impressed by all of the Co-op’s Les Pinonniers range, and this vintage champagne is no exception.” The blend of pinot noir and chardonnay is made for the supermarket “by Compagnie Champenoise, aka Piper & Charles Heidsieck, and it feels effortlessly luxurious with a rich, creamy mousse which delivers abundant notes of delicate twists of lemon alongside soft baked brioche and toasted hazelnuts”.
4Tesco English sparkling wine
- ABV 12%
- Grapes Chardonnay, pinot noir, pinot meunier
- Region Kent, England
“I am all for championing English sparkling wine and Tesco’s Finest [bottle] is great value, especially as it’s created at award-winning Balfour Estate in Kent by one of the loveliest winemakers, Fergus Elias,” says Brodie. “The same grapes as champagne, it has whispers of shortbread and hazelnut alongside glorious English green apples and fun fizz.” Easily rivalling champagne at a fraction of the price, it’s well worth a try on your next weekly shop.
5Roche Lacour cuvée de réserve crémant de Limoux 2018
- ABV 12.5%
- Grapes Chardonnay, chenin blanc, pinot noir
- Regions Limoux, Languedoc‑Roussillon, France
Roche Lacour’s cuvée is “made like champagne but from Limoux, with chardonnay and pinot noir [grapes]”. With “five years on the lees, it gives it real depth – a classy alternative to champagne at a brilliant price,” says Hitchcock. “Think crisp apple, peach and citrus with a toasty richness from oak ageing”. Owing to popularity, the bottle is currently sold out – but sign up for an email notification when it's restocked.

Nigeria to hold presidential election in February 2027

Nigeria to hold presidential election in February 2027
February 13, 2026Nigeria, Africa's most populous country, will hold its presidential and parliamentary elections on Febuary 20, 2027, the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) announced on Friday.
Joash Ojo Amupitan, the INEC chairman, also said the governorship and state legislature polls are scheduled for March 6, 2027, calling the upcoming elections a "significant milestone in (Nigeria's) democratic journey."
He said the elections will cover the offices of president and vice president; governors and deputy governors (except in Anambra, Bayelsa, Edo, Ekiti, Imo, Kogi, Ondo and Osun states); and members of the Senate, the House of Representatives and state Houses of Assembly.
Although INEC has introduced technology over the past decade to improve the integrity of election outcomes, it has had little success boosting public confidence, and post-election litigation remains commonplace.
Earlier this week, the Senate, the upper house, passed an amendment authorizing the real-time electronic transmission of election results. It had initially rejected the measure in the face of popular and political pressure.
Tinubu under pressure at home and abroad
The announcement comes as Nigerian President Bola Ahmed Tinubu faces mounting international pressure, particularly from the United States, over deteriorating security and rising jihadist attacks and kidnappings.
Many Nigerians are also criticizing Tinubu's economic reforms because rampant inflation, rising costs and the plummeting value of the naira against the dollar have divided the country.
The president is seeking reelection, and his supporters argue the reforms were necessary to stimulate long-term investment.
Tinubu was first elected president in February 2023, winning the first round with about 36% of the vote against Atiku Abubakar and Peter Obi. The latter has already announced his intention to run again in the 2027 election.
Voter turnout was just 26%, eight percentage points lower than in the previous election. To win in the first round, a presidential candidate must secure at least 25% of the vote in more than two-thirds of the country's 36 states and the federal capital.

Merz: The World Order Is Breaking Down and Europe Is Not Ready

01:24:19 KST

German Chancellor Friedrich Merz used his opening address at the Munich Security Conference to deliver one of the bleakest assessments yet of the global environment, declaring that the international order that shaped the postwar era has effectively collapsed. According to Merz, the rules-based system, imperfect even at its strongest, is no longer functioning, forcing countries like Germany to rethink their assumptions about security, alliances and self-defense.
He argued that the period following the fall of the Berlin Wall, when the United States stood as the dominant global power, has clearly ended. In its place has emerged a harsher era defined by rivalry among major powers, where even the strongest states face growing insecurity. Merz warned that power politics offers the illusion of simple solutions but in reality replaces predictability with speed, coercion and instability, eroding the legal and diplomatic frameworks that once restrained conflict.
Turning to transatlantic relations, Merz spoke of what he called an uncomfortable reality: the relationship between Europe and the United States can no longer be taken for granted. He said American leadership is being challenged and may already be fading, a shift that leaves Europe more exposed. While still committed to cooperation, Merz stressed that Europe must prepare for a future in which U.S. guarantees are less reliable and greater responsibility falls on European states themselves.
He openly acknowledged a widening political and ideological gap with Washington, particularly under President Donald Trump. Merz rejected U.S. culture wars, trade protectionism and withdrawals from multilateral frameworks, reaffirming Europe’s commitment to free trade, climate agreements and global institutions such as the World Health Organization. Applause from the audience followed his remark that American culture wars are not Europe’s battles.
Russia’s war against Ukraine featured prominently in Merz’s remarks. He said Europe has assumed a leading role in supporting Kyiv, imposing heavy economic and political costs on Moscow. According to the German leader, the conflict will end only when Russia concludes that continuing the war brings no further advantage. He expressed skepticism about Moscow’s readiness for genuine negotiations, citing past attempts at unilateral outreach that yielded no results and were followed by intensified attacks on civilian infrastructure.
Merz also emphasized that Europe’s freedom is now directly at risk. Despite the European Union’s economy being vastly larger than Russia’s, he said Europe has failed to convert its economic strength into comparable military, political and technological power. The challenge, he argued, is not a lack of resources but a lack of resolve, calling on Europeans to fundamentally change their mindset and fully mobilize their potential.
In a sign of how far Berlin’s thinking has shifted, Merz confirmed discussions with French President Emmanuel Macron about the possibility of a European nuclear deterrent. The talks reflect growing anxiety over whether the U.S. nuclear umbrella would reliably protect Europe in a major crisis. While Germany remains anchored in NATO, Merz made clear that Europe must be ready to stand more firmly on its own if needed.
He also issued a warning about China, arguing that Europe’s search for greater autonomy does not mean alignment with Beijing. Merz accused China of exploiting economic dependencies, including through controls on critical raw materials, and cautioned that its military power could soon rival that of the United States.
On broader security priorities, Merz said competitiveness and security are inseparable, urging stronger protection of critical infrastructure, more resilient supply chains, reduced dependence on strategic materials and technologies, and better safeguards for democratic institutions. He reiterated his goal of building Germany’s armed forces into the strongest conventional military in Europe and called for enhanced intelligence cooperation across the continent.
During a question-and-answer session, Merz again stressed that dialogue with Russia is only meaningful if it is backed by pressure. He recalled a European leader’s solo visit to Moscow that achieved nothing, followed by intensified Russian attacks, an apparent reference to Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán. For Merz, negotiations must serve the goal of ending the war, not legitimizing aggression.
Concluding his remarks, Merz framed the current moment as a test for Europe. Freedom, he said, is no longer guaranteed by default and must now be actively defended. That will require difficult choices, rapid change and shared sacrifice. Europe, he insisted, is not powerless, but it must act decisively if it wants to shape the new global order rather than be shaped by it.

BUDAPEST, February 13. /TASS/. Russian oil supplies to Slovakia through the Druzhba oil pipeline have been suspended, Bloomberg reported, citing the Economy Ministry of the country. Earlier Hungarian media reported disruptions in crude oil transportation through the pipeline running through Ukrainian territory.
TASS has compiled the main information on the situation.
Ukraine blocked supplies of Russian oil via the Druzhba pipeline to Hungary to create difficulties for the Hungarian government ahead of parliamentary elections, Minister of Foreign Affairs and Economic Relations Peter Szijjarto said following reports in Hungarian media about the pipeline's oil flows being blocked from going through Ukrainian territory.
Russian oil supplies to Slovakia via the Druzhba pipeline have been suspended, Bloomberg reported, citing the republic's Economy Ministry.
Statements from Hungary and Slovakia
- Hungarian Minister of Foreign Affairs and Economic Relations Peter Szijjarto said that Ukraine had blocked supplies of Russian oil via the Druzhba pipeline to Hungary to create difficulties for the government ahead of parliamentary elections. He noted that the Ukrainian authorities hope to give a leg up to the Hungarian opposition party Tisza, which seeks to take over power from the ruling party Fidesz - Hungarian Civic Union.
The minister called Kiev's actions gross interference in the elections and assured that even if Ukraine does not allow oil supplies to Hungary to resume via the Druzhba pipeline, the government will guarantee the security of energy supplies for all consumers.
- Russian oil supplies to Slovakia via the Druzhba pipeline have been suspended, Bloomberg reported, citing the country's Economy Ministry. As the ministry noted, Slovakia has 90 days worth of strategic reserves of oil and petroleum products.
The Slovakian Economy Ministry of expects oil supplies via the Druzhba pipeline to resume in the coming days. According to the ministry, the situation does not pose a threat to the republic's energy security.
According to Bloomberg, oil has not been delivered to Slovakia via the Druzhba pipeline since early February. A significant reduction in supply volumes occurred already in January.
Kremlin statement
- Kremlin Spokesman Dmitry Peskov said he didn't have all the facts about the halt in oil transit through the Druzhba pipeline.
Ukraine's actions
- The Ukrainian Foreign Ministry summoned the Hungarian ambassador in Kiev to demand an explanation regarding Prime Minister Viktor Orban's recent statement that Ukraine is an enemy of Hungary because it is blocking Russian energy supplies, Szijjarto said noting that his government will not change its position.
- Ukrtransnafta, which provides oil transit through Ukrainian territory, is technically ready to resume oil transportation via the Druzhba pipeline to Hungary and Slovakia, but the company's management is not giving permission for the resumption of deliveries, several sources in the oil industry told TASS. According to the sources, the Ukrainian company completed the liquidation to the emergency situation at the Brody linear production and control station in Ukraine on February 6.
At the end of January, at the request of the Ukrainian side, oil transportation via the Mozyr-Brody main oil pipeline towards Hungary and Slovakia was suspended, but the exact reason for the shutdown is unknown.
About the pipeline
The Druzhba oil pipeline supplies oil to Belarusian refineries and transits it to Europe.
The pipeline starts in Russia’s Samara region, passes through Bryansk, and then branches into two sections: northern and southern.
Hungary and Slovakia receive oil directly via the southern branch.
Through Hungary oil goes further on to Serbia.

Robotics Centre Presents BAAZ Hybrid VTOL UAV

01:21:06 KST

At the Robotics Centre booth, a new hybrid drone called BAAZ was presented, combining the advantages of a multicopter and an airplane.
This was reported to Militarnyi by a company representative at the World Defense Show 2026 defense exhibition, which is taking place in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.
Thanks to this design, the device does not require special runways or complex launch systems.
The drone uses electric motors for vertical maneuvers and an internal combustion engine for horizontal flight. The system runs on a mixture of 87 octane gasoline and special lubricant in a 40:1 ratio.
One of the key advantages of the complex is the ability to recharge the batteries directly during flight using an on-board generator. In just 20 minutes of normal engine operation, the battery charge level is restored to 100%. Between flights, the aircraft only needs to be quickly refueled, which significantly reduces the time needed to prepare for the next mission.
The drone can stay in the air for 6 to 7 hours, depending on the configuration and operating conditions. The cruising speed is usually between 80 and 100 km/h, although the aircraft is capable of reaching higher speeds.
The maximum take-off weight of the BAAZ system is 16 kg, with 5 kg accounted for by payload and fuel. The drone has a wingspan of 2717 mm and a total length of 1842 mm.
The main purpose of the complex is to conduct reconnaissance and surveillance over long distances. To this end, it is fully integrated with an HD45 EO/IR camera with day and thermal channels, or a NextVision Raptor system with 80x zoom.
In addition to standard optics, the drone can be equipped with specialized cameras for high-precision 3D mapping of the terrain. The developers are also open to installing other types of payloads, such as radars or radio reconnaissance systems.
The default communication system is based on Persistent Systems MPU5, but the device is also compatible with other solutions, such as DTC or Silvus.
“But we are open to considering Ukrainian-made systems,” the representative said.
When disassembled, the entire device fits into a 48x20x17-inch Pelican ISP protective case.

We will only recommend gambling sites that carry a licence to trade which has been awarded by the UK Gambling Commission (UKGC). The UKGC exists to enforce the rules set by independent review bodies such as eCOGRA, so any UK casinos that are not regulated by the UKGC are considered unsafe and should be avoided.
Security
Our recommended pay by phone casinos will all use up-to-date security features to protect customer details and data. Examples of such features include SSL encryption and two-factor authentication.
Reputation
We judge casinos by reputation and our impressions after using them. We consider established brands, such as Duelz, and new pay by phone casinos that have caught our eye for the quality of their overall product.
Game Variety
The best casino sites will provide plenty of variety for their users, whether that be slot games and roulette options or table games such as online poker. These games must be provided by a range of quality operators, such as NetEnt and Playtech.
Customer Experience
What is the customer getting out of the casino? Are there enough games, such as slots, table games and live casino? Does it have a reputation as a high payout casino? There should be a variety of options and themes to satisfy all users.
Usability
How easy is the pay by mobile casino site and app to use? We only want to use sites that offer sound usability and functionality across the board, whether you’re using the desktop site, Apple or Android app, or a mobile browser.
Payment Methods
Along with Pay By Mobile, users should have access to a variety of payment options to reflect modern transactions. Bank transfers and debit cards are staples, but we want to ensure that newer methods are available, such as e-wallets and Apple Pay casinos.
Welcome Bonus
New customers should be rewarded with a quality casino sign up bonus. If we’re not satisfied with the casino bonuses on offer we won’t recommend the pay by phone bill casino site.
Promotions
Promotions should not end after the welcome bonus. Users should have options such as free spins, free play games, free bets and prize draws, among others.
Payout Rates
When recommending pay by phone casinos, we check that their games have a reasonable volatility and RTP, and chances for users to win fairly.
Responsible Gambling
We only recommend pay by mobile casino sites that promote responsible gambling and provide the requisite tools to help players manage their gambling habits.
Online casinos should take responsible gambling seriously, offering a range of support methods to aid users who require assistance. Deposit limits, loss limits and self-exclusion should all be on hand and easily accessible.
How to Deposit to a Pay By Mobile Casino
Pay by mobile makes it easy to fund your casino account without needing a debit card or e-wallet. Instead, your deposit amount is added to your mobile phone bill or deducted from your pay-as-you-go balance.
- Choose a Casino - Pick one of our recommended pay by mobile casino sites and follow the link to sign up.
- Select Pay by Mobile method - During the deposit process, choose pay by mobile (or a branded version like fonix) as your payment method.
- Enter Deposit Amount - Input how much you want to deposit — usually capped at around £10–£30 per transaction.
- Verify Your Payment - You may receive a confirmation SMS or automated call containing a verification code. Enter this to approve the transaction confirming you wish to deposit funds into a pay by phone bill casino.
- Complete Deposit - Once confirmed, the funds will appear in your casino account instantly. The charge will then show up on your next phone bill or be deducted from your prepaid credit.
How to Withdraw From a Pay By Phone Bill Casino
Unfortunately, you cannot use pay by mobile to withdraw funds from casino apps or sites.
- Fast withdrawal casino sites offer alternative banking methods, including debit card, bank transfer, PayPal, Skrill, Neteller and Payz.
- Debit card is the easiest withdrawal method, with users simply needing to enter their card details before the money arrives within 12 hours (and often as quickly as two hours).
- With a PayPal casino, customers can withdraw funds in a similar manner, though the processing time is a little longer – usually around 24 hours.
- A Payz, Neteller or Skrill casino work in a similar manner to debit card withdrawals. Your bank account and card are linked to your account, so you simply withdraw into that.
The withdrawal system works in a similar way to deposits:
- Select your withdrawal method.
- If required enter your details. Financial details are protected by the latest security software.
- Enter the withdrawal amount and confirm your withdrawal.
- Depending on your chosen withdrawal method, your funds will be returned within 24 hours to 72 hours.
Types of Pay By Mobile Deposits
Pay by mobile casinos will differ on the type of method they use to take pay by mobile deposits. These include:
Boku: Boku is one of the most recognisable brands online for accepting mobile payments. This method simply adds the payment to your mobile bill or removes i from your pre-paid credit. It’s simple, safe and secure, ensuring that no financial details are shared with the online casino.
Fonix: Fonix permits pay by mobile deposit up to £40 at a time, with a minimum £10 deposit required. It’s a common method available on most pay by phone casinos and allows you to add the deposit to your mobile phone bill to be paid at the end of the month. Fonix is reliable and straightforward, making the process seamless.
PayForIt: PayForIt is notable for its partnerships with major mobile networks in the UK. Sky, O2, Vodafone, Virgin, EE and Three are among the brands available for customers to simply deposit, with those funds added to their mobile bill at the end of the month. It has simple aesthetics and straightforward instructions to complete deposits quickly.
Pay By Mobile Slots
Slot games are the pathway for new customers to integrate their way into life with pay by mobile casino sites. Here are the most popular pay by mobile slots that new users will come across after signing up.
Rich Wilde and Book of the Dead: Rich Wilde and Book of the Dead is featured across many welcome offers for new UK casino sign ups. This pay by mobile slot was created in 2016 by Playn’ Go and offers a simplistic gameplay for new users, needing simply to match up three symbols across a 5x3 grid to win prizes, including free spins and cash. It stands for its high RTP, ranging from 96.21 per cent to 94 per cent depending on your chosen casino site. Other notable slot games in the Wilde series include Wildest Gambit and Rich Wilde and the Tome of Insanity.
Big Bass Bonanza: The Big Bass series is arguably the most notable slot games available from pay by mobile casino sites. From Pragmatic Play, Big Bass Bonanza provides new customers with a simple gameplay system where they can learn and understand the rules of basic slots before progressing further should they wish. Big Bass Bonanza is one of the many Big Bass titles available and features only behind Big Bass Splash for longevity. Users play on a 5x3 grid and can play on 10 paylines to secure prizes such as cash and free spins. Big Bass Bonanza has a high RTP of 96.71 per cent, making it a perfect slot game for new customers to get the most out of their first gameplay experience online.
Secrets of Phoenix: Created in 2017 by Roxor Gaming, Secrets of Phoenix is part of the welcome offer from Bally Casino where new users can secure 30 free spins to use on this pay by mobile slot. It follows a theme from other online slots available for new customers where it is simple, allowing users to match symbols using an Aztec-theme to unlock prizes. Unlike more complex slots, players only need to track symbols on a 5x3 grid with up to 25 paylines. It has an RTP of 94 per cent, highlighting its appeal for new customers learning their way with online slots. The payouts from gaming are not as high as other slots, but still offer a good chance of regular wins.
Pay By Mobile Casino Sites: What are the Pros & Cons?
Pay By Mobile Casinos: Responsible Gambling
Gambling should be seen as a form of entertainment, not a reliable way to generate income. Set a clear budget before you play, never exceed it, and avoid the temptation to chase losses.
All reputable casinos offer responsible gambling tools to help maintain healthy habits. These include options like deposit caps, loss limits, cooling-off periods and full self-exclusion if needed.
These tools are also available on betting sites, bingo sites, new slot sites and slot apps, or any other type of regulated online gambling platform.
Be sure not to get too carried away by free spins and free bet offers, which may seem valuable on first glance, but can become addictive.
Should you wish to seek help for gambling-related issues, there are several charities and healthcare providers who offer support and information:

Nearly 5 million people missing out on £220 a year, broadband experts warn

Nearly 5 million people missing out on £220 a year, broadband experts warn
One expert describes the issue as a ‘cost of living scandal’
- Bookmark
- CommentsGo to comments
Millions of people are missing out on easy-to-access discounts worth an average £220 on their broadband despite being eligible, experts have warned.
Broadband social tariffs are generally available to low-income households, or those in receipt of certain benefits like Universal Credit. Exact eligibility varies between providers, with many major firms now offering some form of cheaper product.
Around 5.3 million UK households are eligible for the lower tariff, research by Broadband Genie found, but around 4.8 million aren’t currently claiming.
This means £1.05bn is “left on the table,” the broadband experts say, urging those who may be eligible to look into the scheme.
Georgina Colman, founder of Purpl, a platform which helps connect disabled people with discounts, said the issue was a “cost of living scandal hiding in plain sight”.
She added: “Millions of people on low incomes, including disabled people and those on Universal Credit, are overpaying for broadband simply because they don’t know help exists”.
There are several social tariffs currently on the market. BT has three offerings for people depending on their income and needs, called the ‘Home Essentials’ tariff.
This starts at from £16 a month for 12 months of 36Mb broadband for those with no income. The next level is £22 a month for 36Mb for those on low-income, and finally there is an offering for 67Mb at £25 a month. Each comes with an £11.99 installation fee.
Other big-name providers offering social broadband tariffs include Now, Sky, Virgin and Vodaphone, all costing £20 a month at most.

There are also some smaller-name providers that offer social tariffs that aren’t available nationwide. This includes Community Fibre, Hyperoptic, and Kcom.
Ms Colman added: “Broadband is an essential service, and when households could be saving around £220 a year, the lack of awareness around social tariffs is letting people down. Providers need to do far more to actively tell customers what they’re entitled to.
“If broadband becomes unaffordable, disabled people don’t just lose an internet connection, they lose a vital lifeline. For many, it’s how they stay in touch with family, access support, manage their health and avoid isolation. Disabled people are already more likely to experience loneliness, and pricing them out of broadband risks cutting them off from the world at a time when digital access is no longer optional.”
Around £24bn of support is estimated to go unclaimed in 2025/26, according to research unit Policy in Practice, due to reasons like stigma, complexity lack of awareness. Broadband represents the biggest social tariff that is missed out on, with missed Universal Credit claims being the leading missed benefit at £11.1bn unclaimed.

'Modern Ukrainian technology, battle-tested' — Zelensky unveils 1st drone produced by German-Ukrainian joint venture

'Modern Ukrainian technology, battle-tested' — Zelensky unveils 1st drone produced by German-Ukrainian joint venture
President Volodymyr Zelensky on Feb. 13 unveiled the first strike drone produced by a newly launched German-Ukrainian joint venture ahead of the Munich Security Conference, as he said in a statement published on X.
The launch marks the first Ukrainian drone production line in Germany and is part of Kyiv's broader effort to expand arms manufacturing in Europe, as the war with Russia drives sustained demand for unmanned systems.
"Today, I received the first jointly made attack drone. We saw the production line and the first flight of the drone," Zelensky wrote on X.
"This is modern Ukrainian technology. Battle-tested. Powered by AI. It will strike, it will scout, it will protect our soldiers," the president added.
Zelensky, accompanied by German Defense Minister Boris Pistorius, visited Quantum Frontline Industries (QFI), a joint venture between Germany's Quantum Systems and Ukraine's Frontline Robotics.
During the visit, the Ukrainian-German Linza 3.0 multi-purpose drone was demonstrated and then handed over to Zelensky.
The facility is expected to produce up to 10,000 drones within a year, all of which will be delivered to the Ukrainian Armed Forces, according to the president.
The Linza 3.0 drone, developed by Frontline Robotics, is the latest version of the company's multi-purpose platform. The manufacturer said it features AI-enabled visual-inertial navigation, can carry up to 4 kilograms of payload, operate up to 15 kilometers (9 miles), and can stay in the air for up to 60 minutes.
The parties announced the start of joint production in December 2025, and Ukraine plans to open 10 more joint ventures by the end of 2026, Zelensky said. The president did not specify which countries the ventures would be located in.
The German production line builds on broader defense agreements signed between Kyiv and Berlin in December, when Germany committed 1.2 billion euros ($1.4 billion) in new defense deals.
The package included long-term sustainment support for Patriot air defense systems currently used by Ukraine, procurement of Ukrainian-made drones, and co-production initiatives between Quantum Systems and Frontline Robotics.
Zelensky previously announced that Ukrainian drone production would expand into Europe, noting that similar production lines are already operating in the U.K.
In October 2025, Zelensky instructed the Defense Ministry to launch a "controlled export" program for Ukrainian weapons, aiming to export surplus military equipment and reinvest profits into urgently needed systems.
Ukraine's drone industry has grown rapidly since Russia's full-scale invasion in 2022, with hundreds of companies producing reconnaissance and strike systems that now play a central role on the battlefield.
Establishing production lines in partner countries allows Ukrainian-developed systems to be manufactured at scale while deepening defense-industrial cooperation with European allies.

U.S. military says transfer of ISIS suspects from Syria to Iraq complete

U.S. military says controversial transfer of thousands of ISIS suspects from Syria to Iraq complete
The U.S. military said Friday that it had finished moving thousands of ISIS suspects from prisons and jails in Syria to facilities across the border in neighboring Iraq, completing a mission sparked by security concerns amid lingering unrest in post-war Syria that saw a mass-escape from one facility in late January.
"Central Command (CENTCOM) completed a transfer mission following a nighttime flight from northeastern Syria to Iraq on Feb. 12 to help ensure ISIS detainees remain secure in detention facilities," the U.S. military command responsible for operations in the Middle East said in a statement, adding that the 23-day operation, "resulted in U.S. forces successfully transporting more than 5,700 adult male ISIS fighters from detention facilities in Syria to Iraqi custody."
"Job well done to the entire Joint Force team who executed this exceptionally challenging mission on the ground and in the air with great focus, professionalism, and collaboration with our regional partners," CENTCOM commander Adm. Brad Cooper said in the statement. "We appreciate Iraq's leadership and recognition that transferring the detainees is essential to regional security."
"The successful execution of this orderly and secure transfer operation will help prevent an ISIS resurgence in Syria," added U.S. Army Maj. Gen. Kevin Lambert, commander of the U.S.-led military coalition in the region tasked with the ongoing fight against ISIS remnants.
It's not clear if any of the prisoners have been charged with specific crimes, or even been confirmed as ISIS members. So, the decision by the U.S. to move them to Iraq — which has offered to put the detainees on trial — has drawn concern from rights groups citing a history in the country of "totally sham trials."
The concern, as voiced to CBS News by Sarah Sanbar, a researcher with the New York-based Human Rights Watch, is that many of the detainees could face terrorism charges in an opaque justice system that, just seven years ago, saw alleged ISIS militants, including European nationals, convicted and sentenced to death.
She said the last time such a large number of people were put before courts in Iraq, the "system was completely overwhelmed."
After Iraq defeated local elements of ISIS at the end of 2017, it put thousands of suspected members of the group on trial. According to the United Nations mission in Iraq, between January 2018 and October 2019, the Iraqi judiciary processed more than 20,000 terrorism-related cases.
Iraqi officials never released details on how many people convicted in these cases were sentenced to death during that period, but Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International have said around 8,000 people remain on death row in the country, including non-Iraqi citizens.
Several news outlets, including The Wall Street Journal, reported in 2019 that seven French nationals were among the hundreds of people sentenced to death.
"They were totally sham trials," Sanbar told CBS News earlier this month. "Confessions obtained under torture, people being tortured in detention centers, trials that lasted 10 minutes without a lawyer present, where they were sentenced to death, on the basis of an anonymous informant and no corroborating evidence."
Responding to questions emailed by CBS News, an official with the Iraqi National Center of Justice and International Judicial Collaboration, rejected the accusations, saying the "Iraqi judiciary categorically rejects torture" and noting that "extracting confessions through coercion is a crime punishable under Iraqi law."
"Terrorism trials in Iraq are conducted in accordance with current laws and within a constitutional framework that guarantees the right to a fair trial, the defendant's right to a defense, and the eligibility of rulings for legal appeal," the official said, adding that all such proceedings were "overseen by specialized judges working under extraordinary circumstances imposed by the scale and nature of these crimes."
Iraq's judiciary announced on Feb. 2 that it had begun investigations into more than 1,300 ISIS suspects among those who had been transferred from Syria by the U.S.
Sanbar, of Human Rights Watch, said Iraq's justice system had "come a long way" since the 2019 trials, as the country itself has continued to stabilize, "but that being said, a lot of those core systemic issues still persist."
U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio confirmed the plan to transfer the prisoners months ago, saying they would "be in Iraq temporarily," and urging the detainees' home countries to repatriate their nationals.
But Iraq's top legal official, the President of the Supreme Judicial Council, Judge Dr. Faiq Zidan, said in a televised address on Jan. 23 that his country was fully prepared to handle the cases of ISIS suspects, foreign and domestic.
"While some countries refuse to receive their nationals involved in terrorist crimes, the Iraqi judiciary confirms its full readiness to try terrorists detained in camps within Syrian territory, in accordance with national laws and international obligations, ensuring fair and decisive trials, achieving justice for the victims of terrorism, and preserving security in Iraq and other countries," he said.
"We don't know who is there," Sanbar told CBS News of the detainees, who have now been moved to Iraq by the U.S. "Part of what we would call on authorities to do in Iraq, and the coalition, is to be very clear about who they're transferring, inform the families, give them access to legal representation, so that first and foremost, we know who's even there."
During a 2019 visit to a prison housing ISIS suspects in Hasaka, northeast Syria, CBS News found mostly Iraqi and Syrian inmates, but there were also many Europeans, Asians, Turks and citizens of other Arab countries. There was also one American man, but CBS News learned later that he had been repatriated.
So far, no third country has commented on the transfer of any foreign nationals to Iraq or the possibility of them being put on trial in the country. That came as no surprise to Sanbar.
"We've seen these countries whose citizens left to join ISIS completely washing their hands of any sort of responsibility. They've let them languish there for the last 10 years," said Sanbar. "We would hope that now they would take them home, and we call on them to do so."
The Iraqi National Center of Justice and International Judicial Collaboration told CBS News in early February that it was in communication with multiple countries regarding the matter, though it did not identify them.

Why is it in Greece’s best interests to strengthen ties with Türkiye?
Unknown
Unknown Publisher

01:16:02 KST

The sixth Türkiye–Greece High-Level Cooperation Council in Ankara, marked by Kyriakos Mitsotakis’s visit and multiple cooperation deals, represented more than a symbolic diplomatic gesture.
The meeting this week indicated that both countries are committed to preserving a workable framework of cooperation and expanding collaboration in areas such as investment, maritime trade, economic cooperation, earthquake preparedness, culture, science, and technology.
President Recep Tayyip Erdogan emphasised after the talks that disputes between the two neighbours are “solvable,” reinforcing Ankara’s preference for dialogue.
Athens’ stance indicates it also recognises the importance of handling disagreements while increasing areas of agreement.
This approach is not driven by goodwill alone, but by strategic necessity, experts say.
Visne Korkmaz, an international relations professor at Istanbul’s Nisantasi University, tells TRT World that the transformation currently underway in transatlantic security has significantly altered Athens’ calculations.
“The political and strategic cost of adopting an overtly anti-Ankara posture has increased,” she says, pointing to Türkiye’s growing visibility and weight within NATO’s evolving deterrence architecture.
And as the United States recalibrates its approach to European security—seeking greater burden-sharing while remaining anchored to NATO—European allies are expected to enhance their defence contributions.
“In such an environment, Türkiye’s military capabilities gain renewed strategic value,” Korkmaz says.
Europe’s regional realities
According to an international relations academic at Middle East Technical University, Oktay Firat Tanrisever, Greece’s calculations are shaped by a shifting strategic environment.
As a NATO member, Athens would face higher costs within the Alliance framework if tensions with Ankara escalated into any confrontation.
He also notes that Washington values dialogue with Türkiye across multiple regions — from the Middle East to the Eastern Mediterranean — reinforcing the perception in Athens that prolonged polarisation with Ankara would receive limited backing from the current US administration.
“Both the United States and the European Union expect Greece to remain in constructive relations with Türkiye,” Tanrisever tells TRT World.
Within this broader context, Tanrisever argues that Greece’s push for cooperation with Türkiye is driven largely by strategic necessity.
At a time when Europe is reassessing its security architecture, Türkiye’s role in European security has become increasingly important.
Countries such as Germany, the United Kingdom, Italy, and Spain have expressed interest in strengthening ties with Ankara.
“Greece does not currently possess wide latitude to draw European states into an overt anti-Türkiye polarisation,” Korkmaz says.
Moreover, the geopolitical landscape of the Eastern Mediterranean remains fluid.
Regional alignments—whether involving the European states, or North African actors—are constantly evolving.
In such an environment, for Greece, sustaining rigid polarisation risks diplomatic isolation rather than strategic advantage, experts say.
Domestic Strategic Pragmatism
Beyond international pressures, domestic realities also shape Athens’ approach.
Greece’s economy still needs stability, and increased tensions with Türkiye could lead to real economic consequences, analysts say.
The tourism industry, in particular, benefits from peaceful bilateral relations.
“The Prime Minister’s visit and the agreements signed show that both countries wish to maintain a reasonable basis for cooperation,” Tanrisever says.
In his assessment, avoiding escalation is necessary for Greece’s own national interests.
Korkmaz notes that while Greece has historically followed what she calls a “mini-state strategy”—internationalising disputes with Türkiye and using third-party deterrence—it is now combining this approach with hedging.
“There are no significant gains in triggering an arms race or provoking Ankara,” she emphasises.
“If Greece wants to ensure that Türkiye remains in a position of strategic self-restraint, cooperation and confidence-building must be foregrounded.”
Taken together, the Ankara meeting suggests that Athens recognises the limits of confrontation in a rapidly evolving security order.
Strengthening ties with Türkiye is not just a diplomatic preference—it's a strategic decision shaped by transatlantic expectations, European realignments, and domestic economic realities.
The transatlantic security shift, Europe’s pursuit of a new strategic balance, and Greece’s economic sensitivities have reduced the scope for escalation while increasing the incentives for careful cooperation.
For Greece, the positive agenda emerging from Ankara is less a tactical pause and more a strategic necessity shaped by the realities of a changing regional and global order.

Use of NSR impossible without cooperation with Moscow — Russian envoy to Seoul

SEOUL, February 13. /TASS/. The use of the Northern Sea Route (NSR) is impossible without cooperation with Russia, and Moscow is ready for such interaction with Seoul, Russian Ambassador to Seoul Georgy Zinovyev said.
"The Russian side is ready to engage with the Korean side on the issue. Cooperation is entirely possible under the current circumstances if there is a desire to do so," he said at a meeting with reporters. Meanwhile the diplomat indicated that he would not judge the extent to which the existing sanctions regime limits opportunities for cooperation in the Arctic, calling this issue an internal matter for the Republic of Korea itself.
At the same time, he noted growing interest in the Northern Sea Route from other countries, such as China and India. "There is no other route from Korea to Europe in the high latitudes. It cannot go through Alaska and Canada as there is no shipping there. In the Arctic Ocean, shipping is only possible along Russia's economic zone and territorial waters," Zinovyev noted. The ambassador reiterated that cooperation with Russia is essential to exploiting the short route from Asia to Europe via the Arctic Ocean. "Anyone who looks at a map will understand perfectly well that cooperation with Russia is necessary," he said.

Compare over 25 free spins on registration no deposit 2026 offers
This section offers a brief look at the relevant casino sign up bonus offers with no deposit free spins, so users can get a quick comparison of the offers detailed above.
Other free spins on registration no deposit UK offers
Some new online casinos provide fewer than 25 no deposit spins on registration, and while these offers are less valuable than some provided by competitors, they can still be useful for casual or first-time players.
As mentioned above, NetBet Casino is a prime example, so we have provided a summary of their popular offer below. Space Wins is another lesser-known slot site that also provide no deposit free spins - more on that below.
NetBet – 11 free spins no deposit
New NetBet users can pick up 11 free spins when they register using the code KINGKONG. The no deposit free spins are worth 10p each and are only playable on King Kong Cash.
Players can earn a maximum of £10 cash in winnings, and winnings are paid in cash with no wagering requirements.
While the NetBet casino offer has a lower value compared to top offers from Sky Vegas, Paddy Power and Betfair, it is great for players wanting a small, low risk sample to test slot games without having to risk their own cash.
Meanwhile, sports bettors may also be interested in NetBet’s betting product, where they’ll find a very accomplished bet builder tool.
Space Wins - 5 no deposit free spins
Space Wins may not be one of the most recognisable casino brands in the UK, but they do give new customers no deposit free spins.
OK, there’s only five free spins on offer and they’re restricted to Starburst, but that’s better than nothing, right?
All you have to do is register a Space Wins account via the link below and then add a valid debit card to your account.
There is a maximum win capacity on the free spins and any bonus funds generated will be subject to 10x wagering requirements.
However, this no free spins on registration no deposit offer is still worth taking up, and if you like the platform you can go on to get another bonus on your first deposit.
A first deposit (minimum £10 to qualify) can potentially land you up to 500 free spins on Starburst.
How to choose a 25+ free spins no deposit casino
When evaluating the best 25 free spins on registration no deposit offers, punters should remember to consider the following factors before choosing an offer or casino:
- UKGC licensing: Remember to make sure the casino is fully licensed by the UK Gambling Commission. All our recommended sites meet this standard, but double-checking protects both your funds and personal data.
- No wagering vs wagering spins: Review wagering rules before opting in to offers. The best no-deposit bonuses have no wagering requirements, or very low ones, making winnings easy to withdraw.
- Maximum win limits: Check the maximum payout to understand the real value of the bonus.
- Game restrictions: Free spins are usually tied to specific slots, though some offers include half a dozen or more eligible slots. Make sure to check the eligible games to evaluate if the offer suits your tastes.
- Bonus expiry windows: Most no deposit bonuses expire within seven days, but this varies. Ensure you’re comfortable with the time limit before you claim.
Responsible gambling
It’s important to gamble responsibly at all times. Our recommended 25 free spins on registration no deposit 2025 casinos promote safe play and offer deposit limits, session reminders and self-exclusion tools.
Free spins can be fun, but remember to treat them as a form of entertainment, never a way to make money.
When using a 25 free spins on registration no deposit 2026 promo or any other free spins offer, be aware that gambling can be addictive, so please take steps to remain in control of your time and budget.
The same applies whether you’re using casino sites, betting sites, betting apps, slot sites or any other gambling medium.
It’s particularly important not to get carried away by any free bet offers or casino offers you might receive, both of which are available in abundance on gambling apps, but must be approached with caution.
You can stay in control by making use of the responsible gambling tools offered, such as deposit limits, loss limits, self-exclusion and time-outs.

Verdict: Best 25 free spins on registration no deposit casinos UK

FAQs
What are free spins in casinos?
Free spins are bonus plays typically offered for slot games on online casinos. They can be unlocked when you sign up and make a first deposit as a new customer to a casino site, or as ongoing promotions for existing customers. Some casinos offer free spins when you sign up even without depositing.
Which UK casinos currently offer no deposit free spins?
A small number of UKGC-licensed casinos still offer no deposit free spins. Paddy Power Games (60 spins), Sky Vegas (50 spins), Betfair Casino (50 spins) and Netbet (11) all provide free spins on registration with no deposit and no wagering on winnings.
Do free spins in the UK always have wagering requirements?
Some do, but the best UK no deposit free spins come with no wagering requirements, meaning any winnings can be withdrawn as cash. Always check the terms, as lower-value offers may include win caps or game restrictions.
Why are no deposit free spins hard to find on UK casino sites?
UK Gambling Commission regulations have made no deposit casino bonuses less common, as operators must ensure promotions protect players from developing addiction. As a result, many casinos now offer fewer free spins, tighter limits, or focus on no-wagering bonuses tied to a small deposit instead.
How to use 25 free spins on Betfair?
Register a new account using one of the Betfair links in the article and enter the bonus code CASAFS when prompted. Open up an eligible slot game to claim your no deposit free spins. First-time depositors can claim a further 100 free spins after they’ve staked at least £10.

Climber dies and two in hospital after incident on Welsh coast
Police confirmed that one person was pronounced dead at the scene at St Govan’s Head

A climber has tragically died following an incident involving three individuals on the rugged Welsh coast.
Dyfed-Powys Police confirmed that one person was pronounced dead at the scene at St Govan’s Head in Pembrokeshire on Thursday afternoon. Two other climbers involved in the incident were taken to hospital with injuries.
Authorities stated the death is not being treated as suspicious, and the individual’s next of kin have been informed.
A police spokesperson added: "Dyfed-Powys Police were contacted by the ambulance service around 4.25pm, Thursday February 12, reporting concerns for the welfare of three individuals at St Govan’s Head, Pembrokeshire."
“Officers were deployed to the location alongside multiple other agencies.
“Two were taken to hospital for treatment for injuries not believed to be life threatening. Sadly, one person was pronounced dead at the scene.”
A spokesman for HM Coastguard said the alarm was first raised at about 4pm on Thursday.
Teams from Fishguard, St Govan’s and Tenby were sent, alongside an HM Coastguard helicopter, an Irish Coastguard helicopter, Wales Air Ambulance and an RNLI lifeboat from Angle.
Last year, a social media influencer with more than 10,000 followers died plunging 65ft when she lost her grip climbing a rocky mountain face in Snowdonia, North Wales.
An inquest heard that adventure-loving engineer Maria Eftimova, 28, was tackling the notorious Tryfan mountain when the accident happened.
Maria was climbing with friends and trying to get a handhold when she tumbled - and went into "freefall" down the mountain.

Israeli artillery, gunfire target several towns in southern Lebanon despite ceasefire
Lebanese state media report shelling on Yaron, Aita al-Shaab, Beit Lif and surrounding areas
BEIRUT
Israeli forces carried out artillery shelling and opened fire on multiple towns in southern Lebanon on Friday, in the latest violation of a ceasefire deal in place since November 2024, Lebanese media reported.
The state-run National News Agency said five Israeli artillery shells struck the Wadi Mazlam area, while heavy machine-gun fire targeted the outskirts of the border town of Yaron.
An Israeli drone also dropped two sound bombs near the town of Aita al-Shaab in the Bint Jbeil district, NNA said.
Additional shelling with heavy-caliber artillery was reported on the outskirts of Beit Lif, while the towns of Aitaroun and Blida were also subjected to bursts of gunfire.
No injuries were reported.
The attacks came amid repeated Israeli violations of the ceasefire agreement, killing and wounding hundreds of Lebanese. Israel continues to occupy five Lebanese hilltops seized during the latest war, in addition to other Lebanese areas it has held for decades.
Israel began military operations against Lebanon in October 2023 and escalated them into a full-scale war in September 2024, killing more than 4,000 people and wounding about 17,000 others.

Pentagon Brings ChatGPT into Its Official AI Tool Set
Unknown
Unknown Publisher
2026-02-13
16:09:45 UTC
01:09:45 KST

The Pentagon’s adoption of generative artificial intelligence tools—including the recent addition of the world’s most popular model, ChatGPT—holds promise for more efficient work for Department of Defense personnel but also poses risks unless users remain vigilant, experts told Air & Space Forces Magazine.
The department announced Feb. 9 it was adding OpenAI’s ChatGPT to its GenAI.mil platform, which uses machine learning on large data sets to function as a chatbot and produce text, images, or software code based on unclassified information.
GenAI.mil launched in December, using Google’s Gemini for Government GPT and later adding xAI’s government suite, based on its Grok model. Already, the platform has surpassed one million unique users.
The addition of ChatGPT may fuel further interest and growth. OpenAI is largely credited with launching a boom in generative AI, and ChatGPT remains the most popular version of the technology. According to a January study of web traffic, ChatGPT accounted for nearly 65 percent of generative AI chatbot site visits among the general public, triple that of Google’s Gemini.
Gregory Touhill, a retired Air Force brigadier general who now serves as the director of cybersecurity at Carnegie Mellon’s Software Engineering Institute, told Air & Space Forces Magazine that expanded access to AI is important because Airmen and Guardians need it to be competitive.
“I think it’s important for our Airmen today, we want our Airmen to be well prepared for the future, and the future is racing toward us now,” Touhill said. “AI is a tool that our Airmen and our Guardians can use to obtain decisive capabilities in the cyber domain.”
Touhill and SEI are currently working with the Pentagon and other agencies to develop risk management processes for using AI in government settings, he said.
Touhill added that he’s confident AI can help service members automate and eliminate tasks to do more faster. But more importantly, AI can potentially free Airmen and Guardians from lesser tasks so they can apply more time to higher-order work.
Caleb Withers, a research assistant in the Technology and National Security Program at the Center for a New American Security, foresees AI benefiting prototyping, wargaming, research, and bureaucratic paper-pushing. “With wide adoption, I imagine these tools will quickly become some of the most used,” Withers said.
But Touhill and Withers cautioned that AI also poses real risks as its use grows. “The security challenge is the fusion of hardware, software, and wetware,” Touhill said, the last term referring to the humans using AI. “We don’t want our Airmen and Guardians disclosing information into a system not designed to process that information. Once it’s in, it’s part of the system; it’s not like you can back away and wipe it clean.”
Using official defense applications and not open commercial solutions is one step to protecting information loss. Good training, common sense, and protocols will also help, Withers said, as does a skeptical approach to AI use.
“These systems are not yet fully reliable, and in some cases can be quite unreliable or fail,” Withers said. “There’s a risk of overconfidence in them.”
In June 2024, the Air Force Research Laboratory rolled out its own generative AI for the Air Force, called NIPRGPT. NIPR stands for Non-secure Internet Protocol Router network, or the unclassified Internet for the military. Adoption was swift: 80,000 users in NIPRGPT’s first three months and 700,000 users before the pathfinder program was shut down in December to make way for GenAI.mil.
The Army had also developed its own generative AI tool, known as CamoGPT. The two services briefly clashed last April when the Army blocked NIPRGPT from its networks, citing cybersecurity and data concerns. Chief Technology Officer Gabriel Chiulli of the Army’s Enterprise Cloud Management Agency told Air & Space Forces Magazine at the time that blocking NIPRGPT was part of a wider move by the Army to shift from experimentation with AI tools to full implementation.
“The block was focused on getting us to a governance framework for AI used in a production state,” he said. “We were trying to make sure we had the guardrails in place for how we’re doing AI for real.”
Now the Pentagon-wide GenAI.mil platform is the only approved AI platform, enabling the military to absorb the latest models, tailored for government use at a uniform location.
Touhill called NIPRGPT a “bold initiative,” an early effort to get a specific large language model in the hands of Airmen and Guardians. “It’s like training on a simulator that actually has some live data,” Touhill said. “It was a good first step in getting Airmen and Guardians comfortable using AI.”
GenAI.mil is likely to expand to include other AI tools, Withers predicts, just as it has recently added ChatGPT. Different generative AIs excel at different tasks, he said, and no one single solution will enable DOD to maximize AI’s potential to tackle different problems.

Water leak strikes Louvre gallery where most valuable artworks are housed
This marks the second such incident in under three months for the Louvre, which has faced a series of recent challenges

- CommentsGo to comments
A water leak struck the Louvre Museum's Denon gallery on Thursday evening, affecting an area displaying valuable paintings but sparing Leonardo Da Vinci's iconic Mona Lisa.
A spokesperson for the Paris institution confirmed the leak had been contained by early Friday morning, with the gallery expected to reopen shortly.
The incident occurred in room 707, home to works by 19th-century French artist Charles Meynier and 16th-century Italian Bernardino Luini. The leak caused damage to a ceiling painted by Meynier.
This marks the second such incident in under three months for the Louvre, which has faced a series of recent challenges.
Earlier on Thursday, prosecutors in Paris announced that nine people were detained in connection with a suspected decade-long ticket fraud scheme at the Louvre.
The alleged operation is believed to have defrauded the institution of more than €10m (£8.7m) over the past decade.
The arrests took place on Tuesday.
They are part of a judicial investigation that commenced after the Louvre lodged a formal complaint in December 2024.
Two museum employees, a number of tour guides and an individual suspected of being the mastermind behind the extensive fraud were among those taken into custody, the prosecutors' office.
The museum alerted investigators about the frequent presence of two Chinese tour guides suspected of bringing groups of Chinese tourists into the museum by fraudulently reusing the same tickets multiple times for different visitors.
Other guides were later suspected of similar practices.
It follows the high-profile heist of the museum on October, when a gang of thieves stole several items of jewellery from the venue.
The robbery gang's haul of loot was worth an estimated 88 million euros ($102 million) — a monetary value that didn't include their huge historical value to France.
The thieves took less than eight minutes to force their way into the museum and leave, using a freight lift to reach the building's window. Footage from museum cameras showed that the two who broke into the ornate Apollo Gallery used grinders to cut into jewellery display cases.
Employees at the Louvre also went on strike in December, with the heist highlighting long-standing concerns that crowding and thin staffing were undermining security and working conditions at a museum that welcomes millions of visitors each year.

Still thinking about Heated Rivalry? Here’s where to listen and read the sequel

Still thinking about Heated Rivalry? Here’s where to listen and read the sequel
There are currently six books in Rachel Reid’s Game Changer series
- Bookmark
Heated Rivalry is undoubtedly the most talked-about TV show of the year so far. Based on Rachel Reid’s book series, Game Changers, the TV adaptation follows the decade-long, slow-burning relationship between two NHL hockey players.
Its blend of sports drama and gay romance is an unlikely contender for 2026’s biggest show – but it’s a formula that’s drawn in millions of viewers around the world and made its two lead actors, Connor Storrie and Hudson Williams, overnight stars.
Spanning six episodes, the series follows Shane (played by Williams) and Ilya (Storrie) as they clash on the ice as rivals in opposing teams. Off the rink, the tension shifts: beneath the pressure of fame and the expectations of family, their emotional and physical bond deepens each hockey season.
The show is irresistibly charming, refreshing familiar romance tropes – enemies-to-lovers, secret affairs, opposites-attract – with surprising tenderness. But much of Heated Rivalry’s success lies in throwing away certain archetypes – there’s no toxic masculinity or misogyny, and the LGBT+ community has praised its representation of queer love.
Women have become particularly obsessed with the show, drawn to its vulnerability, yearning and emotional intimacy – all geared to the female gaze. In part thanks to Emerald Fennell’s “bodice-ripping” Wuthering Heights adaptation, “yearning” is the internet’s current buzzword – and it perfectly captures Heated Rivalry’s intensity.
No doubt you binged all six episodes of Heated Rivalry in record time – and if you can’t stop thinking about Ilya and Shane, the good news is that showrunner Jacob Tierney has already confirmed season two. The bad news is that we might not get it until 2027. “I don’t want to put out a rushed, shitty second season just because the show is very popular,” he told Variety.
While the first series was based on book two of Reid’s Game Changer series, the second series will likely follow the events of book six, The Long Game. There are four other titles in the series (Game Changer, Tough Guy, Common Goal and Role Model), which all focus on the romantic lives of different characters from the hockey league Here’s how to read the Game Changers series in order – plus, everything you need to know about the seventh book, Unrivalled (out in September).
How to read or listen to the ‘Game Changer’ books in order
'Game Changer' by Rachel Reid, published by Carina press
The first book in the series of the same name, Game Changer follows Scott Hunter – who you’ll be familiar with from episode three of Heated Rivalry (and that very public confession of love in episode five). The captain of the New York Admirals hockey team, Hunter, is openly gay, but has always been guarded about his private life. After a chance meeting with Kip Grady, a cheerful and charming smoothie shop worker, all that begins to change.
Heated Rivalry by Rachel Reid, publishing Carina Press
The book that inspired the global obsession, Heated Rivalry is the second title in Reid’s series. It follows Canadian golden boy hockey player Shane Hollander, and rival star Ilya Rozanov, as they battle on ice while hiding a long-running relationship. Navigating the complications of fame, secrecy and the demands of their sports careers, the enemies-to-lovers storyline has surprising emotional depth.
'Tough Guy' by Rachel Reid, published by Carina Press
Tough Guy introduces us to yet more characters, with the attention turning to Ryan Price. A steely hockey player who secretly grapples with anxiety and vulnerability, he meets Fabian Smith, a musician who teaches Ryan to open up and trust others.
'Common Goal' by Rachel Reid, published by Carina Press
Book four in the Game Changer series, Common Goal shines the spotlight on Eric Bennett. An experienced hockey goalie, he becomes entangled in a relationship with a bartender with a lot of emotional baggage, Kyle Swift.
'Role Model' by Rachel Reid, published by Carina Press
The fifth book in the series follows Troy Barnett, a closeted and former bully in the league who wants to redeem himself. Helping him on his path to redemption is Harris Drover, his team’s charismatic and openly gay PR, who helps Barnett on his journey to self-acceptance.
'The Long Game' by Rachel Reid, published by Carina press
A direct sequel to Heated Rivalry, The Long Game is the source material behind season two of the TV show. If you can’t wait until then, the book picks up where series one left off. Shane and Ilya are a decade into their secret relationship and grappling with the idea of going public – but what will this mean for their celebrity careers, family and status in the hockey world?
'Unrivalled' by Rachel Reid, published by Carina Press
In mid-January of this year, Reid teased a seventh book in the Game Changers series, delighting fans by announcing that it will continue Shane and Ilya’s story. Spoilers ahead: now married and out, the couple face new challenges and acceptance within the sport isn’t a given. Released on 29 September 2026, you can pre-order it now.

MUNICH, February 13. /TASS/. The world has entered a new era marked by open conflicts and wars, German Chancellor Friedrich Merz declared at the Munich Security Conference, according to a TASS correspondent.
"We have entered a new phase of open wars and conflicts that keep us on edge and are transforming our world more profoundly than we have anticipated for many years," he stated.
Merz emphasized the disintegration of the rules-based international order. "We must be even clearer: this order, despite its imperfections even at its peak, no longer exists," he asserted.

Waymo is paying DoorDash drivers to close robotaxi doors left open by customers
Waymo has also partnered with a towing company to haul away vehicles that have lost power while on the roads
- Bookmark
- CommentsGo to comments
Waymo has started paying DoorDash drivers to close the doors of its driverless robotaxis, as passengers leave them ajar and can hold up traffic.
The automated cars cannot drive if any of their doors remain open, forcing the company to draft in human assistance to prevent roads from getting clogged up with immobile cabs.
A DoorDash driver took to Reddit to claim Waymo had offered them up to $11 simply for closing the door of a nearby vehicle.
The post, which was upvoted 522 times, showed that the driver had been offered a “guaranteed” $6.25 for the job with an additional $5 up for grabs if they sent proof that the job had been completed.
“You actually DoorDashed,” one user quipped in the comments section.
Waymo and DoorDash confirmed the bizarre situation is part of a pilot scheme in a joint statement given to CNBC, in which they said that they were always looking for new ways for drivers to earn more money.
However, they acknowledged that Waymo vehicles could soon have new technology installed which would automatically close their car doors.
DoorDash is not the only company that Waymo has drafted in to get stranded taxis moving again.
In parts of California, the robotaxi brand has partnered with Honk, a service that functions similarly to Uber but is aimed at towing companies. Through the partnership, workers can earn up to $20 for closing Waymo taxi doors.
Cesar Marenco, owner of Milagro Towing in Inglewood, told The Washington Post that he is now a regular Waymo door-closer.
He told the newspaper that he completes around three jobs a week for Waymo via the Honk app, either towing vehicles that failed to make it to a charging station or closing doors.
But power outages still present a problem for Waymo, with a December 2025 outage in San Francisco leaving several vehicles stranded across the city.
The robotaxis approach non-functional traffic signals as though they were a four-way stop, just as a regular driver would do, but the lack of human intuition means that they struggle to navigate them in larger, citywide power outages.
Following the San Francisco outage, a Waymo spokesperson told The Washington Post that the “sheer scale of the outage led to instances where vehicles remained stationary longer than usual to confirm the state of the affected intersections.”
The firm also confirmed in a blog post that there was a spike in requests for human workers, as difficult intersections may necessitate that a vehicle checks in with officials to “ensure it makes the safest choice.”
But Waymo reportedly has plans to expand its operations, with The Post reporting the company will launch rides in Miami, Dallas, Houston, San Antonio and Orlando throughout 2026.

American 'Quad God' Ilia Malinin carries 5-point lead into the free skate at Milan Cortina Olympics

American 'Quad God' Ilia Malinin carries 5-point lead into the free skate at Milan Cortina Olympics
Ilia Malinin enters the Olympic men’s free skate as the clear favorite, and he holds a strong lead after the short program
- Bookmark
Ilia Malinin, widely considered the best figure skater of this generation, could take a big step toward going down as one of the greatest ever Friday night down when the American goes for the gold medal in the men's free skate at the Milan Cortina Olympics.
The 21-year-old known as the “Quad God” has a five-point lead over Japan's Yuma Kagiyama and France's Adam Siao Him Fa after the short program. That would be a big margin for anyone, but it could be insurmountable given who is in first place.
Malinin is undefeated over two-plus years, a stretch of 14 consecutive victories in full competitions. That includes the past four U.S. championships, the last two world titles, and a host of world records — most crucially, the best mark ever for a free skate, a massive score of 238.24 points that pushed him to a 30-point victory at the Grand Prix Final in December.
Yagiyama, the last man to beat Malinin, was second that day. Siao Him Fa finished in fifth.
“Being the favorite is one thing,” Malinin said after his short program, “but actually getting it done and doing it under pressure and having the skate of your life to earn that medal is another thing. I don't want to get too ahead of myself and say that it's guaranteed that I'm getting that gold medal. Because, of course, I still have to put in the work.”
In truth, he doesn't have to do much more than show up.
That's because the longer nature of the free skate plays even more to his advantage, since it contains seven jumping passes instead of the three in the short program. He has a record-tying seven quadruple jumps scheduled for his program; by comparison, Kagiyama and Siao Him Fa have four in each other free skates.
“It's not so much the point total, it's the difference between the placements,” said Scott Hamilton, the 1984 Olympic champion. “Say it's football. You win by seven points, that's a touchdown; that's good. If you win by 10 points, that's a two-possession victory. You kind of dominated, right? He is winning competitions by 50 points or more. That's like, seven touchdowns.”
The real drama might not be whether Malinin wins but whether he lands the first quad axel in the Olympics.
The sons of Olympic skaters Tatiana Malinina and Roman Skorniakov, the ever-confident Malinin is the only person ever to land the jump in competition. The reason it is so difficult is that the axel begins facing forward, whereas the other five main jumps in figure skating start facing backward, and that adds another half revolution to the quad axel.
“I’m hoping that I’ll feel good enough to do it,” Malinin acknowledged. “But of course I always prioritize health and safety. So I really want to put myself in the right mindset where I’ll feel really confident to go into it."
Malinin already has one gold medal from the team event, where he finished a surprising second to Kagiyama in the short program but beat fellow Japanese star Shun Sato in the free skate. That head-to-head win allowed the Americans to defend their team title.
Afterward, Malinin admitted that the pressure of the Olympics had gotten to him in his debut. But those nerves settled during his free skate, and by the time of his individual short program Tuesday night, his fearlessness and spunk was back again.
“Now I feel like I've taken over that fight that I had in the team event,” Malinin said, “so now I can really just focus solely on that free program, and let everything happen naturally.”

Gary Numan’s wife Gemma, 57, left partially paralyzed after spinal surgery
It comes just months after Gary announced the sudden death of his brother

Gary Numan’s wife Gemma has been left partially paralyzed after undergoing spinal surgery, just months after the singer revealed his brother had died suddenly following a heart attack.
Gemma, 57, told fans in a post on Instagram that her left arm is now paralyzed following a multi-level discectomy, which is a procedure to remove damaged or herniated discs.
“No one can ever understand how s**t it is and not glamorous,” she added.
Gary and Gemma married in 1997 and have three daughters: Persia, Raven and Echo.
The couple live in Los Angeles but Gemma had her surgery in the UK, and said she has been unable to travel back to the States since September last year.
“Gutted!” she wrote. “I miss my animals so much, it makes me feel sick! Gary has looked after me here in the UK the whole time.”
The mum-of-three also thanked her loved ones for their help, writing: “It couldn’t have happened without you!”
Gemma added that the operation was her third since August last year, telling her Instagram followers that she still has another to come.
It comes after 67-year-old Gary announced the sudden death of his younger brother, John, in November. Fans had been concerned for Numan after he broke down in tears midway through a Birmingham performance of his song “Please Push No More”, telling the audience that he had received “the worst news ever”.
In an emotional post on social media, Gary later told fans his brother died just moments after he said goodbye to him following a show in Leeds.
“He had spent the evening with me at my Telekon show, catching up, swapping stories, telling me about his newly found love of reading,” he wrote.
“I hugged him at the door of our tour bus, I think it was about 12:20am, asked him how far he had to walk to get to his car (I always worried about him walking the streets at night), it was not far apparently, we said goodbye and I watched him walk away.
“Sadly he never made it to his car, betrayed by his own heart. It will haunt me forever that we may have driven off not knowing that he was lying in a rainy street just yards away. Luckily a kind person saw him and called an ambulance, but it was too late.”

Malawi vaccinates a new generation of children against polio, which still hasn't been eradicated
The southern African nation of Malawi has launched a new polio vaccination campaign this week in another reminder that the world still hasn’t managed to eradicate the disease despite a concerted effort for more than 35 years

In a classroom in southern Malawi, children sit in rows on the floor as a health worker moves among them administering an oral vaccine that protects against polio.
The new vaccination campaign that began on Wednesday is another reminder that the world still hasn’t managed to eradicate the ancient disease, which primarily affects children and can cause paralysis. despite a concerted effort for more than 35 years by the World Health Organization and its partners.
Health officials believe they came close several times, including five years ago, when just five cases of the natural polio virus were reported globally.
But a WHO report said that there were 38 cases of the natural polio virus between January and October 2025 — all in Pakistan and Afghanistan, the last two countries where it remains endemic — and another 151 cases of a vaccine-derived polio virus strain in 13 countries.
Those vaccine-derived cases have overtaken natural polio virus cases in recent years, and complicated the eradication effort as one of a number of missteps in the global fight. They come about when the weakened live virus in oral polio vaccines mutates into a form capable of sparking new outbreaks.
That’s the problem in Malawi, which reported last month that it had discovered the vaccine-derived Type 2 polio virus strain in sewage water in the southern city of Blantyre, prompting health authorities to launch a new immunization campaign using a modified vaccine.
By WHO regulations, Malawi was required to declare an outbreak on confirming the polio virus traces.
Malawi’s deputy health minister, Charles Chilambula, was among the officials promoting the vaccination drive. It involves 1.7 million doses being administered to children at schools and taken door-to-door through some of the city’s neighborhoods by health workers.
In an attempt to reassure people, Chilambula said that the doses will protect against the vaccine-derived form that’s been discovered in Blantyre in environmental samples. Malawi’s Health Ministry said that it's using the novel oral polio vaccine that’s designed to stop circulating vaccine-derived Type 2 outbreaks.
“It’s very important that we do the vaccine now, because it also deals with this virus which we have detected,” Chilambula said.
Polio is a highly contagious incurable disease that affects the nervous system, and both the wild virus and the vaccine-derived strain can cause irreversible paralysis. It's spread through contaminated food or water. Around one in 200 cases results in paralysis, WHO says, typically affecting the legs.
In the early 20th century, polio struck fear in communities across the world and paralyzed hundreds of thousands of children annually before the advent of vaccines in the 1950s.
Despite statistics now showing more children contracting polio viruses originating in vaccines than in the wild, global health authorities claim a bigger victory against polio. Wild polio virus cases have decreased by more than 99% since 1988, according to WHO, and from 125 endemic countries to two, largely because of vaccines.
But the end goal — the eradication of polio like smallpox — has been elusive.
Malawi became a country of concern for polio again in 2022 when a child contracted the wild polio virus, the first case in the southern African nation for 30 years. Last month’s announcement of traces of a vaccine-derived strain is another setback.
Dr. Joe Collins Opio, UNICEF's Malawi chief of health, said that the vaccination campaign would first focus on children in eight districts, but would ultimately grow into a national effort across the country of around 22 million people and called on everyone to “be part of the response.”
Malawi, like many poor countries, relies heavily on mobile health workers to reach people in vaccination campaigns.
Health workers, mainly women in matching blue dresses, visited schools and homes in the Blantyre area on foot, carrying vaccines in small cooler boxes. Officials say motorbikes will be used to take doses further afield.
People were also invited to open-air educational events, where officials promoted vaccines in speeches interspersed with popular music as children held up signs urging they be protected from polio.
“Polio remains a threat,” said Dr. Akosua Sika Ayisi, a public health specialist with WHO helping with the vaccination drive. She outlined Malawi’s task of ensuring every eligible child "in every community” is fully vaccinated to contribute to the global eradication of polio.

MUNICH, February 13. /TASS/. Germany and France are looking at creating a European nuclear umbrella, German Chancellor Friedrich Merz said.
"I have launched the talks with French President Emmanuel Macron on European nuclear deterrence," he said at the Munich Security Conference.
In an address to the nation in March 2025, Macron announced plans to negotiate with the allies the possibility of placing European countries under the protection of France’s nuclear deterrence forces. Germany, Poland, Lithuania, and Denmark have already expressed their readiness to discuss the issue. According to The Financial Times, the United States’ European allies are looking at creating their own nuclear shield in view of Washington’s course toward resuming relations with Russia.

Bulgaria’s former premier says partnership with Türkiye 'extremely important' for establishing peace
Rosen Zhelyazkov calls 'two-speed' EU initiative 'very particular issue' that would not bother European integrity
MUNICH
Bulgaria's former Prime Minister Rosen Zhelyazkov said cooperation with Türkiye carries strategic importance for the region.
"Nowadays, the world is eager for peace. For us, the partnership with Türkiye is extremely important ... of establishing peace,” he told Anadolu.
He noted that both countries are engaged in diplomatic initiatives tied to the Middle East.
“So I think that with Türkiye, we are a very good example of how the partnership between neighboring countries can facilitate and promote the peace process in the world,” he added.
'Two-speed' EU not a threat to European integrity
Addressing discussions around a "two-speed" Europe, he said the initiative has largely been misunderstood and relates mainly to capital market integration rather than political divisions within the bloc.
European leaders proposed a "two-speed union" as the quickest way to overcome the political deadlock blocking key economic reforms aimed at reviving the European economy.
"This initiative, I think that, is not very well understood," he said, explaining that countries ready to participate in simplifying and enlarging capital markets could move ahead, while others could join later.
He stressed that participation depends on readiness, not differences between member states, adding that the approach "is a very particular issue that would not bother the European integrity and the European Union at home."
Turning to the Middle East, Zhelyazkov said Bulgaria maintains relations with both Israel and Palestine and believes balanced engagement can help ease tensions.
"Both states are very important to ... mitigate all hostile narratives that exist because we need to establish peace and to promote the peace," he said.

PARIS, February 13. /TASS/. The Louvre is facing crises on a daily basis, leader of the French political party Les Patriotes, said.
"There's now a catastrophe every day at the Louvre! Thefts, smuggling, leaks, etc., it never stops! Meanwhile, the museum management is building a luxurious private dining room," the politician wrote on X.
Philippot also called it a "shame" for France that Laurence des Cars is still the museum director.
On February 12, Le Parisien reported that a fraudulent ticket-selling network had been dismantled at the Louvre. This incident adds to the list of problems the main Paris museum has faced recently. On October 19, 2025, the Louvre was robbed of royal jewels. In November, the museum had to close one of its galleries due to a water leak, and since mid-December, museum staff have been striking to demand improved working conditions.
According to BFMTV, French Culture Minister Rachida Dati, before leaving her post to run for mayor of Paris, could dismiss Louvre director Laurence des Cars amid the museum’s troubles.

SpaceX sends crew to International Space Station on 8-month science mission
Falcon 9 carries 2 NASA astronauts, one French astronaut and one Russian cosmonaut
ISTANBUL
A SpaceX rocket launched on Friday headed to the International Space Station for an eight-month science mission, NASA reported in a statement.
According to the statement, the Falcon 9, launched from Space Launch Complex 40 in Florida, US, carries NASA astronauts Jessica Meir and Jack Hathaway, European Space Agency astronaut Sophie Adenot, and Roscosmos cosmonaut Andrey Fedyaev.
“The research this crew will conduct aboard the space station advances critical technologies for deep space exploration while delivering real benefits here on Earth,” said NASA Administrator Jared Isaacman.
During the mission, Crew-12 will conduct a variety of science experiments aimed at advancing research and technology for missions to the Moon and Mars, said the statement.
Crew members will study pneumonia-causing bacteria to improve cardiovascular treatments, on-demand intravenous fluid generation for future space missions, and research on how physical characteristics may affect blood flow during spaceflight, according to NASA.
Other experiments include automated plant health monitoring and investigations of plant and nitrogen-fixing microbe interactions to enhance food production in space, according to the statement.
A SpaceX Dragon carrying Crew-11 scientists from NASA, Roscosmos, and the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency returned to Earth on Jan. 15 from the station.
NASA said that the crew's premature return followed monitoring of a medical concern involving one member, without giving additional details.

Logistics giant DP World replaces chairman named in Jeffrey Epstein documents
Dubai has replaced the longtime head of DP World after emails linked him to Jeffrey Epstein
- Bookmark
Dubai has announced a new chairman for DP World, one of the world’s largest logistics companies, replacing the outgoing head who was named in the Jeffrey Epstein documents.
The announcement by the government’s Dubai Media Office did not specifically name Sultan Ahmed bin Sulayem. However, it said that Essa Kazim was named DP World’s chairman and Yuvraj Narayan was named group CEO. Those were positions held by bin Sulayem.
DP World is a logistics giant that runs the Jebel Ali port in Dubai and operates terminals in other ports around the world. It has long been a pillar of the economy of the Middle Eastern city.
The announcement comes a day after financial groups in Canada and the United Kingdom said they’ve paused future ventures with DP World after newly released emails showed a yearslong friendship between bin Sulayem and Epstein.
The emails — some referencing porn, sexual massages and escorts — surfaced in the cache of Epstein-related documents recently released by the U.S. Department of Justice.
Epstein killed himself in jail in 2019 after he was charged with sex trafficking. The emails do not appear to implicate bin Sulayem in Epstein’s alleged crimes. DP World did not respond to request for comment.
Bin Sulayem previously had a larger role as chairman of the Dubai World conglomerate, which at the time included the property developer Nakheel. That company was behind the creation of human-made islands in the shape of palm trees and a map of the world that helped cement Dubai’s status as an up-and-coming global city.
The state-run WAM news agency also reported that Dubai’s ruler, Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, named a new head of the city-state’s Ports Customs and Free Zone Corporation. That also was a position held by bin Sulayem.
The topics in the emails between Epstein and bin Sulayem range widely, including President Donald Trump, sex and theology. Some emails — like others in the Epstein files — contain typographical errors.
In one email from 2013, Epstein wrote to bin Sulayem that “you are one of my most trusted friends in very sense of the word, you have never let me down." In response, bin Sulayem said: “Thank you my friend I am off the sample a fresh 100% female Russian at my yacht.”
That same year, bin Sulayem sent Epstein an email showing a menu for a massage business which included sexual offerings. Two years later, bin Sulayem texted Epstein a link to a porn site, and, in 2017, Epstein sent bin Sulayem a link to an escort website.
Epstein e-mailed with bin Sulayem about Steve Bannon, the Trump acolyte, in 2018, saying “you will like him.” In another exchange, bin Sulayem asked Epstein about an event where it appeared Trump would be in attendance.

Men Arrested in Shooting of GRU General Charged With Terrorism

Three men accused of being involved in a plot to assassinate senior military intelligence officer Vladimir Alexeyev earlier this month have been charged with terrorism, a spokeswoman for Russia’s top investigative body said Friday.
“Given the overall nature of the crime and the circumstances, investigators are bringing charges of terrorism against Lyubomir Korba, Viktor Vasin and Pavel Vasin,” Investigative Committee spokeswoman Svetalana Petrenko told reporters.
Earlier, the men were charged with attempted murder and arms trafficking.
Alexeyev, a lieutenant general who serves as first deputy head of Russia’s GRU military intelligence service, was hospitalized after being shot several times at an apartment in Moscow last Friday. He remains in critical condition.
Russia’s FSB security service claims Korba, who was arrested in the United Arab Emirates and extradited to Russia, shot Alexeyev with a Makarov pistol equipped with a silencer. Viktor Vasin, meanwhile, was said to have rented out an apartment to Korba in the building where the general was shot.
Both men confessed to having acted on orders from Ukraine’s SBU security service, the FSB said.
Vasin’s son Pavel was accused of providing his father and Korba with “vehicles that were used for physical surveillance and for retrieving weapons from a hidden cache.”
On Wednesday, a Moscow court ordered the three men to be placed in pre-trial detention for at least two months. They face up to 20 years in prison if found guilty of terrorism.
Russian police also issued an arrest warrant for a woman named Zinaida Serebritskaya, who is a fourth person of interest in the attempted assassination of Alexeyev. She is believed to have fled to Ukraine, law enforcement said.
Spokeswoman Petrenko said Friday that Serebritskaya would be charged with terrorism in absentia.
Ukraine has dismissed allegations that it was involved in last week’s shooting and suggested the incident was the result of “Russian infighting.”
The attempted assassination of Alexeyev is just the latest in a string of attacks inside Russia targeting senior military officials. Since December 2024, three generals have been killed in or near Moscow, with the most recent killing having taken place late last year.
A Message from The Moscow Times:
Dear readers,
We are facing unprecedented challenges. Russia's Prosecutor General's Office has designated The Moscow Times as an "undesirable" organization, criminalizing our work and putting our staff at risk of prosecution. This follows our earlier unjust labeling as a "foreign agent."
These actions are direct attempts to silence independent journalism in Russia. The authorities claim our work "discredits the decisions of the Russian leadership." We see things differently: we strive to provide accurate, unbiased reporting on Russia.
We, the journalists of The Moscow Times, refuse to be silenced. But to continue our work, we need your help.
Your support, no matter how small, makes a world of difference. If you can, please support us monthly starting from just $2. It's quick to set up, and every contribution makes a significant impact.
By supporting The Moscow Times, you're defending open, independent journalism in the face of repression. Thank you for standing with us.

Consumer prices rose 2.4% annually in January, less than expected

The cost of goods and services rose at a slower annual rate than expected in January, providing hope that the nagging U.S. inflation problem could be starting to ease.
The consumer price index for January accelerated 2.4% from the same time a year ago, down 0.3 percentage point from the prior month, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported Friday. That pulled the inflation rate down to where it was the month after President Donald Trump in April 2025 announced aggressive tariffs on U.S. imports.
Excluding food and energy, the core CPI was up 2.5%, the lowest level since April 2021. Economists surveyed by Dow Jones had been looking for an annual rate of 2.5% for both readings.
On a monthly basis, the all-items index was up a seasonally adjusted 0.2% while core gained 0.3%. The forecast had been 0.3% for both.
Though the category accounted for much of the CPI gain, shelter costs rose just 0.2% for the month, bringing the annual increase down to 3%. Shelter makes up more than one-third of the CPI.
Elsewhere, food prices increased 0.2% as five of the six major grocery group categories posted gains. Energy fell 1.5% while vehicle prices also were muted, with new vehicles up just 0.1% and used cars and trucks falling 1.8%. Airline fares jumped 6.5% while egg prices fell 7% and are now down 34% over the past year after a meteoric surge.
Stock market futures were little changed after the report while Treasury yields moved lower.
"This is great news on inflation," said Heather Long, chief economist at Navy Federal Credit Union. "Inflation fell to the lowest level since May and key items such as food, gas and rent are cooling off. This will provide much needed relief for middle class and moderate-income families."
The lower-than-expected reading helped boost the outlook for Federal Reserve interest rate cuts in the futures market. Traders raised the odds for a reduction in June to about 83%, according to the CME Group's FedWatch tool.
The report adds to a mixed economic picture.
At the macro level, the U.S. shrugged off a slow start in 2025 and has been barreling forward since, with fourth-quarter growth pegged at 3.7%, according to the latest update from the Atlanta Fed's GDPNow, a running tracker of incoming data.
But inflation has continued to hold above the Fed's 2% annual target even with generally contained energy prices. Moreover, Fed officials continue to express concern about the labor market, which added only 15,000 jobs a month last year. Consumer spending held up fairly well last year, though it was unexpectedly flat heading into the holiday season.
Economists had expected Trump's tariffs to spark inflation, but the impact has been largely tilted toward select goods rather than a broader impact.
"The tariffs have had a clear impact on products such as furniture and appliances, but the key items in many family budgets are cooling off," Long added.
With the conflicting economic signals, the Fed is widely expected to stay on hold until June after a rate-cutting cycle that saw three reductions in the latter part of 2025. The central bank faces shifting dynamics this year, with a rotating cast of regional presidents that seems titled toward a more aggressive posture on fighting inflation and a chair-designate, Kevin Warsh, who is likely to push for lower rates.
Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent on Friday told CNBC that he sees an "investment boom" acting as a tailwind while inflation gets back to the Fed's target "in the middle of this year."
"We've got to get away from this idea that growth automatically has to be tampered down, because growth, per se, is not inflationary." Bessent added. "It's growth that leaks into areas where there's not sufficient supply, and everything this administration is doing is creating more supply."
The January inflation report was delayed a few days because of the partial government shutdown.
The Fed does not use the CPI as its primary inflation measure. Instead, it more closely watches the Commerce Department's personal consumption expenditures price index, the December reading of which will be released Feb. 20.

Are teenagers too young to scroll? Europe weighs social media bans for minors

Worries that too much time on social media may be hurting children's mental health, and creating addictions as harmful as alcohol or cigarettes, are sparking growing calls across Europe to block minors under the age of 15 or 16 from access to platforms.
After Australia became the first country to block under-16s from platforms in December, a host of EU countries are poised to possibly follow suit.
France, Spain, Portugal and Greece are now weighing similar measures, driven by growing concerns over algorithms and the grip of Big Tech on young minds.
Supporters of tougher rules argue that the risks are no longer theoretical. Studies increasingly link heavy social media use among teenagers to anxiety, depression, addictive behaviour and, in extreme cases, suicide.

Governments insist they are stepping in where platforms have failed to protect children from systems designed to maximise screen time over well-being.
Marc Angel, a Luxembourgish MEP from the Socialists & Democrats group, and a member of the European Parliament's Intergroup on Children's Rights, is among the European lawmakers who backs a ban.
In our Talking Europe debate, Angel argues that the logic is simple: what is illegal offline should be illegal online.
He warns that today's dangers are no longer just in the street, but on the bedroom screens of smartphones and other devices. "When I was a kid, my parents told me not to let strangers into the house," he says. "Now the strangers are in the bedrooms of kids. And sometimes they aren't even real people."
But opponents of a blanket ban, such as Ana Vasconcelos, a Portuguese MEP with Renew Europe, consider it a blunt and ineffective tool. In a pointed retort to Angel, Vasconcelos argues that Europe risks over-correcting, prioritising symbolic action over workable solutions.
Vasconcelos warns that age-verification systems raise serious privacy issues, expose sensitive data to hacking, and are "very easy to circumvent." In her view, bans may create a false sense of safety while failing to address the real problem.
Instead, she argues for targeted measures: privacy-by-design on devices, phone-free spaces in schools, stronger media literacy, together with greater parental responsibility. For Vasconcelos, the challenge is not whether social media poses risks, but how to prepare young people to navigate a digital reality they cannot avoid.

The Turkish president spoke by phone on Friday with the Iraqi prime minister to discuss bilateral ties, as well as regional and global developments, according to Türkiye's Communications Directorate.
During the call with Mohammed Shia al-Sudani, Recep Tayyip Erdogan said Ankara would continue taking steps to strengthen relations with Iraq in multiple fields, particularly trade.
The Turkish president also emphasised that increasing cooperation in the fight against terrorism would benefit both countries.
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan’s April 2024 visit to Iraq marked a turning point in bilateral ties.
During the visit, 27 agreements and memoranda were signed in areas including security, trade, transboundary waters, agriculture, culture, and transport, strengthening the legal foundations of the bilateral partnership.
Significant progress has been achieved in institutionalising cooperation through the joint permanent committees established under the Strategic Framework Agreement for Joint Cooperation, one of the key documents signed during Erdogan’s visit.
In the period that followed, high-level political and technical contacts intensified further.
With Iraqi Prime Minister Mohammed Shia al-Sudani’s official visit to Türkiye in May 2025, the sixth meeting of the High-Level Strategic Cooperation Council was held, and 11 strategic documents were signed.

France Negotiating Withdrawal from Eurodrone Program

France is considering withdrawing from the European Eurodrone program and is already in talks with its partners—Germany, Spain, and Italy.
This was reported by Challenges, citing its own sources, as relayed by TipRanks.
The French authorities are increasingly describing this platform as too expensive and unsuitable for high-intensity warfare. The main reason for the change in position is said to be the aircraft’s inability to meet modern threats.
The Chief of Staff of the French Air and Space Force called the program “yesterday’s drone that we can get tomorrow.” This remark is related to another delay in the project’s implementation by approximately five years.
The Eurodrone (also known as MALE RPAS) is a joint project between Germany, France, Italy, and Spain to create the first large European reconnaissance and strike drone. Its main goal is to ensure Europe’s strategic independence from American MQ-9 Reaper and Israeli systems.
The program was officially launched in 2022, and its total cost is estimated at €7.1 billion. The deliveries of the medium-altitude, long-endurance surveillance drone are not expected until around 2030–2031.
The drone has a wingspan of 30 meters and a maximum take-off weight of about 11 tons, equipped with two turboprop engines. The aircraft is capable of staying in the air for more than 40 hours at altitudes of up to 13,700 meters, developing a cruising speed of about 500 km/h. Its payload is 2,300 kg.
The system is certified according to NATO standard STANAG 4671 and complies with civil aviation regulations. This will allow the drone to fly in non-segregated airspace without restrictions.
It should be noted that in October 2025, the project moved to the prototype production stage after successfully completing a critical design review.
The next stage will be ground tests to prepare the system for its first flight.
And in 2021, the European Union allocated a €100 million grant to Eurodrone to the OCCAR defense agency.
The funds were allocated as part of the European Defence Industry Development Program, an EU initiative aimed at developing the European Union’s defense industry.

San Francisco teachers, district reach deal after first strike in decades
San Francisco teachers who have been on strike over wages and family health benefits have reached a tentative agreement with the school district

San Francisco teachers who have been on strike over wages and family health benefits have reached a tentative agreement with the school district.
The San Francisco Unified School District says schools will reopen to staff Friday and to students Wednesday after two holidays.
The strike by about 6,000 public schoolteachers started Monday, marking the city’s first such walkout in nearly 50 years.
The San Francisco Unified School District had closed all 120 of its schools and said it would offer independent study to some of its 50,000 students.
Teachers joined picket lines after last-ditch negotiations failed to reach a new contract. They were demanding higher wages, more health benefits, and more resources for students with special needs.
The union and the district had been negotiating for nearly a year, with teachers demanding fully funded family health care, salary raises and the filling of vacant positions impacting special education and services.
The union asked for a 9% raise over two years, which would mean an additional $92 million per year for the district. They say that money could come from reserve funds that could be directed back to classrooms and school sites.
SFUSD, which faces a $100 million deficit and is under state oversight because of a long-standing financial crisis, rejected the idea. Officials countered with a 6% wage increase paid over three years. Su said the offer also includes bonuses for all employees if there is a surplus by the 2027-28 school year.
A report by a neutral fact-finding panel released last week recommended a compromise of a 6% increase over two years, largely siding with the district’s arguments that it is financially constrained.
The union said San Francisco teachers receive some of the lowest contributions to their health care costs in the Bay Area, pushing many to leave. Su said the district offered two options: the district paying 75% of family health coverage to the insurance provider Kaiser or offering an annual allowance of $24,000 for teachers to choose their health care plan.

No, Trump hasn't threatened a 250% tariff on Norway over Olympic gold medals

A viral claim that Trump is slapping heavy tariffs on Norwegian salmon because of the amount of Winter Olympic gold medals the country is winning is fabricated.
A post circulating on X claims that US President Donald Trump threatened to impose a 250% tariff on Norwegian salmon after accusing Norway of cheating at the Winter Olympics.
The post, which has amassed more than 1 million views on X, is based on an alleged screenshot taken from Trump's Truth Social account.
It accuses the Norwegian ski team of using a "classified" ski wax to gain a competitive advantage during the Milano Cortina Winter Olympics.
The post claims that these unfair advantages are funded via NATO money, given to Norway by the US. "Make skiing fair again," the post reads.
However, the post is not authentic.
There is no record of Trump publishing this statement on his Truth Social account or any of his other social media accounts. There is also no credible media outlet reporting that Trump is targeting Norwegian salmon with tariff threats.
Credible elements
Whilst the post itself is fake, it draws on real elements of elite skiing to appear credible.
Factors such as ski base structure and waxing can influence performance, especially in races decided by seconds. National teams invest heavily in research, testing and specialist technicians to gain an advantage.
A recent ban on fluorinated ski waxes due to environmental and health concerns has also resulted in teams rushing to develop alternatives. These are often kept confidential to preserve a competitive edge.
Athletes found to be using banned substances, such as fluorinated waxes, can be disqualified regardless of nationality.
There is no evidence that any Norwegian athlete has been disqualified yet for using banned waxes this Olympic season.
Two South Korean cross-country skiers have, however, been disqualified from the women's classic sprint at the 2026 Games, after their equipment tested positive for fluor.
NATO funding claim is fake
There is also no evidence that Norway diverts NATO defence funding into its skiing programme.
In June, Norway's Prime Minister Jonas Gahr Støre committed the country to spending at least 5% of its GDP on defence. This money is allocated to military personnel, weapons and equipment, along with defence and security-related civilian investment, such as crisis response and infrastructure that supports military operations.
Norway's Olympic programme is funded separately through civilian sports policy, not defence or NATO budgets.
A share of funding comes from gaming proceeds generated by state-owned lottery operator Norsk Tipping, with 64% of eligible proceeds allocated to sporting purposes, including a portion dedicated to the Norwegian Olympic and Paralympic Committee and Confederation of Sports.

Two men jailed for life over plot to attack Greater Manchester’s Jewish community

Two men have been jailed for life after attempting to stage one of the UK’s deadliest terrorist attacks before it was thwarted by an undercover operative.
Walid Saadaoui, 38, and Amar Hussein, 52, who had sworn allegiance to Islamic State (IS), planned a marauding firearms attack targeting Greater Manchester’s Jewish community.
On Friday, the pair were sentenced at Preston crown court after being found guilty of preparing acts of terrorism between December 2023 and May 2024.
The prime mover in the plot, Tunisian-born Saadaoui, of Abram, Wigan, was ordered to serve a minimum of 37 years.
Hussein, of no fixed address, was ordered to serve at least 26 years.
Saadaoui’s younger brother, Bilel Saadaoui, 37, of Hindley, Wigan, was sentenced to six years in prison for failing to disclose information about the plan.
All three had denied the offences in a trial lasting almost three months last year, in which jurors were told they were Islamist extremists with a “visceral dislike” of Jewish people.
Walid Saadaoui, a former Italian restaurant owner and hotel entertainer, arranged for the purchase and delivery of semi-automatic rifles, conducted reconnaissance and identified targets, but the man supplying them with the weapons was an undercover operative.
The operative, known to them as Farouk, had infiltrated jihadist social media networks and convinced Saadaoui that he was a fellow extremist.
Saadaoui was arrested in a counter-terror strike involving more than 200 officers as he attempted to take possession of two assault rifles, a semi-automatic pistol and almost 200 rounds of ammunition in the car park of the Last Drop hotel in Bolton on 8 May 2024. The weapons had been deactivated.
The court heard that Saadaoui hero-worshipped the IS terrorist Abdelhamid Abaaoud, who orchestrated the 2015 Paris terror attacks in which 130 people were killed and hundreds more injured in gun attacks.
Saadaoui and Hussein planned to disguise themselves as Jews and attack an antisemitism march in Manchester city centre before heading to suburbs north of Manchester city centre that are home to one of Europe’s largest Jewish communities.
Saadaoui, who used Facebook to disseminate IS propaganda and had been considering a lone knife attack for years, decided to escalate his plans after the outbreak of war in Gaza in October 2023. He recruited Hussein, a Bolton-based Kuwaiti national who is believed to have served in Saddam Hussein’s army, to assist his plans.
Believing Farouk would secure them guns, the pair travelled to Dover, Kent, in March 2024 to conduct surveillance on how a weapon could be smuggled through the port without detection.
On his return, Saadaoui travelled to Prestwich and Higher Broughton, north of Manchester, where he carried out reconnaissance on Jewish nurseries, schools, synagogues and shops. A safe house was also secured in Bolton for the storage of the weapons.
Sentencing, Mr Justice Wall told the defendants that if the plot had succeeded, it would “likely have been one of the deadliest terror attacks ever carried out on British soil”.
He said: “I am sure this would have led to the deaths of many people and serious injuries to many, many more.
“Your plan envisaged you and two others discharging AK-47s into a large crowd of marchers, who were unarmed and defenceless.
“One hundred and twenty bullets could have been discharged before any reloads were required. You planned to have spare magazines available.
“Your attack would have led to the deaths of people of all ages, including children.”
After the verdicts last year, the assistant chief constable of Greater Manchester police Robert Potts said the plot, “given the weaponry and ammunition involved, could potentially have been the deadliest terrorist attack in UK history”.
He added: “There was very real risk and danger for Farouk who undoubtedly saved lives. I cannot overemphasise his courage, bravery and professionalism in the role that he played.”
After the sentencing, the chief constable of Greater Manchester police, Sir Stephen Watson, said Jewish communities in the UK “put up with a way of life that nobody else has to put up with”.
He said Jews “have more justification to be fearful than anybody else”, which he said needed to be addressed. “We have seen the terrorist atrocity in Manchester at a synagogue on Yom Kippur,” Watson said. “We have seen the events on Bondi Beach in Sydney.
“We are seeing the manifestation of hatred moving beyond our shores globally and this is a threat to all of us. It is a threat to our Jewish communities and if our Jewish communities are under threat we are all under threat.”
Keir Starmer welcomed the life jail terms for the two men. Writing on X in response to the sentencing, the prime minister said: “I want to thank law enforcement for bringing these vile cowards to justice and reassure our Jewish community that we will never relent in our fight against antisemitism and terror.”

Sybiha informs Grossi in Munich about new Russian strikes, nuclear threat to Europe
Sybiha reported this on his X account, according to Ukrinform.
"I met with Rafael Grossi to inform [him] about Russia's reckless strikes on Ukraine's energy system that create risks for our nuclear objects and threaten nuclear and radiation safety of the entire Europe," the minister said.
He added that he informed Grossi about Ukraine's peace efforts, the country's position regarding the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant, and the need to counter threats caused by Russia.
Sybiha also recalled that Ukraine has proposed amendments to the IAEA Statute to develop effective mechanisms for limiting the rights and privileges of a member state recognized by the UN as an aggressor.
The foreign minister thanked the IAEA for its decision to expand the mandate of monitoring missions at Ukraine's nuclear facilities, for providing medical equipment and other assistance, and suggested expanding humanitarian cooperation.
As was earlier reported, dozens of drones have been detected in the observation zones of the Chornobyl and Rivne nuclear power plants, posing a direct threat to nuclear safety and security.

Putin believes the Cold War was World War III, a system war decided by exhaustion, infiltration, and fear. In 2026, he is trying to replay that playbook against NATO, using cyber sabotage, information warfare, energy coercion, and nuclear intimidation to slow Western decisions.
This video breaks down the hard data behind that toolkit: the US record on Russian influence operations, the $10B+ NotPetya damage estimate, the 2022 gas shock and power price spike mechanics, and the measurable surge in NATO and EU defense spending after Russia escalated.

The pattern is consistent: create pain in wallets and daily life, flood the information space, then force democracies into internal blame fights.
You will also see how these tools stack, because each crisis amplifies the next: distrust makes disruption feel bigger, and disruption makes compromise look tempting.
Sources referenced include US Senate Intelligence, US Department of Justice filings, NATO spending reports, the IEA, and EU Commission market reporting.
Ukraine is the front line, but Western cohesion is the center of gravity. If allies stay unified and speed decisions, the strategy fails. If allies fracture and delay, Putin buys time, and time is the resource he can still manufacture.

South Korean businesses remaining in Russia thriving — Russian envoy to Seoul

SEOUL, February 13. /TASS/. South Korean companies that have not left the Russian market, continue to earn "very good profits" in the country, Russian Ambassador to Seoul Georgy Zinovyev said.
"It's true that many large Korean manufacturers have left the market, but many not only remain but are actually making very good profits," he said at a meeting with reporters. This refers to representatives of the light industry, food and cosmetics manufacturers, including large corporations, the diplomat added. He also noted that South Korean companies were forced to cease operations in Russia due to export restrictions imposed by the government of the Republic of Korea.
"Automobile and electronics manufacturers were forced to leave because the South Korean government imposed anti-Russia sanctions on exports. The list of these restrictions currently consists of 1,402 items. They were unable to conduct their normal operations in Russia [due to these restrictions]," the ambassador explained, adding that the full return of such corporations to Russia is unlikely without the lifting of these sanctions.
"When they will be lifted is not a question for the Russian side," he said when asked to assess the prospects for South Korean companies to return to Russia after the conflict in Ukraine is resolved.
In the past, the Republic of Korea was an important trading partner for Russia: trade turnover between the countries approached $30 bln, Zinovyev said. "Last year, trade turnover stabilized at over $10 bln," he noted, adding that Russia remains attractive to foreign businesses because it has a large domestic market. At the same time, sanctions are often imposed quickly, but their lifting can take decades, as was the case with the Jackson-Vanik amendment in the United States, the diplomat stated.
The lifting of sanctions by Seoul could give South Korean companies the opportunity to participate in the reconstruction of new constituent entities of the Russian Federation affected during the special military operation. "This idea has a right to exist as the Republic of Korea is known for its expertise in construction," he concluded.

Sex, health, child abuse scandals threaten Orban re-election

Sex, health, child abuse scandals threaten Orban reelection
February 13, 2026Hungary is no stranger to extremely polarized election campaigns.
For decades now, Victor Orban has — whether in government or in the opposition — followed the same playbook: Starting months ahead of the polls, he has run campaigns that suggest the very survival of the Hungarian nation is at stake.
In these campaigns, he styles himself as the only one who can save Hungary and its people from evil and the threat of destruction at the hands of the country's enemies.
Hungary is due to elect a new parliament on April 12, and this time, the campaign is more negative than ever.
Nonsense and fabrications
Orban, his government and his party, Fidesz, have no qualms about papering the country with thousands upon thousands of anti-Ukrainian posters, using taxpayers' money to organize a "national petition" against the EU and Ukraine, and flooding social media with AI-generated fake videos about the opposition.
These videos all have one thing in common: They spread nonsense and fabrications. The prime minister and his team are essentially claiming that if Orban loses the election, the country will face war, mobilization on the Ukrainian front, and enslavement and mass impoverishment as a result of tax increases from Brussels.
In view of this particularly extreme campaign, Gabor Torok — an otherwise sober political scientist — has already spoken of the "decline and fall" of political culture.
Could Orban lose the election?
The reason for this downward spiral is quite simply the real possibility that Orban could lose power for the first time since 2010.
People have in general grown weary of what they see as the corrupt, arrogant and autocratic Orban system.
For months now, Peter Magyar and his opposition Tisza party have been clearly and consistently ahead in opinion polls.
At the same time, the prime minister and his government are struggling with the fallout from a number of self-inflicted public scandals that could all safely be filed under "Lies and double standards."
Child abuse scandal
The first of these scandals relates to serious violence and the sexual abuse of minors at a juvenile facility in Budapest. New aspects of the story have gradually been coming to light over the past few months.
The facility, which was more or less a brutal prison for young offenders, has since been closed. Leaked videos have shown shocking scenes of staff violence at the facility.
Government representatives apparently knew about conditions in the facility for quite some time, but did nothing, even though child protection — coupled with homophobia — is a major theme for Orban's government. Indeed, the government likes to claim that it is protecting Hungarian children against "Brussels' LGBTQ+ propaganda" and the supposed abuse that this will lead to.
Orban and some members of his government and party also seemed to suggest a few weeks ago that the victims themselves were responsible by pointing out that they were criminals.
In doing so, they seemed to imply that civic and human rights could be revoked at will. This was greeted with even greater opposition from some parts of Hungarian society.
Ignoring health hazards at a battery plant
Earlier this week, Hungary was rocked by revelations about environmental and health hazards at a Samsung battery plant in God, a town north of Budapest.
According to research conducted by the Hungarian news site Telex.hu, staff at the factory have for years been exposed to poisonous heavy metal particles, and this dust was emitted into the air, the soil and the groundwater. Documents show that levels were in some cases over 500 times higher than permissible limits.
The Hungarian government was apparently aware of this. It is claimed that even the Hungarian domestic intelligence agency AH warned the government of the catastrophic situation. Nevertheless, it is reported that Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto stopped the closure of the plant.
There are also reports that when the anti-corruption website Atlatszo.hu first wrote about the matter in early 2024, the government considered how best to silence the site.
The story is so explosive because Orban's government has for years been pushing the massive development of battery production in Hungary and sees it as a pillar of the country's forward-looking economic and technology policy.
To this end, Chinese and South Korean investors were brought in. Despite numerous local protests, court cases and concerns voiced by experts, the government repeatedly moved ahead with its plans.
Scandal about a possible sex video
And then there is the story of a supposed sex video involving opposition leader Peter Magyar, which has the Hungarian public on tenterhooks.
A few days ago, a black-and-white photo of an unmade bed in a bedroom appeared on a mysterious website named after — but not belonging to — Tisza's deputy leader Mark Radnai. The image was taken from the perspective of what would appear to be a security camera.
After days of speculation, Magyar himself posted a Facebook video about the photo on February 12. In it, he said that he had had "consensual sex" with a former girlfriend in that room on August 3, 2024. He also said that there had been drugs on a table in the apartment, but that he had not taken any.
Magyar initially accused the woman in question of having filmed him in this situation on behalf of Orban's government and Fidesz and said the whole thing was a "Russian-style campaign" to deflect attention from the "death factory" in God.
Soon after, his ex-girlfriend told Hungarian media that she had known nothing of the matter and suggested to Magyar that if such a video was published, they could bring charges together.
Fidesz no longer dominant
To date, neither Orban nor any other member of the government or Fidesz has made any concrete statements as to whether the publication of a sex video involving Magyar was planned.
By addressing the matter head on, however, Magyar has put the powers that be on the back foot, indirectly showing them to be willing — out of fear of losing power — to stoop to primitive methods such as the publication of a sex video in order to divert attention from other scandals.
In an interview with "Campaign Noise Filter," a program by DW's Hungarian Service, political scientist Daniel Mikecz said that such scandals are ramping up the pressure on the Orban government.
"Before one scandal has blown over, a new one arrives," he said, adding that "Fidesz used to say that it had to dominate and win every day. Now we are seeing that they have to react to something every day. There is no more talk of domination."

What will upcoming inflation figures mean for interest rates in the UK?
Most experts predict inflation fell back sharply to 3% in January from 3.4% in December.
- Bookmark
Inflation is expected to have fallen back to its lowest level for nearly a year in Wednesday’s official figures for January, in a boost to interest rate cut hopes.
Most economists are forecasting Office for National Statistics (ONS) data to show Consumer Prices Index (CPI) inflation fell back sharply to 3% in January from 3.4% in December, according to Pantheon Macroeconomics.
This would be the lowest level since March 2025.
It is set to come on the back of lower airfares, food and energy price inflation in January.
The figures are likely to reinforce expectations of another interest rate cut, possibly as soon as next month.
Disappointing growth figures for the final quarter of last year have added to forecasts for a rate cut in March, to 3.5% from 3.75% currently.
The ONS said gross domestic product (GDP) eked of meagre growth of 0.1% in the fourth quarter of 2025, leaving the out-turn for the year as a whole at a worse-than-expected 1.3% expansion.
But Bank of England chief economist Huw Pill said at a Santander event on Friday that he thought rates were already “a little bit too low”, suggesting he would not be among those voting for a reduction next month.
Mr Pill voted as part of the 5-4 majority on the Bank’s Monetary Policy Committee to keep interest rates on hold at 3.75% earlier this month.
The Bank is forecasting that inflation will fall to its 2% target by the middle of the year, as measures announced in the Chancellor’s autumn budget will help to slow inflation, particularly a package of support to bring down household energy bills from April.
For the latest data, Pantheon is expecting a steep drop “as energy, airfares, education and food price inflation all slow”.
Pantheon experts said airfares are set to have dropped by nearly a quarter last month, having soared in December as increased demand for travel over the festive period fuelled price hikes.
Though it believes inflation will be 3% – a touch higher than the Bank of England’s 2.9% prediction.
Investec Economics economist Ellie Henderson said food price growth is also likely to have dropped to 4.2%, below November’s level, but warned there was a risk that food inflation was still a “key concern”.
She added that inflation may also be pushed lower by VAT on private school fees falling out of the annual comparison, as well as “some heavier discounting than usual by retailers”.
She said: “An additional small source of downward pressure on the annual rate looks to have come from utility prices.
“There was a near-5% rise in electricity prices on the month as per the energy price cap, but this was countered by a fall in gas prices.
“In total, the energy price cap increased by just 0.2% in January, smaller than the 1.2% increase in January 2025.”
The inflation figures come in a busy week for official UK economic statistics, with data for unemployment and wages on Tuesday and government borrowing and retail figures on Friday.

UNSC not working as intended: EU's Kallas

EU foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas has said the UN Security Council "is not working the way it was meant to be," arguing that the body fails to reflect the realities of today's world and lacks effective accountability mechanisms.
Speaking at a panel during the Munich Security Conference on Friday, Kallas said the current global order must be reformed to ensure that no country is above international law.
She said that major international crises have historically led to the development of international cooperation, but argued that what is currently missing is accountability.
"Everybody signs up to the United Nations Charter; the principles are there. But what happens if somebody breaches those principles? The accountability is clearly not working," Kallas said.
"The (UN) Security Council is not working the way it was meant to be. The United Nations is not reflecting the world as it currently is," she added.
"If we reform, then we should actually take into account the world as it currently is, where all the states are equal, and also that nobody is above the law," Kallas said, emphasising that even the "most powerful countries" must face consequences if they violate agreed rules.
German Chancellor Friedrich Merz also warned that the rules-based international order no longer exists as it once did and announced proposals to address challenges in an increasingly fractured world.
In a keynote speech at the Munich Security Conference, Merz said the world has entered a dangerous period of great power rivalries, with a growing number of wars and conflicts threatening global peace and security.
Different rules
In response to a question about repeated ceasefire violations by Israel in Gaza and who would hold it accountable, Kallas reiterated her call for the equal application of international law.
While she acknowledged that powerful states have often operated by different rules, she argued that cooperation, not dominance, ultimately ensures strength.
"But even in the jungle, you know, animals cooperate, and so you are better off when you work with others," she said.
Drawing a comparison between major powers, Kallas noted that when Russia wages war, it does so largely alone due to a lack of allies.
"When America goes to wars, you know, then a lot of us go with you, and we lose our people on the way. So, that means that you also need us to be this superpower," she added.

António Costa dials back two-speed Europe debate, says it's a 'non-issue'

"Enhanced cooperation is not an issue," António Costa dials back two-speed Europe debate, saying unity among member states will prevail.
António Costa, the president of the European Council, watered down expectations of a two-speed Europe as a magic bullet to break the impasse on economic reforms, a day after the proposal came to the fore in an informal summit of EU leaders.
"It's a non-issue," Costa said on Friday in a press briefing attended by Euronews.
Several countries, including France, Spain and Denmark, expressed support for using enhanced cooperation to create smaller groups of member states willing to adopt initiatives that could not otherwise be approved due to a lack of consensus.
Enhanced cooperation rose to prominence in December after EU leaders decided to issue a €90 billion loan to Ukraine without the participation of Hungary, Slovakia and the Czech Republic. The legal tool has also been applied in the past in limited cases, as the bloc's functioning is based on consensus-driven decisions.
A shift would indicate leaders now favour speed over unanimity.
"Enhanced cooperation is not an issue. It doesn't matter. And nobody discussed this in the room," Costa said. "We already have different formats in the Union. Some member states are part of Schengen, others are part of the eurozone."
His comments contrast with the approach outlined by Ursula von der Leyen, the president of the European Commission, during the summit's closing press conference.
Von der Leyen highlighted two legislative files for which the legal tool could be considered: the first phase of the Savings and Investment Union, which aims to mobilise dormant private savings into strategic projects, and the 28th regime, which aims to establish a uniform framework to set up companies across the bloc.
Enhanced cooperation for the Savings and Investment Union might be triggered as early as June if "no sufficient progress" is achieved by capitals, she said.
"Often we move forward with the speed of the slowest, and the enhanced cooperation avoids that," von der Leyen told reporters on Thursday evening.
French President Emmanuel Macron went a step further, saying the European economy needs a new agenda agreed at 27 or through smaller coalitions by the summer.
"What we decided today is that between now and June, we will have to finalise the agenda," Macron said. "If in June we don’t have concrete prospects and concrete progress, we will continue with enhanced cooperation."
Council chief bets EU unity is still possible
Still, Costa sought to temper expectations that the EU would radically change the way it operates in the name of speed, suggesting that the necessary unity will eventually materialise over a two-speed Europe where some advance and others do not.
Costa said countries have "doubts" about the "scope" of the 28th regime, which is still to be formally presented, but that there is a "broad" agreement on its need to be adopted to allow entrepreneurs to overcome 27 different corporate regimes.
On the Savings and Investment Union, he noted, there is only one country that still has reservations about the proposal to centralise financial oversight in the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) in Paris.
The country, which Costa did not name, is widely believed to be Luxembourg, which has long argued that the supranational integration of capital markets would produce excessive regulation, raise costs for businesses and fail to unlock fresh funding.
"I haven't seen any good proposals for this so far," Luxembourgish Prime Minister Luc Frieden said at Thursday's summit.
Ireland, Malta and Cyprus, small countries with important financial sectors, had also voiced reservations in the past, but they are now considered to be on board.
"My feeling is that it will be possible to move forward without enhanced cooperation. If it is needed, then okay, no problem," Costa said.
"Some leaders use this to put pressure on other leaders and basically convince one of the founding members of the European Union that he should not be out of the Savings and Investment Union."
Reflecting on the informal summit, which yielded a tentative commitment to complete the single market by the end of 2027, Costa underscored the "sense of urgency" shared by member states beyond "ideological" debates.
"Everybody understands that we are under pressure from outside because the international rules-based border is under threat, that some economic agents and countries are promoting unfair competition and that we need to act to promote prosperity but also to increase our own security," he said.

White House files new lawsuit against Harvard University
- The Justice Department has launched a new lawsuit against Harvard University, alleging its failure to cooperate with a federal investigation and provide documents regarding its admissions procedures.
- The legal action, filed in a Boston federal court, seeks documents crucial for evaluating Harvard's adherence to a 2023 Supreme Court ruling that deemed race-conscious college admissions programmes unconstitutional.
- The Justice Department clarified that the lawsuit was initiated solely to compel Harvard to produce documents and does not accuse the university of discriminatory conduct or seek monetary damages or federal funding revocation.
- This lawsuit is part of a wider campaign by Trump's administration to use federal funding as leverage to enforce changes at US universities, which it claims are plagued by antisemitic and 'radical left' ideologies.
- Previously, Trump's administration cancelled hundreds of grants to Harvard researchers, citing the university's alleged failure to address harassment of Jewish students, which prompted Harvard to launch its own lawsuit last year.

EU must build partnerships with Türkiye, Brazil, India: Germany's Merz

The European Union (EU) must forge partnerships with countries like Türkiye, India and Brazil to address global challenges, German Chancellor Friedrich Merz said.
Speaking at the Munich Security Conference on Friday, Merz said closer integration among EU members and ties with the United States, while important, are no longer sufficient to address today's economic and security challenges.
"We need to establish a strong network of global partnerships," Merz said. "Canada and Japan, Türkiye, India, and Brazil will play a key role in this, as will South Africa, the Gulf States, and others."
The conservative leader emphasised that the EU should strengthen cooperation with these nations based on mutual respect and a long-term perspective, focusing on shared concerns.
"This would avoid dependencies and risks and, at the same time, open up opportunities and possibilities for both sides," Merz said.
We share a fundamental interest in a political order in which we can trust agreements and in which we are able to tackle global problems together."
Ukraine
Merz also said he was "ready to talk" with Russian leaders but maintained that Russia is not yet prepared for "serious" peace talks with Ukraine.
"If it makes sense to talk, we are willing to talk," Merz said.
"But as you can see with the American side, Russia is not yet willing to talk seriously."
"This war will only end when Russia is at least economically, [and] potentially militarily, exhausted. We're approaching this time," Merz said.
"But we are not yet there. Russia has to give up this war against Ukraine, and we have to do everything that is needed to bring them to the point where they see no further advantages for them to continue this terrible war," he added.
"We are not yet there."

Canada school shooter may have been looking to ‘finish off’ family by hunting younger siblings at school: witness
Before opening fire at the school, the suspect allegedly shot and killed her mother and step-brother
- Bookmark
- CommentsGo to comments
The teenager who carried out a mass shooting in British Columbia, Canada, may have intended to “finish off” her siblings, a witness said.
On Tuesday, the suspect, 18-year-old Jesse Van Rootselaar, allegedly shot her mother and step-brother before entering a secondary school in Tumbler Ridge, a small mining town at the base of the Rocky Mountains.
Inside the school, Van Rootselaar — who was transgender and used she/her pronouns, police said — allegedly opened fire, killing five students and a teacher before taking her own life.
Duncan McKay, a 17-year-old, was inside the school when he took cover after hearing shots ring out, he told The Telegraph. McKay didn’t personally know the suspect, but noted that Van Rootselaar’s younger brother and sister were fellow students — and that the brother was in school when gunfire erupted.
“I am positive he went to finish off his family,” he said, referring to the suspect.
Another Tumbler Ridge resident reported hearing the same claims, though they could not corroborate them, the newspaper reported.
Canadian police, however, have yet to reveal what spurred the attack.
“We don’t have an idea yet as to motive,” Deputy Commissioner Dwayne McDonald of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police said at a press conference on Wednesday. “It is something that we are certainly passionately pursuing, but it would be too early to speculate on motive at this time.”
There is no indication that Van Rootselaar had been bullied, he said, noting that she dropped out of school in Tumbler Ridge four years ago.
Police described the suspect as “a very quiet child” who didn’t have “much enthusiasm for anything,” according to the CBC.
Prior to the attack, Van Rootselaar had been visited by police several times in recent years due to mental health issues and she used to have a firearm license, officials said.
The victims at the school were not Van Rootselaar’s relatives. On Thursday, police identified those killed at the school as Abel Mwansa, 12, Kylie Smith, 12, Ezekiel Schofield, 13, Zoey Benoit, 12, Ticaria Lampert, 12 and teacher Shannda Aviugana-Durand, 39. Two other children were left injured with gunshot wounds.
Families of the victims have issued emotional statements, recounting memories of their loved ones.
“Seeing your child murdered at this age is heartbreaking,” the father of one of the victims wrote in a Facebook post yesterday. “I was broken when I saw you packed in that BLACK BAG lifeless and zipped up like those we see in movies…”
“Seeing you leave the house with that beautiful smile while going to Tumbler Ridge High School was so refreshing,” he added. “I saw a bright future, a leader an engineer also a scientist in you.”
The mother of one of the hospitalized victims said in a post on Thursday that her daughter — who was shot in the head — showed signs of improvement.
“Keep up the positive vibes…We need to know this isn’t it,” she wrote in a Facebook post, adding “Fight hard baby.”
Officials in British Columbia declared yesterday a day of mourning across the province, and Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney is set to visit the remote town of Tumbler Ridge Friday.
“Parents, grandparents, sisters, brothers in Tumbler Ridge will wake up without someone they love,” Carney told reporters in an emotional moment. “The nation mourns with you. Canada stands by you.”

Leaders are gathering at the Munich Security Conference as transatlantic relations remain under close scrutiny. This year, the United States is represented by Marco Rubio, whose early remarks suggest a more conciliatory and cooperative tone toward European allies. That contrasts with the impact of last year’s speech by JD Vance, which strongly criticised EU policies and unsettled European leaders. In their statements, European leaders are showing a willingness to rebuild transatlantic relations, as analysed by our journalist Kethevane Gorjestani.

Iran releases on bail three reformists arrested after protests
Iranian authorities have released on bail three senior reformist figures who were arrested in recent days following anti-government protests in January, local media reported.
Azar Mansouri, head of the Reformist Front, "was released from prison a few minutes ago after posting bail", her lawyer Hojjat Kermani told the ISNA news agency less than a week after her arrest.
Kermani previously expressed hope in an interview with ISNA published on Thursday evening that the release of Azar Mansouri, head of the Reform Front since 2023 could come "in the next few days when her arrest warrant is revoked".
Mansouri, 60, an adviser to reformist former president Mohammad Khatami, was arrested on Sunday alongside two other reformists.
"Javad Emam and Ebrahim Asgharzadeh were released a few minutes ago after posting bail," Kermani also told ISNA news agency in the interview published on Thursday.
Asgharzadeh is a former member of parliament and Emam is the spokesman of the Reformist Front, the main coalition of the reformist camp.
They were accused of "undermining national unity" and "coordinating with enemy propaganda," the Fars news agency reported at the time of their arrests.
Reformists traditionally call for more social freedoms and the establishment of a civil society and backed current president Masoud Pezeshkian during his 2024 campaign.
The arrests come weeks after deadly protests erupted across the country, in which thousands of people died and many more were more arrested.
In 2009, Emam was one of the campaign managers for Mir Hossein Mousavi, a leading figure in the Iranian opposition and former prime minister, who has been under house arrest since 2011.

UK painkiller shortage could last for months, pharmacies warn
- UK pharmacies are facing a significant shortage of certain strengths of the painkiller co-codamol, specifically 30mg and 500mg tablets.
- The National Pharmacy Association (NPA) has warned that these supply disruptions are expected to continue until at least the end of June.
- The shortage is causing distress for patients living with severe pain, with pharmacists working to manage limited stock and find safe alternatives.
- Co-codamol, a combination of paracetamol and codeine, is a commonly prescribed painkiller, with around 1.25 million items dispensed monthly in 2025.
- The NPA attributes the issues to growing medicine supply problems and insufficient NHS funding for the full cost of medicines, urging government intervention.

Türkiye on Friday welcomed the parliamentary elections and referendum on reforms, including constitutional amendments, in Bangladesh, saying they were conducted “in a peaceful manner.”
“We hope that the results of the elections and the referendum, which observers from Türkiye also monitored, will contribute to democracy, stability and prosperity in Bangladesh,” the Foreign Ministry said in a statement.
Türkiye also reaffirmed its commitment to further developing relations with the South Asian country in every field in the period ahead.
Bangladesh held general elections on Thursday, the first since the 2024 popular uprising that ousted the government of former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina.

A Ukrainian court has sentenced a 19-year-old woman, the daughter of a priest in eastern Ukraine, to 15 years in prison after convicting her of spying for Russia’s Federal Security Service (FSB), according to Ukrainian prosecutors.
CNN reported on Wednesday, Feb. 11, that Hrystyna Garkavenko livestreamed a road used by Ukrainian troops from inside her father’s church in Pokrovsk about Ukrainian military positions in Pokrovsk, Donetsk region, to a Russian intelligence agent. She is currently serving her sentence in a penal colony.

Prosecutors said Garkavenko livestreamed a road used by Ukrainian troops and transmitted geolocation data about military personnel and equipment to the FSB throughout 2024. She pleaded guilty in June and expressed remorse.
According to Pavlo Uhrovetsky, head of the Donetsk Regional Prosecutor’s Office, the young woman developed more than a friendly relationship with the Russian agent who recruited her. In a phone interview from prison, Garkavenko told CNN she initially agreed to cooperate because she wanted to continue communicating with the agent. She declined to clarify whether their relationship was romantic.
The Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) has opened more than 3,800 treason investigations since the start of Russia’s full-scale invasion in February 2022, CNN reported, citing Ukrainian officials. More than 1,200 individuals have been convicted.

On average, those found guilty face 12 to 13 years in prison, though some receive life sentences.
Officials say Russian intelligence agencies frequently recruit Ukrainians through Telegram channels, often targeting unemployed individuals or those struggling with addiction. Initial tasks are described as minor before escalating to photographing military facilities or installing surveillance equipment.
Defense Ministry adviser Serhiy Beskrestnov also warned that Russian operatives have attempted to recruit Ukrainians to register Starlink satellite terminals for use by Russian forces, offering payments of about $300.
In her interview with CNN, Garkavenko said she hopes to be exchanged and relocate to Russia, where she has relatives. Prosecutors said some convicted collaborators believe they may be swapped for Ukrainian prisoners held by Russia.
Her father remains in Ukraine. According to CNN, he was shocked upon learning of her actions but has continued to support her.
Garkavenko said she regrets her actions. “I hurt my loved ones and, to some extent, ruined my own life,” she told CNN.

Why Pope Leo keeps issuing stark warnings about using AI
- Pope Leo XIV has expressed growing concern about Artificial Intelligence, warning it could alter human civilisation, invade intimacy, and diminish our ability to understand meaning.
- Catholic thinkers are particularly worried that AI's ability to remove “friction” and effort could lead to human isolation and a loss of essential human experiences and relationships.
- The Church is actively engaging with AI, learning from past experiences with social media, and focusing on the technology's impact on consciousness and potential for idolatry.
- While some believe Catholicism's embodied rituals will safeguard it, others fear AI's convenience could tempt people to replace traditional spiritual practices and community engagement.
- Despite acknowledging significant risks and potential negative consequences, there remains a hope among some Catholic figures that Christianity's inherent resilience and human wisdom will help navigate the challenges posed by AI.

MOSCOW, February 13. /TASS/. Hungary increased its purchases of Russian pipeline gas by 8% in value terms in 2025, becoming the leader in terms of this indicator among EU countries, according to Eurostat data and TASS calculations.
The European Union imported 407 mln euros worth of Russian pipeline gas in December 2025. As of today, the TurkStream gas pipeline remains the only active route for Russian gas supplies to Europe.
Hungary (199 mln euros), Greece (76 mln euros), and Bulgaria (72 mln euros) remain the top purchasers. Slovakia paid 43 mln euros for gas, while Italy paid 16.5 mln euros.
In total, the European Union paid 5.8 bln euros for Russian pipeline gas in 2025 compared to 7.6 bln euros in the previous year. The main buyers were Hungary (2.8 bln euros), which increased purchases by 8.2%, Greece (1.3 bln euros), Bulgaria (884 mln euros), and Slovakia (600 mln euros).
TASS reported earlier that Russia exported a record 18 bln cubic meters of gas to Europe via the TurkStream pipeline in 2025.

Norwegian biathlete who confessed to cheating on girlfriend wins second bronze medal at Winter Olympics
Strula Holm Laegreid of Norway won a bronze medal at the Milan Cortina Olympics on Friday in the men's sprint biathlon race — three days after making an unexpected confession during a post-race interview.
Laegreid also won bronze in the 20-kilometer individual race on Tuesday, and revealed in a live broadcast that he had been unfaithful to his girlfriend and hoped to win her back. He said he had confessed the infidelity a week before his win and that she broke up with him.
"I told her a week ago. And it's been the worst week of my life," NBC reported Laegreid as saying, citing Norwegian Broadcasting Corp. "I had a gold medal in life, and there's probably a lot of people out there who look at me differently now, but I only have eyes for her. Sports has taken a bit of a back seat these past couple of days. Yeah, I wish I could share this with her."
Laegreid said he regretted his behavior "with all (his) heart" and accepted "the consequences of what (he'd) done," but hoped if he "put it all on the table," his ex-girlfriend would take him back. Local media reported that his ex-girlfriend, who remains unidentified, was not happy with the display.
"I did not choose to be in this position, and it hurts to have to be in it," local media reported her as saying, according to CBS Sports. "We have had contact, and he is aware of my positions on this."
His tearful confession was criticized by some who said it took the focus away from teammate Johan-Olav Botn, who won the gold medal in that event.
On Wednesday, Laegreid said in a statement issued by the Norwegian team that he deeply regretted "sharing this personal story on what was a day of celebration for Norwegian biathlon."
Quentin Fillon Maillet of France won Friday's sprint race — his second gold of the Milan Cortina Games after the mixed relay — and Vetle Sjaastad Christiansen of Norway took silver.

Naomi Watts ignites divisive debate with Jackie Kennedy portrayal in Love Story
New Ryan Murphy series centers on the tragic romance between JFK Jr. and Carolyn Bessette
- Bookmark
- CommentsGo to comments
Naomi Watts’s portrayal of Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis in the debut season of Ryan Murphy’s new anthology series, Love Story, has sparked heated debate among viewers, with some arguing her performance leaves much to be desired while others are touting it as Emmy-worthy.
Love Story: John F. Kennedy Jr & Carolyn Bessette, which premiered its first three episodes Thursday on Hulu and Disney+, centers on the whirlwind romance and high-profile relationship between the attorney and his publicist wife before their tragic deaths in 1999. It features Paul Anthony Kelly as JFK Jr., Sarah Pidgeon as Carolyn Bessette, Grace Gummer as Caroline Kennedy, and Watts as former First Lady Jackie Kennedy.
Watts, slated to appear in all eight episodes, left critics and viewers in stark disagreement over her vocal impressions of the former first lady.
The Guardian’s Lucy Mangan declared Watts’s performance and vocal impressions were “truly terrible” in a two-star review.
Others shared opinions similar to Mangan’s. “The series’ biggest disappointment was Naomi Watts. She did a horrible Jackie Kennedy. Very bad. I had to look away,” one person wrote on X, with a second adding that it was “unsettling.”
“I’m here for Naomi Watts doing an awful Jackie Kennedy impression on Love Story,” a third said, as a fourth insisted: “I need a minute to adjust to Naomi Watts as Jacqueline Kennedy.”
However, others said that her casting was not what they expected but still argued, “I think it could work.”
Lacy Baugher Milas of the AV Club found it to be “another outstanding performance” from the Mulholland Drive star.
“I think Naomi Watts is a very good Jackie Kennedy,” someone else opined on X. “I really enjoy her interpretation.”
“Naomi Watts is EATING these Jackie Kennedy monologues,” a second echoed, while a third added: “Naomi Watts sounds just like his mother. The comparison stops there but she has the voice down sure.”
A fourth went as far as to predict that she “could secure her 1st win for playing the iconic Jackie Kennedy (Love Story). This could be her 1st (!) major award across ALL mediums.”
This marks the fourth collaboration between Watts, 57, and Murphy. The British actor has previously starred in his 2022 Netflix thriller The Watcher, his limited 2024 series Feud: Capote vs. The Swans and his latest, heavily derided legal drama All’s Fair.
The nine-episode limited series has faced controversy and backlash from many people, who feel Murphy’s dramatized adaptation of JFK Jr. and Bessette’s highly publicized relationship and their untimely deaths in a horrific plane crash is disrespectful.
JFK Jr.’s nephew, Jack Schlossberg, initially slammed the series in a statement, saying: “Lately, my news feed has been filled with pictures of my uncle, John F. Kennedy Jr., a great man. For those wondering whether his family was ever consulted, or has anything to do with the new show being made about him, the answer is no, and there’s really not much we can do.”
Schlossberg then added his concern that Murphy was “profiting off of it in a grotesque way.”
Murphy responded to Schlossberg’s comment at the time by saying, “I thought it was an odd choice to be mad about your relative that you really don’t remember.”
The first three episodes of Love Story: John F. Kennedy Jr & Carolyn Bessette are now streaming on Hulu and Disney+. New episodes will be released weekly on Thursdays through March 26.

Israel’s West Bank annexation, the RSF’s new camp in Ethiopia, and a Myanmar media storm: The Cheat Sheet

Our editors’ weekly take on humanitarian news, trends, and developments from around the globe.
On our radar
Israel moves closer to de facto West Bank annexation
Israel’s security cabinet approved a new set of measures on 8 February, further consolidating its control over the occupied West Bank. Israel’s nearly six-decade occupation of the Palestinian Territories, including the West Bank, East Jerusalem, and the Gaza Strip, is illegal, according to the International Court of Justice. But Israeli ministers made no secret about their intentions following the approval. Energy Minister Eli Cohen said the move would establish “de facto sovereignty” and “actually establish a fact on the ground that there will not be a Palestinian state”. Far-right Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich, who lives in an illegal Israeli settlement in the West Bank, said the move would make it easier for Jewish settlers to force Palestinians off their land and to “continue to bury the idea of a Palestinian state”. The adoption of the measures has drawn international condemnation. Already this year, almost 700 Palestinians in different parts of the West Bank have been forced off their land by attacks by Israeli settlers. Israeli authorities have also been issuing demolition orders and evicting people from their homes in occupied East Jerusalem.
Has the UAE paid for an RSF training camp in Ethiopia?
The United Arab Emirates has reportedly financed the construction of a military camp in Ethiopia’s Benishangul-Gumuz region to train thousands of fighters for the Rapid Support Forces operating across the border in Sudan. An investigation by Reuters, citing 15 sources and supporting documents, says 4,300 recruits – mainly Ethiopians but also citizens of Sudan and South Sudan – are undergoing military training there, while upgrades to a nearby airport may be linked to supplying RSF operations. Benishangul-Gumuz borders Sudan’s Blue Nile state, where the RSF has opened a new front against the Sudanese army in the civil war that began in 2023 and has produced the world’s largest humanitarian crisis. Abu Dhabi’s support network for the RSF has drawn in countries such as Chad and Libya, as well as Somalia’s semi-autonomous Puntland region, though recent tensions with fellow Gulf heavyweight Saudi Arabia appear to be complicating these supply routes. Ethiopia is a key UAE partner in the Horn of Africa and received extensive Emirati backing during its war against Tigrayan forces between 2020 and 2022.
Almost half a billion people vote in Asia
More than 474 million people have gone to the polls across the Asian continent over the past two weeks. Bangladesh saw its first election since the ouster last year by a Gen Z uprising of long-time autocratic prime minister Sheikh Hasina. The centre-right Bangladesh Nationalist Party was projected to win a landslide majority: 212 of the 300 constituency seats. Narendra Modi and Shehbaz Sharif of India and Pakistan respectively sent their congratulations to BNP leader Tarique Rahman – the child of a former prime minister (like Hasina) who has returned after 17 years of self-imposed exile. In neighbouring Myanmar, the military-led government’s elections saw critics accusing the junta of conducting an orchestrated farce, with the military-backed Union Solidarity and Development Party securing clear majorities in both houses. There were also reports of alleged election violence by both the military government and armed opposition groups. In Japan, the party of the country’s first female prime minister won a super majority, with 351 of 456 seats. Thailand, meanwhile, saw the conservative Bhumjaithai Party of Prime Minister Anutin Charnvirakul winning but falling short of a clear majority. An expected “orange wave” of support for young candidates did not come to pass.
Misogyny and the Musevenis
The Pan-African Progressive Leaders Solidarity Network, a rights group led by Kenyan opposition politician Martha Karua, has penned an open letter to Uganda’s first family condemning atrocities against the country’s women following January's elections. Among many incidents of abuse and sexual intimidation the letter details is an assault on Barbara Kyagulanyi, the wife of President Yoweri Museveni’s main challenger in the election, Robert Kyagulanyi (AKA Bobi Wine). The letter criticises the president’s son, General Muhoozi Kainerugaba, who also heads the country’s military for misogynistic online conduct that emboldens subordinates to treat women with similar contempt, and appeals to First Lady Janet Museveni, who also serves as the Minister of Education and Sports, to break her silence. The letter was published a day after Museveni decorated his son with the Kabalega Star – Uganda's second-highest military honour – praising the army for maintaining security during elections despite allegations of involvement in intimidation, ballot-stuffing, and abductions of opposition supporters. The family has consolidated its stranglehold on power and Muhoozi is being groomed to replace his father as president, with some referring to him as the “standby generator”.
African countries push back against Russian military recruitment
Facing a manpower shortage in its war with Ukraine, Russia is increasingly turning to recruitment networks in the Global South – especially Africa – to help fill its ranks. Fast-track visas, the promise of good salaries as well as citizenship are the lures, in contrast to the official immigration hostility in the rest of Europe. But the problem is surviving the front line. In a report released this week, the investigative collective INPACT obtained a single list of 1,417 Africans hired by Russia (Egypt, Cameroon, and Ghana provided the most recruits) and found a death rate of over 20%. Those killed lasted an average of just six months. There are also reports of racism and brutality. While many young men volunteer, others are duped, promised work or scholarships, but are then forcibly enlisted. Kenya and South Africa are two countries that have complained. Nairobi wants a ban on the conscription of Kenyans, while South Africa said Moscow had agreed to the return of 17 men tricked into serving in Ukraine’s Donbas region.

Investigation reveals Frontier Myanmar’s military intelligence ties
An investigation by Myanmar Now into two other news outlets’ alleged military ties has ignited controversy in the country’s exile media scene. The investigation found that The Myanmar Times (now inactive) and Frontier Myanmar (still active) have their roots in an alleged propaganda apparatus designed in the 2000s by a military intelligence official to shape the image of the country’s previous junta abroad. Frontier promptly issued a response, rejecting the accusations as baseless and defending the outlet’s record of investigative reporting and editorial independence. One Myanmar-watcher pointed out that the investigation did not question the credibility of much of Frontier’s journalism, including its coverage of the Rohingya genocide, but explained how “media capture” exploits credible journalism to benefit corporate or state interests. The same person also noted that Frontier’s rebuttal did not engage with much of the evidence Myanmar Now produced, including apparent links between Frontier’s former owners and a military equipment supplier, and a slew of Frontier advertorials promoting businesses linked to one of its owners. Others have criticised Frontier’s editor-in-chief, who posted an AI-generated image that appears to portray the outlet’s critics of being jealous drug-abusers. A former Myanmar Times and Myanmar Now contributor told The New Humanitarian the investigation was a welcome reprieve from the “traumatising and monotonous” war reporting many local and exile journalists are forced to do every day, especially with budgets tightening amid foreign aid cuts: “This is precisely the kind of journalism Myanmar outlets would love to be doing and should be doing, if they had [more] support.”

Hungary's PM hopeful accuses opponents of planning blackmail ahead of election

Orban rival accuses opponents of blackmail plot ahead of Hungary election
Less than two months before Hungary's election, opposition leader Peter Magyar has accused his rivals of planning to blackmail him with a secretly recorded sex tape, and says he is filing a complaint with authorities.
Magyar, who leads long-time Prime Minister Viktor Orban in the polls, said he suspected there were plans to release a tape of him from August 2024, when he says he engaged in consensual sex with a now ex-girlfriend at a party.
He was responding to a photo recently posted online of a bedroom in an apartment dating back to then.
Leading figures in Orban's Fidesz party said they knew nothing about the claims. The BBC has approached Orban's spokesman for comment.
Magyar accused Fidesz of trying to blackmail him and made three allegations of unlawful conduct in a statement on Friday.
Although no video has been published, he said one from that date would have been "recorded with secret service equipment and possibly faked".
Magyar made no mention in his statement of the ex-girlfriend he had been with at the time of the alleged incident, although he said on Thursday he had accused her of extortion 15 months ago - an allegation she denied.
She told Hungarian media that they were both victims regarding the alleged illicit video and she was ready to take legal action with him.
Magyar accused Fidesz leaders of timing their campaign to coincide with the start of his nationwide campaign next week, and of trying to ruin the last week he was spending with his three sons ahead of the April election.
Fidesz communications director Tamas Menczer accused Magyar of lying, while Orban's chief of staff Gergely Gulyas told reporters he could not comment on something he knew nothing about.
Orban, Hungary's nationalist leader, has been in office for 16 years, but with parliamentary elections on 12 April, Magyar's centre-right Tisza party is at least eight points ahead in the latest opinion poll by Hungary's Idea Institute.
Fidesz has so far focused its campaign on attacking the European Union, accusing Brussels of trying to bring down his government. He is seen as Vladimir Putin's closest ally in Europe and has called on the EU to stop sending money to Ukraine.
On Friday, US President Donald Trump praised Orban as a "truly strong and powerful leader", ahead of a visit by US Secretary of State Marco Rubio. Trump said he had been "proud to ENDORSE Viktor" for re-election in 2022 and was "honoured to do so again".
The election campaign is not even due to start until 21 February, but Magyar's allegations of dirty tricks are an indication of how murky the next few weeks may become.
Magyar has built support across Hungary over the past two years, promising to reset relations with Hungary's European partners.
A one-time Fidesz loyalist, he was once married to former justice minister Judit Varga, whose political career ended during a scandal in 2024. They divorced the year prior.

Why the UK is set to endure even more rain and flooding every year
- A new study warns that UK winters are becoming significantly wetter, dramatically increasing flood risks due to rising greenhouse gas concentrations.
- Researchers found that the UK's winter rainfall is increasing by approximately 7 per cent for every degree of global or regional warming, a rate faster than most climate models predict.
- This trend is primarily driven by a warmer atmosphere's ability to hold more moisture, leading to larger and more intense rainstorms.
- Leading global climate models significantly underestimate this change, projecting an average 4 per cent rise in rainfall per degree of warming compared to the observed 7 per cent.
- The UK is currently experiencing winter rainfall levels that climate models had not expected until the 2040s, making the country increasingly vulnerable to flooding.

Russia confirms $12 trillion pitch to Trump tied to Ukraine deal — White House stays silent on proposals

Russia confirms $12 trillion pitch to Trump tied to Ukraine deal — White House stays silent on proposals
Russia appeared to confirm on Feb. 13 the existence of a sweeping U.S.-Russia economic proposal known in Kyiv as the "Dmitriev package," days after President Volodymyr Zelensky first disclosed it publicly.
The Ukrainian president said on Feb. 6 that intelligence had briefed him on what he described as a roughly $12 trillion framework for large-scale economic cooperation between Moscow and Washington.
"Intelligence showed me the so-called 'Dmitriev package' that he presented in the U.S. — it amounts to around $12 trillion," Zelensky told reporters in Kyiv.
The reference is to Kirill Dmitriev, an envoy who heads Russia's sovereign wealth fund and has remained engaged with top U.S. officials, including Special Envoy Steve Witkoff.
The White House twice declined to confirm the existence of such proposals in comments to the Kyiv Independent — first after Zelensky's disclosure and again following a subsequent Bloomberg reporting.
The Russian acknowledgment marks the first official signal that such proposals are on the table as the U.S. pushes for a deal to end Russia's war against Ukraine.
What's inside?
That Bloomberg reporting offered a detailed look at what Russia may be seeking.
The outlet reported on Feb. 12 that Russia seeks to secure a wide-ranging economic partnership with the U.S. as part of an arrangement tied to Ukraine.
Citing an internal Russian memo prepared earlier this year, the outlet said Moscow wants relief from restrictions that have cut it off from the dollar payment system.
Russia reportedly views the restoration of dollar-based settlements as part of a potential peace deal. The memo outlines seven areas of possible U.S.-Russia cooperation.
Beyond regaining access to dollar transactions, Moscow reportedly seeks long-term contracts for American aircraft to modernize Russia's commercial fleet, as well as joint ventures in hard-to-recover oil extraction and liquefied natural gas production.
The Kremlin has long sought the lifting of U.S. sanctions on its aviation sector.
The proposals also include cooperation in nuclear energy, and expanded mining projects for lithium, copper, nickel, and platinum.
To sweeten the offer, the Kremlin signals it is ready to factor in previous American investments in Russia and contribute to compensation for losses incurred after Western companies exited the market following the start of Moscow's all-out war.
U.S. firms would receive preferential treatment if they return to Russia's market.
The plan also envisions joint efforts to promote fossil fuels globally as an alternative to the so-called "green" climate-focused policies.
Moscow's careful confirmation
When asked about the package on Feb. 13, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov didn't deny its existence. He framed it as a natural extension of shared economic interests.
"This Bloomberg article explains something that is quite obvious," Peskov said. "Of course, we are offering cooperation. Of course, companies from both countries are potentially interested in this cooperation — so there you have joint ventures."
Russia has not refused to use dollars — it was the United States that imposed restrictions on the use of the currency, he added.
His response marked Moscow's first public acknowledgment that economic cooperation proposals are under discussion with Washington — a significant shift given the White House's refusal to confirm such talks.
The dollar gambit
Among the proposals, Russia's push to return to dollar-based settlements stands out as the most politically sensitive — and hypocritical.
Russian President Vladimir Putin has repeatedly argued that the dollar's global dominance is declining and accused the U.S. of "parasitizing" the world economy.
Putin has also predicted that U.S. sanctions policy against Moscow would ultimately undermine the dollar's role in global finance.
A renewed embrace of dollar transactions would mark a reversal from the Kremlin's recent policy of "de-dollarization," as Moscow's officials have called it.
Since 2022, Russia has expanded settlements in national currencies with partners such as India and China and promoted alternatives within the BRICS group.
Although Putin said in October 2024 that there were no immediate plans to create a single BRICS currency, he noted the bloc's pursuit of financial sovereignty.
That effort has earlier drawn a warning from the Trump administration.
In January 2025, U.S. President Donald Trump threatened to impose 100% tariffs on BRICS members if they attempt to adopt a new or existing currency to replace the U.S. dollar in international trade.
Ukraine as bargaining chip
Taken together, the reported "Dmitriev package" suggests that Moscow is linking any movement on Ukraine not only to territorial and political demands, but also to a sweeping reset of economic relations with the United States.
Russia sees the war in Ukraine as leverage for extracting massive economic concessions from Washington, while trying to push its maximalist demands for Kyiv.

German chancellor Merz suggests US has ‘squandered’ its claim to world leadership under Trump

US has ‘squandered’ its claim to world leadership under Trump, German chancellor Merz suggests
Friedrich Merz was speaking on the first day of the Munich Security Conference, being held in the shadow of Donald Trump’s global influence
- Bookmark
- CommentsGo to comments
Germany’s chancellor Friedrich Merz has declared the international order is being destroyed, in a swipe at US president Donald Trump and his disruptive foreign policy.
Speaking at the Munich Security Conference on Friday, Merz warned that the United States’ “claim to leadership is disputed, perhaps squandered”.
“A rift has opened up between Europe and the United States. Vice President JD Vance said this very openly here in Munich a year ago,” Merz said, referring to Vance’s deeply contentious speech in which he lambasted traditional allies in Europe.
“He was right. The culture war of the Maga movement is not ours. Freedom of speech ends here with us when that speech goes against human dignity and the constitution. We do not believe in tariffs and protectionism, but in free trade.”
Referring to the upending of a rules-based order since Trump returned to office just over a year ago, the German leader gave a bleak assessment of the current climate.
“You’ve chosen a grim motto for this conference, ‘under destruction’, and it probably means that the international order based on rights and rules is currently being destroyed,” he told the summit.
“But I’m afraid we have to put it in even harsher terms: This order, as flawed as it has been even in its heyday, no longer exists.”
This year alone, Trump has deposed the leader of Venezuela with a military strike, threatened Greenland with annexation and sent aircraft carriers to the Middle East amid ongoing tensions with Iran.
However, Merz did offer an olive branch to the United States, represented at the three-day summit by secretary of state Marco Rubio.
“In the era of great power rivalry, even the United States will not be powerful enough to go it alone,” Merz continued, referring to the rise of China, and Russia’s geopolitical aims.
“Dear friends, being a part of Nato is not only Europe’s competitive advantage. It is also the United States’ competitive advantage. So let’s repair and revive transatlantic trust together,” he said.
Merz went on to reiterate the importance of bolstering Nato’s defences and expressed Germany’s commitment to investing billions in the partnership in the coming years.
Europe has been left reeling from Trump’s more aggressive foreign policy in his second term, forcing a reassessment of global alliances. The theme is expected to come up repeatedly during the Munich conference, though Trump himself is not attending.
“No one in Europe, or in the United States, wins from any kind of conflict between old allies,” said Danish prime minister Mette Frederiksen on Friday, reiterating Merz’s commitment to retain a good relationship with the U.S.
“So we must do what we can to keep the Americans close to us, but this is a new world disorder that we live in.”
Keir Starmer will tell delegates in Munich on Saturday that Europe should limit its dependance on the US and call for a defence alliance that is more European.
He will also say that the UK should move closer to the European Union, stating that turning inwards would be a “surrender” of control in a perilous era for geopolitics.
The prime minister will say: “I'm talking about a vision of European security and greater European autonomy, that does not herald US withdrawal but answers the call for more burden sharing in full, and remakes the ties that have served us so well.”
It follows comments made earlier by US congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, who told the summit that the Trump administration was “tearing apart the transatlantic partnership” as she backed calls for a return to “rules-based order”.
She said: “President Trump has withdrawn from and is looking to withdraw the US from the entire world and turn into an age of authoritarianism to carve out a world where Donald Trump can command the western world and Latin America as his personal sandbox."

People and power: How Cubans and their government see US pressure
As Cuba’s government prepares for American aggression, residents say economic hardship worries them more than the threat of war
- Cuban Foreign Ministry official says Havana concurs with pope’s call for peace, ‘but there is one party that doesn’t agree’
- Havana resident Andy Martinez Gonzalez says blackouts now last ‘12 to 20 hours a day’
- Expert Anna Ayuso says Cuba has diplomatic support from large powers, but is ‘not a priority’ for Russia or China
MEDELLIN, Colombia
Tensions between Cuba and the US have escalated sharply this year, as Washington steps up sanctions and threatens regime change while tightening pressure on the island’s already fragile economy.
The measures have deepened fuel shortages and prolonged blackouts across the country, disrupting transport, tourism and daily life, even as many Cubans say the latest geopolitical standoff feels like a familiar chapter in a decades-long conflict with Washington.
While Washington has for years pursued regime change in Cuba, many analysts believe the risk is now higher. The capture and forcible removal of Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro earlier this year signaled that the Trump administration is willing to use force against regional adversaries, raising concerns that Cuba – Caracas’ closest political and economic ally – could be the next target.
US President Donald Trump has warned Cuba to “make a deal” with its northern neighbor before it is “too late.” Secretary of State Marco Rubio also told a Senate hearing that the White House “would love to see the regime there change.”
Liz Oliva Fernandez, a Cuban journalist with the Havana-based media outlet Belly of the Beast, told Anadolu that many Cubans feel “anxious, frustrated and irritated” by the threats.
Washington has no right to “decide which state or government should collapse,” she said.
Severe fuel blockade deepens economic crisis
On Jan. 29, Trump signed an executive order imposing tariffs on any country that supplies Cuba with oil. The measures most affected Mexico, the country’s main supplier after Venezuela, which had initially pledged to continue shipments but later halted exports amid US pressure.
The impact on Cuba’s energy supply has been severe. By late January, the island had received just 84,900 barrels of oil all year from a single Mexican shipment early in the month, according to energy consultancy Kpler.
That amounts to just over 3,000 barrels per day, down sharply from an average of about 37,000 barrels per day from all suppliers in 2025.
Cuban President Miguel Diaz-Canel has described the measures as an “energy blockade,” warning they are disrupting transportation, hospitals, schools, tourism and food production.
Aviation authorities have also warned airlines that there is insufficient jet fuel available on the island, while the already fragile power grid is facing even deeper strain. Rolling blackouts were common before the latest sanctions, but outages have now intensified.
Satellite imagery analysis cited by Bloomberg shows that nighttime light levels in major eastern cities such as Santiago de Cuba and Holguin have dropped by as much as 50% compared with historical averages.
The fuel crisis is also hitting the tourism sector. Canada, Cuba’s largest source of visitors, has seen its leading airline suspend flights until at least May due to the lack of jet fuel, repatriating around 3,000 tourists. Russian officials have also said they are preparing to halt flights and evacuate travelers in the coming days.
Andy Martinez Gonzalez, a chef and resident of the Cuban capital, told Anadolu that the economic situation “is becoming ever more critical” as blackouts caused by electricity shortages now last between “12 and 20 hours a day.”
He added that, although Cubans are divided on the question of whether the US will attack Cuba, the reality of continued economic hardship remains a more pressing issue to the average Cuban than the distant, albeit threatening, rhetoric of a foreign power.
Preparing for war
The Cuban government, however, is taking the military threats seriously. Authorities recently declared a “state of preparation for war” in response to what they described as the risk of a possible US operation against the island.
Officials warned that the country was ready “to defend the homeland to the last drop of blood,” while the Cuban Revolutionary Armed Forces (FAR) began wartime preparations.
In response to the rising tensions, Pope Leo XIV called for peace between the two nations, “inviting all responsible parties to promote a sincere and effective dialogue, in order to avoid violence.”
A Cuban Foreign Ministry official, speaking on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to talk to the press, told Anadolu that they agreed with the pope’s appeal.
“But there is one party that doesn’t agree,” the official said, referring to the US.
Since the Cuban Revolution of 1959, relations between Cuba and the US have been characterized by the specter of American-backed invasion, regime change, assassinations or economic suffocation. As a result, for many on the island, the threat of war is nothing new.
Jordy Falcon, a Cuban property developer in Havana, said he was generally unperturbed by the military preparations on the island.
Falcon told Anadolu that Cubans were born into “a militarized country 90 miles away from the common enemy” and have “been preparing for war their whole lives.”
However, he added that the latest threats have created a sense among some Cubans that the country’s prolonged economic crisis cannot continue indefinitely.
It is “unsustainable” and “unbearable,” he said, adding that it “will have to end soon, in one way or another.”
Cuba’s efforts to shore up support
Falcon’s speculations about the imminence of change on the island are backed by reports such as one by The Wall Street Journal that said the US intends to enact some form of regime change in Cuba by the end of 2026.
Havana, meanwhile, is seeking to diversify its economic partners after losing most of its subsidized oil supplies from Venezuela.
Mexico had pledged to continue supplying crude, but shipments were later halted. Instead, two Mexican Navy vessels delivered humanitarian aid this week, while President Claudia Sheinbaum said diplomatic efforts were underway to resume oil exports.
Havana has also turned to more distant partners. Both Russia and China – founding members of the BRICS bloc that Cuba has joined – have signaled political support.
Russia’s Interior Minister Vladimir Kolokoltsev visited the island on Jan. 20 to strengthen bilateral ties. This week, Russian media reported that Moscow is preparing to send fuel shipments, noting that the last delivery was in February 2025.
Meanwhile, China approved an emergency aid package of $80 million and has donated 60,000 tons of rice. The Asian giant has also pledged to “provide Cuba with as much support and assistance as possible.”
However, Anna Ayuso, a senior research fellow at the Barcelona Centre for International Affairs (CIDOB), downplayed the significance of the current Russo-Chinese-Cuban alliance because of the reality that the country is quickly running out of oil.
She told Anadolu that, although Cuba can count on “both Russian and Chinese diplomatic and political support,” she believes that “neither country is willing to directly confront the US oil blockade” by sending oil in sufficient quantities to compensate for the latest American sanctions.
“There will be cooperation in the field of intelligence,” she said, adding that China is strengthening surveillance capabilities on the island and Russia is helping Cuba prepare defensively in case of conflict.
But she noted that such cooperation is largely symbolic, stemming from a desire to see Cuba continue to resist American pressure and remain a nuisance for the North American superpower.
Cuba, she believes, is not a “priority for either nation.”
On the ground, Fernandez holds a similarly muted view of potential Russian and Chinese aid.
The journalist said that food donations or other similar diplomatic outreach “will not solve the problem.”
“What Cuba needs more than aid from Russia and China … is for the US to leave us alone – to not do anything, not to help, but not to get in our way. To forget we exist.”
But continued pressure from Washington appears likely. The highest-ranking US diplomat in Cuba, Mike Hammer, reportedly told other diplomats that the long-standing embargo could tighten even further.
“The Cubans have complained for years about the blockade,” he said, according to reports. “But now there is going to be a real blockade.”

Teacher banned from classroom after turning up to school open evening drunk
Julia Leith was also seen under the influence of alcohol on a second occasion at another school
- Bookmark

A teacher has been banned from the classroom after attending a school open evening under the influence of alcohol, as well as turning up to class while “slurring” and “staggering”.
Julia Leith, 60, was described as “erratic, irrational, emotional and confused” by witnesses at Judgemeadow Community College in Leicester during the event in September 2017.
At 6.30pm, a fellow staff member reported concerns that Ms Leith was “disorientated and slurring her speech”, with another staff member realising she did not know “why or who” they were and showed visible signs of drinking.
Given that she was finding it “very difficult to talk”, it was determined that she would not be able to engage with the open evening, which was full of pupils and parents.
When trying to arrange transport, Ms Leith could only provide her own mobile number as a contact number, and was “unable to tell” where her bag was, before she was taken home through the back of the college to avoid the open evening.
In her witness statement, Ms Leith gave contradicting accounts, stating that she had been “anxious” over an observation class that day, and had “a couple of sips” of gin and tonic at home ahead of the open evening.
However, her oral evidence she stated she was “tee total” at the time and would “never drink alcohol in a school”.
A panel for the Teaching Regulation Agency concluded “that Ms Leith’s conduct was inappropriate and unprofessional, as she was present on the college premises having consumed alcohol. The professional judgement of Ms Leith’s colleagues present at the time concluded that she should not be present at the college and needed to be kept away from pupils and parents, necessitating her removal from the premises.”
On a second occasion in December 2018, while working as a supply teacher at Robert Smyth Academy in Market Harborough, Ms Leith was also found to be under the influence of alcohol.
A staff member was informed at 1.30pm that Ms Leith appeared drunk, and was seen swaying from side to side while walking along the corridor.
She appeared “emotional” and “slurring” and smelt of alcohol, with Ms Leith hugging one of the witnesses after opening an office door, the TRA report said.
When mentioned that she was unstable on her feet, she claimed it was due to wearing heels, despite the fact she was wearing flat shoes.
In her witness statement, Ms Leith claimed the smell of alcohol came from mouthwash she kept at work, but admitted drinking wine to “problematic levels” during the evenings.
The TRA found: “Whilst there was no evidence that Ms Leith’s conduct caused harm to pupils, the panel was mindful of the potential harm that could have been caused, had Ms Leith’s colleagues not intervened and sent her home. The panel considered that a teacher under the influence of alcohol whilst on school property was a significant safeguarding concern.
“As such, the panel found the high risk of repetition paired with the potential risk of harm, to be aggravating factors in Ms Leith’s case.”
She has now been prohibited from teaching indefinitely and cannot teach in any school, sixth form college, youth accommodation or children’s home. An application to remove the order cannot be made for two years.

Russia Deploys TOS-3 ‘Dragon’ Modeled on Solntsepyok Rocket Launcher to Ukraine

Russian forces have begun deploying the new TOS-3 “Dragon” thermobaric multiple rocket launcher system (MRLS) on the frontlines in Ukraine – an upgraded model of the TOS-1A Solntsepyok dubbed a “legend” by Russian propaganda.
On Thursday, Defense Express reported that footage recently released by the Russian Ministry of Defense which purports to show a TOS-1A Solntsepyok actually shows the TOS-3 “Dragon,” which has a longer range and enhanced protection compared to the Solntsepyok.

The system was first introduced in 2024, featuring a welded-on grill and an integrated “Volnorez” electronic warfare suite.
The TOS-3 differs from the older Solntsepyok in several ways: for example, it has 15 launch guides instead of 24, but fires longer-range rockets. While the TOS-1A had a range of up to 6 km (3.7 miles) and required direct line of sight, the TOS-3 can strike targets from 15-24 km (9-15 miles), enabling it to fire from covered positions.
Built on a T-72 chassis, it also includes Kontakt-5 dynamic armor, anti-drone nets, and electronic countermeasures. Additional screens and protective elements shield the rockets when stowed. These upgrades make the TOS-3 more resistant to counter-battery fire and strike drones.
Polish journalist Filip Melczarek recently said that its exact specifications will become known only if Ukraine captures one – but that “currently, the only line of defense is using [first person view] FPV drones to neutralize Dragons before deployment.”

Often mistranslated as a “heavy flamethrower,” the Solntsepyok is actually a multiple rocket launcher that fires thermobaric munitions. Like the Solntsepyok, the TOS-3 fires thermobaric rockets that produce massive blast waves by dispersing flammable aerosol before detonation, causing severe pressure changes that can devastate personnel and structures. Any incendiary effect is secondary.
Russia uses the Solntsepyok system to strike Ukrainian positions and civilian areas. A single salvo of 24 rockets can blanket roughly 200 by 200 meters, leveling fortifications and damaging entire neighborhoods.
Each rocket weighs over 200 kilograms, and the system is estimated to cost between $6.5 million and $15 million.
Russian officials have long claimed the weapon has no global equivalent, but it comes with serious risks: when damaged, its volatile ammunition can explode, endangering nearby troops. In one 2024 incident, a Solntsepyok munition detonated in Russia’s Belgorod region, killing three Russian soldiers.
Despite its destructive power, the Solntsepyok is large and lightly armored, making it vulnerable to drones and anti-tank weapons. Ukrainian forces have repeatedly destroyed the launchers throughout the war, sometimes striking them even as they fire. In late September 2025, Ukraine’s 429th Separate Achilles Drone Regiment reported destroying two Russian TOS-1A Solntsepyok launchers using FPV drones in Ukraine’s northeastern Kharkiv region.
Ukraine has also captured several of the systems in the past.

Police are searching for a witness as part of an investigation after a woman was sexually assaulted in Plymouth.
Devon and Cornwall Police said the assault took place at around 3am on 12 September 2025, and was reported last month.
The victim was dragged to the ground by a man who first engaged in conversation with her, then attempted to pull her top down on New George Street.
He then put his hand over her mouth, but the victim managed to scream, alerting a passerby, which caused the man to flee.
The suspect is described as a white male, in his early 20s, with tattoos on his forearms and wearing a black puffa style jacket.
The witness, a woman in her 20s called Sophia, gave the victim her jacket and walked her home, police said. She told the victim that she had just finished work.
A statement from the police said: “A woman was walking along New George Street in the city when she was approached by an unknown male.
“The suspect then engaged in conversation with the victim before attempting to pull her top down.
“He then followed the victim before dragging her to the ground and putting his hand over her mouth.
“The victim’s scream then alerted a female passerby which caused the suspect to flee.”
The assault was reported on 26 January, and officers are keen to speak with Sophia.
If you can help identify Sophia, or are the witness herself, please contact the police on 101 or via their website quoting 50260021188

UK court says Palestine Action ban ‘unlawful’: What does the verdict mean?
Activists welcome the court ruling as the UK government, which designated the group as a ‘terrorist’ organisation, says it will appeal the verdict.
In a landmark ruling celebrated by human rights groups, the High Court in London has called the United Kingdom government’s ban on the pro-Palestinian campaign group, Palestine Action, “unlawful”.
In July last year, the UK government had banned the group, which had protested against Israel’s genocidal war on Gaza and the UK’s support for Israel. The Labour government led by Prime Minister Keir Starmer designated it as a “terrorist” organisation and a national security threat, putting it on par with armed groups like al-Qaeda and ISIL (ISIS).

- list 2 of 3UK decision to ban Palestine Action as ‘terror group’ unlawful, court says
- list 3 of 3UK ban on Palestine Action was unlawful, says court
Here’s a timeline of when and why Palestine Action was banned and what members of the group have had to endure so far:
What does Friday’s ruling mean?
On Friday morning, judges at the Royal Courts of Justice struck down the British government’s proscription against Palestine Action, ruling that they were “satisfied that the decision to proscribe Palestine Action was disproportionate”.
Sean Summerfield, a UK-based barrister specialising in international criminal law and human rights at Doughty Street Chambers, told Al Jazeera that Friday’s ruling mainly vindicates those who stood in solidarity with Palestine Action and will not have an effect on those directly engaged with the group.
Since the ban, the UK police have arrested 2,787 people for holding signs like “I oppose genocide”, “I support Palestine Action” in silent vigils across the UK, according to a statement by the campaign group, Defend Our Juries.
After Friday’s court ruling, holding such placards will no longer be considered unlawful.
Defend Our Juries said that after Friday’s ruling, seven people charged with Section 12 (Terrorism Act 2000) offences for addressing Zoom calls as part of the Lift the Ban campaign against Palestine Action will also have their arrests deemed unlawful.
Summerfield said the UK’s Director of Public Prosecutions will now have a decision to make about what to do with those already arrested.
“Do they respect the decision of the High Court and discontinue those prosecutions, or do they continue to prosecute pending appeal? The Metropolitan police have already indicated they will now stop arresting people for holding placards, but that does not preclude further arrests if the appeal succeeds,” he said.
“But given the early indications that the government will appeal, the thousands of people arrested for holding placards are likely to remain in limbo,” he added.
Summerfield said that with respect to those activists directly engaged with Palestine Action who have broken into arms factories or disrupted supply chains on behalf of the group, prosecution will continue.
“This is because they have been charged with things like criminal damage. They will still be prosecuted,” he said.
Why was Palestine Action banned?
Last July, members of the UK parliament voted in favour of banning Palestine Action, which was established in July 2020. The direct action group describes itself as a movement “committed to ending global participation in Israel’s genocidal and apartheid regime”.
The government proscribed the group under the UK’s Terrorism Act 2000. Other groups banned under the law include armed groups such as ISIS (ISIL), al-Qaeda and Tehreek-e Taliban Pakistan.
The ban came after activists from Palestine Action entered the Royal Air Force station in Brize Norton, the UK’s largest airbase, in June 2025 and vandalised military aircraft with red paint. At the time, the group said they carried out this action since “these [Royal Air Force] aircraft can be used to refuel and have been used to refuel Israeli fighter jets.”
Prime Minister Starmer condemned the incident. “The act of vandalism committed at RAF Brize Norton is disgraceful,” he said in a post.
Previously, in August 2024, Palestine Action activists had driven a van into Israeli defence and technology company Elbit’s headquarters in Bristol, causing extensive damage.
At about the same time, they had also spray-painted the Ministry of Defence, in central London, red and defaced a statue of Arthur Balfour with tomato ketchup inside the House of Commons. Balfour was a former Conservative prime minister who, serving as foreign secretary in 1917, authored the Balfour Declaration, which supported the establishment of a Jewish “national home” in Palestine.
What has happened since the ban?
Following the ban, Palestine Action said on X that “the real crime” was not the “red paint being sprayed on these warplanes, but the war crimes that have been enabled with those planes because of the UK government’s complicity in Israel’s genocide”.
The group added that the government’s move could risk criminalising legitimate protest.
Since the ban, being a member of the group or supporting Palestine solidarity protests organised by the group in the UK was considered an offence punishable by up to 14 years in prison.
Last week, six people linked to Palestine Action were acquitted of aggravated burglary in connection with an alleged break-in at Elbit Systems in August 2024. The jury was unable to reach a verdict on charges of criminal damage.
In total, 24 activists linked to the Palestinian direct action group arrested at different times are still awaiting trial, and many have been held beyond the maximum six-month detention limits.
Several Palestine Action activists launched hunger strikes late last year, seeking better conditions in prison, rights to a fair trial, and for the UK government to reverse its decision to ban the group.
In January, a few of the activists ended their strike after a number of their demands were met, while others ended it due to health reasons.
What are the reactions to Friday’s ruling?
The court’s ruling has, however, been celebrated by people in the country, human rights groups, and members of the British government.
“This is a monumental victory both for our fundamental freedoms here in Britain and in the struggle for freedom for the Palestinian people, striking down a decision that will forever be remembered as one of the most extreme attacks on free speech in recent British history,” Huda Ammori, the Palestine Action cofounder, said.
John Moxham, a retired professor of medicine who was standing outside the court at the time of the ruling, told Al Jazeera he’s “absolutely delighted”.
“I feel absolutely delighted because my wife was arrested for sitting down and supporting Palestine Action. I’ve been on all the marches and it’s just a wonderful day,” he said.
“The whole banning in the first place was just a total travesty, and it was obviously ridiculous. It’s so wonderful that it’s now been turned over. There ought to be a lot of resignations of government ministers and people. The prime minister and David Lammy [secretary of justice] have got a lot of blood on their hands.”
Anas Mustapha, head of public Advocacy at CAGE International, said: “Today’s decision is the correct legal outcome, though it was secured only through principled sacrifice and collective will.
“This ruling against the Home Secretary’s decision should now result in the withdrawal of charges against all Palestine Action activists in prison and the thousands who acted on their conscience, as part of the largest civil disobedience campaign this country has seen in recent years,” he added.
British Green Party MP Adrian Ramsay welcomed the ruling.
“The Govt must immediately stop interfering with legitimate peaceful protest – and instead fully address its complicity in the ongoing genocide in Gaza,” he said in a post on X.
What happens next?
The British government has said it intends to appeal the court’s ruling.
“I am disappointed by the court’s decision and disagree with the notion that banning this terrorist organisation is disproportionate,” Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood said in a statement.
“I intend to fight this judgment in the Court of Appeal.”
Summerfield told Al Jazeera that the High Court’s ban remains in place until the government decides whether to appeal.
“The British government has until next Friday to launch an appeal,” he said.
“Assuming the government does appeal, the ban will remain in place at least until that appeal process has been exhausted, which could be lengthy,” he added.
But rights groups have called on the government not to appeal the court’s decision.
“The High Court’s decision sends a clear message: the Government cannot simply reach for sweeping counter terrorism powers to suppress protest,” Amnesty International’s UK division said on X.
“We welcome this judgment as an essential check on overreach and a powerful reminder that fundamental rights still carry weight in UK law,” the international rights group said.
“We urge the Government to respect the ruling and NOT to appeal this decision. We will continue to expose attempts to erode our rights.”

German chancellor issues powerful Nato warning to US
German chancellor Friedrich Merz has proclaimed that the rules-based international order is “over” in stark opening remarks at the Munich Security Conference on Friday, 13 February.
In a comprehensive speech, the German chancellor implied that in a period of intense rivalry, even the US lacks the strength to stand alone without the backing of NATO allies.
Merz also offered Europe’s unconditional support to Denmark in the ongoing dispute with the Trump administration over Greenland, and reaffirmed his commitment to turning the German armed forces into the strongest army in Europe, ready to defend its eastern flank against Russia.

Keep drilling for oil in the North Sea, says Tony Blair
- Tony Blair's think tank has urged the Labour government to reverse its ban on new North Sea oil and gas licences.
- The Tony Blair Institute (TBI) also called for a reduction in the windfall tax rate on oil and gas firms, stating current policies have increased risk and driven capital away.
- The TBI report argues that the government's clean power plan is 'leading the UK in the wrong direction' and is 'climate theatre' rather than 'climate leadership'.
- Labour's current policy commits to phasing out North Sea oil and gas production by restricting new licences and increasing the Energy Profits Levy.
- The TBI's recommendations echo comments made by Donald Trump, who has criticised the UK for not utilising its North Sea reserves.

Ruling against Palestine Action ban is embarrassing defeat for the government

The list of those who criticised the ban on Palestine Action and its consequences was disparate to say the least, taking in a Trump administration official, a former director of public prosecutions, a former director of the security services, Home Office officials, politicians of different stripes, and UN experts, not to mention a host of NGOs.
Now a trio of senior judges can be added to the list, after they deemed the ban to be “disproportionate” and impinging on freedom of speech and protest when the direct action group’s activities could be targeted under the existing criminal law.
From the point in June last year when the then home secretary, Yvette Cooper, first announced her intention to proscribe Palestine Action, the ban has been hugely controversial.
While “serious property damage” is a criterion for a ban under the Terrorism Act 2000, the legislation had previously only been used on groups intent on violence to the person, such as Islamic State and Boko Haram.
As such, its use against Palestine Action, a group that targeted the UK sites of the Israeli arms manufacturer Elbit Systems and others it said were complicit in genocide against the Palestinians, jarred with many.
As well as its reliance on the “serious property damage provision” in the Terrorism Act, the ban also drew attention to the fact that the UK is one of the few countries where recklessly expressing support for a proscribed organisation is an offence.
Never before had a direct action group been banned, fuelling perceptions, despite government denials, that suppressing pro-Palestinian voices was more important to ministers than stopping the slaughter of tens of thousands of people trapped in Gaza.
The advocacy organisations We Believe in Israel and the Campaign Against Antisemitism had pressed the government to proscribe Palestine Action, and the Guardian had previously revealed meetings, under the Conservative government, with Elbit representatives and Israeli embassy officials, that were apparently concerned with cracking down on the group.
Cynicism only increased in the run-up to the parliamentary vote on the ban as the Home Office briefed the Times that it was investigating whether Palestine Action was funded by Iran – a claim the Home Office later distanced itself from and which the independent reviewer on terrorism legislation, Jonathan Hall KC, who supported the ban, told Channel 4’s Dispatches was “nudge-nudge, wink-wink” insinuation without foundation.
There were also concerns that two neo-Nazi groups, the Maniacs Murder Cult and the Russian Imperial Movement, were included on the same banning order, which meant MPs were forced to vote on banning all or none of them.
If the government expected the controversy to settle down after the ban came into effect, it was to be disappointed. Not only was there a legal challenge – an injunction to stay the ban having been rejected – but also a campaign of civil disobedience. Scenes of pensioners, including clergy and war veterans, being carried away by police only added to criticism, with the Metropolitan Police Federation saying the extra demands on officers as a result of the repeated demonstrations, during which hundreds of people were arrested, were “unsustainable”.
Police interventions were simultaneously chilling and absurd. Laura Murton was threatened with arrest by armed officers for supporting Palestine Action after holding a sign saying “free Gaza” and a Palestinian flag. Marianne Sorrell, a retired teacher, was held by police for almost 27 hours, during which officers forced their way into her house and searched it, after she was arrested for holding a placard saying: “I oppose genocide. I support Palestine Action.”
Jon Farley was arrested for carrying a placard reproducing a graphic from Private Eye magazine, which said: “Unacceptable Palestine Action: spraying military planes. Acceptable Palestine Action: shooting Palestinians queueing for food.”
Downing Street described Palestine Action as “a violent organisation that has committed violence, significant injury, extensive criminal damage” and Cooper made similar statements but they seemed to be contradicted by documents released in the judicial review.
The Joint Terrorism Analysis Centre (Jtac), a government body based within MI5, produced a secret report on 7 March last year that was disclosed in the high court. While recommending banning Palestine Action, Jtac said the group “primarily uses direct action tactics”, which typically resulted in minor damage to property. “Common tactics include graffiti, petty vandalism, occupation and lock-ons,” it said.
Whitehall officials also supported a ban, but conceded that proscribing the group would be “relatively novel” as “there was no known precedent of an organisation being proscribed on the basis that it was concerned in terrorism mainly due to its use or threat of action involving serious damage to property”.
Ultimately, the judges found that “a very small number of Palestine Action’s activities amounted to acts of terrorism within the definition of section 1 of the 2000 act”.
But in trying to categorise it as such, not only has the government suffered a humiliating defeat, it has transformed Palestine Action from a little-known protest group to one that is on the front page of newspapers.

Pakistani lawmakers demand treatment of jailed ex-Premier Imran Khan over 'vision loss'
Supreme Court directs government to form medical team to examine incarcerated PTI chief
ISTANBUL
Pakistani lawmakers on Friday demanded medical treatment for the imprisoned former Prime Minister Imran Khan over his “vision loss.”
The opposition alliance Tehreek Tahafuz-i-Ayeen Pakistan (TTAP) lawmakers protested outside the parliament in the capital Islamabad, demanding Imran Khan’s admission to a hospital for treatment.
Lawmakers raised slogans seeking the release and treatment of Khan, according to videos shared by TTAP on US social media company X.
It came after a lawyer on Thursday submitted a report to the Supreme Court, detailing the situation of the founder of the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) party.
The report by lawyer Salman Safdar said Khan’s right eye had lost vision. He met Khan in Adiala jail on Tuesday, following the top court's direction.
The court was told by Safdar that Khan had only 15% vision remaining, prompting a strong response from the PTI and his followers.
The Supreme Court ordered the formation of a medical team to examine Imran Khan’s eye, after the submission of the report.
Parliamentary Affairs Minister Tariq Fazal Chaudhry on Friday said that the government has “repeatedly” assured the opposition that “no negligence will be tolerated regarding Imran’s health.”
“It is a medical issue,” he stressed, adding that Khan would be taken “wherever he prefers” for medical treatment.
TTAP leader and former lawmaker, Mustafa Nawaz Khokhar, said the government had “cordoned off all roads leading to the Parliament.”
“All this to stop opposition MPs from protesting and demanding medical access to Imran Khan. This doesn’t reflect strength rather weakness!” he said on X.
However, Minister Chaudhry said the “blockade was not from the government’s side."
Khan, who was ousted from government by parliament in April 2022, has been in jail since late 2023 over several cases, which his party says are politically motivated.

EU foreign policy chief says UN Security Council 'not working the way it was meant to be'
Kaja Kallas calls for reforms to multilateral system to better reflect today's geopolitical realities while upholding state equality
BRUSSELS
EU foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas on Friday said the UN Security Council "is not working the way it was meant to be," arguing that the body fails to reflect the realities of today's world and lacks effective accountability mechanisms.
Speaking at a panel during the Munich Security Conference, Kallas said the current global order must be reformed to ensure that no country is above international law.
She said that major international crises have historically led to the development of international cooperation, but argued that what is currently missing is accountability.
"Everybody signs up to the United Nations Charter, the principles are there. But what happens if somebody breaches those principles? The accountability is clearly not working," Kallas said.
"The (UN) Security Council is not working the way it was meant to be. The United Nations is not reflecting the world as it currently is," she added.
"If we reform, then we should actually take into account the world as it currently is, where all the states are equal, and also that nobody is above the law," Kallas said, emphasizing that even the "most powerful countries" must face consequences if they violate agreed rules.
In response to a question about repeated ceasefire violations by Israel in Gaza and who would hold it accountable, Kallas reiterated her call for the equal application of international law.
Addressing questions about the US-led Gaza "Board of Peace" linked to a UN Security Council resolution, Kallas noted that the original resolution envisaged a time-limited mechanism and included Palestinian participation, while current proposals do not fully reflect those elements.
While she acknowledged that powerful states have often operated by different rules, she argued that cooperation, not dominance, ultimately ensures strength.
"But even in the jungle, you know, animals cooperate, and so you are better off when you work with others," she said.
Drawing a comparison between major powers, Kallas noted that when Russia wages war, it does so largely alone due to a lack of allies.
"When America goes to wars, you know, then a lot of us go with you, and we lose our people on the way. So, that means that you also need us to be this superpower," she added.

The Anglo-German company Hypersonica has successfully tested a prototype hypersonic missile developed in 9 months.
This was reported in a press release from the company.
The test flight took place at the Andøya Space Center in Norway. Hypersonica became the first European private defense company to achieve this technological milestone.
The missile prototype accelerated to a speed of over Mach 6 with a flight range of over 300 km. It took just over six months from project inception to launch.
Throughout the flight, including ascent and descent through the atmosphere, all systems operated normally. The effectiveness of the system has been confirmed at the subcomponent level at hypersonic speeds.
The test provided valuable data for the further design of high-speed strike systems and will expand the capabilities for analyzing enemy weapon profiles.
Hypersonica plans to complete the development of the hypersonic missile by 2029, following a phased approach with successive test flights.
Preparation for the first test included conceptual design, component procurement and integration, ground testing, as well as compliance with export control and flight safety requirements and test site organization.
The missile’s modular architecture allows for rapid upgrades and reduces costs by more than 80% compared to traditional approaches.
This approach will enable Europe to deploy hypersonic capabilities within the timeframe set out in the NATO and UK Hypersonic Frameworks for 2030, and to do so at a significantly lower cost.

Reeves appoints higher pay advocate to fight skills shortages as chief economic adviser
Unknown

00:38:02 KST

Rachel Reeves has appointed a labour market expert who has repeatedly called for better pay and conditions in key sectors, such as social care, to reduce the UK’s reliance on migrant workers as her new chief economic adviser.
Prof Brian Bell, who chairs the independent Migration Advisory Committee (MAC), which advises the government, has been announced as the new chief economic adviser in the Treasury – a senior civil service role.
He will take up the post just as the UK economy is adjusting to a plunge in net migration, which fell by more than two-thirds, to 204,000, in the year to June 2025.
Some economists have predicted a further decline, towards zero net migration – but Bell rejects that forecast, expecting it to bounce back towards 300,000 a year by the end of the decade.
A professor of economics at King’s College London, Bell has used his role on the MAC to make the point that the “skills shortages” bemoaned by UK employers may often reflect the failure to offer good enough terms and conditions to domestic workers.
In its 2024 annual report, after Labour came to power, the MAC welcomed the new government’s focus on skills policy as it sought to reduce net migration.
But it also warned: “Many sectors exhibit high levels of immigration not just due to skills shortages but as a result of poor pay and working conditions which cause low engagement from the domestic workforce.”
It added: “The domestic workforce with relevant skills may be unwilling to supply their labour for the wage and working conditions on offer from employers.”
Bell has also argued stridently for better pay in social care. In an interview with the Guardian in 2023, when the Conservatives were still in power, he accused ministers of having “no interest” in the conditions faced by workers in the sector.
“They may not say it explicitly, but I think they basically believe that care workers should be paid less than people who stack shelves for Aldi – because that’s what their policy is,” he said, accusing the government of relying on immigration as a “crutch”.
Bell added: “We’re not doing anything on the wages front, and until we do that, then we are accepting that exploitation as part of the way that we’re going to pay for social care: and that just seems appalling.”
Labour is establishing a new negotiating body for social care, which aims to agree a fair pay agreement that will become the statutory minimum across the sector. But it is not due to come into force until 2028, and sector experts have said the £500m set aside to pay for it will not be sufficient. The wider issue of how to fund social care is being reviewed by the cross-bench peer Louise Casey, who is not expected to report until the run-up to the next general election.
Speaking on a panel at the Bristol festival of economics last year, Bell argued that rapid increases in the number of people coming into the country often reflect wider policy challenges.
“It’s almost always that where there’s big immigration numbers, the problem is somewhere else in government not addressing an underlying problem,” he said.
Bell’s appointment comes amid a wider refresh of the chancellor’s advisers. Neil Amin-Smith, once the violinist for the pop band Clean Bandit and now an economist, was recently made chair of her council of economic advisers, which is made up of political appointees rather than civil servants.
Reeves said: “Through stability, investment and reform, this government has the right plan for our economy and the appointment of Prof Brian Bell will strengthen our economic leadership as we deliver for working people.”

Sweden announces third $100M aid package to Ukraine under PURL initiative
According to Ukrinform, the announcement was made on the Swedish government's official website.
"Sweden stands firm in its solidarity with Ukraine. Through our contribution to PURL, which will give Ukraine access to prioritized U.S. defense materiel, we are once again demonstrating that we are prepared to take concrete steps to strengthen Ukraine's defense capabilities. Air defense and ammunition are crucial to allow Ukraine to defend itself against Russia's continued attacks. Together with our Allies and partners, we are sending a clear signal that demonstrates our shared commitment to peace and security in Europe," Minister for Defense Pal Jonson said.
This is the third time Sweden has contributed to PURL. On previous occasions, Sweden has provided $275 million for a support package together with Denmark and Norway and provided $60 million for a support package together with other Nordic and Baltic countries.
Taking into account this new contribution, Sweden has provided a total of $435 million in financial support to PURL.
On February 6, the Swedish government announced a new aid package to Ukraine worth SEK 1 billion, intended to address the country's most urgent needs in energy equipment.

MOSCOW, February 13. /TASS/. Geneva was chosen to host the next round of Russia-US-Ukraine talks because the parties found it convenient, Kremlin Spokesman Dmitry Peskov told TASS.
"The place was chosen based on the schedule of all three parties. Everybody found it reasonable and convenient," he said, when asked about the reason behind the decision to relocate the talks to Europe.
The Emirati capital of Abu Dhabi held the second round of trilateral talks on February 4-5. The first round of consultations was held in Abu Dhabi on January 23-24. Russia’s delegation was led by Igor Kostyukov, head of the Main Directorate of the General Staff of the Russian Armed Forces.
Peskov said earlier on Friday that the next round of Russia-US-Ukraine talks would be held in Geneva. Presidential Aide Vladimir Medinsky will lead Russia’s delegation.

Zelensky gets chilling warning from Trump official ahead of key summit
- US Secretary of State Marco Rubio declared that the "old order is gone" and the world is at a "defining moment" in geopolitics, ahead of the Munich Security Conference.
- Rubio is anticipated to meet with Volodymyr Zelensky at the conference, which will also be attended by other global leaders including Sir Keir Starmer and Emmanuel Macron.
- The conference follows Ukraine's announcement that it is set to receive $38 billion (£27.9bn) in military aid from its allies for 2026.
- This aid package includes a £500 million contribution from the UK specifically for air defence, forming part of a larger £3 billion support commitment.
- Ukrainian Defence Minister Mykhailo Fedorov confirmed that the funding will be allocated for drones, air defence systems, and Patriot missiles.

MUNICH, Germany — German Chancellor Friedrich Merz said that U.S. leadership can no longer be taken for granted and Europe must prepare to stand more firmly on its own, in a stark warning to world leaders in Munich.
“The leadership claim of the U.S. is being challenged, perhaps already lost,” Merz said during the opening of the Munich Security Conference, laying out the starkest assessment yet from Berlin of a world increasingly defined by great-power rivalry. “In the era of great powers, our freedom is no longer simply guaranteed. It is under threat.”
He argued the global system itself may already have collapsed. “The international order based on rights and rules … no longer exists in the way it once did,” he said.

Trump-appointed judge issues scathing order saying ICE violated immigrants’ rights in Minnesota detention
Latest blow to mass deportation efforts in the state follows wave of rebukes from federal courts against ICE
- Bookmark
- CommentsGo to comments
A federal judge appointed by Donald Trump lambasted the administration for surging federal officers into Minnesota without accounting for basic due process protections for thousands of people they arrested.
Immigration authorities violated their rights by stashing them into a severely overcrowded federal facility without access to attorneys, according to District Judge Nancy Brasel.
“It appears that in planning for Operation Metro Surge, the government failed to plan for the constitutional rights of its civil detainees,” she wrote Thursday.
“The government suggests — with minimal explanation and even less evidence — that doing so would result in ‘chaos,’” she added. “The Constitution does not permit the government to arrest thousands of individuals and then disregard their constitutional rights because it would be too challenging to honor those rights.”
Immigration and Customs Enforcement was ordered to immediately restore meaningful access to legal support for people detained in Minnesota, marking a major victory for human rights groups and detainees who sued over conditions that the judge said “all but extinguish a detainee’s access to counsel.”
In response to Judge Brasel’s order, a spokesperson for Homeland Security said that “no lawbreakers in the history of human civilization have been treated better than illegal aliens in the United States”
Thursday’s order arrived hours after the Trump administration’s announcement that federal officers would begin withdrawing from Minnesota in the coming days.
White House border czar Tom Homan — who was deployed to the state after officers fatally shot two citizen protesters and the apparent removal of Border Patrol “commander-at-large” Greg Bovino — said Thursday that “a small footprint of personnel” will remain in the state to supervise the transfer of “full command and control” of immigration enforcement back to the ICE field office in Minneapolis.
A class-action lawsuit from The Advocates for Human Rights alleges widespread violations at the Bishop Henry Whipple Federal Building, where detainees are "shackled" and “secretly” moved to ICE detention centers as far as away as Texas without a chance to call a lawyer or family member.
Detainees are “moved frequently, quickly, without notice, and often with no way for attorneys to know where or how long they will be at a given facility,” according to the judge.
ICE refused to let attorneys meet with their clients, who were routinely “pressured” to sign self-deportation forms, according to plaintiffs.
“All of these barriers make it difficult — if not impossible — for attorneys to effectively represent their clients,”Judge Brasel wrote.
The judge ordered the government to provide written notice to detainees’ access to legal services and provide them with free, private and unmonitored access to telephones.
Attorneys also must be allowed to visit clients seven days a week, and ICE must inform them if their clients are being moved out of the facility, with a chance for the detainees to call their legal counsel or family.
“When the government deprives people of liberty, it cannot avoid its constitutional responsibilities because it finds them inconvenient,” according to Michele Garnett McKenzie, executive director of The Advocates for Human Rights. “It’s appalling that we required a court ruling to defend this fundamental right.”
The ruling is the latest blow to the Trump administration’s mass deportation efforts in Minnesota, after a wave of rebukes from federal judges who accused ICE of routinely violating court orders, including ignoring orders to release detainees and illegally moving them around the country.
Judges have also issued similar court rulings over the conditions inside makeshift ICE facilities in Chicago and New York, where detainees similarly lacked access to legal counsel and were stuffed into overcrowded cells.

Ukraine’s former prime minister suspects US may quit talks on Ukraine in May

MOSCOW, February 13. /TASS/. Ukraine’s former Prime Minister Nikolay Azarov (2010-2014) did not rule out the possibility of the United States withdrawing from negotiations regarding the Ukrainian conflict in May.
"There are various speculations that, sometime in May, President Donald Trump might officially announce that he’s tired of all the talk and negotiations, and simply 'let them fight it out,'" Azarov stated on the Soloviev Live TV channel. "Could this happen? Well, probably. Why not? He’ll be able to sell weapons and make money."
Azarov suggested that in such a scenario, European countries would likely support Ukraine. He pointed out that the European Union’s budget for 2026 is approximately 190 billion euros, with about 90 billion euros allocated to support the Kiev regime.
Earlier, the British newspaper The Financial Times, citing sources, reported that Ukraine, under pressure from the US administration, had begun planning presidential elections and a referendum on peace agreements with Russia by May 15. The publication indicated that an official announcement might be made as early as February 24. However, a source close to Zelensky denied these election rumors to RBC-Ukraine. Additionally, Deputy Head of Ukraine’s Central Election Commission (CEC) Sergey Dubovik clarified that the CEC had not received any documents related to organizing elections.
Zelensky’s presidential term officially ended on May 20, 2024, but Kiev has not conducted regular elections, citing the impossibility of doing so until martial law is lifted. Russian President Vladimir Putin emphasized that Zelensky’s term "has expired, along with his legitimacy, which cannot be restored through any tricks." He also recalled that Russia held elections during its own special operation period without any demands for guarantees.

The Pope and Catholic priests keep giving terrifying warnings about AI. What exactly are they scared of?
Artificial intelligence could bring people back to the church – or replace it entirely, writes Maja Anushka

- CommentsGo to comments
If there’s one defining thing about Catholics, it’s that they’re known for the corporeal. They’ve involved themselves, for thousands of years, with the natural world and the role of the human body within it. Every sacrament has matter and form: something in the hand, something said with the voice. Water, to cleanse the body of sin. Ashes, pressed into the forehead. Bread and wine, blood and flesh, placed in the mouth. It’s a preoccupation that makes sense for a faith born from an incident of extreme physical torture, but Catholics know, for all their focus on Jesus’ singular body, that one body alone is of little use. Churches are not built by disparate networks of hermits. Your sins cannot be absolved without the attentive ear of a priest to hear them in the first place. People are important.
As a result, the labour of the Catholic church is largely done offline, by real people in real buildings. Its practitioners should be among the most insulated from fear about new, unwieldy technology. But after being elected as the new Pope in May of last year, Leo XIV used his first cardinal address to sound an alarm not only rooted firmly in the digital present, but which also rings out long into the future.
The Leo before him, Leo XIII, became head of the Catholic church in 1878, when the Gilded Age was well underway. Now, 147 years later, the new Pope looked upon a world grappling with a new industrial revolution. “Sensing myself called to continue in this same path, I chose to take the name Leo XIV. The Church offers her social teaching… in response to developments in the field of artificial intelligence that pose new challenges for the defence of human dignity, justice and labour,” he said.“It was so unexpected to hear him speaking about AI. It delighted a number of Catholics I know.” Father Stephen, the Rector of the Venerable English College in Rome, reflects. “They thought, thank God, we've got a pope who gets it.” Work on AI within the Catholic community was already well underway before Leo XIV’s papacy. In 2023, Longbeard founded Magisterium AI: a Catholic chatbot which can read relevant Bible passages to you.
Leo XIV’s first mention of AI was fairly neutral. But by the 24th January, when he published his message for the 60th World Day of Social Communications, his tone had starkly intensified. The technology threatens to alter the fundamental pillars of human civilisation, Leo XIV warned. It could “invade and occupy” our sphere of intimacy. We stand to lose our ability to understand meaning, “turning into passive consumers of unthought thoughts and anonymous products without ownership or love.”
It’s undeniably striking to hear the leader of one of the oldest religions in the world speaking so directly about the dangers of unguarded AI usage. We already know that AI is changing our minds and hearts, but could it change our faith? And why does it seem that, out of all the organised religions, Catholics are particularly bothered about it?
Fr Stephen thinks it has to do with the attitude towards struggle. “For the Christian, need and vulnerability and brokenness is not something to be avoided. There’s an understanding built into the theology that these are not just roadblocks to try and get around, but they're part of what our humanity is, and in this imperfect world, they're part of the way that we learn to love and to be loved.”
Perhaps Catholics are particularly preoccupied with AI because it’s precisely this type of friction which chatbots are built to remove. There’s the obvious danger that AI doesn’t work well. That it could be taken over by a bad actor, or used to spread more written and visual mis-truth and mis-information. We’ve already seen the fatal impact of AI failing to understand the nuances of human communication. But there’s a secondary, altogether more concerning possibility: that AI works really, really well.
The promise of every large language model is the same, whether it be ChatGPT, Claude, or Gemini. A lack of effort to get what you want, and a lack of friction in receiving it. “But If AI is substituting for my friend, my librarian, my teacher, my counselor, my companion, my prayer partner,” Fr Stephen continues, “I become isolated. I've lost the things which nurture what it is to be human, a friend, a brother, or a sister.” Things are not meant to be this easy.
It’s these anthropological questions that bug Fr Stephen, much more than whether AI is going to start a thermonuclear war or not. “Because that, at least, you have a chance to solve. But you can't solve the questions about our consciousness easily. As a Christian, they’re on my mind all the time.”
Fr Stephen admits to having a bit of déjà vu with the whole thing. It feels very much like the world has stood here before. Naoise Gresham, a senior policy and research analyst for the Catholic Bishops' Conference of England and Wales, agrees: “There's a sense that we were a bit behind when it came to social media. So now, we're working with AI to be a bit more kind of, if not ahead of the curve, then at least not as far behind.”
The difference here, he explains, is that in the early 2000s, when society was just starting to worry itself about social media, people in his community were primarily concerned about the content of the tool. Now, they’re worried about the effects of the tool on consciousness itself – and therefore, the consciousness we have about God.
Despite his simultaneous excitement and fear over AI, Fr Joseph finds comfort in the physicality of Catholicism. “Christianity in general, and especially Catholicism, are completely embodied religions, and have to stay that way. So that's why, as a Catholic thinker, I'm not worried that we'll go kind of stratospheric and become unrooted because we can't. Things might get very messy, and a lot of people might get broken and hurt on the way, but we’ll come back to the mass, to communion, to community.”
But could it be exactly this reliance on in-person rituals that puts Catholicism particularly at risk of losing worshippers to AI? These things require a combination of time and effort, which are two concepts we’re stripping more from our lives every day (see: the lack of friction thing), and you could argue that AI stands to be a fairly seamless substitute. The similarities are quite remarkable: both are something omnipresent, available to be called upon at any moment. They hold (or claim to hold) the answers to life’s greatest questions. They can be trusted to hear about your darkest secrets, and won’t tell a soul; will even comfort and absolve you of them. There to provide unwavering guidance and support in your loneliest moments, any time you need. The main difference between God and AI is that one of these things requires getting up and going to church, investing time into a community, building relationships, having discipline, maintaining dedication through doubt, and the frustration and persistence of undertaking a spiritual journey. The other lives inside your phone, for free.
Bishop Paul Henricks, the Lead Bishop for AI at the Catholic Bishops' Conference of England and Wales, finds the concept of someone fully replacing God with AI troubling. “I think it is, in a sense, only a matter of time. A relationship with a chatbot is less rewarding, obviously, but also less demanding. I guess that's the temptation. It's difficult to envisage, but I can't help thinking that someone's bound to, sooner or later.”
It’s one example of how AI could become ‘spiritually unhealthy’, Naoise says. “If the relationship is overly dependent, that would be, in a Christian Catholic sense, a form of idolatry. Tech or AI could become an idol, and be revered or worshipped, even if kind of unwittingly. It needs to be used as a tool. That distinction is really important.”
Bishop Paul half-jokes: “I used to have a rather pessimistic rule of thumb. If it's possible to do a stupid thing, sooner or later, someone's going to do it.”
Father Josef Wieneke, pastor at St Matthias Catholic Church in Berlin, remains hopeful that nothing will ever replace the power of church-going, or his physical and spiritual role within his religious community. “There are lots of professions under threat, but mine isn’t. The Catholic sacraments cannot be performed by a computer. They only work face to face,” he says.
“Which may even lead to people becoming more skeptical of the internet, so that the search for what is genuine, real and authentic becomes stronger. We've been telling the young people at our church for years: ‘If you've posted some nonsense on the internet, that's terrible. But if you confess a sin, God will forgive you and never remind you of it again.’ It would be gone forever.”
Fr Joseph isn’t quite so optimistic. “I don’t think that’s where most ordinary people are,” he says, somewhat sadly. “The slope is so steep that I don’t think most of us are capable of getting off it. That’s why I'm not campaigning that we stop it – but the other reason is that I think it's impossible. We're in an AI race, and no one can stop it.
“I do think things will get very bad for a lot of people in the next 10 years, for the reasons that we’ve spoken about. We will go down a slippery slope. We’ll adopt AI uncritically. It will have lots of intended and unintended consequences. Some of those are going to be very dark.”
When I point out that I can’t follow how this bleak vision of the future chimes with his earlier statements that humanity will overcome the challenges of AI, he disagrees. “I don’t think there’s a contradiction here. There’s enormous benefits, and great risks. But I really believe in my Christian faith, and that Christianity is built to survive. I'm hopeful that humanity and human wisdom and the tech people will be able to adjust it before one of the tech companies takes over, or we reach [artificial superintelligence] and we’re blown up. I think we will find our way forward with AI before…” Fr Joseph stops speaking and cocks his head to the side, thinking. “No, I’m contradicting myself now,” he realises. After pausing for a moment, he continues, nodding, once again assured: “No, I am hopeful. I'm hopeful that we will find our way before existential annihilation.”

Judge sentences teen to life without parole for fatally shooting 5 in North Carolina

Mass shooter who killed five people at age 15 is jailed for life
A handwritten note found at his family's house was revealed during the sentencing hearing
- Bookmark
A judge has sentenced an 18-year-old to life in prison without parole for killing five people in a mass shooting.
Austin David Thompson was 15 when he went on a rampage on Oct. 13, 2022. The attack started at his Raleigh home, where he shot and repeatedly stabbed his 16-year-old brother, James.
Equipped with firearms and wearing camouflage, Thompson then fatally shot four others — including an off-duty city police officer — in his neighborhood and along a greenway.
He was arrested in a shed after a self-inflicted gunshot wound to his head.
Thompson pleaded guilty last month to five counts of first-degree murder and five other counts less than two weeks before his scheduled trial.
Thompson, who did not speak in court, was led away in handcuffs after the sentencing. Family members of the shooting victims cried as the sentence was handed down. Thompson’s attorneys announced plans to appeal the sentence.
Superior Court Judge Paul Ridgeway judge had the option to sentence him to life in prison with the chance for parole after at least 25 years, but Thompson did not face the death penalty given his age at the time of the crimes.
“It’s hard to conceive of a greater display of malice,” Ridgeway said, adding that months of planning and fantasizing by Thompson to carry out the rampage also confirmed that Thompson is the rare juvenile offender “whose crimes reflect irreparable corruption.”
During the sentencing hearing that began last week, prosecutors revealed the previously confidential contents of a handwritten note with Thompson’s name and the shooting date found at his family's house in the Hedingham subdivision.
The note said the “reason I did this is because I hate humans they are destroying the planet/earth,” adding that he killed James Thompson ”because he would get in my way.”
Thompson “cannot tell you why he wrote that note the way that he did,” defense lawyer Deonte’ Thomas said, noting that he had no history of ecological-based anger. “And he cannot tell you why he ran down the streets of Hedingham terrorizing people that day.”
But “he is not unredeemable, he is not incorrigible,” Thomas added in asking Ridgeway to give him the opportunity one day to tell parole commissioners he could “still be a productive person in society.”
Thomas argued that the rampage happened during a behavioral episode caused by medicine he regularly took for acne which dissociated the youth from reality. A psychiatrist who interviewed Thompson and a geneticist testified to bolster the explanation.
Ridgeway decided the evidence did not support the conclusion that Thompson’s acts happened while he entered an altered mental state induced by the medication and a genetic abnormality.
Prosecutors dismissed the medication argument as weak and highlighted Thompson’s internet search history on his phone and computer leading up to the attack. They said it included school shootings and were related to guns, assaults and bomb-making materials.
Nicole Connors, 52; Raleigh police Officer Gabriel Torres, 29; Mary Marshall, 34; and Susan Karnatz, 49, also were killed in the rampage. Two other people were wounded, including another police officer involved in the search for Thompson.
“In the blink of an eye, everything changed for those people and for the people that they left behind,” Wake County assistant prosecutor Patrick Latour said Thursday while urging a sentence with no potential parole. “And the thing that made it change was not some acne medication. It was the defendant’s knowing, researched, well thought out, planned, decisive actions.”
The judge heard from people like Jasmin Torres, the widow of Gabriel Torres and the mother of their 5-year-old daughter. She asked Ridgeway to sentence Thompson to life without parole, calling him a “monster.”
“Not one of us surviving victims, our families, our friends, our community should ever have to worry about a future where his barbaric self is set free,” Torres said last week.
Thompson’s parents testified they couldn’t explain why their son committed the violence, calling him a normal, happy kid who did well in school and showed no signs of destruction.
Thompson’s father pleaded guilty to improperly storing his handgun that authorities said was found when his son was arrested. He received a suspended sentence and probation.
“We both lost our children, one at the hand of the other. We never saw this coming and still cannot make sense of it,” mother Elise Thompson said last week while telling the families of shooting victims she will “forever be sorry for the pain that this has caused you.”

EU weighs two-track approach to break economic reform deadlock
Sign up now: Get ST's newsletters delivered to your inbox
BRUSSELS, Feb 13 - EU governments have long preached unity as the best response to U.S. and Chinese economic pressure, but are discovering they need urgently to boost Europe's competitiveness and that waiting for all 27 member states to agree may take too long.
That was the clear message from an informal EU summit in Belgium on Thursday, where French President Emmanuel Macron and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen gave the bloc until June to progress on a stalled union of financial markets.
The Capital Markets Union would allow the bloc to invest at scale at a level to match the United States, but vested interests in various countries and professional groups have held back any integration for more than a decade.
Now, unless there is sufficient progress by June, a smaller group of at least nine European Union members could press ahead in "enhanced cooperation" with the required steps and reforms, von der Leyen and Macron said.
"Often we move forward with the speed of the slowest and the enhanced cooperation avoids that," von der Leyen told reporters on Thursday. "The pressure and the sense of urgency is enormous, and that can move mountains."
The first movers could be the six leading economies who took part in talks last month hosted by Germany on a "Europe of two speeds" to break decision-making inertia and galvanise the EU economy. The other five countries were France, Italy, Spain, Poland and the Netherlands.
If EU leaders needed a reminder of threats to their economic model, data showed on Friday that the bloc's trade surplus shrank further in December as tariffs weighed on exports to the U.S. and rising Chinese imports crowded out domestic production.
MULTI-SPEED EU ALREADY EXISTS
Some of those not invited to the German-led group of six have expressed alarm.
"It is a good idea to threaten member states to agree on some files, but a very bad idea for the future of Europe," said one EU diplomat.
"Quite simply, it just flies in the face of the unity we like to parade in other areas," said another.
But a third diplomat said it was clear that plan A was to make progress with all 27 EU members and it was good to have a plan B.
"It's a hostile world out there. Prosperity is under threat if these bottlenecks continue," the third diplomat said, noting that Europe already operated at different speeds elsewhere.
Certain flagship EU projects, including the euro currency and the Schengen passport-free travel zone, allow groups of EU countries to move ahead, while others can join later.
The Schengen area, for example, does not include Cyprus or Ireland, but does include four non-EU countries. The European Public Prosecutor's Office has 24 EU participants and the Unitary Patent system 18.
As recently as December, EU leaders agreed to provide a 90 billion euro loan to Ukraine, but the Czech Republic, Hungary and Slovakia opted out.
Karel Lannoo, CEO of the Centre for European Policy Studies, said the EU should still try to advance as 27, not "become more concentric circles".
"You need to advance as Europe, and that's what we need to see also in the context of the threats from the United States and Russia," he said.
The European Policy Centre think-tank said a coalition of the willing was no silver bullet, noting that talks on creating the Capital Markets Union had been long held up by disagreements among big EU members, including France, Germany and Italy.
European Council President Antonio Costa, who chaired Thursday's meeting, said the topic of a coalition of the willing was not part of the official discussions, but diplomats said it was raised on the sidelines.
"Europe has never really suffered from a lack of plans or grand vision; the real obstacle has almost always been weak implementation and national interests taking precedence over European ones," ING Bank economists Carsten Brzeski and Bert Colijn said in a note to clients.
"Whether this time will be any different remains to be seen." REUTERS

Epstein files rock Columbia as two officials are fired

ALBAWABA - Columbia University fired two administrators after it came to light that the girlfriend of convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein got into one of their classes through what the school said were "unusual procedures."
As part of a larger release by the U.S. Department of Justice, new documents linked to Epstein showed internal communications that made people question the honesty of the admissions process. This led to the action.
The university said in a statement that the emails showed exchanges that did not meet its standards for fairness and honesty in admissions decisions.
Reversal of Admission Brings Up Questions
Reports say that Karyna Shuliak, a Belarusian woman who was said to be Epstein's last known girlfriend, had her entry to Columbia's dental school turned down in early 2012.
But records show that Epstein talked about her enrollment with top university leaders a few weeks later. By May 2012, Shuliak knew for sure that she would be able to start the fall term as a transfer student.
According to the released records, Ira Lamster, who was Dean of the Dental School at the time, emailed Epstein about Shuliak's admission and told him that her "special status" meant that her visa would not be a problem.
In the end, Shuliak passed from the program in 2015. She had studied dentistry for four years in Belarus before starting at Columbia. In 2010, she moved to the United States.
Talks About Donations
The papers also show that when Shuliak was accepted, university officials were talking with Epstein about a possible gift of several million dollars.
Later, Lamster told the media that while the university was trying to get Epstein to give a lot of money, Shuliak's application would be looked at on its own merits. He also said that the gift offer was turned down after more thought.
Epstein also gave $100,000 to Columbia's School of Public Health before Shuliak started her studies. The money went to a research project connected to Lamster, according to the records.
Response from Institutions
Columbia University said it had taken action against two people with ties to the medical school, but it didn't say who they were.
The case has made people look more closely at Epstein's connections with academic institutions and how much his money may have changed how those institutions made decisions.

How fast is “fast” at a UK online casino?
A fast withdrawal casino is one that processes payouts within minutes or hours rather than days. In the UK, instant payouts are often completed in under 15 minutes using methods like PayPal, Trustly or Apple Pay, while same-day withdrawals typically arrive within 24 hours.
Actual speeds vary between even the best online casino sites, depending on payment method and verification status.
How We Evaluate Fast Withdrawal Casinos
Recommending a fast withdrawal casino is something we approach with care. Every site we list has been independently tested to confirm that its payout speeds match what it claims.
Our review process combines licensing checks, hands-on testing for instant payouts, transparency analysis and player experience.
Licensing & Regulation All casinos must be fully licensed by the UK Gambling Commission (UKGC), guaranteeing secure payments, protected funds and access to independent dispute resolution.
Payment Transparency True fast payouts require clarity. We only recommend casinos that publish full details on withdrawal times, limits, payment methods and fees.
Real-World Testing We deposit, play and withdraw using multiple methods — including debit card, PayPal and Trustly — to confirm real payout times and consistency.
24/7 Processing Top casinos handle withdrawals automatically, with payments processed round the clock, even on weekends and bank holidays.
Streamlined KYC Verification is essential but shouldn’t delay payouts. The best sites complete KYC quickly during sign-up, preventing unnecessary hold-ups when you withdraw.
Fast Withdrawal Casinos UK
We’ve broken down our list of fast withdrawal casino sites into three categories: instant, fast and same-day withdrawal casinos.
All our recommended fast withdrawal casinos are licensed and regulated by the UK Gambling Commission.
Best Instant Withdrawal Casinos
A growing number of online casinos claim to offer instant payouts, with punters receiving their funds in under an hour, depending on their preferred banking option.
Here’s our list of recommended instant withdrawal casino sites and the payment methods you’ll need to use to receive funds in 15 minutes or less.
Bet365 Casino
Bet365 Payment Methods
Apple Pay users will find banking with bet365 a breeze with the online casino pledging to process withdrawals in a matter of minutes using the service.
Punters can also unlock the bet365 welcome offer with an Apple Pay deposit, while the withdrawal limit of £20,000 using Apple Pay should satisfy most high rollers.
Bet365 have other speedy withdrawal methods, such as a Paysafecard. They are one of only a handful of Paysafecard casinos to allow bettors to make withdrawals.
The Stoke-based bookmaker will allow punters to withdraw up to £2,000 using a Paysafecard. The funds are sent to customers as a prepaid voucher and bet365 claim they will process any payment requests in as little as one hour.
Betfair Casino
Betfair Payment Methods
Typically, withdrawals made via debit cards have tended to be slower than those made via other casino payment methods. However, after coming under pressure from e-wallets, the banks have fought back by offering instant withdrawals, which some fast withdrawal casino operators have picked up.
Betfair offer the service and pledges to process the majority of withdrawals instantly. All Visa debit cards and selected Mastercard debit cards are covered by instant withdrawals and Betfair pledges to have the money in your account in no more than four hours.
With standard card payments taking between two and five working days to hit a user’s account, it’s hardly a tough decision for punters over which type of card payment they would prefer to use.
Other payment options, such as e-wallets and Paysafecard, are available on Betfair, but the best option are the instant card withdrawals, particularly as card payments are eligible to qualify for the welcome bonus of deposit and bet £10, get 150 free spins.
Sky Vegas
Sky Vegas Payment Options
Sky Vegas provide plenty of information on the withdrawal process, laying out the best methods if you want an instant withdrawal. There are many options, so bettors looking for Paypal and other e-wallets may want to go elsewhere.
They offer to complete Pay By Bank payments instantly with most major high street banks serviced.
If you can’t do Pay By Bank, all Mastercard debit customers can also get withdrawals paid within an hour of being approved.
All other withdrawal options are measured in days. We found the Pay By Bank option painless, once you’ve made a deposit from your account, and our withdrawal arrived in a matter of minutes during testing.
MrQ
MrQ Payment Methods
High rollers will be familiar with bank transfers, as they are often the preferred payment method used when large sums of money need to be withdrawn. Additionally, they incur no transaction fees and offer greater security than other methods. That said, bank transfers can take several days, hardly ideal for anyone wanting a fast withdrawal casino.
However, MrQ guarantee any bank transfers will be completed instantly, or they’ll pay you £10 as part of their lightning-fast withdrawal guarantee.
Using the instant bank transfer services means payments can be processed and completed within seconds. While it may sound too good to be true, it is widely supported by most of the big-name UK banks.
Rapid bank transfers are just one of four payment options available on MrQ - fewer than the majority of instant payout casinos - but that doesn’t feel like such a big issue when everything MrQ does just works.
Ladbrokes
Ladbrokes Payment Methods
Ladbrokes are a big-name brand in the world of online casinos, and with good reason. They have one of the highest-rated casino apps available and excellent live options, making them a popular pick for gamers.
Now, using their app or mobile betting site has been made even more user-friendly with the implementation of Google Pay.
Withdrawals can be made using Google Play from as little as £5. Any withdrawals made using Google Pay will be in your account instantly, according to Ladbrokes.
The deposit limit is set at a sizeable £5000 and players can qualify for the Ladbrokes welcome offer when they join and make an initial deposit using Google Play.
Best fast withdrawal casinos UK
Below are our recommended fast withdrawal casinos. They all process withdrawals within one hour, depending on your preferred payment method, which is still excellent for punters wanting quick access to their funds.
Pub Casino
Pub Casino Payment Methods
Pub Casino is a great option for Neteller users seeking a quick casino payout. One of the best new casino sites, Pub Casino claim that any withdrawal using the payment platform will be processed instantly.
Neteller, for those not in the know, is another e-wallet like PayPal or Skrill that’s linked to your bank account, meaning you don’t have to share your financial details with an online casino.
Pub Casino does require you to verify your identity before you can deposit, and be aware that you can not qualify for the Pub Casino welcome offer if you make your initial deposit using either Neteller or Skrill.
As well as being an under one hour withdrawal casino, Pub Casino have a reputation as one of the UK’s top slot sites, thanks in part to a huge selection of slots with regular updates of their library to include all the new slots to hit the market.
PokerStars Casino
PokerStars Casino payment options
The list of e-wallets accepted by online casinos changes regularly and the number of MuchBetter casino sites available has increased quickly as the digital payment service has grown in popularity.
MuchBetter is a prepaid service, making it easier to track your online spending and for users of PokerStars, it’s an option for instant withdrawals.
PokerStars doesn’t accept PayPal so bettors will need an alternative e-wallet. MuchBetter is a strong option with PokerStars pledging to process withdrawals made using MuchBetter instantly, or in one hour if the withdrawal amount exceeds the total sum deposited.
Pay By Bank, Neteller, Skrill and Luxon Pay also qualify for instant withdrawals at a fast withdrawal casino that is very transparent when it comes to its payment options.
There are also no restrictions on the payment method needed to unlock the huge PokerStars sign up offer.
Virgin Bet
Virgin Bet payment options
Virgin Bet are another fast withdrawal casino that doesn’t have a wide selection of payment methods with only four options, but two of them promise instant payouts.
Virgin Bet pledges to complete any payments made using Apple Pay and PayPal instantly, although this depends on how quickly the withdrawal request is processed by the operator.
In our experience, payment requests were dealt with in a timely fashion and a lot of the payments arrived in our account within the hour.
Away from their banking system, Virgin Bet with regular free spin offers, free-to-play games, a solid welcome bonus and a well-reviewed mobile app.
BetMGM
BetMGM payment options
For such a massive gambling brand, BetMGM have a relatively small list of banking options. And for those wanting fast withdrawals, they may be best off avoiding debit card and bank transfer transactions, which can take up to three business days to complete.
Those processing times can get longer if a withdrawal extends into a weekend or bank holiday. However, despite BetMGM’s caution over withdrawal times, our testing revealed that Apple Pay and PayPal payments tend to come through in less than an hour.
It helps if you’ve previously used Apple Pay or PayPal to make a deposit, as that will speed up any withdrawal.
BetMGM has quickly established itself as one of the UK’s most popular online casinos, thanks to a strong sign-up offer, a great range of slot titles and regular promotions.
PlayOJO
PlayOJO payment options
We were impressed with the level of detail PlayOJO go into when explaining how to make deposits and withdrawals using one of their five available methods, the online casino highlighting the processing with images and step-by-step guides.
The major omissions were the maximum withdrawal limits and an estimation of withdrawal times, which were a little harder to uncover.
In our testing, we found that PayPal, Apple Pay and instant bank transfer withdrawals were all delivered in under an hour, with an average time of 45 minutes. Once processed by PlayOJO, payments were quick to hit our accounts.
PlayOJO have collected plenty of awards over the years from within the industry to suggest they are a top online casino and we like the idea of earning cash back as an OJOPlus member. However, not all bettors have had a positive experience with PlayOJO, judging by several posts on Reddit about the fast withdrawal casino.
Same-day withdrawal casinos
Our final category features operators that are reliable and prompt with most payments, but can’t quite be described as a fast withdrawal casino yet.
Ivy Casino
Ivy Casino Payment Methods
Ivy Casino are the latest online casino from Betable, which operates nine other gambling sites. As a result, there’s a bit of a familiar look to Ivy Casino, but don’t let that put you off from making it your go-to PayPal casino.
Ivy Casino aim to process all withdrawal requests in four hours and says that the majority of payments are made to customers instantly, no matter which payment option you choose. Ivy Casino allows withdrawals of up to £10,000 to be made using PayPal and claims deposits using the e-wallet should be processed without delay.
It’s worth noting that PayPal is widely accepted across many fast payout casinos, but what makes Ivy Casino different is that PayPal isn’t excluded from their list of payment options when it comes to qualifying for their sign up offer.
Ivy Casino have a pretty standard welcome offer, awarding new customers a casino bonus of 20 no-wagering free spins on Big Bass Splash.
Once signed up, players will find a decent range of offers, including opportunities to unlock no-wagering free spins and claim cash prizes.
QuinnCasino
QuinnCasino Payment Methods
Revolut is a payment method only accepted at a handful of online casinos. It offers instant deposits and withdrawals, but just remember to uncheck the gambling block option on your Revolut account before trying to complete a transaction.
QuinnCasino is a high payout casino that accepts Revolut and guarantees that all withdrawals will be processed in approximately 24 hours, with most payments reaching accounts on the same day.
That 24-hour threshold can only be met if players have completed the verification process - so make sure to do this when you sign up.
QuinnBet has plenty of offers available, with a different one every single day, alongside weekly promotions, including 10 per cent cashback on any losses.
The sign-up offer has recently been updated and will appeal to fans of online slots, with new customers now able to secure 50 free spins on Big Bass Splash when they wager £10.
All British Casino
All British Casino Payment Methods
All British Casino accepts a large range of payment methods, including the e-wallet Skrill.
Skrill is similar to PayPal, allowing you to send and receive funds using an email address linked to a debit card or bank account. The combination of Skrill and All British Casino is a recipe made for those looking for an instant withdrawal casino.
Do keep in mind, though, that any withdrawals from All British Casino made via Skrill on a weekend will not be processed till the following Monday.
Another drawback of using Skrill is that the All British sign-up offer excludes qualifying deposits made via Skrill, meaning punters will have to choose another payment method.
888 Casino
888 Casino payment methods
888 Casino are clear and concise with their explanations on time frames for making withdrawals, depending on your banking method.
Using 888 Casino’s withdrawal table, bettors can see that withdrawals made using Trustly tend to be calculated and paid the same day.
That’s quicker than many rival Trustly casinos, the number of which continue to grow in the UK as the service becomes more and more popular.
Trustly can be used to activate the 888 Casino sign up offer, which gives new customers 100 free spins on selected Pragmatic Play slot titles after they deposit and wager a minimum of £10.
Fastest Payment Methods For Instant Casino Withdrawals
Getting your winnings quickly can depend not only on the casino you choose but also on your preferred payment method. Below, we’ve listed the best options for a fast casino withdrawal, based on the average time casinos take to process payments using these methods.
Apple Pay
- Processing times: Instant - 24 hours
- Withdrawal limits: £5 - £40,000
This incredibly convenient service for iPhone and iPad users means transactions can be completed in just one tap, while the number of online casinos offering instant Apple Pay withdrawals is growing all the time.
PayPal
- Processing times: Instant - 24 hours
- Withdrawal limits: £5 - £30,000
PayPal remains the gold standard for speed and reliability when it comes to e-wallets and instant withdrawals from casinos. One of the most widely accepted e-wallets in the UK, PayPal is readily available at most online casinos and doesn’t charge fees for any withdrawals.
Skrill
- Processing times: Instant - 24 hours
- Withdrawal limits: £5 - £20,000
Instant withdrawals are available at selected online casinos with Skrill, who offer a prepaid Mastercard service, meaning you can instantly turn your winnings into cash and spend them anywhere Mastercard is accepted.
Visa Fast Funds
- Processing times: 30 minutes - 24 hours
- Withdrawal limits: £5 - £10,000
Gone are the days of debit card withdrawals taking days, with online casinos now having the ability to send a payment through using Visa Fast Funds in 30 minutes. This service offers the same level of security as a debit card withdrawal and means your funds go straight into your bank account.
Trustly
- Processing times: 10 minutes - 24 hours
- Withdrawal limits: £10 - £10,000
Trustly can complete instant casino withdrawals without the need to share your bank details with a gambling site. Trustly uses open banking technology to facilitate fast payments while offering high-level security.
Instant bank transfer

- Withdrawal limits: £10 - £100,000
Selected banks and online casinos now offer a fast withdrawal bank transfer that bypasses the more traditional BACS method. This is a great option for anyone who needs to withdraw a large sum of money and doesn’t want to use a third-party.
How to cash out at an instant withdrawal casino
Most online casinos follow similar withdrawal processes. Below is a step-by-step guide to conducting a withdrawal from an online casino, using BetMGM as an example.
1. Log in to your account and head to the banking or cashier option on your my account page.
2. Select withdraw from the list of options on the banking page.
3. Choose one of the payment options for your withdrawal. For a fast withdrawal, it tends to best to use a method you’ve previously made a deposit from.
4. Enter the amount you wish to take out and click withdraw. You may be presented with a confirmation page. Check all the details are correct before going ahead.
5. Wait for verification. Some fast withdrawal casinos will have a pending withdrawal section where you can check the status of your withdrawal.
Why casino withdrawals can be delayed
Despite the best efforts of fast withdrawal casinos, payment delays can still occur. These tend to be caused by routine checks or human error, rather than technical problems, and can easily be avoided.
Here are some of the reasons payments from a fast withdrawal casino are sometimes delayed:
- Account verification (KYC): UK-licensed casinos must verify a player’s identity before processing withdrawals. If requested documents haven’t been provided and subsequently approved, payments will be held. To avoid any delays, complete the KYC steps during sign-up.
- Payment method alterations: Many casinos require withdrawals to be made using the same method as the deposit, which can slow down the process if an alternative is selected. Try to stick to one method of banking at a casino.
- Active bonus wagering: Any outstanding wagering requirements must be completed before funds can be released. Check the account balance to see if you have any bonus funds if a payment is held.
- Timing of the request: Withdrawals requested late at night, on weekends or on bank holidays may be processed more slowly. Some fast withdrawal casinos do process payments 24/7, but not all of them.
- Large withdrawal amounts: Higher-value payouts are often subject to additional internal checks.
What is KYC verification and how to complete it
KYC stands for Know Your Customer and is used by several industries to verify the identity of a user and manage any risk to the organisation.
Online casinos are required by law to carry out these checks and risk huge fines or losing their license if they don’t implement these measures, which are designed to protect the consumer, guard against money laundering and fraud.
A KYC check is often carried out during registration with an online casino or the first time a punter makes a withdrawal, and if not done correctly, it can nullify the ability of a casino to make an instant payment.
Here’s what you’ll need to make sure your fast withdrawal casino of choice remains able to make quick payments.
- Proof of identity: Casinos may ask for photo ID, such as a passport or UK driving licence, to confirm your identity before allowing withdrawals. They may also ask for you to take a selgie next to your identification document.
- Proof of address: You may need to provide a recent document, like a utility bill or bank statement, to verify your current UK address.
- Age verification: To confirm you’re over 18, casinos may request ID if automatic age checks fail.
- Payment method verification: Online casinos can ask you to verify that the payment method used belongs to you, usually with card images.
- Source of funds/wealth checks: This is likely to apply only if you are betting large amounts, but casinos may ask for evidence of the source of your gambling funds, such as payslips or bank statements.
- Affordability checks: As part of new regulations designed to keep players safe, some UK casino sites carry out risk-based checks to ensure gambling remains affordable, which may involve income checks or open banking (with consent).
Please Gamble Responsibly
Playing at a fast withdrawal casino means you should be able to collect your winnings almost immediately, but it’s just as important to keep gambling safe and balanced.
Whether you prefer betting sites, poker sites, betting apps, or any other types of popular gambling apps, setting personal limits and sticking to them can help you stay in control.
The most reputable instant withdrawal casino sites in the UK offer built-in safety tools, such as deposit caps, cooling-off periods, and full self-exclusion options.
These features make it easier to manage your bankroll, take breaks when needed, and ensure gambling remains fun. Remember not to get too carried away by free bet offers or casino bonuses.
If you start to feel gambling is affecting you negatively, reach out to support services like GamCare or BeGambleAware for confidential help.

The Palestine Action ruling vindicates the courageous – and shames the complicit | Owen Jones
Unknown
Unknown Publisher
2026-02-13
15:29:54 UTC
00:29:54 KST

This is a day of humiliation for those who facilitated Israel’s genocide in Gaza – and a moment of vindication for those who stood against “the crime of crimes”. It is worth underlining what the high court in London has today ruled to be unlawful: our government’s decision to place the direct-action group Palestine Action on the same legal footing as al-Qaida and Islamic State. Legally speaking, simply showing support for it risked a jail sentence of up to 14 years. The consequences? More than 2,700 people arrested for holding placards opposing genocide and supporting Palestine Action, many of them elderly, including a retired octogenarian priest.
No one who engages in criminal damage for a political cause imagines they will avoid arrest. As the court ruling makes clear, normal criminal law remains available for such acts. But when a government applies the badge of “terrorism” to movements that, however disorderly, are clearly not terrorist movements, an alarming precedent is set. As the court recognised, the proscription interferes with rights to freedom of expression, to peaceful assembly and free associations with others. You do not need a fevered imagination to see how a future Reform UK government could build on such a precedent. (As things stand, the ban on the group remains in effect so the government has time to appeal.)
The judges’ ruling did argue that Palestine Action’s adoption of direct action goes beyond civil disobedience. That’s because it seeks to damage property – primarily, to destroy equipment belonging to the Israeli arms manufacturer Elbit Systems. Well, fine, but then the suffragettes weren’t a civil disobedience movement either. Today, they are secular saints, lauded by some of the same MPs who voted to proscribe Palestine Action, even though their tactics were far more extreme. Let’s not forget, the suffragettes planted bombs, burned down private homes and even killed people.
History’s judgment on that movement is clear: the greater crime was the disenfranchisement of women. Their actions are seen through that prism.
In this case, a UN independent commission, genocide scholars and NGOs ranging from Amnesty International to Médecins Sans Frontières have concluded that Israel has committed genocide against the Palestinian people. The international criminal court (ICC) – of which the UK is a founding member – long ago issued arrest warrants for Israel’s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, and his former defence minister for alleged war crimes and crimes against humanity. Britain supplies crucial components for Israel’s fighter jets, shares intelligence and permits its citizens to fight in Israel’s army.
In the abstract, how would a reasonable person respond if asked: “If you have strong grounds to conclude that your own government is facilitating genocide – the crime of crimes – should you do whatever it takes to stop it, even if that means breaking the law?” That is undoubtedly a question English juries have wrestled with, because they have repeatedly acquitted Palestine Action activists hauled before the court. No wonder the government wants to curb trial by jury.
Our home secretary, Shabana Mahmood, has declared that she will “fight” the judgment in the court of appeal. It is worth noting that according to his published correspondence with Peter Mandelson, Mahmood’s cabinet colleague Wes Streeting declared last year: “Israel is committing war crimes before our eyes.” Moreover, more than a decade ago, Mahmood was marching against an Israeli onslaught against Gaza which – however horrific – was not anywhere near the scale of the current genocide.
It stretches incredulity to believe that Mahmood does not share Streeting’s conclusion that Israel has committed war crimes, because denying that is like subscribing to flat-Earthism. The British government refuses to state the obvious because that would impose legal obligations on it. For a start, it would not be lawful to supply the crucial components of fighter jets to a state committing war crimes. That’s why the then foreign secretary backtracked last year when he described Israel’s blockade of Gaza as what it is: a violation of international law.
In sum, smashing up the equipment of an Israeli arms manufacturer isn’t lawful – but neither is arming a state committing war crimes, and indeed genocide. Which should we treat as the most serious?
There is one major question to be answered. After Palestine Action vandalised Donald Trump’s Turnberry golf resort in Scotland in March 2025 – before the group was proscribed – the president described them as “terrorists” and expressed hope they would be “treated harshly”. We also know that Trump discussed Palestine Action twice with our prime minister. The contents of that conversation must be revealed to establish whether proscription was discussed.
That only 26 MPs voted against this unlawful legislation tells you everything you need to know about our soulless, cowardly political establishment. But those who have facilitated genocide should begin to panic. The suffragettes, alas, did not have court rulings in their favour at the time, and their cause was – however absurdly – controversial. Women did not receive the vote in full until 1928, and the suffragettes’ canonisation came decades later.
But polling shows that the British public believes Israel’s attack on Gaza was not justified, supports an arms embargo and sanctions against Israel, and supports the arrest of Netanyahu. Polling in the US shows that half of Americans believe Israel has committed genocide, with just over a third disagreeing. That the ICC issued arrest warrants despite colossal western pressure is another sign of where this all leads.
It is obvious that Israel’s genocide will be remembered as one of the great crimes of our age. Those complicit will be damned by history, and may one day find themselves hauled before the courts. Those who were arrested for holding placards will be vindicated as courageous fighters against the worst crime that can possibly exist. Whether Mahmood wins or loses her appeal, that reckoning is coming.

Billboard outside Old Trafford takes aim at Jim Ratcliffe after anti-immigration claim
A billboard praising immigrants has been displayed outside Old Trafford after Manchester United co-owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe claimed that the UK had been “colonised” by migrants.
He incorrectly claimed that the UK population had risen by 12 million since 2020 - it has risen by an estimated 2.7 million. He has since apologised for his comments.
On Friday (13 February), British protest group Everybody Hates Elon released a video showing the installation of a poster outside the stadium which read: “Immigrants have done more for this city than billionaire tax dodgers ever will.”
Sir Jim has been living in tax-free Monaco since 2020.

German Chancellor Merz urges US to repair ties with Europe
France
Unknown Publisher

00:29:15 KST

German Chancellor Friedrich Merz acknowledged, on Friday, February 13, that a rift had opened up between Europe and the United States but issued an appeal to Washington: "Let's repair and revive transatlantic trust together."
Merz was giving the opening address to the Munich Security Conference, against a backdrop of rapidly worsening ties between Europe and the US. US Secretary of State Marco Rubio was among the top American figures in the audience.
"Let me begin with the uncomfortable truth: A rift, a deep divide has opened between Europe and the United States," Merz told the gathering, attended by dozens of leaders, defence chiefs and foreign ministers from around the world. From US President Donald Trump's threats to seize Greenland, to his tariff blitz and his administration's warning that Europe faces "civilisational erasure," transatlantic ties have been dropped to the lowest level in years.
"Vice President JD Vance said this a year ago here in Munich. He was right in his description," he said, referring to a 2025 speech in which Vance also accused Europe of stifling free speech and other democratic rights.
'Change,' 'upheaval' and even 'sacrifice'
The tone of much of his address was dark, as he warned of worsening geopolitical tensions and called on Europe to bolster its defences. "In the era of great power rivalry, even the United States will not be powerful enough to go it alone," said the conservative leader, traditionally a staunch supporter of the transatlantic alliance.
Merz warned that, in such an era, freedoms long taken for granted were increasingly "endangered." "This will require us to be prepared for change, for upheaval – and, yes, even for sacrifice."
Merz then struck a more hopeful note, as he called on the US and Europe to forge a "new transatlantic partnership." "Dear friends, being a part of NATO is not only Europe's competitive advantage. It's also the United States's competitive advantage. So let's repair and revive transatlantic trust together," Merz said. "We, the Europeans – we are doing our part."
In a sign of Europe's worries that long-standing US security commitments are in danger under the Trump administration, Merz also said he had held "confidential talks" with French President Emmanuel Macron about nuclear deterrence.
He has previously said he was open to France extending its nuclear deterrent in Europe. Germany, which cannot acquire its own atomic weapons due to treaty obligations, has traditionally relied on the US nuclear umbrella via its participation in NATO.

Trump administration sues Harvard seeking documents on its admission process
The Justice Department clarified that the lawsuit ‘does not accuse Harvard of any discriminatory conduct’

Donald Trump's administration has launched a fresh lawsuit against Harvard University, alleging its failure to cooperate with a federal investigation and demanding documents pertaining to its admissions procedures.
The legal action, filed in a Boston federal court by U.S. Justice Department lawyers, states that the requested documents are crucial for evaluating Harvard's adherence to a 2023 Supreme Court ruling that deemed race-conscious college admissions programs unconstitutional.
The Justice Department clarified that the lawsuit was initiated "solely to compel Harvard to produce documents relating to any consideration of race in admission" and "does not accuse Harvard of any discriminatory conduct, nor does it seek monetary damages or the revocation of federal funding." Representatives for Harvard did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
Earlier this month, President Trump indicated his administration was pursuing $1 billion from Harvard to resolve inquiries into its policies, following reports that he had rescinded an earlier demand for payment from the Ivy League institution.
Harvard has been a key target in the administration's wider campaign to use federal funding as leverage to enforce changes at US universities, which Trump claims are plagued by antisemitic and "radical left" ideologies.
This campaign has seen the administration cancel hundreds of grants to Harvard researchers, citing the university's alleged failure to adequately address harassment of Jewish students on campus, a move that led Harvard to launch its own lawsuit.
Harvard University sued the Trump administration last year, accusing the White House of violating its free speech rights by freezing federal funding to punish it for its refusal to take action against students for their beliefs.
"The government has not — and cannot — identify any rational connection between antisemitism concerns and the medical, scientific, technological and other research it has frozen that aims to save American lives, foster American success, preserve American security, and maintain America's position as a global leader in innovation,” the university said at the time.

Pride Festival in Zurich to charge admission
The Pride Festival in Zurich is to be downsized this year and will now charge admission. This is intended to secure funding after sponsors pulled out.
+Get the most important news from Switzerland in your inbox
“After thorough analysis, we have decided to hold the Zurich Pride Festival 2026 on a smaller, more predictable scale at Turbinenplatz,” the organisers announced on Friday.
A ticket must now be purchased to attend the festival. This should ensure planning security and stabilise liquidity. The measures are intended to make the organisation behind the event financially stable and independent in the long term. Various large companies have recently reduced or cancelled their sponsorship of Pride in Zurich and other cities.

The measures have not yet been finalised. The association’s members will vote on this at an extraordinary general meeting next week. Within a short space of time, the announcement published on Instagram was met with a number of disappointed and critical responses as well as understanding comments.
The Zurich Pride demonstration is not affected by the measures. The event will take place on June 19-20.

Love on the big stage: Couples star in Broadway's 'Aladdin' and 'The Lion King'

Love on the big stage: Couples star in Broadway's 'Aladdin' and 'The Lion King'
Rodney Ingram plays the title role of “Aladdin” on Broadway, and he shares the stage with his new wife, Sonia
- Bookmark
This Valentine's Day, Rodney Ingram will be doing what he loves with the one he loves. All on Broadway.
The newlywed plays the title role in Disney's “Aladdin” alongside his wife, Sonia, who covers multiple roles. It's a workplace romance at the pinnacle of musical theater.
“This is so rare,” he says. “This is such a gift and a dream. I couldn’t have thought to have even prayed for it.”
The couple first met in Mexico City on the first day of rehearsal of “Aladdin” in 2021. She joined the Broadway show in 2024, and they were married last December.
Then the call came this winter for Ingram to step into the role of Aladdin permanently. He didn't have to think about it. Plus, his favorite person was there.
“This is her show,” he jokes. “I’m just living in it.”
Love is in the air
The Ingrams aren’t the only couple working together on Broadway. They’re not even the only Disney couple. A few blocks away, Mduduzi Madela and Nteliseng Nkhela are both in “The Lion King.”
“It’s beyond any of my wildest dreams,” says Madela, who was raised in South Africa and has been picked to step into the role of Simba permanently later this month. “My wife is the one who’s the proudest and she’s the very first person to announce it to anyone.”
He joined the Broadway company in 2013, following several years in other productions around the world. She joined the Broadway ensemble in 2010 and understudies Rafiki. They got married in 2021 and have two daughters.
Madela met his future wife at a workshop for “The Lion King” in South Africa in 2003. Their friendship lasted a decade until things took a turn into more serious territory.
Both have been onstage as Simba and Rafiki as their daughters watched in the Minskoff Theatre seats, an astonishingly rare moment. “It’s not a usual phenomenon to see both your parents on the Broadway stage at the same time,” he says, laughing.
How Rodney met Sonia
Back at “Aladdin,” Rodney Ingram's rise to the title role caps a remarkable ascension for a young actor who was raised in the tiny Mexican fishing village of Sayulita and fell in love with DVDs of musicals.
It started with a love of music. Ingram recalls always wanting to sing with the mariachi bands and falling in love with “My Fair Lady” and “Fiddler on the Roof.”
“I just remember imitating them on screen and just watching over and over, becoming kind of obsessed with musicals. That same passion still exists today,” he says.
When it came time to audition for musical theater schools in New York, a rude awakening awaited. “I had no formal training, only the love of the game,” he says.
He found himself competing against trained actors who knew their way around a pirouette. He had never taken a dance class. Ingram faced rejection but vowed to get better.
“I think that motivated me even more. I didn’t get accepted into any musical theater school that first year and I don’t blame them. I wouldn’t have accepted me either,” he says.
After months of training, he tried again and landed a spot at New York's Collaborative Arts Project 21, a professional theater company with a conservatory. This time, he nailed a pirouette.
He credits his parents for always supporting his vision. “They’ve seen ‘Aladdin’ more than most people ought,” he says, laughing.
Mexico and a life partner
After school came regional theater — “Little Mermaid” at the White Plains Performing Arts Center in New York, “Little Women” at Theatre Aspen in Colorado and “Kiss Me Kate” at Gretna Theatre in Pennsylvania.
Ingram made his Broadway debut as an understudy for Aladdin in 2015, a year after he had scored a discounted, same-day ticket for the last row of the balcony to see the show for the first time.
“I thought, ‘Wow, this is incredible, really remarkable.’ But still such a nebulous dream that I could possibly end up there one day,” he recalls.
He spent two years as an understudy, going on maybe 20 or so times. He then played Raoul in “The Phantom of the Opera” for a year and returned to “Aladdin” just as the pandemic shut shows down.
When the world restarted, Ingram was tapped to lead a production in Mexico City, performing the role in Spanish from 2021-23. “Aladdin” would change his life again.
“I got to meet my wife on the very first day of rehearsal. We started off as friends,” he says. “I had no idea, obviously, that we’d get married four or so years later.”
The couple endured a long-distance relationship when she joined the “Aladdin” North American tour. “She said, ‘It’s going to be OK, honey. It’s not like I’m going to Alaska.’ And I look at her schedule and I’m like, ‘I think you are going to Alaska.’”
Now they take the subway to work together, on the same schedule, in the same city and in the same show.
“We’re exactly where we’re supposed to be right now,” he says.

Peter Murrell accused of embezzling £459,000 from SNP, court papers show

The former chief executive of the Scottish National party (SNP) Peter Murrell has been accused of embezzling £459,000 from the party over a period of more than 12 years, according to court documents that emerged ahead of a hearing.
Murrell, the ex-husband of the former first minister and party leader Nicola Sturgeon, is due to appear at the high court in Glasgow next Friday for a preliminary hearing in the case.
Details of the charges, which accuse Murrell of embezzling £459,046.49 of party funds between 12 August 2010 and 13 January 2023, and illicitly purchasing items including luxury goods, jewellery, cosmetics, two cars and a motorhome, were first published in the Scottish Sun.
According to documents seen by the newspaper, Murrell bought a Niesmann and Bischoff Smove 7.4e motorhome at a cost of £124,550 for his own personal use from a dealer in Stafford using SNP funds.
He is also accused of creating “false” sales documents “in order to portray the purchase as a legitimate party expense” in the court papers.
He is further accused of using £57,500 of SNP money towards the purchase of an £81,000 Jaguar I-Pace car in 2019.
Further allegations include that Murrell made “false invoices” for a £12,042 payment to Apple Retail and £2,478 to the German retailer Manufactum, both for “purported business related” purchases. He is also accused of using SNP funds to pay a parking ticket, according to the documents seen by the Sun.
Murrell, who served as the party’s chief executive for 22 years, made no plea during an initial appearance at Edinburgh sheriff court last year after which he was granted bail.
He was arrested in 2023 as part of Operation Branchform, the Police Scotland investigation into SNP finances, and charged with embezzlement in April 2024. Sturgeon was also arrested and questioned by Police Scotland detectives in June 2023 as part of Operation Branchform, but later exonerated.
In her memoir Frankly, published last August, Sturgeon described her “utter disbelief” when police raided her home in Glasgow and arrested Murrell. “With police tents all around it, it looked more like a murder scene than the place of safety it had always been for me. I was devastated, mortified, confused and terrified.”

Music Review: A post-'Brat' Charli xcx broods on the 'Wuthering Heights' soundtrack

Charli xcx review, Wuthering Heights – A spectacular, phantasmagorical fever dream
On her wild, gothic soundtrack album, the pop star proves herself much more in tune with the terrible complexity of Emily Brontë’s original vision than film director Emerald Fennell
- Bookmark
- CommentsGo to comments
“Put my flesh upon the cross until I scream,” intones a dry-throated Charli xcx on Wuthering Heights. Her atmospheric soundtrack to Emerald Fennell’s new film leans hard, at times, into the script’s BDSM vibe. But while the big, lavish gloss of Fennell’s visual narrative slip-slides (often comically) around on the surface of the story, the grimy friction of Charli’s music claws its way back through the centuries to disinter Cathy and Heathcliff’s dark, damaged hearts. This is a record that conjures history in its use of violin, cello and double bass, but drags the strings’ horsehair romance violently into modernity over cold, muddy beds of industrial electronica.
In interviews, the artist born Charlotte Aitchison says she was touring her all-conquering, messy party album Brat in 2024 when she got a text from Fennell asking if she’d be interested in creating a soundtrack (she’d already composed original music for Emma Seligman’s 2023 dark comedy Bottoms). Exhausted from performing Brat’s erratic hyperpop, she found herself moving in the “opposite” direction with Wuthering Heights. Working with Finn Keane (who also co-produced Brat) Charli luxuriates in dreamier sonic territory, swapping the garish neons of her last album for gritty, pixelated shades of grey. There are nods to the layered grind of Nineties bands such as Nine Inch Nails and the aching, Sixties drawl-drone of The Velvet Underground.
Charli scored a coup by coaxing former Velvet, John Cale, to appear on the tremendous single “House”. Like Nellie Dean, the elderly housekeeper who unreliably narrates most of Emily Brontë’s novel, the 82-year-old Cale’s weathered vocal adds a sense of deeper time (Brontë was always reaching back – her mid-19th century novel was set in the late 18th century), along with a reminder that passion and creativity doesn’t necessarily fade with age. Over the ragged, repeated snag of a violin bow, Cale speaks with haunting formality: “Can I speak to you privately for a moment?/ I just want to explain/ Explain the circumstances I find myself in/ What and who I really am/ I’m a prisoner, to live for eternity…” Towards the close, Charli balances his measured tone with a long, corrosive howl.
That howl echoes through the album, even as Charli switches to a low, guttural mutter on songs such as “Wall of Sound”. Here, she invokes “unbelievable tension... unbelievable pressure” that builds over loops of thwarted yearning; it escalates to a clubbable pace on “Dying for You” with its breathless revelations, “All the pain and torture that I went through all makes sense to me now/ I was dying for you.” The wild beauty of the misty moors gleams through “Always Everywhere” with a melody that scales the hills, while “Seeing Things” deals in madness and visions over punchy, sawing violins. The spectacular “Chains of Love” writhes around in the anguish of obsessive love: “I’d rather lay down in thorns/ I’d rather drown in a stream/ I’d rather light myself on fire/ I’d rather wear all these scars/ I’d rather watch my skin bleed…”
The whole thing is a phantasmagorical fever dream that relishes its weird and experimental noises without sacrificing cool hooks or accessible language. Charli proves herself much more in tune with the terrible complexity of Brontë’s original vision than Fennell: there are no inverted commas around the emotion expressed on this record. A windswept, gothic triumph.

GENEVA, February 13. /TASS/. Switzerland, as the host country, will organize trilateral talks between Russia, the US, and Ukraine in Geneva on February 17-18, the Foreign Ministry confirmed to TASS.
"The Federal Department of Foreign Affairs (FDFA) remains in contact with all parties and has consistently offered its good offices, an offer that was recently reiterated during exchanges held last week in Kiev and Moscow. In this context, Switzerland, in its capacity as host state, will host trilateral talks in Geneva on Tuesday and Wednesday between Russia, Ukraine and the United States," Spokesman Jonas Montani told TASS.
Earlier, Russian presidential press secretary Dmitry Peskov announced the date and venue of the new round of talks between Russia, the US, and Ukraine. According to him, the Russian delegation will be led by presidential aide Vladimir Medinsky.
The first round of trilateral security consultations between Russia, the US and Ukraine took place on January 23-24 in Abu Dhabi. The Russian negotiating team was led by Igor Kostyukov, head of the Main Directorate of the Russian Armed Forces General Staff. The second round was held in the UAE capital on February 4-5. Later, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov noted that Moscow was maintaining a "polite silence" on the contacts in Abu Dhabi, as results-oriented talks prefer silence.

Warning as major shortage of painkiller used by millions could last until summer
The National Pharmacy Association (NPA) has warned the shortage could last until at least June
- Bookmark
- CommentsGo to comments
UK pharmacies are currently facing a significant shortage of certain strengths of the painkiller co-codamol, a disruption that could extend until at least the end of June.
The National Pharmacy Association (NPA), which represents approximately 6,000 independent community pharmacies, has highlighted widespread difficulties in obtaining 30mg and 500mg tablets, leading to a knock-on effect on other dosages.
According to the NPA, some suppliers have indicated to pharmacists that these supply issues are unlikely to be resolved before late June. Olivier Picard, chair of the NPA, confirmed: "Pharmacies are telling us they have struggled to order in supplies of some strengths of co-codamol, with a number reporting that supply disruption will last at least until June."
"This is deeply distressing for patients living with severe pain, and pharmacists are working tirelessly to find safe alternatives or manage very limited stock."
Co-codamol is a commonly prescribed painkiller which comprises a mix of paracetamol and codeine.
It is used to treat a wide range of pain, such as toothache, period pain and muscle pain.
According to NHS figures, some 1.25 million items a month of co-codamol were prescribed to patients in 2025.
Mr Picard added: "Where pharmacies have supplies, they will be doing all they can to manage them to ensure patients get the medication they need.
"We face ever growing issues with medicine supplies which are compounded by the NHS not funding the full cost pharmacies have to pay to get the medicines patients need.
"The Government must urgently act to address a growing list of medicine shortages impacting patients and pharmacists alike, who end up at the sharp end of an increasingly difficult medicine supply system."
The Department of Health and Social Care has been approached for comment.

Get the Well Enough newsletter for practical ways to feel healthier and happier
Every week, fitness coach Harry Bullmore shares practical tips, small habits and thoughtful recommendations you can realistically fit into your week – helping you make sense of wellness without the overwhelm

I’m Harry Bullmore, a fitness coach and The Independent’s senior fitness writer.
Having spent my days interviewing experts, reading the latest research, and coaching in person, I can’t help but feel that fitness has been overcomplicated – and it’s getting a tad overwhelming.
Social media nudges us towards expensive supplements when a good night’s sleep would do the job better; it encourages us to invest in pricey exercise equipment when a cut-price dumbbell might suffice; fortified foods promise benefits better gained from a hearty home-cooked meal.
My aim is to strip all that back and provide Independent readers with accessible, affordable, actionable, evidence-based health tips. The goal? To help you build a body that’s fit for life – without compromising on the “life” part.
That’s the thinking behind Well Enough, a newsletter delivered straight from my noggin to your inbox each Sunday.
Each edition is a digestible collection of insights from my daily chats with expert coaches, leading exercise researchers, and athletes – whether it’s the benefits of a post-meal meander for blood sugar regulation or desk stretches that fend off tight hips. Everything is carefully curated to be genuinely useful, without demanding too much from you.
Along the way, I’ll point you toward a handful of deeper reads worth your time, fitness ideas you can realistically squeeze into your week, small food, movement, and mindset habits that add up to real health gains, and the odd budget-friendly product that’s earned its place in my routine.
Health and fitness isn’t about perfection – it’s about finding an approach that works for you and sticking with it. My aim is for readers to start every week feeling a little more informed – and a little less overwhelmed.
Hopefully, l can help you do just that.

Board of Peace focused on resolving situation in Gaza — US envoy to UN

MUNICH, February 13. /TASS/. The Board of Peace is currently focused on the Gaza Strip but it is flexible enough to also address other global challenges, US Permanent Representative to the United Nations Michael Waltz said.
"The Board of Peace is absolutely focused on Gaza. I think you will see that in the meeting next week, but in the formation and its founding documents, the team wanted to leave flexibility to be able to tackle other problems," he pointed out at the Munich Security Conference.
On January 22, 19 countries signed the Charter of the Board of Peace on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. The body was created as part of efforts to resolve the situation in the Gaza Strip. The Board of Peace was established based on an agreement between Israel and the radical Palestinian movement Hamas to govern the Gaza Strip, but it is also supposed to prevent and settle conflicts in other regions.

Bulgaria to Join First Meeting of Trump’s Board of Peace

Bulgaria will take part in the inaugural meeting of the Board of Peace initiated by US President Donald Trump, outgoing Prime Minister Rosen Zhelyazkov confirmed while speaking to journalists on the sidelines of the Munich Security Conference.
The first session of the Council is expected to be held on February 19, a date that coincides with the anticipated announcement of a new caretaker government in Bulgaria. Because of this overlap, it has not yet been decided who will represent the country at the meeting, Zhelyazkov explained.
He said the decision will be made by the incoming executive, stressing that Bulgaria’s participation will ensure continuity in relations rather than being shaped by political changes. According to him, the country will be represented at an appropriate level, in line with the transition of power taking place on the same day.
Under the statute of the Board of Peace, which was signed by Zhelyazkov, member states are represented by their president or prime minister, or by an official appointed by them. If Bulgaria does not send a senior political representative to Washington, alternative options include Stefka Yovcheva, the acting head of the Bulgarian embassy in the United States, although this would be considered a relatively low level of representation, or Ambassador Gergana Karadjova, Bulgaria’s permanent representative to the United Nations, given that the Council was established through a UN Security Council resolution.

Iran announces enquiry team to investigate deadly protests
The Iranian government announced on Friday the establishment of a commission of enquiry to look into protests against the high cost of living that turned into anti-government rallies that left thousands dead.
"A fact-finding committee has been formed with representatives from relevant institutions and is collecting documents and hearing statements," Iranian government spokeswoman Fatemeh Mohajerani told the local news agency ISNA.
The spokeswoman did not specify whether the commission would only focus on the economic demands that triggered the protests, or whether it would also investigate deaths during the protests.
"The final report will be published for public information and further legal action after the process is completed," she stated.
On Thursday, the government website published comments by President Masoud Pezeskhian saying "We have assigned teams to investigate the causes (of the unrest)", without providing further details.
The protests, which began in late December before escalating on 8 January, left more than 3,000 dead, according to the official count.
Iranian authorities claim that the vast majority of victims were security forces or bystanders killed by "terrorists" working for Israel and the United States.
Human rights advocacy groups based outside Iran, however, accuse the security forces of targeting protesters.
The US-based Human Rights Activists News Agency (HRANA) reports that at least 7,005 people were killed during the peak of the protests.
"We are ashamed that such unfortunate events have occurred," Pezeshkian said, according to the report published on the government website.

What does BNP’s landslide mean for Bangladesh’s post-uprising order?
The victorious BNP was sceptical of constitutional reforms outlined in July Charter – now it must implement them.
Dhaka, Bangladesh – Bangladesh’s February 12 election has delivered a landslide victory for the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP), which will now form the first elected government since the July 2024 mass uprising that toppled former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina and her Awami League party.
While the election, from which the former governing Awami League was banned, has been viewed as something of a litmus test for political change in Bangladesh, observers say the overwhelming election of the BNP, one of just two parties which have held power continuously since independence in 1971, shows Bangladeshis may prefer to stick with what they know.
On Friday, the Election Commission released unofficial results showing the BNP winning 209 seats out of 297 already announced; Bangladesh Jamaat-e-Islami with 68; the National Citizen Party (NCP) with six; smaller parties, a handful of seats; and independents with seven seats.
In all, 299 of the 300 elected seats in parliament were up for grabs in this election. Turnout was about 60 percent.
Registered voters also voted in a referendum to approve constitutional reforms, with just more than 60 percent voting “yes” for the July National Charter outlining those reforms.
Final official results are still pending, but Mirza Fakhrul Islam Alamgir, BNP’s secretary-general, hailed the sweeping election victory as evidence that the BNP is “a party of the people”. The party expects to form a government on Sunday.
On Friday night, Jamaat-e-Islami, the BNP’s main opponent in this election, had yet to concede defeat, saying it was not “satisfied” with the vote count and raising “serious questions about the integrity of the results process”.
Analysts fear this may signal a return to the confrontational politics of the past in Bangladesh.
A vote for familiarity, experience
Asif Mohammad Shahan, professor of development studies at Dhaka University, said the result showed most people would rather opt to have a known political group in power at times of uncertainty.
“Voters choosing BNP means they ultimately chose a familiar political force. They appeared to prefer a party whose governing experience they already knew, despite reservations about some of its past practices,” he told Al Jazeera.
Ultimately, the result indicates that the people of Bangladesh have chosen to revert to institutional politics following the turbulence of 2024 rather than embrace any sort of ideological shift as represented by the student-led National Citizen Party, which joined forces with Jamaat to contest this election.
Political historian Mohiuddin Ahmad told Al Jazeera that this election was almost a “repetition of the 2001 election” when the BNP surged in popularity and won 193 parliament seats, ahead of the previously governing Awami League, which secured just 62.
The real litmus test, now, he said, will be to see how well the opposing parties cooperate in the new parliament. “Parliamentary democracy becomes successful through cooperation between the treasury bench and the opposition bench,” he told Al Jazeera.
But can Bangladesh steer away from the confrontational politics of the past?
Two competing mandates
Political reform is far from off the agenda, however, and this may ultimately be what drags the nation back to those bad old days, experts say.
On Thursday, Bangladesh also held a referendum on the July National Charter, a blueprint for constitutional reforms emerging from the 2024 uprising and aimed at restructuring the state’s governance architecture. It has been overseen by a caretaker government in place since the ousting of Hasina.
The charter proposes a new two-chamber parliament, new procedures for appointing constitutional bodies such as the Election Commission, and strengthening institutional checks to reduce winner-takes-all executive dominance.
It also outlines broader constitutional reforms, including expanded fundamental rights and limits on unilateral constitutional amendments.
With approximately 60 percent voting “yes” to it on Thursday, the referendum creates a parallel reform mandate alongside BNP’s parliamentary majority.
These two mandates may not fully align, Shahan said.
The BNP was sceptical about the July National Charter referendum for months during the transitional government, at times signalling a “no”, until party chief Tarique Rahman publicly endorsed a “yes” vote on January 30 – something the main opposition Jamaat alliance was eager to point out during campaigning.
Therefore, “the BNP’s manifesto, to a large extent, conflicts with the July Charter”, Shahan pointed out.
During campaigning, the BNP pledged to back the implementation of the charter if voters approved it in the referendum. But Ahmad noted that the BNP’s earlier dissent on parts of the charter means the party may not feel obligated to implement every single reform in it.
In particular, the BNP may be opposed to proposals for proportional representation and the new design of an upper house, which, it has argued, could dilute large parliamentary majorities under the current electoral system.
The scale of its election win indicates that the public expects the BNP will uphold its campaign pledges, particularly on corruption and institutional reform. Therefore, any decision not to pursue specific reforms will require public explanation, Ahmed said.
But the sheer size of the BNP’s majority could make it easier to proceed unchallenged by a weak opposition.
“Those who come with a majority naturally have much greater capacity to work on policy implementation and reform,” political analyst Dilara Choudhury said. But such dominance in parliament also means less accountability.
Shahan warned, “There is a serious concern that, based on political costs, we could return to confrontational politics again.”
The Awami League factor
The landslide result also reshapes Bangladesh’s party system at a time when the Awami League is absent. Following Hasina’s brutal crackdown on protesters in July 2024, which killed about 1,400 people, the Awami League was banned from standing in this election.
Some observers have criticised this move, saying it would have been more credible to allow voters to reject the party through democratic means by refusing to vote for it.
As Bangladesh politics were previously dominated by the BNP and Awami League, its absence has also created the possibility of an asymmetrical political field dominated, now, by a single major party, analysts say.
The results of this election appear to show that this may be true.
The BNP has limited incentive to facilitate the Awami League’s return to political life, Shahan noted. But he cautioned that a failure to deliver reforms or effective governance could reopen space for the Awami League’s revival if voters become disillusioned with both traditional and reformist actors.
For now, according to Shahan, post-election stability will depend on two factors: whether opposition parties accept the results and participate constructively in parliament, and whether the BNP uses its strong mandate to pursue inclusive reforms rather than majoritarian consolidation.
A diplomatic balancing act
The landslide result places the BNP at the centre of both domestic restructuring and regional realignment in the wake of the 2024 uprising, said Shahab Enam Khan, geopolitical analyst and professor of international relations at Jahangirnagar University in Dhaka.
This election will have “immediate implications” for the region, he added.
Particularly, Bangladesh’s relationship with India, where Hasina remains in exile, much to the anger of many in Bangladesh who would like to see her extradited to face the death penalty handed to her by the International Crimes Tribunal (ICT) in Bangladesh in November last year, for ordering her forces to fire on protesters in 2024.
“The Sheikh Hasina factor will always remain … extradition will remain an agenda, but in reality it may not happen given her relationship with political circles in Delhi,” Khan said.
“This will be a government which will receive unprecedented support from all the global powers, including the regional neighbours,” Khan told Al Jazeera. The United States is likely to continue its engagement initiated under the interim administration led by Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus, while China will remain a key partner given its market-oriented approach to Bangladesh, regardless of which party is in power.
As a result, relations with India – warm under Hasina’s rule – could become more transactional. “[Bangladesh’s] foreign policy will be very confident and that will make Bangladesh–India relationship much more transactional … BNP will look forward to much greater cooperation from Delhi based on reciprocity,” he said.
On Pakistan, he noted, “Islamabad will continue to have a good relationship with Dhaka because historically it had a good relationship with both BNP and Jamaat … we will see trade and investment ties improving and possibly some security cooperation.”
But balancing ties with India, China, the United States and Pakistan simultaneously may pose diplomatic challenges.
“Delhi would always be suspicious about Islamabad’s engagement and the US will always have concerns about Beijing’s engagement,” he said.
Ultimately, however, Khan said internal stability for Bangladesh will depend less on geopolitics than on governance.
“Instability can come from many corners – lack of reform delivery, weak economic performance and inflation,” he said. The evolving relationship between BNP and opposition forces, particularly Jamaat, is an unknown variable.
Above all, Bangladeshi politics must not return to the old style of repression over debate.
“If BNP resorts to the same policies that Awami League has … cracking down on the public when it comes to criticism of foreign policy … that will be massively disastrous,” he said, adding that foreign policy toward India and Pakistan “will be heavily monitored by the public”.
Whether the new government embraces a reformed constitutional order or reverts to majoritarian governance will depend on how it balances its parliamentary dominance, the July Charter reform mandate, and rising geopolitical expectations.
The election has settled the question of power; the durability of Bangladesh’s post-uprising political order will hinge on how that power is exercised.

Teen writes chilling note admitting to killing his mom and stuffing her in a trash can, cops say
Isaac Gideon Tracy, 17, called 911 and said he wanted to get himself arrested ‘because he killed his mom’
- Bookmark
A North Carolina teenager allegedly left behind a chilling handwritten confession note after fatally stabbing his mother and stuffing her body inside a trash container in their garage, according to newly released court records.
Isaac Gideon Tracy, 17, a sophomore at Jack Britt High School, is charged as an adult with first-degree murder in the death of his mother, Katharine Svaldi, 49, the Fayetteville Police Department announced.
The brutal killing was reported shortly after 7 p.m. Tuesday at the family’s home in the 1900 block of Daphne Circle in the Arran Lake neighborhood of Fayetteville, police said.
An affidavit obtained by The Fayetteville Observer revealed disturbing details of the crime. It stated that Tracy's grandparent called 911 after he confessed to killing his mother.
Around the same time, Tracy also called 911 himself and told a dispatcher that “he wanted to get himself arrested because he killed his mom,” according to the affidavit.
When officers arrived, they found Svaldi’s body partially inside a recycling container in the garage. Police also observed Tracy with blood on his clothes and injuries described as self-inflicted, the affidavit said.
Police searched his home and found a handwritten note on the kitchen table, allegedly written by Tracy, “detailing why he committed the crime,” according to the affidavit. Authorities did not disclose the contents of the letter.
Neighbors told ABC11 that they were stunned by the violence in the normally quiet community.
“Can you imagine… to kill your mom. That’s very sad,” Diana Konitzer said, adding that she was “very shocked” and that she had “never heard like this in my neighborhood.”
Kirsten, a close friend of Svaldi, told ABC11 that she was heartbroken over the mom’s death.
“When I finally found out that it was her, devastated, heartbroken, you know, nobody deserves to lose their life like that at anybody’s hands,” she said.
She recalled a favorite memory they shared together.
“The one memory I have of her. We got to go to a Beauty and Beast prom,” she said. “So we dressed up and danced and just had the best time.”
Kirsten said she “hurts for her family, and I hurt for her son,” adding that she hopes the public will not rush to judgment.
“I just want people to not judge,” she said. “We don’t know where anyone or any family is going through, and to speculate on what either one of them could have been, is not needed.”
Because of the severity of the charge and his age, Tracy is being prosecuted as an adult under North Carolina law, which requires 16- and 17-year-olds accused of certain serious felonies to begin in adult court, where records are public.
He remains in custody without bond.

Prosecutor’s Office Asks Russian Supreme Court to Designate Anti-War Committee as Terrorist Organization

Prosecutors in Moscow have asked Russia’s Supreme Court to designate the Russian Anti-War Committee as a terrorist organization, state media reported Friday.
Founded shortly after the 2022 invasion of Ukraine, the Anti-War Committee is made up of prominent opposition figures living in exile, including former Yukos CEO Mikhail Khodorkovsky, chess champion Garry Kasparov and economist Sergei Guriev.
Its stated mission is to coordinate efforts, support anti-war Russians and create a space for solidarity, action, and mutual assistance for people who oppose the war against Ukraine.
Russian authorities labeled the Anti-War Committee an “undesirable” organization in January 2024, putting its members at risk of imprisonment and criminalizing any engagement with the group, including sharing its content online.
The Supreme Court said it would consider the request to slap the organization with the more severe terrorist designation behind closed doors.
In October, the FSB security service announced terrorism charges against 23 members of the Anti-War Committee.
Authorities accuse its members of financing paramilitary units fighting on the side of Ukraine and of plotting to overthrow the Russian government.
A Message from The Moscow Times:
Dear readers,
We are facing unprecedented challenges. Russia's Prosecutor General's Office has designated The Moscow Times as an "undesirable" organization, criminalizing our work and putting our staff at risk of prosecution. This follows our earlier unjust labeling as a "foreign agent."
These actions are direct attempts to silence independent journalism in Russia. The authorities claim our work "discredits the decisions of the Russian leadership." We see things differently: we strive to provide accurate, unbiased reporting on Russia.
We, the journalists of The Moscow Times, refuse to be silenced. But to continue our work, we need your help.
Your support, no matter how small, makes a world of difference. If you can, please support us monthly starting from just $2. It's quick to set up, and every contribution makes a significant impact.
By supporting The Moscow Times, you're defending open, independent journalism in the face of repression. Thank you for standing with us.

Newborn Found Dead in Plastic Bag Near Playground in Sofia

A tragic discovery was made in Sofia after the body of a newborn baby, placed inside a plastic bag, was found close to a playground in the Druzhba-1 residential area, the Sofia Police Directorate confirmed.
The body was discovered by two workers from the municipal cleaning company "Chistota" while they were cleaning the area between residential blocks 17 and 18, near the local market. The plastic bag containing the baby had been left next to garbage containers close to the playground.
Police units were immediately dispatched to the scene, which was sealed off to allow investigators to carry out an on-site inspection. According to preliminary information provided by the police, the baby was premature.
Unofficial information cited by bTV indicates that the infant may have been born in the fifth month of pregnancy, suggesting an extremely early birth.
Similar cases in Bulgaria in recent years highlight both tragedy and rare instances of survival. In 2024, a newborn abandoned near a waste container in a village close to Dulovo was rescued after being found alive with severe hypothermia and breathing difficulties. Doctors at the neonatology department of the Silistra Regional Hospital managed to save the child.
A decade earlier, another newborn boy was found inside a backpack placed in a garbage container in Kazanlak. The baby was initially not breathing and was discovered by a homeless man, who alerted the authorities. Emergency medics managed to revive the infant, who began crying after resuscitation efforts. Police later identified the mother as a ninth-grade student, whose own mother worked at the Ministry of Defense. The child’s father was also a student, in the 11th grade.

Thailand puts elephants on birth control as populations are 'squeezed out' of their natural habitat

In a bid to prevent human confrontations, which can turn deadly, Thailand is administering birth control vaccines to wild elephants.
Thailand is using a birth control vaccine on elephants in the wild to try and curb a growing problem where human and animal populations encroach on each other.
It's an issue in areas where farms spread into forests, meaning elephants are squeezed out of their natural habitat.
The initiative is part of efforts to address confrontations that can turn deadly. As farmers cut down forests to make more farmland, elephants are forced to venture out of their shrinking habitats in search of food.
Last year, wild elephants killed 30 people and injured 29 in Thailand, according to official figures, which also noted more than 2,000 incidents of elephants damaging crops.
Sukhee Boonsang, director of the Wildlife Conservation Office, recently told news agency AP that controlling the wild elephant population has become necessary as numbers of elephants living near residential areas rises sharply, increasing the risk of confrontations.
Thailand's elephant issue: Is birth control the solution?
The office obtained 25 doses of a US-made vaccine and conducted a two-year trial on seven domesticated elephants - using up seven doses of the vaccine - which yielded promising results. Boonsang says that the vaccine doesn’t stop female elephants from ovulating but prevents eggs from being fertilised.
Then, in late January, the vaccine was administered to three wild elephants in eastern Trat province, he explains, adding that authorities are now determining which areas to target next as they prepare to use up the remaining 15 doses.
The vaccine can prevent pregnancy for seven years and the elephants will be able to reproduce again if they don’t receive a booster after that time expires. Experts will closely monitor the vaccinated elephants throughout the seven-year period.
'Undermining' conservation efforts
The vaccination drive has drawn criticism that it might undermine conservation efforts.
Thailand has a centuries-old tradition of using domesticated elephants in farming and transportation. Elephants are also a big part of Thailand’s national identity and have been officially proclaimed a symbol of the nation.
Boonsang says that the programme only targets wild elephants in areas with the highest rates of violent human-elephant conflict. Official statistics show a birth rate of wild elephants in these regions at approximately 8.2 per cent per year, more than double the national average of around 3.5 per cent.
It is believed that around 800 out of the nation’s approximately 4,400 wild elephants live in these conflict-prone areas.
“If we don’t take action, the impact on people living in these areas will continue to grow until it becomes unmanageable,” Boonsang says.
Reducing elephant-human conflict
In addition to the contraception vaccine, authorities are said to be implementing other measures to reduce conflict, such as creating additional water and food sources within the forests where elephants live, constructing protective fencing, and deploying rangers to guide elephants that stray into residential areas back into the wild.
A court-ordered operation earlier this month to remove wild elephants that have repeatedly clashed with locals in northeastern Khon Kaen province sparked a public outcry after one elephant died during the relocation process.
An initial autopsy revealed that the elephant died from choking after anaesthesia was administered ahead of the move, officials said.
The Department of National Parks, Wildlife and Plant Conservation carried out the relocation effort, and its director general, Athapol Charoenshunsa, expressed regret over the incident while insisting that protocol was followed properly. He said an investigation was underway to prevent such incidents from happening again.

Beijing pastry shop overrun by shoppers after Xi Jinping’s visit

A Beijing pastry shop visited by the Chinese president, Xi Jinping, on a lunar new year tour this week has been swarmed by customers hoping to get their hands on Xi-approved sweet treats.
Traffic was brought to a standstill in Beijing’s capital as the president took a tour around the city on Monday and Tuesday.
As well as visiting technology parks and business leaders, Xi dropped by a Chinese new year market in central Beijing’s Dongcheng district. The nine-day celebrations, the biggest holiday in China’s calendar, officially start on Sunday.
While at the festive market, Xi picked up a 45 yuan (£4.79) bundle of delicacies from Daoxiangcun, a historic bakery known for its traditional snacks.
According to the shopkeeper interviewed by Chinese media, Xi plumped for three items: honey-glazed dough twists, cream-filled dough twists and jujube flower pastries, a flakey, flower-shaped cookie with a filling made from red dates. Dough twists are made from fried pastry and are a popular local snack in Beijing.
The shop has since been overrun by shoppers keen to get a slice of the Xi-approved pies.
One customer, Zhao, bought 16 bags of the snacks, which are now being pre-packaged into Xi-themed triples. She told a reporter: “These are the same new year’s goods recommended by the general secretary, and people really like them. I want to buy some to give to my friends.”
Xi is the general secretary of the Chinese Communist party (CCP), as well as being China’s president and the commander of the armed forces.
Daoxiangcun said its stores had to restock pastries to accommodate hungry and patriotic customers.
Xi also visited a store called Yili Bakery and bought a 14 yuan loaf of fruit bread. He reportedly said that he had enjoyed Yili’s butter rolls as a child in Beijing’s hutongs, the traditional alleyways that crisscross the capital’s historic centre.
Xi’s personal tastes have often inspired imitations. In 2022, there was a viral trend among young people on social media of wearing “office and bureau style clothes”, ie the plain attire of a CCP bureaucrat, a tongue-in-cheek homage to the CCP’s highest-ranking cadre, the general secretary.

Meta plans to add facial recognition software to its glasses despite security and privacy concerns
Leaked memo suggests the company is well aware of the potential pitfalls of introducing controversial technology. Meta says it’s still “thinking through the options”

Meta is looking to add facial recognition software to its smart glasses despite concerns about security and privacy, a report claims.
The “Name Tag” feature would provide glasses wearers with identifying details of the people they are looking at, according to the New York Times.
But an internal memo seen by the newspaper acknowledged the technology carries “safety and privacy risks.”
Furthermore, the company appears to see an upside in releasing a potentially controversial product during the ongoing political turmoil in the U.S., The Times adds.
“We will launch during a dynamic political environment where many civil society groups that we would expect to attack us would have their resources focused on other concerns,” the leaked memo says, per the newspaper.
In recent months, facial recognition technology has been used by Immigration Customs Enforcement (ICE) to track down not only suspected undocumented migrants but also American citizens protesting against ICE.
A Meta spokesperson told The Independent the company was still looking into the technology and considering its options.
“We’re building products that help millions of people connect and enrich their lives,” a statement said.
“While we frequently hear about the interest in this type of feature — and some products already exist in the market — we’re still thinking through options and will take a thoughtful approach if and before we roll anything out.”
The move comes five years after Facebook removed facial recognition from its site , in a bid to find the “right balance” of privacy and legality on the social network.
Since then, Meta founder Mark Zuckerberg has aligned himself to President Donald Trump’s White House which has been friendly to big-tech and little regulation.
Meta came out with its first Ray-Ban smart glasses in 2021, but at the time they could only take photos and record videos. The CEO and Facebook founder unveiled new glasses powered by AI last September.
The glasses have proven to be a popular product selling approximately seven million pairs in the past year.
According to three people involved in making the glasses who spoke to The Times, the facial recognition component would differentiate Meta’s product from smart glasses being produced by competitor Open-AI.
But Nathan Freed Wessler of the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) warned that facial recognition is “ripe for abuse”.
“Face recognition technology on the streets of America poses a uniquely dire threat to the practical anonymity we all rely on,” he said.

Five more children abducted by Russia return to Ukraine

Five more children abducted by Russia return to Ukraine
According to Ukrinform, Ukraine's Parliamentary Commissioner for Human Rights Dmytro Lubinets said this on Telegram.
"Five Ukrainian children have returned from the temporarily occupied territories and from Russia – and each return is a small, yet at the same time great, victory for Ukraine," he said.
According to Lubinets, this was made possible thanks to the active efforts of the Ombudsman's Office as part of the president's Bring Kids Back UA initiative. The non-governmental organization Save Ukraine also joined the process.
The ombudsman thanked them for their support.
Lubinets also expressed gratitude to U.S. First Lady Melania Trump for humanitarian support for Ukraine's initiatives aimed at returning children.
"Thanks to our persistent work, children aged 4 to 15 are back home," he said.
According to Lubinets, one of the returned children, a seven-year-old boy, had been in the Kherson Baby Home, from where Russian forces deported him during the occupation of the city. His mother fought to have her child returned and appealed to the Ombudsman's Office. Now the closest people in his life are together again.
A similar separation, Lubinets said, was experienced by a four-year-old brother and his six-year-old sister. They were also abducted by Russian forces from the Kherson Baby Home. The children spent four years in deportation and did not see their mother during that time.
"The woman last hugged her children when they were essentially still infants. Today, they are together again," he said.
Lubinets also shared another story involving a nine-year-old boy: the child and his mother ended up in Russia, where the woman died of a serious illness. At first, the boy's grandfather tried to take him back but was unsuccessful.
"Today, the boy will be reunited with another close relative – his uncle," Lubinets said.
"These stories show that a childhood that should have been filled with fairy tales and warmth became a test of endurance. But now it is not only about pain. It is about return. About the first embrace after long years of separation," Lubinets said.
Overall, since the start of Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine, 1,985 children have already been returned, Lubinets said.
"And as long as at least one Ukrainian child remains far from home, we will continue fighting for them," he said.
The Ombudsman's Office is directly involved in a number of processes related to returning children – from communicating with relatives to personally meeting minors at the border.
Lubinets also posted a video on Telegram in which a boy who was returned from deportation today and had not seen his family for almost four years says: "The flag looks good on me!"

UNRWA chief says Gaza remains in 'daily struggle' amid mounting pressure on agency
Philippe Lazzarini warns of desperate humanitarian conditions, political efforts to weaken UNRWA, and 'silent war' intensifying in West Bank
MUNICH
The head of the UN agency for Palestinian refugees warned on Friday that humanitarian conditions in Gaza remain dire and political and operational pressure on his organization is intensifying, while violence and settlement expansion in the occupied West Bank risk further undermining prospects for peace.
Speaking to Anadolu on the sidelines of the Munich Security Conference, UNRWA Commissioner-General Philippe Lazzarini said people in Gaza continue to live in survival mode despite ongoing aid efforts.
"It's true that the situation in Gaza is still desperate, that beside food, people lack almost everything and are still in a survival mode. It's a daily struggle for the people in Gaza," he said.
He stressed that beyond emergency relief, maintaining basic public services in the war-battered enclave is critical, particularly education.
"When it comes to an agency like UNRWA, it is absolutely key that we continue to provide public health services, that we continue to provide education, primary, secondary," he said. "I think education has to become a top priority for the international community, because the children have been out of school for more than two years."
Calling schooling essential for long-term stability, he described education as "a key for a better future" for the Palestinians.
Lazzarini said the agency itself is facing mounting constraints, including political and legal challenges.
UNRWA under 'intense pressure'
Philippe Lazzarini warns of desperate humanitarian conditions, political efforts to weaken UNRWA, and 'silent war' intensifying in West BankStressing that the agency is "under intense pressure," Lazzarini said: "We have seen outrageous violation of international law. We have seen the destruction which is symbolic, but while it has been very violent, of the headquarters in occupied East Jerusalem, which also is perceived as a desire to annihilate any memory of the Palestinian refugee identity in East Jerusalem.”
He added that there is "political pressure to get rid of the agency, because the main political motivation is to strip the Palestinian from the refugee status."
Despite this, he said UNRWA, which Israel banned from operating starting January 2025, is determined to continue operating.
"We have to push back and focusing all our efforts to make sure that we continue to have the space so that we can deliver for the people in Gaza," he said.
Looking ahead, he urged that needs of Palestinians remain central in any post-war planning.
"It is time that in any, I would say, discussion about the future of Gaza, or future peace plan that will put the interest of the Gaza, the interest of the Palestinian, at the center of any of our decisions."
'Silent war' in West Bank
Turning to the West Bank, Lazzarini warned that rising settlement activity and violence are being overlooked amid the focus on Gaza.
"The West Bank is a silent war which has been overshadowed by Gaza," he said.
He lamented the acceleration of illegal settlement activities, as well as the increase of settler violence.
"It has been unabated," he said, describing the situation as "total impunity."
"People are living in an atmosphere ... of fear, and it is time that our attention also we brought into the West Bank before it is too late, before the situation has completely undermined the future of a two-state solution.”

Israeli settlers injure at least 54 Palestinians in West Bank attacks
Latest attacks come amid a widely condemned Israeli push to cement control over the occupied Palestinian territory.
Dozens of Palestinians have been injured as Israeli settlers carried out a wave of attacks across the occupied West Bank, destroying olive trees and vandalising property.
At least 54 Palestinians were wounded on Friday morning as settlers attacked several towns and villages under the protection of the Israeli military.

Settlers assaulted Palestinian farmers on their lands near Talfit, a village south of Nablus in the northern West Bank, and Israeli troops fired tear gas and live ammunition at residents who tried to repel the settler attack.
Images from the village showed homes with broken windows and vehicles with smashed windshields as a result of the attack.
Elsewhere in the West Bank, Israeli settlers also destroyed about 300 Palestinian olive trees near the Ramallah-area town of Turmus Aya, the Wafa news agency reported, citing local sources.
Palestinians across the West Bank have faced an intensified surge in Israeli military and settler violence in the shadow of Israel’s genocidal war against Palestinians in Gaza.
At least 1,054 Palestinians were killed in the West Bank by Israeli troops and settlers between October 7, 2023, and February 5 of this year, according to the latest United Nations figures.
Israel has also forcibly displaced tens of thousands of Palestinians from their homes across the West Bank, refusing to allow them to return in what Human Rights Watch says amounts to war crimes and a crime against humanity.
The Israeli government drew international condemnation this week after it approved plans to extend its authority over more of the West Bank – a move that observers denounced as de facto annexation, in violation of international law.
“If these decisions are implemented, they will undoubtedly accelerate the dispossession of Palestinians and their forcible transfer, and lead to the creation of more illegal Israeli settlements,” UN human rights chief Volker Turk said on Wednesday.
“We are witnessing rapid steps to change permanently the demography of the occupied Palestinian territory, stripping its people of their lands and forcing them to leave,” Turk said in a statement.
“This is supported by rhetoric and actions by senior Israeli officials, and violates Israel’s obligation as an occupying power to preserve the existing legal order and social fabric. These decisions must be overturned.”

MOSCOW, February 13. /TASS/. The World Rowing Executive Committee ruled to allow Russian and Belarusian athletes to participate in international competitions in double-sculls and 8+plus under a neutral status, the press office of the Russian Rowing Federation (RRF) said in a statement on Friday.
"The extended list of disciplines and tournaments that Russian rowers will be able to compete at proves that we are moving in the right direction and even the most stubborn [sports] federations can return Russian athletes back to international tournaments without any restrictions whatsoever," the RRF statement reads.
"We also carry on with our dialogue and expect a result here as well regarding the implementation of the IOC recommendations to reinstate Russian amateur athletes without any restrictions at all," the statement added.
IOC sanctions against Russia, Belarus
On February 28, 2022, the International Olympic Committee (IOC) issued recommendations to international sports federations to prohibit athletes from Russia and Belarus from participating in international tournaments, citing Moscow’s special military operation in Ukraine as the reason.
Following the IOC’s recommendations in late February 2022, the majority of global sports federations decided to bar athletes from Russia and Belarus from all international sports tournaments.
In late March, 2023, the IOC recommended allowing individual athletes from Russia and Belarus to participate in international sports tournaments, but only under specific conditions. Specifically, athletes from the two countries should not be "actively supporting" Russia’s special military operation in Ukraine and must compete under a neutral status. Russia and Belarus were also banned from participating in international team events.
On October 12, 2023, the IOC suspended the Russian Olympic Committee (ROC) until further notice after the Russian organization included the Olympic councils of the Donetsk and Lugansk People’s Republics (DPR and LPR), the Zaporozhye and Kherson Regions as its members.

Merz warns Munich Security Conference freedom 'is no longer a given' in stark remarks

Speaking at the opening of three days of high-stakes diplomacy, the German Chancellor delivered a stark diagnosis of a global order "under destruction".
Friedrich Merz has told the Munich Security Conference that the world order as it has stood for decades "no longer exists" – and warned the United States that it will not be powerful enough to "go it alone" in the new age of great power politics.
The German Chancellor alluded to the title of the gathering, "a world under destruction", suggesting that the old rules-based order has already disappeared and countries like Germany will have to completely rethink its approach to security and self-defence.
"You've chosen a grim motto for this conference, 'under destruction', and it probably means that the international order based on rights and rules is currently being destroyed," he said on the opening day of the conference on Friday.
"But I'm afraid we have to put it in even harsher terms: This order, as flawed as it has been even in its heyday, no longer exists."
Declaring that the "unipolar moment" that existed after the fall of the Berlin Wall with the rise of United States as world's superpower has passed, Merz warned that the new global order of power politics puts even the strongest nations in greater danger.
"The return to power politics is not only rooted in the rivalry between great powers," he said, suggesting that it reflects the restlessness and agitation of pre-revolution times.
"It is an expression of a wish in many democratic states for strong leadership in a globalised world in which democratic states in particular are coming very close to the limits of their ability to act," he added.
This new context, he argued, marks the end of the "rules-based order" that democratic powers have used to prevent or mediate conflict since the end of the Second World War.
"Great power politics, it seems, offers strong and easy answers – at least to the big players, and at least at a first glance," he said.
"Under this illusion, big power politics turns away from a world in which increasing connectivity translates into the rule of law and peaceful relations between states. Big power politics has its own rules. It is fast, harsh, and often unpredictable."
'An inconvenient truth'
Merz also directly addressed what he called an "inconvenient truth": the transatlantic relationship between the US and Europe that has underpinned western security for decades is now in doubt.
In a particularly striking passage, he referenced an incendiary speech given by US Vice President J.D. Vance at the Munich Security Conference last year, in which Trump's second-in-command accused European democracies of dooming themselves to destruction with censorious laws and mass immigration from other cultures.
"A divide has opened up between Europe and the United States," Merz said. "Vice President J.D. Vance said this very openly here at the Munich Security Conference a year ago, and he was right."
However, Merz said he does not subscribe to Vance's diagnosis, speaking instead of European values – including those in direct disagreement with the Trump administration's decisions and beliefs, in particular its withdrawal from multilateral organisations and abandonment of efforts to combat the climate emergency.
"The culture wars of MAGA in the US are not ours," he insisted.
"Freedom of speech here ends where the words spoken are directed against human dignity and our basic law. We do not believe in tariffs and protectionism, but in free trade. We stick to climate agreements and the World Health Organization because we're convinced that global challenges can only be solved together."
'Russia is not yet willing to talk seriously'
One of the main themes of Merz's speech was the importance of western allies' support for Ukraine in the face of Russia's full-scale invasion, which will soon mark its fourth anniversary.
He alluded to the fact that since Donald Trump returned to the White House, Europe has had to double down on its support for Kyiv and strengthen its approach to penalising the Kremlin.
"For a year, Germany and Europe have assumed the most important leading role," Merz said. "We have imposed unheard losses and costs on Moscow. And if Moscow finally agrees to make peace, it will also be for that reason, because this is an expression of European self-assertion."
Going further in a brief question and answer session conducted by conference chairman Ambassador Wolfgang Ischinger after his speech, Merz insisted that Russia could not yet be trusted to negotiate in good faith on ending its assault – and called out Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán's visit to Moscow in 2024, albeit without naming him.
"There was somebody from the European Union, a prime minister, who travelled to Moscow on his own," Merz recalled. "He had no mandate; he went there, he achieved nothing. In the week after, we saw the heaviest attacks on civil infrastructure, and private homes, on hospitals, we had ever seen until this time."
"So if it makes sense to talk, we are willing to talk," Merz continued. "But as you can see with the American side, Russia is not yet willing to talk seriously. This war will only end when Russia is at least economically, potentially militarily, exhausted."
"Russia has to give up this terrible war against Ukraine, and we have to do everything that is needed to bring them to the point where they see no further advantages for them to continue this terrible war."
Pointing to Europe, Merz warned that freedom can no longer be taken for granted.
"Russia's GDP is currently about €2 trillion. That of the European Union is almost 10 times as high – but still, Europe is not 10 times as strong as Russia today.
"Our military, political, economic, and technological potential is huge, but we haven't tapped it to the necessary extent for a very long time. So the most important thing is to flick the switch in our minds now."
"We have to understand that in the era of big powers, our freedom is no longer a given. It is at stake. We will need to show firmness and determination to assert this freedom," he added.

Survivor 50 cast single out the player they’re most skeptical of ahead of landmark season
The milestone season will feature former contestants from as far back as the show’s inaugural competition in 2000

- CommentsGo to comments
The cast of the milestone 50th season of Survivor has called out one player they were surprised to see made the cut.
In May 2025, the show’s host and executive producer, Jeff Probst, announced the full cast of the reality show’s upcoming season on CBS Mornings. The season, titled “In the Hands of the Fans,” will feature a lineup filled with fan favorites.
With the new season set to premiere February 25, the cast recently opened up to People about their fellow competitors. When asked who cast members were surprised to see return, one name consistently emerged: Kyle Fraser.
Fraser recently won season 48 of the reality show in a final jury vote of 5-2-1, which awarded him the $1 million prize.
“Kyle, why? You just won yesterday!” four-time Survivor player, Cirie Fields said. “The ink ain't even dry on your check yet. What are you trying to prove, Kyle? That makes you public enemy No. 1 for me.”
Two of Fraser’s fellow season 48 cast members also agreed that they were not thrilled to see him as part of the cast.
“I am upset that Jeff did not disclose [that Kyle was returning] when he asked me, ‘Do you want to come play 50?’” Kamilla Karthigesu, who finished fourth on season 48, said.
Joe Hunter agreed, telling People, “It's like I was on national television, and Kyle gave me a wedgie, and then Kamilla came up and pulled it over my head...I won't come after them, but how could I trust them?”
Survivor follows a group of contestants divided into “tribes” based on the season's theme, who are stranded on an island and tasked with surviving by building shelters and foraging for food. Alongside these survival efforts, they compete in a series of mental and physical challenges. Each week, contestants are eliminated through a tribal vote until only one remains. The last contestant standing is crowned the Sole Survivor and awarded the $1 million prize.
Another notable season 50 contestant is Mike White, the creator of The White Lotus. White previously competed on Survivor’s 37th season, which was titled “David vs. Goliath.” The season’s premise saw the David tribe, made up of some of life’s underdogs, face off against a group of overachieving “Goliaths.”
He finished the season in second place with three jury votes, while Nick Wilson secured the title of Sole Survivor with seven votes.
“Mike, after he finished playing, said, ‘I want to play again,’” Probst previously recalled. “When White Lotus hit, and I thought, ‘Well, he’ll never play again.’ But he kept texting and saying, ‘Look, I’m serious. If you ever do anything where you have returning players, I want to play again.’ So we’re happy to have Mike.”
Survivor's milestone season premieres February 25 on CBS.

Sky-high cucumber prices are rattling Russian shoppers. The spike might be temporary, but the inflation problem isn’t.

Sky-high cucumber prices are rattling Russian shoppers. The spike might be temporary, but the inflation problem isn’t.
At the start of the year, Russians got a shock at the grocery store: cucumber prices had skyrocketed. Still, officials and economists aren’t sounding the alarm; prices are expected to begin falling by spring. Inflation more broadly accelerated early in the year, though it’s already showing some signs of slowing. But bringing prices under control could mean sacrificing economic growth — and that, in turn, could deepen Russia’s budget deficit.
Sticker shock
In the first weeks of 2026, cucumber prices in Russia spiked so dramatically that they took on a life of their own. Social media flooded with complaints and photos of produce aisles showing price tags of 500 — and even 1,000 — rubles per kilogram ($2.93, or even $5.87 per pound). As Forbes Russia noted, by early February, cucumbers had effectively become as expensive as meat.
Even official data confirmed the spike. According to Russia’s Federal State Statistics Service (Rosstat), prices rose 43 percent between late December and February 2, then climbed another 5.2 percent in the following week. Industry analysts say the actual increase is even higher.
The trade association Rusprodsoyuz estimates that over the past three months, cucumber prices have jumped 111 percent, with the average retail price reaching around 300 rubles per kilogram (about $1.76 per pound) by February. Alexey Plugov, head of agricultural research company AB-Center, told Forbes Russia that between December 22 and February 2, the price per kilogram rose from about 224 rubles to 317 rubles (from $1.32 per pound to $1.86 per pound).
And yet, viewed year over year, the picture looks far less dramatic. Compared with February 2025, vegetable prices are up just 1.8 percent. As Rusprodsoyuz Deputy Chairman Dmitry Leonov pointed out to Forbes Russia, last year prices rose 120 percent over the same three-month stretch.
Cucumbers in Russia always get more expensive in winter — and there are clear reasons for this.
First, seasonality. By the early 2020s, Russia had effectively become self-sufficient in growing cucumbers; today, about 95 percent of the market is supplied domestically. Thanks to widespread greenhouse technology, farmers now grow cucumbers year-round across the country — not only in the warmer southern regions but also in the colder central part of European Russia. In 2025, they harvested nearly 900,000 tons.
But winter production is costly. From November through March, greenhouses rely on intensive artificial lighting to compensate for short daylight hours, stimulating photosynthesis and speeding growth. Cucumbers, in particular, need bright, powerful light for up to 18 hours a day. Electricity can account for as much as half the cost of winter vegetables, and rates for producers have risen 23 percent over the past two years.
Then there’s the cold itself. January 2026 ranked among the three coldest in central Russia in the past 30 years — the very region where much of the country’s greenhouse capacity is concentrated. Heating costs rose accordingly. Freezing weather also makes cucumbers harder to store: at wholesale warehouses and smaller distribution points, they spoil faster than usual — driving up logistics costs throughout the supply chain.
Taken together, these factors make February a predictably difficult month for the cucumber market. Output falls. Harvesting and distribution become more expensive. And unlike during the 2025 potato price crisis — when authorities turned to imports — there are currently no foreign suppliers filling gaps in supply. Meanwhile, the cost of imported seeds, fertilizers, and equipment continues to climb. According to Plugov, production in February is roughly 35 percent lower than in January.
However, there may be some relief on the horizon for Russian cucumber lovers: prices are likely to fall soon. As daylight hours lengthen, temperatures rise, and open-field harvests begin, supply should increase. Officials and analysts alike expect prices to ease in the spring. Output in March is projected to be about one and a half times February’s level, and in April two to two and a half times higher — potentially pushing prices down to 90–100 rubles per kilogram ($0.53 to $0.59 per pound) by mid-spring.
The bigger inflation problem
In an interview with the business news outlet RBC, Russian Central Bank Deputy Director Alexey Zabotkin noted that the surge in cucumber prices reflects the pronounced seasonality of a single product, not “sustained inflationary processes” in the wider economy.
Keeping inflation in check is one of the Russian government’s main economic priorities in 2026. The Central Bank has been cautious in lowering its key interest rate from elevated levels. High rates curb business lending and make bank deposits more attractive for households, cooling consumer demand.
Even so, inflation accelerated at the start of the year, driven not only by seasonal increases in fruit and vegetable prices but also by the rise in value-added tax from 20 percent to 22 percent, Economic Development Minister Maxim Reshetnikov said.
Weekly data from Rosstat show that annual inflation in Russia peaked at 6.46 percent on February 2 before easing slightly to 6.36 percent by February 9. In late December, it stood at 5.59 percent, meaning inflation has yet to return even to last year’s level. At the same time, the Central Bank’s latest forecast for 2026 puts inflation at 4–5 percent.
Still, some economists say recent data point to a slowdown in inflation. Sofia Donets, chief economist at Tinkoff Investments, noted that “weekly inflation is better not only than in previous weeks but also than during the same period of the past three years.” The January bump from higher taxes and regulated tariffs, she said, has largely played out. What remains is consumer demand — which, for now, is subdued.
Reshetnikov maintains that inflation will continue to slow and move toward the 4–5 percent target range, giving the Central Bank “room” to cut rates further. Indeed, on February 13, the Central Bank cut the key rate from 16 percent to 15.5 percent. The problem, he acknowledged, is that the “natural price” of curbing inflation is stalled economic growth. Russia’s GDP may not increase at all in 2026, he said, with growth resuming only in 2027.
That outlook is troubling for a federal budget already suffering from revenue shortfalls. In January, the deficit reached 1.7 trillion rubles ($22 billion). Oil and gas revenues — depressed by lower global prices — fell to multi-year lows, totaling just 393 billion rubles ($5 billion). The shortfall could be offset by stronger-than-expected revenue from other sources. But those revenues depend on the broader health of the economy.
Whether the Russian authorities can balance the fight against inflation with the need to shore up the budget is difficult to predict. It is becoming increasingly harder to dismiss warnings that by summer, Russia’s economy, strained by war and sanctions, could face a crisis.

What to Say When Someone Tells You to Smile More

Four words have echoed across every boardroom, dating app, and city street in the world: You should smile more.
Anastasia Ryan has heard it her whole life, but perhaps never more than in a role where the people she was speaking to couldn’t see her at all. “The majority of what I did was over the phone, and I still had my supervisor coming through and making gestures that I needed to smile while on a call,” she says. “And then eventually, I was told that my facial expressions weren't appropriate in the office.”
After being let go, Ryan channelled her rage into a novel called You Should Smile More, a workplace revenge fantasy about a telemarketer who’s fired for her neutral expression. Through its protagonist, Ryan was able to say all the things she wished she’d been able to say when those smile directives were lobbed at her.
The same remarks might have inspired a rewarding career turn, but that doesn’t negate the damage they caused. “It is absolutely infuriating because it’s being singled out for your appearance and for the way you're presenting yourself, in a way that's not equal across gender standards,” she says. “It's frustrating because we're so much more than that.”
Why it happens
People (usually men) have been advising other people (almost always women) to smile more for as long as anyone can remember. “Men feel that it's OK, if not entirely required, to tell women to smile, which is a really interesting assumption,” says Marianne LaFrance, an emerita professor of psychology and of women's, gender, and sexuality studies at Yale University, and author of Why Smile? The Science Behind Facial Expressions. “The gender status quo is that women should smile more.”
That stems largely from a sense of entitlement, she says. “Men laugh it off, as though it’s a male prerogative to tell a woman what to do with her body,” LaFrance says. People in certain industries, like health care workers and service workers, are especially likely to be told that “they need to constantly display their femininity. And one of the best ways to do that is to smile.”

Another reason people deploy this line is because they feel uncomfortable when someone else's face isn't easy to read. Neutral expressions can be unsettling to people who expect emotional reassurance. “It’s less about me, and it's all about your comfort, because you want to see me smile,” says Minda Harts, an assistant professor at NYU's Wagner Graduate School of Public Service and author of Talk to Me Nice: The Seven Trust Languages For A Better Workplace. “It’s not about me being joyful.”
Comments like these do more than create momentary discomfort. They send a subtle signal about whose feelings matter—and whose don’t. “Being told to smile sends a message that ‘you’re inconveniencing me,’ and over time, that erodes trust—not just with others, but with ourselves,” Harts says. “I used to internalize when people would say, ‘Oh, you need to smile more,’ and I'm like, ‘Is there something wrong with me? What’s going on with my face?’”
When saying nothing says enough
Figuring out how to respond when someone tells you to smile more can be complicated. The truth is, experts agree, that it’s not always practical to respond the way you’d like to.
It’s sometimes easiest to address the comment nonverbally. Some people opt to just flash a smile, because they want the interaction to end quickly. “They feel awful for having done it, but they feel that they have no choice,” LaFrance says. “Unfortunately, it reduces the woman in some small way. She’s been caught not being appropriately feminine.”
Another option is to remain stoic and hold your expression, letting your eyes do the work of signaling that the request isn’t welcome. Or you could do what LaFrance defaults to: offer a fake smile. “We all have a bunch of those, and it sort of looks like the smile is plastered on the face and it’s held too long—because the key to a genuine smile is that they're very brief,” she says.
Will the person on the receiving end be able to tell? “It depends how good the fake is,” LaFrance says. “There are fakes that look like the real thing, and then there are fakes that look like it's a satire. It's a put on. It conveys a, ‘You want one? I'll show you one’ sort of attitude.”
That's almost irrelevant, though, LaFrance adds. What matters is the way it lands internally. “I know that what I'm doing inside isn’t obeying the premise that he gets to call me out on something,” she says, “but that I get to decide in what form.”
Redirecting without rewarding the comment
Different scenarios call for different responses. Say a family member or someone else with good intentions phrases their remark like this: “You seem so serious lately—you should smile more.” It can work well to acknowledge their intent without changing your behavior, says Tatiana Teppoeva, founder and CEO of One Nonverbal Ecosystem, an organization that teaches business leaders how to decode nonverbal behavior, communication patterns, and personality dynamics. You might say, “Thank you for caring,” or “I appreciate you checking in.” You’re validating their intentions, she says, without accepting the idea that your expression needs correction.
When people tell their colleagues to smile more, it’s often an attempt to redirect attention, minimize authority, or interrupt momentum, Teppoeva says. For example, you might be making a point in a meeting when someone interjects: “You’d come across better if you smiled more,” shifting focus away from whatever you were saying. In that case, neutral redirection or ignoring the comment entirely usually works best. You can continue your point without responding or calmly redirect: “Let’s stay on topic.” “Engaging emotionally or defensively reinforces the power move,” Teppoeva says. Continuing calmly, on the other hand, “signals authority and shows that your presence doesn’t require external approval.”
Or consider this scenario: A colleague instructs you to smile more because it helps other people feel more at ease. Teppoeva suggests light acknowledgement without commitment: “That’s an interesting perspective,” or “I’ll think about it.”
Occasionally, when she was still working in an office, Ryan would respond to comments suggesting she smile more like this: “Would you say that to a man?” You could even follow up with something like this, she adds: “It’s not your job to provide me with any sort of feedback on my appearance.”
Read More: Can I Ask Someone if They’re on Ozempic?
Though LaFrance prefers to respond nonverbally, she can think of a few effective comebacks. One of her favorites: “I will if you will.” Or, if you’re walking down the street and someone shouts at you—“Come on, honey, I want to see you smile”—you could say: “I wouldn’t if I were you, because it’s not pretty.”
Some people feel best keeping their response light and defusing the tension with humor. You could make a joke like this, Harts says: “Smiling costs extra.” Another favorite: “I save my feelings for after meetings.”
If you'd rather be direct, she likes this way of framing things: “I’m comfortable with how I’m showing up right now.” Or, you could flip the conversation back on the other person: “Why do you think so?” Or: “Can you say more about what you're noticing? Is there something specific you need from me right now?”
Ultimately, how you respond is a choice—not an obligation. The idea isn’t to be nicer; it’s to reclaim control. “I always tell people that you don't need a perfect response. You just need one that protects your dignity and makes you feel safe,” Harts says. “You don't have to perform happiness to be respected. You can be professional without providing joy on demand for somebody else.”

Showdown in the American west as Colorado River faces crucial deadline: ‘Mother nature isn’t going to bail us out’

The future of the American west hung in the balance after seven states remained at a stalemate over who should bear the brunt of the enormous water cuts needed to pull the imperiled Colorado River back from the brink.
Negotiators, who have spent years trying to iron out thorny disagreements, ended their talks on Friday without a deal – one day before a critical deadline to form a plan that had been set for Saturday.
The end of these talks has thrust the basin, and those who rely on its essential water resources, into uncertain territory.
In the region where water has long been the source of survival and conflict, the challenges that hindered consensus were as steep as the stakes are high.
Snaking across 1,450 miles (2,300km) from the Rocky Mountains into Mexico, the Colorado supplies roughly 40 million people in seven states, 5.5m acres (2.23m hectares) of farmland and dozens of tribes. The waters fuel an estimated $1.4tn in economic activity, and raised bustling cities, including Los Angeles, Phoenix and Las Vegas. The sprawling basin is also home to diverse ecosystems, with scores of birds, fish, plants and animals, and provides critical habitat for more than 150 threatened or endangered species.
But the river has been overdrawn for more than a century. As demand continues to grow, rising temperatures and lower precipitation caused by the climate crisis are taking an increasingly larger share of declining supplies, a trend only expected to worsen as the world warms.
Up to 4m acre-feet of cuts are needed to bring the basin back into balance – an amount equal to more than a quarter of its annual average flow. One acre-foot, a unit denoting the amount of water that can cover a football field one foot deep, is equal to roughly 326,000 gallons – enough to supply roughly three families for a year.
A record snow drought plaguing the region this year is expected to reduce water supplies further, which added another layer of urgency to the talks.
“There needs to be unbelievably harsh, unprecedented cuts” that will affect water users in major ways, said Dr Brad Udall, senior water and climate research scientist at Colorado State University’s Colorado Water Center. “Mother Nature is not going to bail us out.”
Colorado, Utah, Wyoming and New Mexico, which form the upper-basin states – have resisted any cuts to their share, insisting lower-basin states – California, Arizona and Nevada – are responsible for creating the deficit. Because they are situated closer to the headwaters, their supply doesn’t come from the reservoirs that the lower basins draw from.
The lower basin has balked at the idea. They have already agreed to take substantial cuts and are demanding their neighbors to the north share the burden. While disagreements range across a series of issues, this is a major sticking point.
The states have been at an impasse for months, after blowing through a deadline last November and this week’s breakdown in the talks signals how entrenched the opposing parties are.
In a joint statement on Friday, the governors of the California, Arizona and Nevada insisted that “all seven basin states must share in the responsibility of conservation”.
“The federal deadline for a consensus agreement on managing the Colorado River after 2026 is passing for a second time without resolution,” said Gavin Newsom, Katie Hobbs and Joe Lombardo. “The stakes couldn’t be higher for our lower basin states of Arizona, California and Nevada.”
It’s unclear how quickly the federal government will move to issue its plan, or if there can be more room made for discussions to continue.
“This is the second time the Bureau of Reclamation has given us a deadline without a consequence,” Rhett Larson, a professor of water law at Arizona State University said. “A deadline without a consequence is just a date.”
If the states can’t produce a path forward, the federal government has threatened to issue its own, one likely to deeply slash the lower-basin states’ shares. Four draft proposals released for public comment in January include severe reductions of lower states’ supply.
Any of the federal options on the table would almost certainly result in lawsuits and complex court battles, an outcome everyone would like to avoid.
Still, the basin urgently needs a plan – one that goes far beyond the complex matrix of laws and agreements expiring this year that have been unable to keep pace with the rapidly widening gap between supply and demand.
“Everyone agrees we have to use less water, the problem is states look at each other and say you should use less,” said Dr Jack Schmidt, the director of the Center for Colorado River Studies at Utah State University.
The negotiations have been like the final scene in Thelma and Louise, he added. “Seven people have their hands on the steering wheel driving toward the edge of a cliff – and no one is working the brakes.”
‘A system that fails us when we need it most’
Along with supplying vast water needs across the west, arguments have centered on how much should be released to protect the critical reservoirs of Lake Powell and Lake Mead. Storage in these reservoirs has fallen to historic lows and experts have warned that just a couple of dry years could put them at critical levels.
If they fell far enough, the system would cease to function altogether. So-called “deadpool” – when water isn’t high enough to pass through the dams and be distributed downriver – would be catastrophic.
Schmidt said the federal government would intervene long before deadpool. But if desperately dry conditions like those expected this year fail to improve, then even the Bureau of Reclamation’s proposals might not be able to stabilize the system, according to the environmental analysis released with the alternatives in January.
“That’s pretty damn scary,” Schmidt said. Water managers may have to make urgent decisions in the coming months, even if agreements aren’t in place and the problems could get more complicated still.
“We know temperatures are going up – and going up quite rapidly,” Udall said. Hotter environments mean faster evaporation. It shifts the timing of snowmelt and runoff, produces drier soils, and thirsty plants soak up more water. Flows in the Colorado are down 20% over the last century and precipitation has shrunk by about 7%.
“The chickens are coming home to roost,” he said. “Climate models have underestimated how much warming we are going to get, and humans are not stepping up.”
Shortages could lead to dramatic changes in how water is distributed in the future. More than 70% of water is used by agriculture – which includes thirsty crops like alfalfa and hay that are used to feed cattle and the bulk of the winter lettuce and leafy greens grown in the US. The irrigation systems were set up long before suburbs began to sprawl across the deserts, and frameworks that govern the river dictate that that’s why they get their shares first.
“But you can’t fallow cities,” Udall said. While municipalities need to do more to conserve, “it’s the farmers that will hurt – that’s just super clear,” he added. “We have created a system that was supposed to provide certainty that fails us when we need it most.”
‘We are facing a system crash’
There had been hope that negotiators could strike a smaller, short-term deal that would provide incremental steps that buy more time for the big issues.
With the conditions as dire as they are this year, Udall said it was unlikely the states would be able to fall back on short-term solutions this time.
“Maybe in a normal winter you could impose less drastic solutions, but given the snow drought we have right now and the state of the reservoirs, the federal government is going to have to impose a solution,” Udall said. “I would bet you dollars to donuts that the lawsuits are going to fly.”
Larson, who also serves as council for the Arizona Municipal Water Users Association, representing 10 of the large central Arizona cities, said the federal proposals all have “fatal flaws” for Arizona, and other states that will be asked to carry enormous cuts.
It’s likely Arizona will sue, and be joined by California and Nevada. But the lawsuits might not end there.
If dry conditions push river flows low enough that lower-basin states don’t receive their share secured in the original compact over a century ago, another lawsuit could be filed against the upper-basin states themselves. Legal disputes would center on whether the upper basin can be held responsible for losses in supply due to climate change. An interstate water law conflict like this would go straight to the US supreme court.
While the legal battles unfold, “somebody has still got to manage an ever-dwindling river”, Larson said.
It’s an outcome that Dr John Berggren, regional policy manager at Western Resource Advocates, said, would ultimately be a failure for the river, leaving little room to manage the challenges of a highly complicated system.
“[Litigation] kind of freezes everything – and environmental values are one of the first things to go,” he said. “They’ll protect the reservoirs as best they can, but they’re probably not going to be able to consider environmental flows and things that actually benefit the river itself.”
Berggren added that the waterway needed flexibility, especially during dry years. Emergency actions – especially those governed by courts and not experts – can’t take account of things like timing and temperature, that are so vital to protecting the river’s ecosystems.
“It’s not just a pipeline,” he said, “it’s a living river.”
The ecosystems on the banks of the river have already paid a heavy price. Fourteen native fish species are endangered or threatened. The once-lush wetlands in Mexico’s river delta have been dry for decades and the once mighty river slows to just a trickle as it crosses over the US-Mexico border. “That’s an ecosystem that is lost,” Schmidt said, “and no one is talking about returning it to its former glory.”
Before the negotiators ended their talks on Friday, Matt Rice, the south-west regional director for the conservation organization American Rivers, said he was clinging to hope that something would come out of the negotiations.
Rice has seen year after year of crisis management play out on the river, and lessons continue to go unlearned.
“The positive thing is we know what to do,” he added. Conservation efforts across the Colorado River basin have been successful. Cities in the region have reduced water-use by 18% over the last two decades, even as some saw their populations grow. Farmers have adopted more efficient irrigation systems, infrastructure can be updated for better efficiency and conservationists are working to restore watersheds.
But these fixes have not gone far enough – not by a long shot. Rice said there needed to be a new approach, framed not as an emergency cut that goes from crisis to crisis, but as adaptation to an arid future.
For that, the deadline isn’t coming from the federal government, it’s being imposed by the waterway itself.
“We are facing a system crash,” he said. “The river is not going to wait for process or politics.”

MOSCOW, February 13. /TASS/. Russia has all the necessary research facilities for advancing lunar and deep space exploration, said President of the Kurchatov Institute National Research Center and Chairman of the Scientific Expert Council of the Russian Maritime Board Mikhail Kovalchuk.
"We have the entire base, <…> a complete research rig. It is currently undergoing modernization. [Research] for space basing is being conducted there, for the fleet, and so on. There is a special facility that tests materials at extra-low temperatures: at -270 degrees Celsius, at absolute zero on the Moon. <…> This base has now been upgraded to a new level and ensures our country’s steady progress in the exploration of the Moon and deep space," Kovalchuk said in his address at a Scientific Expert Council meeting dedicated to the 123rd birth anniversary of Academician Anatoly Alexandrov.
He also highlighted new prospects in the development of a synergy of space and nuclear technologies.
"Today, thanks to our joint efforts with the new head of Roscosmos, Dmitry Vladimirovich Bakanov, I believe we have a chance for the deep and active introduction of nuclear technologies in the space industry," the Kurchatov Institute head concluded.

From Berlin to Tenerife: All the destinations Ryanair won’t fly to anymore in 2026

Ryanair has added another French airport to its list of route cuts for 2026, citing aviation taxes.
2025 was a big year for Ryanair, with the European budget airline making some key changes and announcements. The airline revealed major expansions to its winter schedule, especially in the UK, Finland and Italy, and announced new routes like London to Murcia and Rovaniemi to the UK. It also unveiled plans to boost passenger numbers and invest more in bases like Bologna.
On the other hand, there were also some challenges, such as persistent Boeing delays, with Ryanair CEO Michael O’Leary slamming the aircraft company’s management for “running around like headless chickens”. The airline’s recent move to phase out physical boarding passes has also been met with significant backlash.
However, one of the most impactful announcements was Ryanair’s decision to cut several routes in 2026, across major destinations such as Spain, France, Germany, Belgium, Portugal and beyond - with more destinations being added to the list in January.
This move will potentially slash around three million seats overall, while significantly impacting connections and passenger convenience for smaller cities.
Here are all the places that will be affected by Ryanair’s route cuts in 2026.
Which German routes is Ryanair cutting in 2026?
In October 2025, Ryanair revealed that it would be slashing 24 routes to and from Germany - a reduction of almost 800,000 seats - for the Winter 2025/2026 schedule.
Nine airports have already been affected so far, including Hamburg, Berlin, Cologne, Memmingen, Frankfurt-Hahn, Dresden, Dortmund and Leipzig. Operations will continue to be suspended at the Leipzig, Dresden and Dortmund airports in 2026 beyond the winter schedule.
However, details are yet to be released about which other airports might continue being impacted throughout the year.
Ryanair has blamed high air traffic control (ATC) and security fees, as well as high German aviation taxes and numerous airport changes for this decision, slamming the government for harming competitiveness.
“Germany’s sky-high access costs are in stark contrast with countries such as Ireland, Spain and Poland which have no aviation taxes, or Sweden, Hungary and regional Italy, where aviation taxes are being scrapped alongside reduced access costs to boost traffic, tourism, jobs and economic recovery,” the airline said in a press release in October.
“As a result, Germany remains among the worst recovered air traffic markets in Europe, operating at just 88 per cent of pre-Covid levels.”
Ryanair also called out the German government for backtracking on its promises to lower aviation taxes, unlike other major EU nations.
Such taxes are, partially, in place to account for the devastating climate impact of flying, and to encourage travellers to take greener modes of transport such as trains.
The airline has also revealed that it plans to move capacity out of Germany to other countries with more affordable costs, while warning of potential withdrawals and further reductions, if the situation does not improve.
However, if the government addresses the above issues, the airline has said that it would be happy to increase capacity again.
Which Spanish routes is Ryanair ending in 2026?
Ryanair has also announced flight cuts to Spain in 2026. After cutting around one million seats for the winter 2025 schedule, the airline will follow up with a capacity reduction of about 1.2 million seats from its summer schedule for regional Spain.
This includes stopping all flights to Asturias, as well as Vigo. The airline will also close its base at Santiago de Compostela, while continuing to reduce capacity for Santander and Zaragoza and slashing connections to the Canaries.
All flights have been stopped for Tenerife North this winter. Jerez’s base, which has also been closed this season, and will remain shut in 2026. Similarly, all flights to Valladolid have been stopped, with Ryanair’s base there being closed since winter 2024.
Ongoing disagreements with Spanish airport operator Aena over steep tax and airport fee hikes are to blame for the cuts, along with what Ryanair claims are “illegal bag fines” from the Spanish government - referring to the 2024 clampdown on extra cabin bag fees.
According to Ryanair, this makes regional Spanish airports less competitive than lower-cost alternatives in Morocco and Italy, among other places.
“Aena’s monopoly approach to pricing is that small underused regional airports should charge similar rates as busy main airports like Madrid, Barcelona, Palma and Malaga. As a result, Ryanair is switching seat capacity to these bigger Spanish airports (where passenger demand and air fares are higher),” the airline said in a press release in October.
It also said that it was moving to other lower-cost airports in Croatia, Morocco, Italy, Sweden and Albania, where governments were reducing airport fees and lowering environmental taxes.
However, rival airlines such as Vueling, Binter, Iberia and Wizz Air have all stepped into the gap left by Ryanair, which is likely to decrease passenger inconvenience significantly, by offering many of the same routes.
Which routes is Ryanair cutting in France this year?
France is also getting hit by Ryanair cuts in 2026. The airline already slashed 750,000 seats and 25 routes to France in winter 2025, after stopping all services to Bergerac, Brive and Strasbourg. This was mainly due to higher French airline taxes.
However, months after this decision, Ryanair announced in December that it would be restarting flights to Bergerac in summer 2026, following negotiations with French authorities, although services to Brive and Strasbourg remain suspended.
Ryanair cautioned that further French cancellations may be on the cards for 2026. “Ryanair will leave French regional airports in the summer of 2026,” the airline’s chief commercial officer, Jason McGuinness, revealed in the Paris-based ‘Challenges’ business magazine.
This warning is already bearing fruit: Ryanair announced in January 2026 that it will stop operations at Clermont-Ferrand Auvergne Airport from 27 March due to environmental taxes. Currently, the airline operates budget flights to London, Porto and Fez from Clermont-Ferrand.
The carrier has also dropped its Dublin-Rodez route for 2026. Ryanair will, however, maintain services from London Stansted and Brussels to the airport in the southern region of Occitania.
Which Belgian routes is Ryanair cutting in 2026?
Ryanair has removed 20 routes and one million seats from Brussels and Charleroi for its winter 2026/27 schedule.
Like other destinations, this is mainly due to a new Belgian aviation tax which will double the charge to €10 per passenger. Additionally, Charleroi might impose local taxes too.
These have impacted destinations like Milan-Bergamo, Barcelona, Lisbon, Rome-Ciampino, Krakow and Mallorca, among others. This decision cuts around 22 per cent of Ryanair’s Belgian capacity, with the airline also withdrawing five aircraft from the Zaventem and Charleroi bases.
“If the government really wants to revive Belgium’s economy, they should abolish this harmful aviation tax to generate more traffic and tourism, not double it,” the airline said in a press release in early December.
“Ryanair calls again on Prime Minister De Wever and his government to abolish the aviation tax or Belgian traffic will collapse and fares will soar, just as they have done in Austria and Germany, where governments repeatedly increased access costs.”
Which Ryanair routes are being cut in Portugal?
Ryanair will slash all six of its routes to and from the Azores from the end of March this year, which will affect about 400,000 fliers per year. This will represent a cut of around 22 per cent in Ryanair’s Portuguese capacity, impacting key cities like Porto and Lisbon as well.
This is also mainly because of higher air traffic control fees imposed by the Portuguese operator ANA (Vinci), as well as EU taxes such as the EU Emissions Trading System (ETS), which targets short-haul flights to destinations like the Azores and Madeira, while exempting longer routes.
A new €2 travel tax in Portugal, which Ryanair has said is counterproductive compared to other EU countries, has added to this.
Portugal’s operational costs have also been rising for the last few months, with several airport staff strikes as well, further complicating the situation.
“Sadly, the ANA monopoly has no plan to grow low-fare connectivity to the Azores. The ANA monopoly faces no competition in Portugal - which has allowed it to extract monopoly profits, by raising Portuguese airport fees without penalty - at a time when competing EU airports are lowering fees to stimulate growth,” Ryanair said in a press release in late November.
“The Portuguese Govt. must intervene and ensure that its airports, which are a critical part of national infrastructure - especially in an island economy like the Azores - are used to benefit the Portuguese people, rather than benefitting a French airport monopoly.”
However, ANA has categorically denied these monopoly abuse claims, stating that dialogue remains open and that the fees in the Azores were low.
Ryanair flights being cut in Bosnia and Serbia
Ryanair will also implement reductions across Bosnia and Serbia in summer 2026. This is mainly to reallocate resources to areas with growing summer demand, like Croatia.
This includes cutting six weekly departing flights from Banja Luka, which will reduce to two weekly rotations on services to Vienna, Memmingen and Baden Baden.
In Niš, the airline will slash two weekly flights, including one each to Vienna and Malta.

Three men jailed in UK over Islamic State-inspired plot to kill hundreds of Jews

Three men were jailed for involvement and knowledge of a plot to kill hundreds in an Islamic State-inspired attack on the Jewish community in England, Greater Manchester Police (GMP) announced on Saturday.
The plot, if successful, would have been "one of the deadliest terrorist attacks to ever take place on UK soil," according to GMP Assistant Chief Constable Rob Potts.
Walid Saadaoui and Amar Hussein were both found guilty of preparing acts of terrorism after a trial at Preston Crown Court and were sentenced to minimum sentences of 37 and 26 years, respectively.
Saadaoui's younger brother, Bilel Saadaoui, was additionally found guilty of failing to disclose information about acts of terrorism and was sentenced to six years in prison.
According to GMP, Saadaoui masterminded the plot and recruited Hussein to participate.
Saadaoui, Hussein crafted plot through online communications
In late 2023, Saadaoui came into contact online with an individual he believed to be a fellow extremist, and after multiple messages were exchanged between the two, "it soon became clear that Saadaoui was keen to conduct a significant terrorist attack targeting Jewish people," GMP stated.
Saadaoui believed the individual could help him import automatic firearms to use in the terrorist attack and began developing the plot, going so far as to "conduct reconnaissance around Upper Broughton in Salford" and visit the port through which they believed the weapons would be smuggled.
According to a BBC report, Saadaoui planned to obtain four AK-47 assault rifles, two handguns, and 900 rounds of ammunition for the firearms.
The individual sought out by Saadaoui for help with the plot turned out to be an undercover agent who played a "crucial role" in foiling Saadaoui and Hussein's would-be terrorist attack, according to GMP.
Through Saadaoui's discussion of the plan with the undercover agent, it became clear to GMP that his younger brother knew about the planned attack, but remained silent, an action Potts stated "makes him as guilty as the others."
According to the BBC, Saadaoui was arrested by counter-terrorism police on May 8, 2024, in an operation with over 200 officers involved. He was apprehended in the parking lot of a hotel while attempting to collect the firearms he planned to use in the attack.
The BBC additionally reported that Saadaoui came to the attention of authorities when he began using social media accounts to spread Islamist extremist views. He used over ten accounts, none of which were created in his own name.
Reuters contributed to this report.

Leak damages 19th Century painting in latest Louvre setback

Leak damages 19th Century painting in latest Louvre setback
A water leak at the Louvre has caused damage to a 19th Century ceiling painting, in the latest major setback for the Parisian museum.
Water damage was discovered in room 707, also known as the "Duchâtel" room, late on Thursday night, the museum said. The room houses multiple 15th and 16th Century artworks.
The museum said the leak - from a heating pipe - was stopped shortly after midnight and the only painting damaged was Charles Meynier's The Apotheosis of Poussin, Le Sueur and Le Brun.
It comes a day after French police reportedly detained nine people - including two museum staff - over a suspected ticket fraud scheme.
Museum bosses have come under increasing scrutiny in recent months, after thieves stole priceless French crown jewels from the museum in broad daylight and hundreds of books were damaged in a leak.
The Louvre said Thursday night's leak occurred at the entrance to the paintings department in the Denon wing.
It said firefighters responded "immediately" and the leak was stopped 40 minutes after it began.
A painting restorer inspected Meynier's ceiling painting on Friday morning and found it had "two tears in the same area, caused by the water, and the paint layer on the ceiling and its arches has lifted".
The ceiling painting, signed by Meynier in 1822, depicts lauded French painters Nicolas Poussin, Eustache Le Sueur, and Charles Le Brun, who appear in the clouds among angelic figures.
Rooms 706, 707 and 708 in the Denon wing on the building's first floor were closed on Friday morning, but are expected to reopen later in the day.
The chief architect of historic monuments also came to assess the condition of the ceiling, the Louvre said, but found there were no structural problems.
A union representative told news agency Reuters that scaffolding had been erected in the affected area.
The cost of the damage to the painting and the building remains unclear.
This leak is the latest in a long series of problems faced by the museum, which is the most visited in the world, in the recent past.
In December, 300-400 pieces, mostly books, were damaged by a leak in the Louvre's Egyptian department. At the time, the museum's deputy administrator, Francis Steinbock, said the problem that caused the leak had been known about for years.
The month prior, structural weaknesses prompted the partial closure of one of the galleries hosting Greek vases and offices.
This came shortly after a high-profile heist on 19 October in which four burglars made off with historic jewellery worth €88m (£76m; $102m), exposing glaring gaps in the musuem's security.
The brazen theft involved a stolen vehicle-mounted mechanical lift, which was used to gain access to the Galerie d'Apollon (Gallery of Apollo) via a balcony close to the River Seine.
Several people have been arrested in relation to the heist, which the French police are still investigating.
The majority of the stolen pieces have still not been recovered and the museum has since moved some of its most precious jewels to the Bank of France.
A report published in October by France's public audit body criticised the museum's excessive spending on artwork, which it said was "to the detriment of the maintenance and renovation of buildings."

Regarding the torture of Ukrainians

Danylo Mokryk
Reporter with the War Crimes Investigations Unit of the Kyiv Independent
Torturing prisoners is not merely a war crime that Russians perpetrate, it's part of Russian culture. Susan Sontag's 20-year-old essays may help us understand it.
In the Kyiv Independent's latest investigative documentary "Torture Culture," we examine the sufferings that Russians systematically inflict on their Ukrainian prisoners — all the beatings, electrocutions, mutilations, sexual abuse, psychological violence — not only as a war crime but also a cultural phenomenon, something that Russians do decade after decade, whenever and wherever the opportunity presents itself.
From Western Ukraine in 1939-1941 to the Gulag system, from Chechnya to today's occupied territories, torture resurfaces again and again.
As it usually happens, some parts of our work on the documentary did not make it into the final cut. For example, during the interview with the Chechen human rights defender Akhmed Gisaev (who himself survived Russian detention and extensive torture in 2003) we discussed how the intent to instil fear in civilians with torture (and with spreading information about it among the population) in the occupied territory alludes to the Russian popular "matrimonial" proverb, "If she fears you it means she respects you."
An important point in the documentary is that the perpetrators of torture most often seemed to thoroughly enjoy the process.
Several survivors talked about it in their interviews. But there's also a seemingly small detail that we left out from the film — and which, upon reflection, is quite telling: according to all of our interviewees, Russian torturers liked to record the beatings, electrocutions, waterboardings, and other abuses and humiliations on their smartphones.
That brings to mind the last major essay by Susan Sontag, "Regarding the Torture of Others," published in 2004. In it, she comments on photos from the Iraqi Abu Ghraib prison, where American soldiers had been torturing local prisoners. "The meaning of these pictures is not just that these acts were performed, but that their perpetrators apparently had no sense that there was anything wrong in what the pictures show," she writes. "Even more appalling, since the pictures were meant to be circulated and seen by many people: it was all fun."
The same analysis may be applied to the Russian practice of consistently recording the process of torturing Ukrainians 20 years later.
And there's more in Susan Sontag's essay that may be helpful in trying to understand the different reasons and twisted logic behind Russian torture. For instance, she remarks that very often the detainees in Abu Ghraib were arrested for reasons no more specific than simply being in the wrong place at the wrong time, the only justification for holding them being "interrogation."
"Interrogation about what? About anything. Whatever the detainee might know. If interrogation is the point of detaining prisoners indefinitely, then physical coercion, humiliation and torture become inevitable," Sontag writes.
It seems that thousands of Ukrainian civilian prisoners who fell into Russian hands find themselves in exactly the same situation. In most cases, they’re not even charged with any crime. Instead, they are subjected to days, weeks, or even months of continuous interrogation — and, it often seems, to torture for its own sake.
Sontag is also very critical of George W. Bush's administration and its geopolitical direction — and she connects this direction to torture. "The torture of prisoners is not an aberration. It is a direct consequence of the with-us-or-against-us doctrines of world struggle," she writes. "This endless 'global war on terrorism'... inevitably leads to the demonizing and dehumanizing of anyone declared by the Bush administration to be a possible terrorist."
Once again, this logic can be applied to Russian torture practices against Ukrainians — and not only Ukrainians.
Demonizing and dehumanizing Ukrainians is part of Russian state propaganda. Labeling Ukrainian patriots as "nazis" and "fascists" serves just that purpose (we've covered that in one of our previous investigative documentaries, "Destroy in Whole or in Part").
Given the crucial part that the victory against Nazism plays in the modern Russian mentality, there's hardly a more efficient way to dehumanize a group of people than calling them that.
That's precisely why, historically, almost all Kremlin's invasions and military operations after World War II were conducted against "fascists" and "nazis" — at least, according to the Kremlin’s own propaganda.
To fight "fascists," the USSR sent tanks to Budapest in 1956 and Prague in 1968. Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev's attempts to crush Latvian and Estonian aspirations to independence in 1991 were also ostensibly aimed against "fascism."
Russian invasions of Moldova in 1991 and of Georgia in 1992-1993 were also accompanied by the same rhetoric, and so on. (I covered that topic in my 2022 investigation for Bihus.Info, which is also available in English).
Accusing its victim of being a "fascist" or a "nazi" can very well be considered a part of Russian political culture. And in the same way that, for Susan Sontag, the American "war on terror" led to torture in Abu Ghraib, the Russian "war on fascism" leads to torture in today's Ukraine.
Obviously, torturing the arch-enemy, the "fascist," the "nazi," is something Russians not only practice, but also very much enjoy.
Once again, it's cultural.

Kyrgyzstan president highlights ‘steady positive dynamics’ in ties with Kazakhstan
Sadyr Japarov says bilateral political dialogue ‘actively developing’ as Astana’s top diplomat visits Bishkek
ISTANBUL
Relations between Kyrgyzstan and Kazakhstan are demonstrating “steady positive dynamics,” Kyrgyz President Sadyr Japarov said on Friday as he received Kazakh Foreign Minister Yermek Kosherbayev in Bishkek.
The meeting focused on current issues of bilateral cooperation across a broad range of areas and underscored potential for expanding collaboration, according to the Kyrgyz presidential press service.
An exchange of views also took place on multilateral cooperation within international and regional organizations, with both sides confirming readiness to continue coordinating efforts on the international stage.
Japarov stressed relations between the two neighboring countries are “filled with concrete practical content” and that interstate political dialogue is “actively developing” at the highest and senior levels.
He pointed to ongoing joint trade, investment, transport, transit, and water and energy projects, including the construction of the Kambarata Hydroelectric Power Plant-1.
Kosherbayev thanked Japarov for the warm reception and conveyed greetings from President Kassym-Jomart Tokayev.
He said the "trust-based" dialogue between the two leaders provides a solid foundation for strengthening allied relations and promoting stability and prosperity in both countries.
The Kazakh minister said implementing agreements reached at the highest level in a timely and effective manner remains a priority for his ministry, alongside boosting practical cooperation in trade, economic, investment and humanitarian spheres.

With the schools breaking up for half term, Friday is a particularly busy day at Brussels Airport in Zaventem (Flemish Brabant). No fewer than 70,500 passengers are expected at the airport during Friday, making it the busiest day at the airport this spring half term. Unlike last year both Dutch-medium and French-medium schools break for half term up on the same day this year. Pupils in Dutch-medium education have a week’s holiday, while those taught through the medium of French have two weeks.
Almost 1.1 million passengers will travel via Zaventem during the spring half term break. Many will be leaving for skiing holidays or for warmer climes for a bit of sun, sea and sand. Today (Friday 13 February) 37,500 passengers will depart from Brussels Airport and 33,000 will arrive there.
Sunday 22 February is also set to be a busy day at Zaventem with 70,000 passengers expected. This coincides with the end of the school holidays in Dutch-medium schools.
Tradionally the favourite destinations for a holiday during the spring half term vacation are the Cannary Islands, Spain, Morocco, Tunisia, Cabo Verde, Gambia, the UEA and Thailand, all of which are (considerably) warmer and sunnier than Belgium at this time of year. Winter sport destinations are also popular.
Arrive in plenty of time
Brussels Airport advises passengers to arrive in plenty of time. This means at least 2 hours before take-off for a flight within the Schengen Zone and 3 hours before take-off for a flight outside the Schengen Zone.
Passengers are also advised to travel to the airport on public transport if the can or to reserve a parking space in advance.

Alexander Skarsgård and Harry Melling on the surprisingly sweet BDSM romance ‘Pillion’
Alexander Skarsgård plays a biker who begins a dom-sub relationship with a younger, more inexperienced man in “Pillion.”
- Bookmark
Alexander Skarsgård doesn’t usually watch his movies more than once with an audience. But “Pillion,” in which he plays the enigmatic member of gay biker club who begins a dom-sub relationship with a younger, more inexperienced man, Colin (Harry Melling), has been an exception. He’s seen it at least four times.
It’s partly because “Pillion” has been coming out for so long. The film premiered last year at the Cannes Film Festival before going on to play at several others and is just now arriving in North American theaters. But mostly it's because it's a film that is never not interesting to experience with a crowd: It's both remarkably explicit in its depiction of sex and surprisingly sweet and comedic as Ray (Skarsgård's character) and Colin navigate the dynamics of their unconventional relationship.
“It can play in so many different ways,” Skarsgård said in a recent interview. “It’s really fun to see and feel the energy in the room, how sometimes people really lean into the comedy and sometimes it feels more somber and heartfelt.”
Skarsgård was joined by Melling and filmmaker Harry Lighton for a lighthearted conversation about sex on screen, “Heated Rivlary” and why Melling, who since his days as Dudley Dursley in “Harry Potter” has become a bona fide character actor, would prefer to keep the word “breakthrough” out of this moment.
Remarks have been edited for clarity and brevity.
AP: There’s been some comparisons to “Babygirl,” which stirred debate over whether it’s sex positive or negative. Do you see “Pillion” in one of those lights?
LIGHTON: It’s hard for me to reduce it to sex positive or sex negative, because I think that there are ups and downs to Colin’s experience. Maybe I’d call it “sex net positive,” which is an incredibly unsexy way to describe the film. That’s not going to get bums on seats at all. But for me the film’s about someone trying to grow into his sexuality. And that’s always going to be a bumpy road. But where he ends up is with more knowledge and practice.
AP: Was there anything you refused to compromise on?
LIGHTON: I had to fight for the odd piece of technical equipment or an extra day in the schedule, all that boring stuff. But not the stuff which I thought was really integral to the script, for instance, not sanitizing the depiction of sex. I was very keen on the fact that if we were going to take on this subject matter that the sex would be on screen, that it wouldn’t be like portrayed through ellipsis or the camera panning away because I thought would make it seem like I was judging the type of sex we were showing. But I was very well supported in that aim by all of our execs.
SKARSGÅRD: The screenplay was way more explicit than the final movie. You made sure that anyone who read the screenplay knew what they were throwing themselves into.
MELLING: You really did know what you were saying yes to.
LIGHTON: Actually, in a way, you didn’t because you thought you were saying yes to a five-minute shot of an erection.
SKARSGÅRD: I’m like, what kind of Disney version of this movie is that?
AP: Ray is pretty mysterious, but you do get glimpses of vulnerability and insecurity. How did you make sense of him?
SKARSGÅRD: I love the little clues that Harry put into the screenplay and the fact that it’s never really spelled out. There’s never a big cataclysmic moment where he’s opening up about his past or about a secret life.
It was a lot of fun finding little things that would add a flavor to the character of this dominant biker, everything from what book is he reading, what glasses is he wearing, to what are the tattoos on his body? Maybe they’re more effeminate. Maybe he’s listening to like, “I Think We’re Alone Now,” you know, like pop music from the '80s.
And I’m really pleased that he remains enigmatic.
AP: Would you say this is a breakthrough role for Harry Melling?
LIGHTON: He’s done lots of roles which have merited attention and they’re all incredibly varied, which is what I found so fascinating about Harry as an actor. But I also did it in a slightly greedy way. I thought it was really exciting that I would be able give Harry the opportunity to, I mean, this is your first lead feature film role. Is that fair Harry?
MELLING: I’d say so.
LIGHTON: The success of the film lives or dies by Colin so I think the reaction to the film is a kind of testament to Harry’s work in it.
MELLING: I’ll also add, this is like a side point, nothing about that, but like the idea of, you know, the word breakthrough terrifies me. If you as an actor start considering this is, like, the moment or the breakthrough moment, you’re sort of done for.
SKARSGÅRD: And can we steer the conversation back to me now?
LIGHTON: I knew I knew that was coming. As soon as I said “lives or dies by Harry’s performance,” I saw your face drop.
SKARSGÅRD: You saw the vacant, distant gaze of an actor when the conversation isn’t about him.
LIGHTON: Anger. It was anger on the face.
SKARSGÅRD: I was texting my publicist, “Get me out of this.”
AP: Do you think “Pillion” could be a “Heated Rivalry” kind of hit?
SKARSGÅRD: No. But I’m excited that it’s coming out, finally. And the fact that people in the BDSM community seem to respond to it, but (Harry Lighton’s) mom also loves it. Hopefully it can appeal to a lot of people.
MELLING: My parents also absolutely loved it. Sadly, I didn’t see it with them, which I would have loved to. I know to a lot of people that would be shocking.
SKARSGÅRD: I watched it with my dad (Stellan Skarsgård), and he loved it. But maybe that’s less surprising than like Lighton’s mom with her friends going to watch it.
LIGHTON: Yeah, my mum hasn’t made any films of Lars von Trier, as far as I’m aware. But I mean, “Heated Rivalry” is a good example of someone taking a risk on something which seems like it might be niche, and then suddenly it explodes into the mainstream. Independent films are obviously different and our film is different from “Heated Rivalry” but I think the sort of takeaway is that taking risks can result in not only exciting creative material but commercially viable results as well.

Regarding inaccurate information disseminated by certain media outlets
In connection with the publication by several media outlets of materials alleging the involvement of Serhii Tarasov and the group of companies “I&U Group” in criminal proceedings handled by the National Anti-Corruption Bureau of Ukraine (NABU), we hereby state the following.
The information disseminated by certain media outlets is inaccurate and presented with significant distortion of the factual circumstances.
NABU is currently conducting criminal proceeding No. 42020120000000009 dated January 10, 2020, initiated under Part 2 of Article 364 of the Criminal Code of Ukraine (abuse of power or official authority), concerning alleged misconduct by officials of the Mykilska Village Council of Svitlovodsk District, Kirovohrad Region. The case relates to the establishment by the village council of an enterprise and the subsequent disposal of corporate rights in LLC “Megatrend” in favor of third parties.
The pre-trial investigation was originally initiated by law enforcement authorities of the Kirovohrad region and was conducted from 2020 to 2022, after which the case was transferred to NABU based on jurisdiction.
According to the investigation materials, officials of the Mykilska Village Council of Svitlovodsk District, Kirovohrad Region admitted participants into LLC “Megatrend” by contributing property belonging to the village council—namely 10 chairs—into the company’s authorized capital, which constituted 65% of the charter capital. Subsequently, the enterprise was granted lease rights, under a preferential procedure and without an auction, to 49 land plots totaling 1,500 hectares. Thereafter, the village council adopted a decision to alienate its share in the authorized capital in favor of another participant in the company. According to an expert assessment conducted by the Kyiv Scientific Research Institute of Forensic Expertise (KNDISE), damages were allegedly caused to the Mykilska Village Council as a result of the sale of corporate rights in LLC “Mega-Trend” at an undervalued price, taking into account the market value of such corporate rights as of January 25, 2016, in the amount of UAH 10,009,296.00.
Key Clarifications Regarding the Publication:
- The criminal proceeding concerns alleged abuse of power and official authority by officials of the Mykilska Village Council of Svitlovodsk District, Kirovohrad Region, and has no relation to “I&U Group.”
- According to NABU, no individual has been formally notified of suspicion in this proceeding; the case remains a fact-based investigation.
- The land plots were leased and have not been withdrawn from state ownership; lease payments continue to be made to this day.
- The decision to alienate part of the corporate rights in LLC “Mega-Trend” to a third party was adopted by resolution of a session of the Mykilska Village Council.
- “I&U Group” acquired LLC “Mega-Trend” with its assets and encumbrances from third parties, not from the village council.
- According to official data available on the website of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of Ukraine and Interpol, S.D. Tarasov is not subject to international search and no preventive measure has been imposed on him.
- According to official information from NABU, S.D. Tarasov has not received any notice of suspicion in any NABU case and does not hold any procedural status in the Bureau’s proceedings.
We additionally note that one of the media outlets that first disseminated the information using inaccurate wording and assumptions subsequently removed the respective publication from its platform.
We call on media representatives to adhere to journalistic standards, respect the presumption of innocence, and verify information before publication.
The group of companies “I&U Group” conducts its activities in full compliance with the legislation of Ukraine, cooperates openly with state authorities, and is prepared to provide all necessary information in accordance with the law.
For the purpose of media cooperation, S.D. Tarasov is ready to give interviews to independent media outlets.

No water or electricity, and children begging in streets filled with rubbish – but this is why I won’t leave Cuba

Felix Valdés García was nine years old when the revolutionaries came to blow up his trees. It was the verge of the 1970s and his father, Felin, was losing the family farm to Cuba’s 10-year-old communist regime. A push called the Revolutionary Offensive was under way, mobilising the people to sow, clean and harvest 10m tonnes of sugar cane in an effort to make Cuba financially independent. The land needed to be cleared.
For decades the family had nurtured their 800 hectares of rich loam alongside the meandering Sagua River. Eight couples, all related, worked the fields, while Felix and his sister had fruitful adventures among the royal palms, avocado, mango and magnificent ceiba.
“The sappers arrived,” Felix writes in his family memoir. “A gang of agile men who opened holes in the roots and placed charges of dynamite. There was a terrible roar and the trees flew into the sky, defying gravity, then fell shuddering with broken branches.”
Felix is my father-in-law, and I recall this moment when I think about Cuba’s revolution, which is often as the country spirals into tragedy around me.
A vast human experiment is coming to an end. Fidel and Raúl Castro’s communist revolution is crumbling, to be replaced by … we know not what. The US government, after six decades of aggression, is seeking the endgame. The Trump administration, newly energised from decapitating Venezuela’s Bolivarian revolution, is looking for “assets” within the Cuban government, and briefing of warships enforcing a total oil blockade. “Make a deal before it’s too late,” President Donald Trump told Cuba’s leaders.
The Americans are facing a country where the lazy tourist’s recommendation – “See it before it changes” – no longer applies. In the pit of an economic slump, the island has gone from being run-down and picturesque to a horror show. The economy contracted by 11% between 2019 and 2024, with a further 5% fall through September 2025. Rubbish fills the streets, picked over by burgeoning bands of beggars. Rolling power cuts rack the island, spoiling the little food people have in their fridges, and making it hard to sleep. Anyone who protests is met with authoritarian force.
It’s not the first time Cubans have gone hungry. The “special period in a time of peace” following the collapse of the Soviet Union saw people begin to starve. But those who lived through those times say these are different. The government, out of money and ideas, has allowed a small super-class of Cubans to emerge, licensed to import products including food. But inflation means very few can afford their goods. “In the special period things were very bad, because there was no food, but we had hope,” said Carlos Bustamante, a film producer. “Now there is food, if you can afford it, but no hope.”
The wealthy drive Mercedes and Dodge Rams past the famous 1950s Ford Fairlanes and 1970s Russian Ladas. In the special period neighbour helped neighbour, but such communitarianism is collapsing. Every generation is affected by the crisis, but none more so than the one that built the revolution, who rallied to the call to put aside personal gain for the common good. It was they who volunteered to cut cane during that 10m-tonne harvest, on the understanding that they would be provided with food and healthcare until they died.
The revolution raised many out of poverty, its great achievement. But it is now beggaring them again.
For some it was enough. I stop an old man sweeping the path outside his house in Havana’s Vedado neighbourhood. Darío Díaz Machado says he was a lieutenant colonel in FAR, the revolutionary army. His 4,500 pesos a month pension may only be worth $10, but his son, a surgeon in Spain, sends money.
“I was a peasant, working the land,” he says. “After the triumph of the revolution I began to attend schools and improve myself. I’ve come this far. I feel happy.”
This is not a widely held view. An estimated 20% of the population – among them the best and brightest – have emigrated since the pandemic, often with children. The shock on the faces of their elderly and increasingly lonely relatives matches the state of their clothes.
Martha Ortega was a secretary in a Communist party office in central Havana. She now lives with her daughter, who is deaf and mute, on a pension inflation has reduced to $5 a month. “We lived with a dream, with a devotion. And then everything was gone,” she tells me.
What Cubans now live with is an electricity grid that regularly collapses. The first time it happened, in October 2024, I was making breakfast for my then two-year-old boy, Santiago. Five days of blackout also meant the water supply had failed. He was potty training, and turning to check on him, I discovered he’d pooed on the floor, putting his dirty hands to his face.
I looked at the useless taps, aware that our cupboard of imported medicines didn’t include anything for conjunctivitis. Picking him up, I thought: what are we doing here? Many have no choice, but we do.
Part of it is that my wife, a literary professor at the University of Havana, has never wanted to go. We’ve lived together for eight years in her small apartment overlooking the Florida Straits and she remains in awe of her home city. “All this,” she’ll say, looking at some magnificent building. “In the Caribbean.”
But all her friends have gone. A graduate of the once meritocratic powerhouse of a high school, La Lenin, she shared a dorm with friends who are now spread across North America. They wonder why she won’t go, too. Instead she heads off to classes during the extended power cuts in the hope that her students will turn up in the gloom (they usually do).
But part of it is me. Cubans now refer to themselves as a “third world country”. Marco Rubio, the US’s Cuban-American secretary of state, who is at the forefront of the administration’s effort to change the Havana regime, called it “fourth world”. This makes me furious because neither is true. Or at least it wasn’t. Cuba is something else, something unique and terrifying, which is what this article is about.
I came of age in Scotland when the Berlin Wall fell, and was told the good guys won and the bad guys lost. Felix heard it differently. In the 1980s he had left the house in Santa Clara in which the family had been resettled from the farm, to study philosophy. He boarded a ship in Havana Bay and set off across the Atlantic to study in the Soviet Union. The cruise liner refuelled in Algeciras, Cuba’s communist students shouting down to Spain’s until recently fascist stevedores. Then it was through the Bosphorus, and a landing in Odesa.
There Felix met Yohanka, also Cuban, also a philosopher. (You get used to this sort of thing if you live in Cuba: I like to fish and Felipe, my Cuban guide, is a trained psychologist.) Felix and Yohanka were beneficiaries of a revolution determined to educate. “Without education there is no revolution,” Fidel Castro said. Yet all attempts to pay for this education were failing. The sugar harvest that saw Felix’s beloved trees blown up fell short by between 1.5m and 2.5m tonnes, and was soon excised from national conversation.
Other attempts to centrally plan prosperity sputtered into life. There was an ambition to build a network of nuclear power stations, which collapsed after Chornobyl, a bioengineering sector to manufacture drugs, which was met with an international shrug, and a tourism industry that necklaced the best beaches on the island with ugly all-inclusive hotels. Without capitalism’s glinting edge, the government’s money-making attempts either limped on or collapsed. Each time I pass through Havana’s José Martí airport, I laugh at a billboard attempting to encourage medical tourism. It shows a smiling couple saying, “I choose Cuba to procreate.” I mean, I chose Cuba to procreate, but I wouldn’t have put it quite like that.
Doctors have been trained by the thousand, and sent to more than 160 countries on medical missions. These have been a subject of pride and scandal: the doctors earn up to $1,000 a month while the state charges the host country five times that.
Nothing has given the island – 777 miles long, with a historic population of 11 million – the velocity to escape the financial kindness of other nations. Instead, the economy has lurched from one crisis to another, as insidious sweetheart deals have been done with Russia, Venezuela, Iran and China. Meanwhile, the fundamental infrastructure rots. “This country has never been economically independent,” says Katrin Hansing, a professor of anthropology at the City University of New York. “Full stop, since colonial times.”
The government blames its woes – with justification – on the US and its decades-long economic embargo. Others – with equal justification – point to ageing political leaders ineptly running a moribund, centrally planned state. What is certain is that the vast majority of Cubans on the island no longer care who is to blame.
As 2024 turned into 2025, we took a family trip to Viñales. If you have visited Cuba, you will probably know it: a village in the island’s west in a valley full of mogotes, steep-sided rocky hills. There was a pig roast, presided over by a local lad sporting a solid-gold chain and a vast medallion. I liked his shtick. He’d made money trading cars. His children were like little Mowglis, charging around bareback on horses, before falling asleep together in a hammock.
But my parents-in-law eyed him in confusion. “He’s just not emancipated,” Felix said. I’d laughed, teasing him, but I kept thinking about it afterwards. It reminded me of a line in Secondhand Time, Svetlana Alexievich’s Nobel prize-winning book of interviews with people after the fall of the Soviet Union. “There were new rules,” one said. “If you have money, you count – no money, you’re nothing. Who cares if you’ve read all of Hegel?”
I tell the story to Hansing, the City University of New York professor, who is a classic example of the curious people you meet on the island. She arrived in Cuba in the 1980s as a teenager, daughter of South African anti-apartheid activists. She was educated on Cuba’s Isle of Youth alongside students from a slew of African countries, part of Fidel Castro’s then global outreach.
“I know so many people who grew up in the early years of the revolution who became professionals, doctors, engineers, university professors, journalists,” she says. “But their children or grandchildren, if they haven’t been able to leave, are now doing manual labour because it pays better.” She is grim about the future: “There’s a growing sense of not only anti-intellectualism, but anti-education among many young people.”
Cuba’s revolutionaries made the island an icon of the international left. In some ways it still is. In January, there was a gathering to mark the anniversary of the 1966 Tricontinental Conference which drew anti-colonialists from all over the world. And yet lately, the government’s apparent acceptance of the suffering of its people has been causing a degree of circumspection even among true believers. Heinz Bierbaum is a former president of the European Left who, as chair of the Rosa Luxemburg Foundation, is a regular visitor to the island. “Solidarity with Cuba is very important because it’s a socialist country in an unfavourable environment,” he says. “But we have to talk about the situation, to enter a dialogue with the government about the problems.” (To be fair, he told me this before the US assault on Venezuela, which is bound to harden opinions again.)
It didn’t have to be like this. In 2016, then US president Barack Obama flew into Havana to “bury the last remnants of the cold war”. He was greeted by a population who believed fundamentally in free healthcare and education. It wouldn’t have been a reach for Cuba to give its people a little opportunity, allowing them to earn money while asking them to pay decent taxes towards such benefits. But the government didn’t think so, at least not on any effective scale. Instead it cleaved to policies that maintained its control of the economy, often in baffling ways. A programme of hotel building has been under way, with 7,000 more rooms added since 2019, despite tourist numbers halving in the same period. And no one answers the question why.
Meanwhile, in 2021 came a unification of two currencies, one pegged to the US dollar, one local, which resulted in hyperinflation that collapsed the value of state sector pay and pensions. The minister responsible, Alejandro Gil, was charged, convicted and given a life sentence for corruption and, more startlingly, espionage. Again, no further explanations were given.
Michael Bustamante, chair of Cuban and Cuban-American Studies at the University of Miami, and one of the most fair-minded observers of the island, says the government has “missed every opportunity” to make the economy better, and the effects are heartbreaking. Children who would once have had to answer to the police if seen on the streets in school hours now use the time to beg. Parents struggle. A friend received a call from her sons’ school after a rainstorm asking that she pick them up. A lack of gas meant they had been cooking lunch for the children over fire, but their wood got wet.
Doctors battle on, working in dirty hospitals, sharing any functioning machines, doing what they can. But once-vaunted infant mortality rates have doubled and even the government admits medicines are scarce.
And people keep leaving. There are no firm figures but estimates are as high as 2 million. My wife’s speciality is the literature of emigration, her PhD on writers making sense of their broken families and exile. Her subject has been Haiti, a deflection not lost on her.
Across the Florida Straits, Cuba’s exile community watches events on the island carefully, sensing the end even as they struggle with this latest, unprecedentedly large, influx of refugees. In an office on the 11th floor of a glittering building in Miami’s Brickell mall, Pedro Freyre is one of the city’s leading attorneys. The 76-year-old is exile aristocracy, his family having fled a beautiful house on Havana’s Fifth Avenue ahead of the revolution. His brother fought against the Castros in the Bay of Pigs and his brother-in-law died there.
Cuban Americans are proud of their relationship with their adopted country, he says. “We were well received, well treated. And, as the song says, we built this city.”
Despite his family history, Freyre was closely involved in the effort to bring investment to Cuba during the thaw in relations started by Obama. “Trump’s people were there,” he says. “You see the property that they were looking at as you fly in. It had a landing strip, and he was going to build a golf course.”
He has lost patience now, saying many Cuban Americans would support intervention – something I never hear in Cuba itself. He calls nonsense on my suggestion that the revolution gave Cubans a unique intellectualism. “That’s a very Cuban tradition that has been around since the inception – think of José de la Luz y Caballero and José Martí.”
This remark brings me up short and I mull it as I drive away. I think also of pre-revolutionary artist Wifredo Lam, writer Alejo Carpentier and singer Benny Moré. Then I look around, at Miami’s flatlands full of strip malls and faux-this-and-that houses. Cubans may have built this city, but they didn’t do it with any poetry.
Still, I am on my way to meet a man who will shed no tears if the revolution collapses, who has experienced the darkest side of its legacy. In a small apartment under the flight path into Miami airport, I find José Daniel Ferrer, who for much of this century has been de facto head of the Cuban opposition. On and off, he has spent 12 years in Cuba’s jails as a political prisoner (one of nearly 1,200, according to human rights group Prisoners Defenders). “I saw things I never thought a human being in the western hemisphere could see,” he says, including being held in darkness for months, force-fed, attacked by both guards and prisoners. He says he watched two men get beaten to death.
Despite this, he always refused to leave Cuba, determined to be a thorn in the side of the government from within, but in October last year he’d had enough and accepted exile. “There is nothing to lose with the fall of the regime,” he says bitterly. “Rather we will gain freedom, opportunity and prosperity.”
The worst years of his incarceration, he says, came after 2016. It’s a reminder that, even if everything had gone smoothly following Obama’s visit, it’s unlikely Cuba would have easily pivoted into a cosy social democracy. “Cuba hasn’t had a democracy, let alone a social democracy, since 1952, so there is a lot of work to be done,” says Bustamante, the University of Miami academic. “And the tenor of political discourse among Cubans doesn’t give me high hope for the defence of democratic values.”
Indeed, inside Cuba, misery has led to a cyclone of cynicism, projected in bitter humour. During the last May Day celebrations, a joke circulated that the vast annual march, when workers are bussed in from all corners, would no longer lead to the city’s Plaza de la Revolucion … but instead to the psychiatric hospital.
For those the revolution educated, the sad last act of the great experiment appears to be extraordinary individual tragedies. Says Hansing, “For many of the Cubans I know, these are the questions: what have I lived through? What was all that for? What was my life?”
Reading this article, my father-in-law Felix said sadly, “You [he meant western Europeans, Americans] use communism as a hammer, but to me it remains a beautiful idea – perhaps the most beautiful idea.”
I drive my family down the island for a cousin’s wedding. We take the northern road, past the tourist beaches of Varadero and along a crumbling highway next to Cuba’s palm-fringed coast. Despite the power cuts and lack of gasoline, it remains a journey I love above almost all others.
The people we pass appear exhausted, as if waiting for something they can no longer even articulate. My wife and I have made a habit of exploring Cuba’s sideroads and we do so again, arriving by chance at a hotel once known for its natural springs. The whole family get out. The lobby is clean and the shop is open, selling beach towels and hats. The staff are welcoming, their uniforms pressed. The swimming pool is empty and there are no guests. I ask when the last came through and the receptionist tells me four years ago.
Later, at the wedding in Sagua La Grande, where the power cuts are now more than 16 hours a day, the priest tells the congregation not to throw rice, but to instead give it to the happy couple.
Still caught by the story of the sappers blowing up the family’s trees, I suggest we visit the farm on the way back to Havana, and plant a few fresh saplings. From the highway, I see the gesture is unnecessary. The whole place has turned to thick forest. But Felix has brought a tree anyway, a lemon that had grown from a discarded fruit in the Santa Clara house in the years after his father, Felin, died in 2021.
We pick our way through the woods, through rattlebush and punarnava, Felix plunging ahead with such intent, I worry the rest of us will lose him. Finally we emerge into a clearing where the Caribbean sun is diffused by the canopy.
Nothing remains of the farm, not even the foundations of the house. We stand astonished. All traces of Felin’s work, of the eight couples who lived here, have disappeared. All the pain and sadness Felin suffered on losing his land was unnecessary, and is now forgotten by everyone except this family.
I start digging. My boy Santiago runs over to help, pulling up rich, fecund soil with his little hands. When it is deep enough, Felix plants the lemon tree.
We press down the roots and christen it with water. A burst of sunlight draws out the deep green of its leaves and a yellow butterfly, magnificent and huge, floats by. We all watch it go, its journey as random as madness.

As Chinese provinces slash revenue outlook, analysts warn of debt control
Local governments seen curbing infrastructure spending as Beijing’s fiscal discipline pushes regions to prioritise social services and tech over large projects
Fiscal strains are forcing Chinese provinces to slash their budget-revenue expectations for 2026 due to the knock-on effects of a five-year property market slump, and analysts cite the shift as a warning sign that intense debt pressures continue to drag down the nation’s economic growth outlook.
Major provinces are budgeting for 2 to 3 per cent growth this year in general public operating revenue, broadly in line with last year but below broader economic growth targets, Fitch Ratings said in a research note on Wednesday. It pointed to “subdued revenue momentum” and flagged debt-repayment risks.
“We believe local governments will prioritise debt control rather than pursue rapid expansion in infrastructure investment to prop up growth,” Fitch wrote, citing data from 23 Chinese provinces, regions and municipalities.
Low property values were expected to keep local investments in check.
“A sustained rebound in land purchases is unlikely in the near term, keeping [local government] capital revenue weak or flat in many provinces and constraining government-fund spending growth,” the credit rating agency said. “Operating spending discipline is also likely to persist, despite the Ministry of Finance’s indications that fiscal spending would be increased in 2026.
“We expect modest expenditure growth for [local government’s] general public budgets.”

US and Europe must ‘repair and revive transatlantic ties’: Germany’s Merz
German leader seeks to set tone of unity at Munich Security Council, as top US diplomat says ‘new era in geopolitics’.
German Chancellor Friedrich Merz has called on the United States and Europe to “repair and revive transatlantic trust together” during an address at the Munich Security Conference.
Merz began his remarks on Friday at the annual meeting of top global security figures with an appeal for unity, arguing that Washington also benefits from its role in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO).

- list 3 of 3Trump is the ‘elephant in the room’ as the African Union holds new summit
The statement contrasted remarks by US Vice President JD Vance last year, who used his appearance at the event, just weeks after taking office, to chastise European leaders for their funding commitments to NATO and to criticise the state of democracy on the continent.
“Let me begin with the uncomfortable truth: A rift, a deep divide has opened between Europe and the United States,” Merz said.
“Vice President JD Vance said this a year ago here in Munich. He was right in his description,” Merz said, as he called for a “new transatlantic partnership”.
Referencing Trump’s Make America Great Again (MAGA) movement, Merz also warned that Europe did not need to move in the same political direction as the US, saying the “culture war of the MAGA movement is not ours”.
Directly appealing to the Trump administration, he added: “In the era of great power rivalry, even the United States will not be powerful enough to go it alone.
“Being a part of NATO is not only Europe’s competitive advantage. It is also the United States’ competitive advantage. So let’s repair and revive transatlantic trust together. Europe is doing its part.”
‘A new era in geopolitics’
It remained unclear how receptive Washington would be to the message after a year of confrontational policies that have roiled traditional European allies.
That has included the increased pressure for more NATO funding, whiplash efforts to end Russia’s war in Ukraine and Trump’s threats to seize Greenland, an autonomous territory of NATO-member Denmark.
The administration has also put renewed emphasis on what it has called Europe’s “civilizational self-confidence and Western identity”, calling on countries on the continent to stem migration, while accusing them of stifling right-wing voices.
Critics have said the messaging has racist undertones.
Leaving for Germany late Thursday, US Secretary of State Marco Rubio said the US is “very tightly linked together with Europe”, adding that “most people in this country can trace both, either their cultural or their personal heritage back to Europe. So, we just have to talk about that.
“We live in a new era in geopolitics, and it’s going to require all of us to reexamine what that looks like,” said Rubio, who is set to speak on Friday.
The visit comes as Trump’s Republican Party prepares for the midterm elections in November, which will decide control of the US House of Representatives and Senate.
A slate of recent polls has suggested tanking support for Trump on several domestic issues, including his hardline immigration policy.
Polls have also shown voter disquiet over Trump’s actions abroad, including the US military abduction of Venezuelan leader Nicolas Maduro and Trump’s push to take control of Greenland.
A new poll released on Friday suggested seven in 10 US adults disapprove of how Trump is handling the issue of Greenland.
The rate is higher than the overall disapproval of Trump’s foreign policy approach.
‘European nuclear deterrence’
Speaking on Friday, Germany’s Merz also confirmed he was holding talks with French President Emmanuel Macron on “European nuclear deterrence”.
Calls for a so-called European nuclear umbrella have gained new momentum amid the wider US strategic pivot away from Europe.
Under NATO’s existing arrangement, US nuclear weapons stationed in Europe can be deployed by aircraft from allied countries in the event of an emergency. US nuclear bombs are believed to be stored in northern Italy, Belgium, the Netherlands and western Germany.
For its part, Germany has been required to renounce the manufacture, possession and control of nuclear, biological and chemical weapons as part of a 1990 agreement on the country’s reunification.
Merz said any new policy would be in line with Berlin’s legal commitments.
Following the United Kingdom’s exit from the European Union in 2020, France became the only nuclear-armed member of the bloc.

Teachers describe immigration enforcement's impact on classrooms in challenge of Trump policy
In a new court filing, teachers around the country describe how President Donald Trump’s immigration crackdown is emptying classrooms and frightening families
- Bookmark
In one testimonial after another, teachers detailed all the ways President Donald Trump's immigration crackdown has shaped their work and the lives of their students.
In a court filing Thursday, educators around the country described rumors of immigration raids that scared away students, immigrant parents who stopped sending their children to school altogether, and stories of parents and students — including one middle schooler — being picked up by Immigration and Customs Enforcement at school bus stops.
The stories were shared as part of a a lawsuit challenging a Trump administration policy that opened up schools, houses of worship and medical facilities to immigration enforcement. Farmworker and teacher unions, churches and preschool educators filed the lawsuit last year in federal court in Eugene, Oregon, arguing that the policy was “arbitrary and capricious.”
As the impacts of immigration enforcement on schools and healthcare facilities grew, the plaintiffs filed a petition asking a judge to halt the Trump administration policy as the lawsuit proceeds.
“In recent months — and escalating in the past several weeks — immigration enforcement agents have made startling incursions into cities and towns around the country, including unprecedented and unrestrained surges in and around vital community institutions such as schools and healthcare facilities,” attorneys wrote.
The Department of Homeland Security did not immediately respond to a message seeking comment.
Administration officials have defended the policy in the past, saying that making schools, churches and other spaces off-limits to immigration enforcement could make them refuges for criminals.
Officials have said Immigrations and Customs Enforcement does not target schools for enforcement operations, but there have been several instances in recent months where immigration authorities have pursued or detained people on or near school property.
A new policy opened the door to arrests at schools
The government for more than three decades had barred immigration authorities from making arrests in schools and houses of worship. That policy was updated over the years to include other “protected areas,” such as hospitals and homeless shelters, to prevent enforcement actions that would restrict access to essential services and activities.
Shortly after Trump took office, his administration rescinded that policy, instead issuing a four-paragraph memo that advised officers to use “a healthy dose of common sense” when deciding whether to make arrests near “protected areas.”
As Trump has ramped up his efforts to deport millions of people, some of the arrests have been made near schools during pick-up and drop-off hours. The plaintiffs in the lawsuit include a trio of educators from an Oregon preschool, where ICE agents attempted to arrest a man in the parking lot after he dropped off his infant son.
In Chelsea, Massachusetts, teachers union president Kathryn Anderson said immigration enforcement has been more disruptive to learning than the COVID pandemic, which moved school online for months. The school system lost a significant number of students this year and absenteeism is higher than usual.
“Right now, kids of all backgrounds are being prevented from going to school because of the extremely real fear that either they or their family members will be separated,” said Anderson, who is not part of the lawsuit. “As an educator ... having to help kids move through and exist in that fear (has) been a near impossible task.”
During a Chicago operation in October, agents released tear gas that engulfed a school playground. They later arrested a teacher inside of her preschool during morning drop-off. DHS said agents had attempted to pull over the car she was riding in before she got to school and said she barricaded herself inside, forcing agents to enter. The woman, who has work authorization, was eventually released.
In Minneapolis, agents scuffled with bystanders after pursuing a man onto a high school campus as school was ending for the day.
Teachers describe fear trickling into classrooms
The court filing included testimony from 60 teachers and health care workers from 18 states who described how immigration enforcement near their schools and medical facilities has challenged their work. All submitted their testimony anonymously.
One middle school teacher said half of students stayed home amidst a rumor about immigration enforcement nearby. The following month, a student at the school was detained while at a bus stop.
Elsewhere, a speech pathologist described tearful meetings with immigrant parents fearful that signing documents to get their child special education services would draw the attention of immigration enforcement.
A high school teacher said many students, including immigrants still learning English, switched to virtual learning after a parent was arrested by ICE at a school bus stop. But the virtual option is only offered in English, and the teacher said they feared the students are falling behind.
A teacher at a another school said a student was detained by ICE at a school bus stop and never returned to class after being released. Now, when students ask whether they can be arrested at school, "I can no longer reassure them that campus is safe from ICE.”

UK High Court rules banning of anti-Israel group Palestine Action unlawful

UK High Court rules banning of anti-Israel group Palestine Action unlawful
Judges leave ban in place pending government’s expected appeal, but say ‘level, scale’ of group’s actions, including raids on military and industrial sites, don’t merit ‘terror’ label
Britain’s High Court ruled Friday that the government’s decision to outlaw the protest group Palestine Action as a terrorist organization was unlawful, but kept the ban in place pending another hearing, while the government prepares an appeal.
The UK government banned Palestine Action after activists in June 2025 broke into a Royal Air Force base and vandalized two planes, causing an estimated £7 million ($9.3 million) of damage, in protest of Britain’s military support for Israel amid the war in Gaza.
Judges Victoria Sharp, Jonathan Swift and Karen Steyn said that “the nature and scale of Palestine Action’s activities” did not meet the “level, scale and persistence” that would justify proscription.
The judges said they were “satisfied that the decision to proscribe Palestine Action was disproportionate.”
The government had declared the anti-Israel group a terrorist organization, alongside the likes of al-Qaeda and Hamas, making membership in or support for Palestine Action a crime punishable by up to 14 years in prison.
Since then, more than 2,700 people have been arrested at protests for holding signs saying “I support Palestine Action.” More than 250 have been charged under the Terrorism Act.
Supporters of Palestine Action and civil liberties groups said the arrests ran roughshod over free speech and the right to peacefully protest.
Palestine Action co-founder Huda Ammori said the court’s decision “is a monumental victory both for our fundamental freedoms here in Britain and in the struggle for freedom for the Palestinian people, striking down a decision that will forever be remembered as one of the most extreme attacks on free speech in recent British history.”
Yasmine Ahmed, UK director of Human Rights Watch, called the court ruling “a shot in the arm for British democracy.” She said the British government had used anti-terror legislation to stifle legitimate criticism of Israel.
British Jews ‘deeply concerned,’ minister vows fight
UK Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood said she was “disappointed by the court’s decision,” and pledged on X: “I will fight this judgment in the Court of Appeal.”
In a statement after the verdict, Mahmood said: “The Court acknowledged that Palestine Action has carried out acts of terrorism, celebrated those who have taken part in those acts and promoted the use of violence.
“It has also concluded that Palestine Action is not an ordinary protest or civil disobedience group, and that its actions are not consistent with democratic values and the rule of law.”
The home secretary argued that the blacklisting “does not prevent peaceful protest in support of the Palestinian cause, another point on which the court agrees,” and insisted that some of the supporters of the group “don’t know the full nature of this organization.
“The proscription of Palestine Action followed a rigorous and evidence-based decision-making process, endorsed by parliament,” she said, pledging on X: “I will fight this judgment in the Court of Appeal.”
In a joint statement, the UK’s Jewish Leadership Council and the Board of Deputies of British Jews welcomed Mahmood’s response to the ruling, which they said “deeply concerned” them.
“The practical impact of Palestine Action’s activities on Jewish communal life has been significant and deeply unsettling,” the Jewish groups said. “Palestine Action has repeatedly targeted buildings hosting Jewish communal institutions, Jewish-owned businesses, or sites associated with Israel, in ways that cause fear and disruption far beyond the immediate protest sites.”
The Jewish groups said they would “seek urgent clarity” from the UK government, police and prosecutors “regarding the implications of this ruling and the steps they intend to take to ensure that communities are protected from intimidation and criminality. This includes ensuring appropriate legal tools are available.
“The safety of the British public including Jews must remain a priority,” the groups said.
Palestine Action has carried out acts of “direct action” at military and industrial sites in the UK since the group’s formation in 2020, including breaking into facilities owned by Israeli weapons manufacturer Elbit Systems UK.
Last week, a UK jury found six Palestine Action members not guilty of aggravated burglary at an Elbit UK site in Bristol in August 2024. One of them was also acquitted of causing grievous bodily harm despite being filmed striking a policewoman with a sledgehammer, resulting in a fractured spine. UK prosecutors said Saturday that they would seek a retrial in the case following sharp criticism from lawmakers, police leaders and Jewish organizations.
Officials say Palestine Action’s activities have caused millions of pounds in damage that affects national security.
In their ruling Friday, the judges said that while “a very small number of its actions have amounted to terrorist action … regardless of proscription, the criminal law is available to prosecute those concerned.”
The justices said they would not quash the ban until a further hearing on whether it should stay in place “pending the possibility of an appeal.” They gave lawyers for the two sides until Feb. 20 to prepare for that hearing.
London’s Metropolitan Police force said that in light of the judgment, officers would not arrest people expressing support for Palestine Action, but would continue to gather evidence of offenses “to provide opportunities for enforcement at a later date.”

Falling cocoa prices won't necessarily mean cheaper Valentine's Day chocolates
Cocoa prices have fallen nearly 70% since last Valentine’s Day, but that won’t make heart-shaped boxes of chocolate or even chocolate Easter bunnies more affordable this year
- Bookmark
Cocoa prices have fallen nearly 70% since last Valentine's Day, but that won’t make heart-shaped boxes of chocolate or even chocolate Easter bunnies more affordable this year.
Chocolate prices at U.S. retail stores rose 14% between Jan. 1 and the first week of February compared to the same period last year, according to market research company Datasembly. That’s on top of a 7.8% increase for the same period in 2025.
Europe has seen even steeper price increases. In Germany, chocolate prices rose 18.9% in 2025, according to government figures.
Here’s what caused the price of cocoa futures to rise and then fall — and why that may not be reflected in the prices customers are paying.
Cocoa, climate and cost
Cocoa prices more than doubled in 2024 due to insufficient rainfall and crop diseases in West Africa, which supplies more than 70% of the world’s cocoa. Cocoa, which is made from the dried beans of the cacao tree, is the main ingredient in both dark and white chocolate.
Weather conditions have improved since then in Ivory Coast and Ghana, and cocoa production is increasing in Ecuador and other countries, according to an analysis by J.P. Morgan. The resulting supply increase is one reason cocoa prices are coming down.
But they're also dropping because of lower global demand. Chocolate getting more expensive has turned off consumers, so manufacturers have cut the amount of chocolate they use or shifted to other products like gummy candies to keep prices in check, said Chris Costagli, a food thought leader at the market research company NIQ.
In the U.S., annual retail sales of chocolate rose 6.7% in 2025 compared to the prior year, largely because of price increases, according to NIQ data. But the number of individual products sold was down 1.3%, as consumers bought less chocolate overall.
Tariffs on treats
The Trump administration's tariffs were another reason U.S. chocolate prices increased last year.
The administration put a tariff averaging 15% on cocoa-producing countries last February, which raised the price of U.S. cocoa imports, according to the U.S. Federal Reserve.
In November, the administration removed tariffs on cocoa and other commodities that can't be grown in the U.S., including coffee, spices and tropical fruit.
But tariffs of 15% or more on products from the European Union, including chocolates, remain in place.
What goes up... may stay up
So far, declining cocoa prices haven't necessarily let chocolate lovers pay less.
Costagli compares the situation to gas prices. Even when the cost of oil goes down, prices at the pump don't immediately follow because companies need to use up the oil they bought at a higher price.
Chocolate makers like The Hershey Co. have long-term contracts that may require them to pay more than current cocoa prices. The market also is volatile; companies know that another bout of poor weather or a surge in demand could make cocoa prices surge again.
But Costagli said companies also watch shoppers' reaction to prices.
“If the customer is still willing to pay that higher price point, do we really take the price down?" he said.
Mondelez International, which owns chocolate brands like Oreo, Cadbury and Toblerone, raised its prices by 8% globally in 2025 to counter higher cocoa costs.
In Europe, the company hiked prices by even more and saw a significant decrease in the amount of its products sold. As a result, Mondelez lowered prices this year in some markets, including the United Kingdom and Germany.
“We have learned that certain price points are very important, and so we have adjusted already to put our products at the right price point,” Mondelez Chairman and CEO Dirk Van de Put said during a February conference call with investors.
Van de Put said Mondelez didn't plan immediate price cuts in North America, where both its price increases and its sales volume losses were more moderate.
Trading up ... or down
Two segments of the chocolate market grew in the U.S. last year: value brands and super-premium brands, Costagli said.
The expanded interest in higher-end chocolate may seem surprising if consumers balked at paying more for a Snickers bar or a pack of Reese's Peanut Butter Cups. But the companies behind super-premium lines like Ferrero Rocher, Justin's and Lindt Excellence were less aggressive about instituting cocoa-related price increases since their products already were more expensive, Costagli said.
As mainstream chocolate makers like Hershey and Mars raised prices, some customers decided they'd just spend a little more, he said.
“It's given the aspirational shopper that little push they need to trade up. If they wanted a better product, if they wanted better experience, better product characteristics, organic, fair trade, whatever it might be,” Costagli said.
On the flip side, value brands — think Whitman's or some store-brand chocolates — also sold more products in the U.S. last year as price-conscious shoppers traded down from mainstream brands.
“The savings you get by trading down is actually greater than it used to be,” Costagli said. “So from an aspirational perspective, it’s easier to trade up, and from a financially insecure perspective, it saves you more to trade down.”

MOSCOW, February 13. /TASS/. The acquired toughness of the monetary policy creates required conditions for inflation returning to target of 4%, Governor of the Bank of Russia Elvira Nabiullina said at a press conference after the Board meeting.
"The built-up toughness of the monetary policy creates necessary conditions for inflation to return to the target level of 4%," she said.
The peak of inflation was in December 2024 and in January 2026, Nabiullina noted.
"The inflation pressure peak was indeed in January, from our point of view. When speaking about stable inflation, we believe the peak was in December 2024. Concerning the peak of inflation expectations, we will keep an eye on it attentively," she added.

UN creates first global AI safety panel as tech insiders sound alarm over the technology

Antonio Guterres, the UN's secretary-general, said the panel is a 'foundational step toward global scientific understanding of AI.'
The UN appointed a 40-member global scientific panel this week that will study the risks of artificial intelligence (AI), despite strong opposition from the United States. The move comes as former employees at AI companies sounded the alarm about the technology.
The UN's General Assembly voted 117-2 to approve the panel, with the United States and Paraguay voting no, and abstentions from Tunisia and Ukraine. Russia, China and European allies voted in favour.
The experts on the Independent International Scientific Panel on Artificial Intelligence (AI) will publish an annual report that synthesises and analyses AI's risks, opportunities and impacts in what the UN calls the "first global scientific body of its kind."
The panel's adoption is a "foundational step toward global scientific understanding of AI," said Antonio Guterres, the UN's secretary-general.
“In a world where AI is racing ahead,” Guterres said, “this panel will provide what’s been missing — rigorous, independent scientific insight that enables all member states, regardless of their technological capacity, to engage on an equal footing.”
The UN vote comes as employees walk out of artificial intelligence companies due to concerns over their practices.
Mrinank Sharma, Anthropic's former safety researcher, warned in an open letter that "the world is in peril," with the development of AI and other crises.
While OpenAI's former top researcher, Zoe Hitzig, told the New York Times that she has "deep reservations" about the strategy that her former company is taking.
Some of the world's most prominent figures in AI, such as Dario Amodei, the CEO of Anthropic, OpenAI’s Sam Altman and Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak, have also warned about the risks of AI.
'A significant overreach of the UN's mandate'
The UN's 40 members were selected from more than 2,600 candidates after an independent review by several UN bodies and the International Telecommunications Union, according to Guterres. They will serve for three-year terms.
Europe has 12 seats at the table: Joelle Barral of France, Melahat Bilge Demirkoz from Turkey, Finland's Anna Korhonen, Mark Coeckelbergh from Belgium, Latvia's Aleksandra Korolova, Russia's Andrei Neznamov, Germany's Maximilian Nickel and Bernhard Scholkopf, Spain's Roman Orus, Austria's Johanna Pirker, Poland's Piotr Sankowski and Silvio Savarese from Italy.
Lauren Lovelace, the US' representative, called the panel “a significant overreach of the UN's mandate and competence” and said “AI governance is not a matter for the UN to dictate.”
Instead, Lovelace asked the UN to focus on its "core missions," such as international peace and security, human rights and humanitarian assistance, instead of "attempting to regulate or stifle the development of cross-cutting ... technologies that will determine economic and strategic competition in the twenty-first century."
US President Donald Trump has pushed for minimal AI regulation, where he aims to cut federal red tape and avoid a "patchwork" of state laws that could slow innovation. The US and China are considered neck-in-neck in the AI adoption race.
Despite the US' opposition, they still have two representatives on the panel: Vipin Kumar, a University of Minnesota professor and Martha Palmer, a retired University of Colorado professor and linguistics expert.

Trump’s push for Greenland reveals a political weak spot, new AP-NORC poll finds
WASHINGTON (AP) — Republicans may be willing to stick with President Donald Trump through almost anything, but his recent push to seize control of Greenland has turned off many in his own party, according to a new AP-NORC poll.
The survey from The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research finds that about 7 in 10 U.S. adults disapprove of how Trump is handling the issue of Greenland, a semiautonomous territory of NATO ally Denmark. That’s higher than the share who dislike how he’s handling foreign policy generally, suggesting that Trump’s Greenland approach has created a weak spot for the administration. About 24% of American adults approve of Trump’s Greenland approach.
Even Republicans aren’t thrilled. About half disapprove of his attempt to turn the icebound landmass into American territory, something that Trump has insisted is critical for national security in the Arctic, while about half approve.
The poll was conducted Feb. 5-8, which is after Trump had made the decision to scrap tariffs designed to pressure European countries into supporting U.S. control of Greenland, but after his weekslong push for American intervention over the island.
About half of Republicans disapprove of Trump on Greenland
Trump’s base is normally unwavering behind him, so Greenland stands out as an exception.
The marks represent Trump’s lowest ratings among Republicans on a list of key issues in the poll, including the economy and immigration — where about 8 in 10 approve — and foreign policy generally. About 7 in 10 Republicans approve of his overall foreign policy approach.
Trump has argued that the U.S. needs Greenland to counter threats from Russia and China in the Arctic region, despite America already having a military presence there.
Other recent polls, including a Pew Research Center survey conducted in January, found that Republicans were largely divided on whether the U.S. should take over Greenland, while Americans overall were opposed.
Ayman Amir, a 46-year-old Trump supporter from Houston, Texas, said he agrees that Greenland holds strategic importance for the United States’ military. But that doesn’t mean he thinks Trump should claim it.
“We can’t take it by force. We don’t have a right to do that,” Amir said. “You can’t blame Russia for what they do in Ukraine and then do the same thing. You can’t do this.”
Trump’s overall foreign policy approval remains steady
The president dropped his threats to seize the territory by force late last month after saying a framework for a deal over access to Greenland was reached with help from NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte.
The clash represents just one of the moves Trump has made to strain relationships with key allies over the last year. Western leaders are focusing on trans-Atlantic tensions this week at the Munich Security Conference.
On Greenland, Trump has few vocal supporters at home or abroad.
Even as Trump made significant moves to obtain control of Greenland, his overall approval on the issue of foreign policy has remained steady. About 4 in 10 U.S. adults approve of Trump’s approach to foreign policy, a measure that’s been unchanged in recent months.
Young Republicans especially disapprove of Greenland approach
Younger Republicans are especially likely to disapprove of how Trump is handling the situation.
About 6 in 10 Republicans under 45 say they disapprove of his leadership on Greenland, compared to about 4 in 10 older Republicans.
That 4 in 10 who approve of Trump’s Greenland actions is much lower than young Republicans’ approval on issues of foreign policy, the economy, or immigration.
Independent voter Aaron Gunnoe, 29, an engineer from Marion, Ohio, was baffled by Trump’s aggressive posture on the NATO ally.
“It’s the stupidest thing I’ve ever heard,” he said. “It’s owned by somebody else. That should be the end of it.”

The AP-NORC poll of 1,156 adults was conducted Feb. 5-8 using a sample drawn from NORC’s probability-based AmeriSpeak Panel, which is designed to be representative of the U.S. population. The margin of sampling error for adults overall is plus or minus 3.9 percentage points. The margin of sampling error for Republicans overall is plus or minus 6.1 percentage points.

Ukraine expects new IMF program to be approved 'in coming weeks'
Government Commissioner for Public Debt Management Yuriy Butsa said this in an interview with Reuters, Ukrinform reports.
Butsa believes that formal IMF Board sign-off on the money should come very soon.
"I would expect it in a matter of weeks. I think February is still doable in terms of a timeline," he said.
According to the government commissioner, all the numbers have already been agreed upon.
"We already agreed on all the numbers for this and next year and will cover it (budget deficit) from existing commitments," he said.
Commenting on talks about a potential U.S.-brokered ceasefire ahead of the anniversary of Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine, Butsa noted that even after a ceasefire, Ukraine would need to maintain a large and strong army and continue rearmament, meaning that financial pressure would not ease.
He added that Ukraine was unlikely to rush to issue more international market debt whenever the war does end. Instead it will keep using cheap concessional lending and borrow in local currency debt markets where it doesn't face currency.
On November 26, 2025, the IMF and the Ukrainian authorities reached a staff-level agreement on a new four-year Extended Fund Facility (EFF) with potential access of up to $8.2 billion.
The IMF said the launch of the new program for Ukraine depends on the country meeting prior actions and securing financing assurances. These prior actions include, among other things, adopting the 2026 state budget, broadening the tax base to include revenues from online operations, closing customs loopholes for consumer goods imports, and abolishing VAT registration exemptions.
IMF Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva said during a visit to Kyiv on January 15 that the issue of introducing VAT for sole proprietors in Ukraine must be resolved.
On February 13, Ukrainian Prime Minister Yulia Svyrydenko said that the Cabinet of Ministers would not submit a bill to parliament this month on registering sole proprietors as VAT payers.

How two extremists planned ‘mass murder’ of Jewish community in Manchester
- Walid Saadaoui and Amar Hussein have been handed life sentences for plotting a mass shooting targeting an antisemitism march and a Jewish community in Manchester.
- Saadaoui had planned to smuggle four AK-47 rifles, two pistols, and 900 rounds of ammunition into the UK for the attack.
- The plot, driven by extremist ideology and admiration for ISIS, was foiled after Saadaoui shared his plans with an undercover operative.
- Saadaoui was arrested in May 2024 while attempting to take possession of assault rifles and ammunition.
- Prosecutors stated that had the terrorists succeeded, it would have resulted in mass murder and been one of the deadliest attacks on Jewish communities in the UK.

A new round of US-brokered talks between Russia and Ukraine is set for Geneva next week
Envoys from Russia and Ukraine are to meet for a new round of U.S.-brokered talks in Geneva next week as both sides keep fighting and trading long-range strikes
- Bookmark
Another round of U.S.-brokered talks between envoys from Russia and Ukraine will take place next week in Geneva, days ahead of the fourth anniversary of the all-out Russian invasion of its neighbor, officials in Moscow and Kyiv said on Friday.
The meeting will be held on Tuesday and Wednesday, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said in a statement carried by Russian news agencies.
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy’s communications adviser, Dmytro Lytvyn, confirmed the new round of negotiations.
The talks take place against a backdrop of continued fighting along the roughly 1,250-kilometer (750-mile) front line, relentless Russian bombardment of civilian areas of Ukraine and the country’s power grid, and Kyiv’s almost daily long-range drone attacks on war-related assets on Russian soil.
Previous U.S.-led efforts to find consensus on ending the war, most recently two rounds of talks in Abu Dhabi, the capital of the United Arab Emirates, have failed to resolve difficult issues, such as the future of Ukraine’s Donbas industrial heartland that is largely occupied by Russian forces.
Zelenskyy said last week that the United States has given Ukraine and Russia a June deadline to reach a deal. Previous deadlines given by U.S. President Donald Trump have passed largely without consequence.
Zelenskyy in Munich
Zelenskyy was in Munich, Germany, on Friday and visited the first joint Ukrainian-German company for the production of drones. Germany has been a major backer of Ukraine in the war.
He was also due to hold bilateral and multilateral meetings at the Munich Security Conference, an annual gathering of top international security figures.
Russia’s bigger army has managed to capture about 20% of Ukraine since hostilities began in 2014 and its full-scale invasion of Feb. 24 2022. Its battlefield progress has been slow and costly in terms of troops and armor.
NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte said that “the Russians are not winning (the war) as some are thinking.”
“This so-called Russian bear is not there,” he told reporters. “It is basically still the speed of a garden snail, what we are seeing in Ukraine — this is how the Russians are moving inside Ukraine, very slow, staggering losses.”
Finding compromises is hard
The negotiators heading to Geneva have the tough task of finding compromises that are palatable to both Moscow and Kyiv.
Russian President Vladimir Putin’s adviser Vladimir Medinsky, who headed Moscow’s team of negotiators in the first direct peace talks with Ukraine in Istanbul in March 2022, is returning to lead Moscow’s delegation.
The previous two rounds of trilateral talks in Abu Dhabi reportedly focused on military issues, such as a possible buffer zone and ceasefire monitoring. The return of Medinsky, who has pushed Russian President Vladimir Putin’s maximalist conditions for peace, could mark a shift toward political issues in the next round of talks.
Ukraine’s delegation will again be led by Rustem Umerov, Ukraine’s National Security and Defense Council chief.
It was not clear which American officials would be in Geneva. In the UAE capital, the Trump administration was represented by envoys Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner.
War of attrition
The grim war of attrition is continuing while the two sides negotiate.
Overnight from Thursday to Friday, a Russian strike killed three brothers between 8 and 19 years of age in eastern Ukraine, authorities said. Their mother and grandmother survived but sustained multiple injuries, the Donetsk regional prosecutor’s office said.
In Odesa, one person was killed and six more injured in a Russian strike at the city’s port and energy infrastructure, officials said.
The Russian Defense Ministry said on Friday its air defenses shot down 58 Ukrainian drones over several Russian regions and annexed Crimea during the night.
Of those, 43 were brought down in the Volgograd region of southwestern Russia, where three people, including a 12-year-old boy, were injured by drone debris, according to the local governor. Ukraine has recently targeted the Volgograd oil refinery.

France’s ‘French Response’ uses memes and sarcasm to fight disinformation on X

Through posts combining provocation, humour and irony, the "French Response" account has taken potshots at trolls, but also top-level politicians. It is part of a wider strategy led by Paris to combat disinformation, ministry told Euronews.
France's Ministry of Foreign Affairs has ramped up its fight against disinformation with "French Response", an official X account which replies to trolls and fake news with humour, irony and provocation.
The account has amassed more than 180,000 followers since its creation in September, taking aim at disinformation peddled by pro-Russian users and US accounts. Meanwhile, White House-aligned accounts have increasingly targeted France on X in recent months.
According to ministry spokesman Pascal Confavreux, France has decided to shake up its strategy to actively combat disinformation.
"The intuition was that you can't win the information war if you don't fight the battle. So we had to raise our voice," Confavreux told Euronews.
"We have changed our stance, with a rapid reaction to foreign informational attacks against us, so that we can re-establish a form of dissuasion, in other words by exposing the ridiculous, the big tricks or the big lies", he said.
"We're using the codes of social networking with a virality that will enable us to increase our audience and reach precisely those who hear only manipulated information."
The account combines sarcasm and meme language in its responses to what it identifies as trolls and disinformation. The ministry reported that the account generates approximately 15 million impressions weekly.
The account's first post responded to US Secretary of State Marco Rubio's claim that Hamas withdrew from hostage negotiations immediately after France announced plans to recognise a Palestinian state.
French Response posted a timeline showing Israeli officials had reported the collapse of talks before President Emmanuel Macron's announcement.
The account has also defended the EU's investigations into X, responding to claims that the probes constitute "censorship" of freedom of expression.
"Judicial scrutiny should be a welcome spotlight, not something to run from," the account stated in a February post that garnered more than 1 million views.
"European interests are often the target of misinformation. The Digital Services Act, a European regulation which aims to make digital platforms more accountable, is also frequently targeted by disinformation," Confavreux explained.
Asked about the risk of legitimising the techniques used by trolls by using them for diplomatic purposes, he said: "We will respond to trolls, but we are not trolls ourselves."
In another recent public spat, French Response took aim at a pro-Russian account named "Loetitia" sharing a viral video featuring doctored email exchanges that implicated Macron in the latest tranche of the Epstein files.
As part of the campaign, a false article sharing the same allegations was also posted on a website impersonating the fringe French outlet France-Soir.
In a tongue-in-cheek post, French Response moderators responded to the X video.
"It turns out that Loetitia holds global secrets. It turns out that AI puts them into images. It turns out that the France Soir article does not exist. It turns out that Russian networks are amplifying it directly," their reply said.
France's diplomatic communications shift has not been restricted to its French Response account.
In May 2025, the Élysée's official X account responded to a pro-Russian disinformation campaign which alleged that French President Emmanuel Macron, German Chancellor Friedrich Merz and British Prime Minister Keir Starmer were caught taking cocaine on their trip to Kyiv.
The Élysée shared a meme mocking allegations that the leaders had a bag of cocaine and a snuff spoon on their meeting table — stating that "misinformation" was being used to "pass off a simple tissue as drugs."
Experts warn about 'trolling tactics'
Ruslan Trad, an expert in global security at the Digital Forensic Research Lab, warned: "When official diplomatic channels adopt trolling tactics, they implicitly validate the information ecosystem's descent into provocation-based discourse".
He added that matching adversaries' tone risks "creating equivalence in audiences' minds between democratic institutions and disinformation actors."
It is unclear whether the account could reach the most vulnerable segments of the population, particularly given the rising distrust of institutions in France and across the continent.
A 2025 study by the Fondation Jean-Jaurès, Cevipof and the Institut Montaigne found that distrust of institutions and politicians alike has increased over the past year. Separately, 62% of French people believe they should "be wary of what the media say about the major issues of the day," according to a 2025 survey.
"What counts is not so much the number of followers that 'French Response' accumulates, but the number of engagements," Confavreux retorted. "These posts need to be seen, particularly by those who are the target of these manipulations."

MUNICH, February 13. /TASS/. German Defense Minister Boris Pistorius has said that Russia's Northern Fleet is very strong.
"The Russian Northern Fleet is highly active in the Arctic with nuclear-powered submarines and its fleet," the minister warned. "We are talking about a very, very strong military maritime power there." "These are very, very powerful naval forces we're talking about," Pistorius told reporters on the sidelines of the Munich Security Conference, raising the topic of Germany's participation in NATO's Arctic Sentry mission.
The Northern Fleet is an operational-strategic formation of the Russian Navy. Its missions include "implementation of measures to protect the integrity and inviolability of the territory of Russia" and maintaining naval strategic nuclear forces in constant readiness in the interests of nuclear deterrence. The fleet’s flagship is the heavy nuclear-powered missile cruiser The Pyotr Veliky. The Russian Northern Fleet consists of more than 40 submarines and over 40 surface ships and boats.

Temple Mount’s delicate balance tested as Jewish prayer, Ramadan crowds meet

The Temple Mount: The very words evoke strong feelings among diverse peoples. Let us explore other aspects of what makes this site arguably “the center of the world.”
For Jews, the Temple Mount is the site of the First and Second Temples – the center of ancient worship and the heart of Jewish memory. Yet the rhythms of modern life on the Mount are shaped in large part by the Muslim calendar, especially Ramadan, which brings tens of thousands of worshipers to al-Haram al-Sharif.
During this month-long daytime fast, the esplanade is crowded, especially in the final 10 nights, and security is heightened to protect and control tens of thousands of worshipers – and the Jews who brave the ascent, as well as those praying at the Western Wall below.
For Jewish visitors, Ramadan is not just an observation of Muslim practice – it is a period when access and visibility on the Mount are constrained, and when the smallest gestures of prayer can carry heightened significance. Whispering a “Shema” prayer, prostrating quietly, or holding and learning from a Torah page becomes a deliberate act of devotion against the backdrop of centuries of exclusion.
Historically, Jewish access to the Mount has been limited, and tensions have flared during Ramadan when overlapping holidays or large crowds have complicated movement. Today, police allow controlled Jewish prayer in certain areas – a small but powerful reclaiming of presence during times when the site holy to two cultures is otherwise filled.
“There has never been a time in Jerusalem’s history with such religious tolerance for all believers like this period of Israeli rule,” said Rabbi Shmuel Rabinowitz, rabbi of the Western Wall and Holy Sites. “The hundreds of thousands of Muslims who ascend the Temple Mount uninterrupted daily, and even more so throughout the blessed days of Ramadan, can testify to this.”
For Jewish visitors, Ramadan underscores the fragility – and the value – of access. It is a reminder that while the Mount remains under Waqf administration, the right to ascend and pray, even quietly, is a hard-won achievement. Each visit, each whispered prayer, is part of a continuum that stretches from Solomon to today: a living connection to Jewish history at the site where history itself was and continues to be made.
Perspectives: The Temple Mount today – change in practice
For decades after 1967, the Temple Mount was defined by a simple rule: Jews could visit but not pray. Muslim worshipers claimed the esplanade; Israeli police enforced quiet access below. The arrangement was called the “status quo,” and for a long time it mostly worked – until recently.
Small but meaningful changes are quietly shifting that balance. Jewish visitors now regularly ascend the Mount, sometimes bringing prayer books, sometimes whispering under their breath. Police often allow these gestures, as long as they are discreet and brief. As mentioned in the main article, one visitor described prostrating for up to five minutes without interruption – an apparently small event but large in the grand spiritual scheme and historic for those who have long been excluded.
The Mount’s paradox is clear: Laws may or may not change, but practice does. Court rulings affirm the right to visit certain areas, while rabbinic authorities weigh ritual restrictions; police calibrate security, and visitors navigate the gray zone. The Mount is controlled, yet negotiable; sacred, yet monitored.
High-profile visits have a way of escalating attention. Politicians have ascended and walked the site – like former prime minister Ariel Sharon in 2000 when he was the leader of the opposition and, more recently, National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir, who has ascended several times, most recently on October 8, 2025, the day after the second anniversary of the Oct. 7 massacre.
Such visits, whether drawing scrutiny and criticism from some, or support and encouragement from others, remind everyone that such presence is both symbolic and significant, and IT can also be provocative. These visits are rare but potent reminders that the Mount is always more than a physical space; it is a living focal point of memory and sovereignty.

These visits are rare but potent reminders that the Mount is always more than a physical space; it is a living focal point of memory and sovereignty.
Debates continue behind the scenes, sometimes spilling out into the open. Some rabbis forbid ascent on halachic grounds; others advocate for broader Jewish presence. Activist groups press for expanded access, while police remain cautious, mindful of crowd dynamics and regional and cultural sensitivities.
On the Muslim side, fears of encroachment persist, shaping responses even to quiet, controlled visits, as mentioned in the main article. But why should Jews feel like they are encroaching on a place that is originally – and should now be at least equally – theirs?
The result is a holy, contentious site where tiny shifts carry enormous symbolic weight. Each allowed prayer, each permitted tour, is a visible crack in decades - or even centuries-old patterns.
For those who climb its steps, the experience is more than procedural – it is a living connection to centuries of prayer and Jewish history. On the Temple Mount, the “status quo” is never still; it moves and shifts – incrementally, carefully, and with immense meaning.

What happened to the Syrians detained and disappeared by Israel?

What happened to the dozens of Syrians detained and forcibly disappeared by Israeli forces?
In the weeks following Bashar al-Assad's fall on 8 December 2024, Israeli forces invaded areas of southwestern Syria beyond the Golan Heights, which they had occupied since 1967, seizing areas inside a UN-monitored demilitarised buffer zone and beyond.
Since then, families across the southern cities of Quneitra and Daraa and the town of Beit Jinn say Israeli forces have been detaining civilians during raids, incursions and patrols in border areas.
What began as scattered reports has now developed into a documented pattern, with lawyers and rights groups saying at least 43 Syrians remain held in Israeli detention, including at least one child.
Former detainees describe being blindfolded, interrogated and, in some cases, transferred into Israel itself. Others speak of months spent without charge, without access to lawyers, and without their families knowing where they were being held.
The arrests come amid Israel's continued illegal military presence inside southern Syria, which Israeli officials have framed as a "security zone" intended to prevent alleged threats near the Golan.
By March 2025 however, Defence Minister Israel Katz publicly stated that Israeli forces were prepared to remain in Syria for an "unlimited" period, reinforcing concerns that the detentions were unfolding within a deepening and open-ended military presence beyond the occupied Golan Heights.
How many Syrians are being held?
Ahmad al-Moussa, a lawyer who has been documenting the arrests, told The New Arab's affiliate Syria TV that the number of Syrian detainees had previously reached 50, although seven were released in recent weeks.
Four were freed shortly before a fact-finding visit by the UN Working Group on Enforced or Involuntary Disappearances to Quneitra last month, while three others were released ahead of the group's sessions in late January.
According to al-Moussa, 43 Syrians remain in detention, including four who were children at the time of their arrest, and one who is currently under 18.
Thirty-nine of those detentions took place after 8 December 2024, the day Israeli forces entered parts of southern Syria beyond the long-standing buffer zone.
Additional testimonies to The New Arab's sister site Al-Araby Al-Jadeed, as well as local monitoring, suggest the number of abductions may be higher.
Activists and local sources told Al-Araby Al-Jadeed last month that dozens of incidents have been recorded in villages in the Yarmouk Basin and areas near the separation line, with civilians seized during military incursions, from their workplaces, or while moving between towns.
Al-Moussa says he has compiled individual case files and submitted them to the UN Committee on Enforced Disappearances, while also contacting the Human Rights Council, the Independent International Commission of Inquiry on Syria and the International Committee of the Red Cross.
With the assistance of Israel-based rights groups, including HaMoked, lawyers were appointed to represent some detainees. Al-Moussa says that legal pressure contributed to the release of seven individuals so far, though dozens remain in custody.
He adds that sustained advocacy had led to a fact-finding visit to Quneitra in December, where officials met families of detainees, and the issue was discussed during a dedicated session at the UN Human Rights Council. Further clarification on detention locations and legal status is still being sought.
Detainees being transferred to notorious Sde Teiman facility
Testimony from a recently released detainee has intensified concerns that some of the detainees were transferred to facilities in Israel where horrific abuse of Palestinian detainees has taken place.
The man, cited by Syria TV, says he was held for more than two months and reported encountering around 50 Syrian detainees inside Sde Teiman prison near Beersheba in southern Israel, where Palestinian detainees have been subjected to rape, starvation, and torture by Israeli forces.
Other testimonies point to detainees being held in Ofer prison near Ramallah and in Nafha desert prison.
One case that drew attention is that of Shadi Zeina, a 17-year-old from the Damascus countryside town of Kanaker, who disappeared during an Israeli incursion on 29 July 2025.
His mother, Samar Dreiby, told Al-Araby Al-Jadeed that she had spent two months searching for him before learning through released Palestinian detainees that he was being held in Ofer prison in the occupied West Bank.
She had contacted the International Committee of the Red Cross and HaMoked before confirmation came that her son was in Israeli custody.
According to former detainees who met him, Shadi had not been formally charged and had not been visited by a lawyer.
The transfer of detainees from Syrian territory into Israel would raise serious legal issues. Under the Fourth Geneva Convention, protected persons in occupied territory must not be forcibly transferred to the territory of the occupying power.
Such transfers can constitute grave breaches of international humanitarian law and may carry individual criminal responsibility.
Legal experts say that detaining civilians without clear charges, denying information about their whereabouts, or refusing to acknowledge their detention could also amount to arbitrary detention or enforced disappearance under international human rights law, which continues to apply during military occupation.
What are former detainees saying about what happened to them?
One young man from Jbata al-Khashab described to Al-Araby Al-Jadeed being seized by a seven-member Israeli force along with three others.
Blindfolded and taken to what he believes was a military site inside Syria, he said he was questioned about his political views, his family, and whether he had any links to the Lebanese group Hezbollah or Iran.
A map was placed in front of him, and he was asked to identify homes and neighbourhoods before he was released seven hours later. The fate of the three others detained with him remains unknown.
Another Syrian man, who spent seven months in Israeli detention, described his experience as a "nightmare". He said he was first held at the Sde Teiman camp, where he spent around four months without formal charges or a court appearance.
He described harsh detention conditions and sustained physical and psychological abuse, including severe beatings, prolonged stress positions, painful restraints, solitary confinement, sleep deprivation and repeated interrogation sessions lasting up to six hours.
He was later transferred to Ofer prison, where questioning continued.
How many cases may qualify as disappeared?
Almoutassim Al-Kilani, founder of the rights group Min Haqqi, says his organisation has documented 41 cases of disappearance since 8 December 2024.
Families have no confirmed information about where many detainees are being held, with some believed to have been transferred to facilities inside Israel, based on testimony from released detainees.
Under international law, enforced disappearance occurs when a person is deprived of liberty by state agents and their fate or whereabouts are concealed or denied.
Al-Kilani says the combination of detention and a lack of information places individuals outside the protection of the law.
He notes that while UN mechanisms can request urgent clarification, they lack direct enforcement power.
He says the International Committee of the Red Cross can visit detainees and help families communicate with them confidentially, while the Committee on Enforced Disappearances can push authorities for answers, but neither has the power to force Israel to release the detainees immediately.
Meanwhile, the Palestinian Commission of Detainees and Ex-Detainees Affairs says it has attempted to organise visits for Syrian detainees and pursue legal interventions, but Israeli prison authorities have so far refused to grant permission.
The commission is preparing to petition Israel's Supreme Court in an effort to obtain access.
For many families in southern Syria, however, the legal process offers little immediate relief. Months after their relatives were seized, they remain without confirmed information, without visits, and without clarity about what charges, if any, have been brought against them.

Ukraine's battlefield lessons drive UK to spend over $545 million on hypersonic, long-range weapons in 2026
The U.K. plans to spend 400 million pounds ($545.4 million) on hypersonic and long-range weapons in 2026, drawing on lessons from Russia's war in Ukraine, the U.K. Defense Ministry announced on Feb. 13.
The announcement comes as the annual security conference opens in Munich, running on Feb. 13–15, with about 50 world leaders and government officials expected to attend, including President Volodymyr Zelensky.
"To meet this new era of rising threats, we need hard power, strong alliances, and sure diplomacy," U.K. Defense Secretary John Healey said.
"We can see from the war in Ukraine the decisive impact of long-range precision weapons, so the U.K. is stepping up, investing more than 400 million pounds ($545.4 million) in long-range and hypersonic weapons this year," Healey added.
The planned investments will also support joint weapons projects with France, Germany, and Italy, the statement said.
The Stratus program, a collaboration between the U.K., France, and Italy, is developing a next-generation stealth missile to replace the Storm Shadow. The new missile is designed to "defeat high-value targets, destroy enemy ships, and suppress enemy air defenses," the statement said.
Separately, a joint long-range weapons program between the U.K. and Germany is entering a study phase and will focus on future stealth and hypersonic capabilities.
"Alongside Germany, France and Italy, we will deliver the cutting-edge weapons that will keep the U.K. and NATO safe, boost deterrence, and build a new deal for European security," Healey said.
This year's investment in hypersonic weapons will also cover the development of key technologies, ground and flight testing, and support for academic training, including funding for postgraduate studies, according to the statement.
The U.K. Defense Ministry added that the new domestically produced Deep Precision Strike system, with a range of more than 2,000 kilometers (1,240 miles), is expected to enter service in the 2030s.
Earlier, the U.K. and other partners announced roughly $38 billion in aid to Ukraine following a Feb. 12 meeting of the Ukraine Defense Contact Group in the Ramstein format.
More than $2.5 billion will be allocated for Ukrainian drones, more than $500 million for the Prioritized Ukraine Requirements List (PURL) initiative, and $2 billion for air defense, according to Ukraine's Defense Minister Mykhailo Fedorov.
Ukraine has long urged its partners to boost support for air defense systems, as Russian strikes on its energy infrastructure have intensified over the past months.
The attacks have left Ukraine facing its most severe energy crisis since the start of the full-scale invasion.

Thousands of documents detail Jeffrey Epstein’s far-reaching ties across Europe

The monstrous tentacles of sex offender and multimillionaire Jeffrey Epstein did not discriminate. He sought power and tried to draw it from every sphere of life: politicians, academics, economists, hedge fund managers, artists, sports team owners and royalty. Although Epstein’s record — he was convicted in 2008 of soliciting a minor for prostitution — was well known, many chose to look the other way.
But the 3 million documents from the case released by the U.S. Justice Department in recent weeks expose another aspect: the sweeping geographic scope of the affair. Name after name, country after country, continent after continent. Figures of power who felt above the law and morality, who believed nothing would happen to them despite various ties to Epstein, including a frequent guest mentioned in thousands of documents, former Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak, who maintained business and social ties with Epstein even years after his conviction.
This is only an initial review of the documents, a task expected to take weeks more. For now, each new revelation widens the circle of alleged wrongdoing — those who knew and remained silent, those now finally facing consequences and, above all, public shame and ostracism. This report focuses solely on the European circles that intersected with Epstein, and there is more than enough material there.
Trouble in the kingdom
Only a rear-guard political battle by British Prime Minister Keir Starmer temporarily prevented his ouster this week, though it appears to be a brief reprieve before further challenges ahead. Some stem from the Epstein documents, which reveal the depth of ties between the financier and Peter Mandelson, whom Starmer appointed Britain’s ambassador to the United States in late 2024.
Those ties allegedly included financial grants to Mandelson and his partner and stays at Epstein’s apartment, whom Mandelson called "my best friend." The documents also suggest that while serving as a member of Parliament and Cabinet minister, Mandelson lobbied for Epstein’s interests and leaked secret and classified government documents related to Britain’s economic policy.
Mandelson’s connections to Epstein were public knowledge as early as 2019, the year Epstein died by suicide in a New York jail. But the new documents allege actions that approach outright betrayal and have led London police to open an investigation into Mandelson.
Starmer has also come under scrutiny for making the sensitive Washington appointment despite later acknowledging he knew Mandelson had continued his ties with Epstein after 2008 — a pivotal year in which the financier was first convicted and designated a sex offender. Mandelson, a leading figure in New Labour and a close Starmer adviser, was viewed as someone capable of building strong ties with President Donald Trump, particularly on trade and tariffs. Starmer survived an attempt to remove him after all Cabinet ministers, including rivals, expressed confidence in him and he pledged full transparency and referred the ambassadorial appointment to a parliamentary committee.
Mandelson, dismissed after just seven months as ambassador, could still face prison. But little surprises Britons anymore after Prince Andrew lost his royal titles and patronages in 2022 following a settlement with a woman who said she had sex with him when she was a minor and revelations about his ties to Epstein’s sex trafficking network. The new documents allege Andrew also shared confidential British government business documents with Epstein.
The Oslo failure
Relative to its population size, few countries appear to have had as many senior figures in politics, business and society linked to Epstein as Norway. His reach extended into its diplomatic corps, the prime minister’s office, the Foreign Ministry, the Nobel committee and even the royal household.
Mona Juul, 66, a former Norwegian ambassador to Israel, the United States and the United Nations, was suspended last week and later resigned as ambassador to Jordan and Iraq after her ties to Epstein were revealed. Newly released documents show that shortly before his death, Epstein drafted a will leaving $10 million to the two children she shares with her husband, Terje Rød-Larsen, who also held several diplomatic posts in the Middle East.
The couple had faced scrutiny before. In 2002, Juul was fined by Norwegian tax authorities for failing to report $100,000 she received in 1999 from the Peres Center for Peace for her involvement in the Oslo Accords. Her husband resigned in 2020 from the International Peace Institute after his ties to Epstein and funds he received from him were exposed. Norway’s Foreign Ministry said Rød-Larsen also demonstrated poor judgment in his dealings with Epstein. The country’s economic crimes unit has opened a corruption investigation into the couple and searched their apartment.
According to the documents, the couple in 2018 purchased an apartment in a trendy Oslo neighborhood at a price significantly below market value after pressure allegedly exerted by Epstein on the seller. "I am slowly tightening the noose around his neck," Epstein wrote in an email. The couple also visited Epstein’s private Caribbean island with their children. Testimony cited in the documents alleges that attractive young Eastern European women with limited qualifications were temporarily employed at the International Peace Institute.
Juul is not the only Norwegian public figure tied to the affair. Crown Princess Mette-Marit remained in contact with Epstein from 2011 and visited his estate in Florida. In one message she said she missed her “crazy friend,” and in another remarked that Paris was well suited for affairs while Scandinavia was a good place to find a wife. Last Friday, she apologized to everyone she had disappointed and described her association with him as entirely shameful.
Meanwhile, Norway’s economic crimes unit has opened an investigation into former Prime Minister Thorbjørn Jagland, who served as chairman of the Nobel Peace Prize committee. Authorities are examining whether he received gifts, travel expenses or loans from Epstein in connection with his role, and whether he facilitated contact between the financier and Russian President Vladimir Putin. Norway’s Foreign Ministry approved a police request to lift Jagland’s immunity, granted during his tenure as secretary-general of the Council of Europe. The council confirmed Epstein attended at least two events at Jagland’s official residence in Strasbourg.
Norwegian journalist Geir Jørgensen said it is a source of national embarrassment that the world is questioning why so many figures from a country known for promoting human rights and development assistance were deeply entangled with a convicted pedophile. At the same time, he said, there is a measure of reassurance in the fact that, unlike in the United States where little appeared to change after the revelations, the affair has become a major story in Norway. That, he added, reflects a functioning press, a culture of accountability and, above all, a sense of public shame among those involved.
Deutsche Bank acknowledged this week that Epstein managed more than 40 accounts at its branches. Johanna Rubinstein, a Swedish U.N. official, resigned after it emerged she visited Epstein’s Caribbean island in 2012. Miroslav Lajčák, Slovakia’s national security adviser, stepped down after emails surfaced in which he and Epstein discussed diplomacy and "beautiful girls." Latvia, Lithuania and Poland announced official investigations into links between their nationals and Epstein, as well as possible connections to Russian intelligence.
In a statement, Poland’s Foreign Ministry said Epstein cultivated relationships not only with those already in positions of power but also with individuals rising toward senior roles. The ministry said authorities plan to investigate whether he sought to influence elections or shape policy, and whether any public officials may have been susceptible to blackmail by the Kremlin.
The French connection
Epstein also extended his reach into France, where he owned a large apartment near the Arc de Triomphe. He followed local politics obsessively, and the names of Emmanuel Macron and Marine Le Pen appear hundreds of times in his documents. So does the name of former Culture Minister Jack Lang, who resigned as head of a major cultural institute, and his daughter Caroline, who stepped down from her role at an independent filmmakers’ association after documents revealed Epstein invested in her film projects, transferred $5 million to an account in her name in the Virgin Islands and mentioned her in his will. Lang said in an interview that mutual friend Woody Allen introduced them. Asked about Epstein’s crimes, he replied that he does not investigate the criminal past of people he meets.
Everyone knew. Many of those involved in the Epstein affair are highly educated individuals. No one could have missed his 2008 conviction, which resulted in a lenient 18-month sentence. The internet already existed, and even those using dial-up connections could read The Daily Beast’s 2010 investigation under the headline "The Pedophile Billionaire and His Sex Den."
Everyone knew and chose to ignore it, partying with vulnerable young women from Eastern Europe in an apartment in Paris, on the Caribbean island, in New York. Bill Gates and Noam Chomsky are among the names, alongside a long list of lawyers, Hollywood producers and hedge fund managers. Many did not need Epstein’s money, yet accepted gifts such as flights or Apple watches and exchanged suggestive emails describing women as commodities.
None of the European figures mentioned here reached the level of hypocrisy and moral blindness of Steve Bannon, a leading figure in the "Make America Great Again" movement who fashioned himself as an opponent of elites. In 2017, he offered Epstein public relations assistance and began preparing a documentary intended to rehabilitate his image. In documents released by Congress last year, Bannon told Epstein that they needed to oppose rapists who traffic in girls exploited by some of the world’s most powerful and wealthy men, adding that such acts are beyond redemption.

UK facing more rain and flood risks due to climate crisis, new study warns
Extra rainfall now falling on UK each winter due to global warming ‘would fill three million Olympic-sized swimming pools’
- Bookmark
- CommentsGo to comments
UK winters are becoming “significantly wetter” and dramatically increasing flood risks as rising greenhouse‑gas concentrations warm the atmosphere, a new study has warned.
Researchers found the UK’s winter rainfall is increasing by around 7 per cent for every degree of global or regional warming – a rate the authors say is happening far faster than most climate models predict.
They explained the trend is not driven by changes in weather patterns, but by a warmer atmosphere’s ability to hold more moisture and produce larger, more intense rainstorms.
The team at Newcastle University analysed UK winter rainfall records from 1901 to 2023 to determine whether the increase was caused by shifts in atmospheric circulation or by the thermodynamic effect of warming. They said the rainfall increase of 7 per cent per degree of warming “is consistent with the expected rate of moisture increase in a warmer atmosphere”.
Anthropogenic climate change – primarily from the burning of fossil fuels – is the dominant factor, they said.
The team also discovered that many leading global climate models significantly underestimate the scale of the change. On average, models project a 4 per cent rise in rainfall per degree of warming – well below the 7 per cent increase seen in real‑world observations.
Dr James Carruthers, lead author and researcher at Newcastle University’s School of Engineering, said the findings show the UK is already experiencing rainfall levels that models had not expected for another two decades.
“Climate change has already made our winters significantly wetter,” he said. “Since the 1980s, the UK has warmed by around 0.25C per decade, meaning we are now seeing almost 9 per cent more winter rainfall than we did then.
“This is really concerning, as seasonal rainfall is increasing at a much faster rate than global climate models have predicted. We’re already experiencing changes in UK winter rainfall that global climate models predict for the 2040s – we’re 20 years ahead.”
He noted that October 2023 to March 2024 was the wettest winter half‑year on record, with the current season close behind.
Professor Hayley Fowler, a co‑author of the study published in the journal Geophysical Research Letters, warned that the additional rainfall leaves the UK increasingly vulnerable to flooding.
“The extra water that falls every winter across the UK from fossil-fuel induced warming would fill three million Olympic-sized swimming pools,” she said.
“This predisposes the country to flooding as the ground is more generally saturated.
“This extra rainfall will continue to increase every year with additional global warming. We can only stop these increases in flooding by stopping the burning of fossil fuels.”
Prof Fowler added that with the UK facing more than 100 flood warnings this week, without major investment in adaptation, economic losses and casualties will continue to grow.
“There is a widening gap between growing climate risks and action on adaptation,” she said.
The findings build on earlier research showing that northern and central Europe are becoming significantly wetter in winter, while the Mediterranean is becoming drier – patterns that global climate models also underestimate in both speed and magnitude.
A Defra spokesperson told The Independent: "We recognise how important it is to prepare the country to adapt to climate change.
"That is why we are investing £10.5bn in our flood programme until 2036, protecting nearly 900,000 properties. This is alongside reprioritising over £100m to maintain existing flood assets."

MOSCOW, February 13. /TASS/. The negotiations on a Ukrainian settlement in Geneva will involve representatives of Russia, the United States and Ukraine, with no European participation, Kremlin Spokesman Dmitry Peskov told TASS.
"No, this will be a strictly trilateral format, so only Russia, the US and Ukraine. There will be no Europeans," he said when asked whether representatives of the European Union or international organizations might participate in any capacity.
The first round of trilateral security consultations involving Russia, Ukraine, and the United States was held on January 23-24 in Abu Dhabi. The Russian negotiating group was headed by Igor Kostyukov, head of the Main Intelligence Directorate of the General Staff. A second round was held there on February 4-5.

Men who plotted ‘mass murder’ of Jewish community in terror attack jailed for life
The men plotted to open fire on a march against antisemitism in what could have been ‘one of the deadliest attacks’ the UK has ever seen
- Bookmark
Two men who plotted a mass shooting that could have become “one of the deadliest attacks on Jewish communities” in the UK have been given life sentences.
Walid Saadaoui, 38, hatched a plan to smuggle four high-powered military-grade AK-47 rifles, two pistols and 900 rounds of ammunition into the UK and unleash what police chiefs said could have been Britain’s deadliest terrorist incident.
Alongside Amar Hussein, 52, he had intended to cause “untold harm” by opening fire on a march against antisemitism in Manchester city centre before moving to attack an area of the city occupied predominantly by the Jewish community.
The plot was foiled after Saadaoui, of Abram in Wigan, shared his deadly preparations online with a man he believed shared his ideology. Unbeknown to him, Saadaoui was actually in contact with an undercover operative – later identified in court proceedings as “Farouk” to protect his identity.
Saadaoui and Hussein, both of no fixed address, were jailed for life on Friday at Preston Crown Court, with minimum terms of 37 years and 26 years respectively.
Mr Justice Wall told the defendants that if their plot had succeeded, it would “likely have been one of the deadliest terror attacks ever carried out on British soil”.
He said: “I am sure this would have led to the deaths of many people and serious injuries to many, many more.
“Your plan envisaged you and two others discharging AK-47s into a large crowd of marchers, who were unarmed and defenceless; 120 bullets could have been discharged before any reloads were required. You planned to have spare magazines available.
“Your attack would have led to the deaths of people of all ages, including children.”
Prosecutors said Saadaoui had moved to the North West in 2022 and made several unsuccessful attempts to purchase guns online before he met Farouk. He was also found to have posted Isis propaganda on numerous Facebook accounts and encouraged others to take up weapons “in the name of the Islamic State”.
In his communications with the undercover officer, Saadaoui shared his admiration for Abdelhamid Abaaoud, the leader in the 2015 Paris attacks. He also told Farouk of his desire to attack Jewish people, and covertly joined a Jewish Facebook page to follow events.
He also recruited Hussein, a fellow Isis sympathiser, to conduct reconnaissance and monitor the arrival of the weapons.
The two would-be terrorists believed that Farouk could import automatic firearms from abroad, and welcomed him into their deadly fold. He infiltrated the group, learning that the pair embraced the ideology of Isis and intended to carry out attacks in response to alleged atrocities conducted by Israeli troops since October 2023.
Saadaoui told Farouk he could independently obtain a firearm via Sweden, and indicated that he was looking to bring guns from Eastern Europe. Separately he had bought an air weapon and had visited a shooting range.
Saadaoui and Hussein travelled to Dover, Kent, in March 2024 to conduct hostile reconnaissance on how a weapon could be smuggled through the port without detection. A safe house was also secured in Bolton for storage of the weapons, while both men returned to Dover two months later, where they believed they were watching the firearms coming into the country.
Farouk also learnt that Saadaoui had discussed his plans with his younger brother, 36-year-old Bilel Saadaoui.
Walid Saadaoui was arrested by counterterrorism police in May 2024 after attempting to take possession of two assault rifles, a semi-automatic pistol, and almost 200 rounds of ammunition.
Following a trial at Preston Crown Court, he and Hussein were convicted of making preparations to commit a large-scale terrorist attack, while Bilel Saadaoui, of Hindley in Wigan, was found guilty of failing to disclose information about the terror plan. He was sentenced to six years in jail with an extended licence period of 12 months.
Mr Justice Wall commended the bravery of undercover operator Farouk. He told the court: “His is a dangerous and difficult job. He undertook it with great skill and patience. He has potentially saved many lives by putting his own life on the line. I am not allowed to know his true identity, but I hope the remarks I make are passed on to him.”
Frank Ferguson, head of the Special Crime and Counter Terrorism division at the Crown Prosecution Service, said: “This was a deeply disturbing plot inspired by extremist ideology. Had these terrorists succeeded, it would have led to mass murder and been one of the deadliest attacks on Jewish communities in this country.
“The investigation and prosecution deployed a highly trained witness who made sure their plot did not succeed and secured valuable evidence directly from the mouths of the terrorists. This laid bare their intention to destroy lives, their long-held attitudes and beliefs as well as their Isis credentials. We worked closely with counterterrorism officers to ensure the strongest possible case was built from the outset and presented in court to the jury, resulting in these convictions.
“Terrorism is an attack on the very fabric of our society. We will always use the law to protect communities from harm and relentlessly hold offenders to account, making sure they face the toughest legal consequences for their actions.”

MOSCOW, February 13. /TASS/. Annual inflation in Russia is at present slightly lower than the interval forecast by the Bank of Russia, Central Bank chief Elvira Nabiullina said at a press conference after the Board meeting.
"Annual inflation is at the level of 6.3% now. It is slightly lower than our forecast interval of 6.5-7%, the one we expected as of the start of this year," Nabiullina said. "Accordingly, inflation dynamics at large is evolving within the framework of this scenario, we merely came to the current point not smoothly but throw slowdown in November - December and subsequent acceleration in January," she added.
An increase in certain indicators of stable inflation can be seen in full month data for January, Nabiullina noted. "Why? Because the estimation of such stable inflation indicators does not anticipate exclusion of the effect from VAT rate increase. That is why their growth cannot be interpreted as an upward turn of stable inflation," she added.

SARAJEVO
Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic said Friday that Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan is “a great world leader” and described Türkiye as one of Belgrade’s most important partners following what he called highly productive talks in Ankara.
“Erdogan is a great world leader, Türkiye is one of our most important partners. We had exceptionally productive talks on all issues. Infinite thanks for the exceptional hospitality to President Erdogan, we look forward to welcoming you in Serbia,” Vucic wrote on the US social media platform X after concluding a one-day visit to Türkiye late Thursday.
During his stay in Ankara, Vucic held a bilateral meeting with Erdogan at the Presidential Palace and stressed that Serbia recognizes Türkiye’s political and economic importance, describing it as one of the country’s most significant partners.
Vucic thanked Erdogan for what he called exceptional hospitality and expressed hope that the Turkish president would visit Serbia within the next three to four months, when several important documents could be signed.
During the visit, Erdogan highlighted Türkiye’s efforts to promote regional ownership-based initiatives, citing the second meeting of the Balkan Peace Platform hosted in Istanbul on Jan. 23, 2026, and thanked Vucic for his personal support for the platform.
Erdogan described Vucic’s visit as highly valuable for advancing peace, stability, and prosperity in the region.
“God willing, we will also pay a visit to Belgrade and Novi Pazar in May or June with a large delegation,” he said.
Following their meeting, Erdogan hosted a dinner in honor of Vucic.
Members of the Serbian delegation included Foreign Minister Marko Djuric, Defense Minister Bratislav Gasic, Economy Minister Adrijana Mesarovic, Assistant Defense Minister Nenad Radomirovic, and the minister without portfolio in charge of reconciliation, regional cooperation and social stability, Usame Zukorlic.

Ukrainian company TAF Industries and German Wingcopter have signed a memorandum to establish a joint venture for the production of drones.
The document was signed during the 62nd Munich Security Conference in the presence of representatives of the Ukrainian and German governments.
The joint venture will be located in Germany.
“This will diversify the Ukrainian defense sector and reduce industrial risks, strengthen the resilience of Ukraine’s defense sector, and, most importantly, enable the continuous supply of necessary equipment to the Ukrainian Armed Forces,” TAF Industries said.
The partnership was formed as part of the Build with Ukraine program.
As part of the joint venture, TAF Industries will provide licensed designs and experience in UAV production.
For its part, Wingcopter will provide industrial infrastructure, manufacturing expertise, and engineering capabilities in Germany.
This collaboration expands German manufacturer Wingcopter’s activities in the security and defense sector through the newly created Wingcopter Security & Defense division.
In addition to existing systems, the partners plan to jointly localize UAV production for the European market and NATO countries.
“This joint venture combines our battle-tested innovations with Germany’s industrial power, transforming operational experience into scalable production,” said Vladimir Zinovsky, CEO of TAF Industries.
Wingcopter is a German company engaged in the development, production, sale, and operation of fully electric unmanned aerial vehicles.
The company’s flagship product is the Wingcopter 198 drone, which, thanks to its patented swivel rotor mechanism and proprietary software algorithms, provides a smooth transition between two flight modes.
It can take off and land vertically like a multicopter, as well as fly long distances as efficiently and quickly as a fixed-wing aircraft.
Ukrainian company TAF Industries, in turn, manufactures more than 30 types of defense products, most of which are certified by the Ukrainian Ministry of Defence.
The range includes FPV drones and reconnaissance UAVs, electronic warfare systems, remote control solutions, and artificial intelligence-based combat technologies.
“The production of FPV drones is up to 80,000 units per month,” the company said.
Last year, TAF Industries updated the Babka drone and the Kolibri family of strike FPVs, focusing on mass production and low cost.

Boots launches first high street service for weight loss jabs
The pharmacy chain has launched the service as a trial initially across 17 stores nationwide.
- Bookmark
Boots is offering customers an in-store service for weight loss drugs that will allow people to pop in and buy jabs in their lunch breaks.
The pharmacy chain has launched the service as a trial initially across 17 stores nationwide, including in London, Manchester and Edinburgh, offering treatments such as Mounjaro and Wegovy on the high street for the first time.
Customers will be offered an in-person consultation with a pharmacist in a private consultation room, where their health and medical history will be assessed to see if they are eligible for treatment.
Weight loss medication has until now been largely only available through online prescriptions.
GPs in England are also allowed to prescribe Mounjaro on the NHS, but only to severely obese people who also suffer from a range of other health problems.
Estimates suggest more than 1.5 million people in the UK are already taking weight loss drugs, which may have been prescribed through specialist weight loss services or via private prescription.
Jamie Kerruish, chief healthcare officer at Boots, said: “We know that people have different preferences for how they access healthcare services – some seeking online support and some wanting in person conversations with their local practitioner.
“The launch of our in-store weight loss treatment service alongside our digital offer delivered through Boots Online Doctor means we can now deliver convenient care to people both online or in person.”
He added: “Our weight loss treatment services are for anyone whose lives are affected by obesity.
“For people who are overweight or living with obesity, it can be hard to lose weight through diet and exercise alone.
“Weight loss treatment combined with 360 support to make lifestyle and behavioural changes, can be a powerful tool in helping people manage their weight and at Boots we are here for every step of our customers’ weight loss journeys.”
Boots has already been selling Mounjaro, made by Eli Lilly, and Novo Nordisk’s treatment Wegovy through its Boots Online Doctor service.
Customers can book in-store appointments for the service online or on a walk-in basis at stores taking part in the pilot.
Here is a list of Boots stores offering the weight loss drug service:
– Nottingham, Victoria Centre, Nottinghamshire– Cardiff, Queen Street, Wales– Durham, Market Place, County Durham– Belfast, Donegal Place, Northern Ireland– Edinburgh, Princes Street, Scotland– Newcastle, Sidgate, Tyne and Wear– St Albans, St Peters Street, Hertfordshire– London, Liverpool Steet Station– Leicester, Fosse Park, Leicestershire– Brighton, North Street, East Sussex– London, Piccadilly Circus– Dartford, Blue Water, Kent– Altrincham, Stamford Quarter, Trafford, Greater Manchester– Chester-Le-Street, County Durham– Middlesborough, Nunthorpe, North Yorkshire– Bath, Southgate Centre, Somerset– Lisburn, Sprucefield, Northern Ireland

Trump expected to attend Saudi FII conference in Miami
US President Donald Trump is expected to attend Saudi Arabia's Future Investment Initiative conference in Miami, marking his second consecutive appearance at the event since returning to the White House, people familiar with the matter said.
Trump is expected to attend a dinner on the first day hosted by Yasir Al-Rumayyan, governor of Saudi Arabian sovereign wealth fund PIF, two people said, asking not to be identified as they were not authorised to speak publicly. The event takes place from 26-29 March.
The FII Institute, the Saudi government and the White House did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
Trump's engagement with the FII platform underscores the importance his administration places on Gulf economic partnerships.
Saudi Arabia and the US finalised a series of investment and defense agreements during the crown prince's meeting with Trump in November, with Riyadh boosting its commitment to invest in the United States to $1 trillion - expanding significantly from the $600 billion in deals outlined during Trump's visit to the kingdom in May.
Saudi Arabia's Vision 2030 pivots to private sector
The potential high-profile attendance comes as Saudi Arabia recalibrates its ambitious Vision 2030 economic transformation program amid a shortage of funding for mega-projects that were part of the kingdom's wider diversification efforts.
Saudi officials have increasingly pivoted toward securing buy-in and collaboration from the private sector after initial plans relied heavily on government funding.
The FII Miami event would provide a platform for Saudi Arabia to court North and South American business leaders and investors at a time when the kingdom is repositioning its economic agenda.
The gathering also takes place against a backdrop of deepening rivalry between Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, traditionally close Gulf allies, who have increasingly found themselves at odds over regional economic competition and strategic priorities.
The two nations have been vying for position as the Middle East's premier business and financial hub, with the UAE's rapid rise in sectors from finance to technology creating friction with Saudi Arabia's own ambitions under Vision 2030.
FII competes with Abu Dhabi's Milken Institute Global Conference, which takes place in Los Angeles in May. The main FII conference, usually held each fall in Riyadh and dubbed "Davos in the Desert," has become a flagship event for Saudi Arabia to showcase its economic vision and attract global investment.
The organisation has expanded beyond Riyadh to host events in other major cities.

What to know about the Homeland Security shutdown starting this weekend
Another shutdown for parts of the federal government is expected this weekend
- Bookmark
Another shutdown for parts of the federal government is expected this weekend as lawmakers debate new restrictions on President Donald Trump's immigration enforcement agenda.
Funding for the Department of Homeland Security is set to expire Saturday. Democrats say they won't help approve more funding until new restrictions are placed on federal immigration operations after the fatal shooting of Alex Pretti and Renee Good in Minneapolis last month.
The White House has been negotiating with the Democrats, but the two sides failed to reach a deal by the end of the week, guaranteeing that funding for the department will lapse.
Unlike the record 43-day shutdown last fall, the closures will be narrowly confined, as only agencies under the DHS umbrella — like Immigration and Customs Enforcement and Customs and Border Protection — will be affected. Still, depending on how long the shutdown lasts, some federal workers could begin to miss paychecks.
Services like airport screening could also suffer if the shutdown drags on for weeks.
At the Transportation Security Administration, about 95% of employees are deemed essential. They will continue to scan passengers and their bags at the nation’s commercial airports. But they will work without pay until the funding lapse is resolved, raising the possibility that workers will being calling out or taking unscheduled leave. Many TSA workers already faced financial stress last year.
“Some are just now recovering from the financial impact of the 43-day shutdown” said Ha Nguyen McNeill, a senior official performing the duties of TSA administrator. “Many are still reeling from it.”
Why is a Homeland Security shutdown happening?
Essentially, it's because Trump acquiesced to Democrats' request that Homeland Security funding be stripped from a broader spending package to allow more time for negotiation over demands for changes to immigration enforcement, like a code of conduct for federal agents and a requirement that officers show identification. Homeland Security was temporarily funded only through Feb. 13.
The rest of the federal government is funded through Sept. 30. That means most federal programs are unaffected by the latest shutdown, including food assistance, and pay for most federal workers and for service members will continue uninterrupted.
What agencies are impacted?
The funding lapse affects the Department of Homeland Security and its constellation of agencies, including U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, U.S. Customs and Border Protection, the Secret Service and the Federal Emergency Management Agency.
The vast majority of employees at the Secret Service and U.S. Coast Guard will continue their work, though they could also miss a paycheck depending upon the shutdown's length.
At the Federal Emergency Management Agency, the shutdown will disrupt the agency's ability to reimburse states for disaster relief costs. Some workers will be furloughed, limiting the agency's ability to coordinate with state and local partners, and training for first responders at the National Disaster and Emergency Management University in Maryland will be disrupted.
Republicans have pointed out that the work of ICE and CBP will mostly continue unabated during a shutdown, despite Democratic demands for changes at those agencies.
That's because Trump's tax and spending cut bill passed by Republicans last year provided ICE with about $75 billion and CBP with about $65 billion, money those agencies can continue to tap for Trump's deportation operations.
What is the impact on workers?
It’s up to each federal agency to designate which of its employees are “essential” or “excepted,” both of which mean the same thing in this case. They keep working during a shutdown, typically without getting paid until government funding is back in place.
Some examples of “essential” employees are military personnel, security screeners at airports and law enforcement officers. There can be a wide range, from positions deemed critical for public safety to those authorized by law to continue even without new funding.
Most of the more than 270,000 people employed by Homeland Security are deemed essential, meaning that they stay on the job even during a shutdown. For the fall 2025 shutdown, more than 258,000 DHS employees were in that category, and about 22,000 — or 5% of the agency's total employee base — were furloughed.
Lawmakers have been particularly concerned about the potential impact on the TSA and airports.
Senate Republican Leader John Thune has warned that “there’s a very good chance we could see more travel problems” similar to last year's shutdown. As staffing shortages grow, airports may reduce the number of open security lanes or close checkpoints altogether to relieve pressure on an already strained workforce.
During last year’s lapse in funding, unpaid TSA workers increasingly called in sick or stayed home as missed paychecks made it harder for workers to cover basic expenses. The strain was visible on the ground: About a month into the shutdown, TSA closed two checkpoints at Philadelphia International Airport.
“The longer the shutdown goes on, the more severe the impact on our TSA workforce,” the agency said at the time.

MOSCOW, February 13. /TASS/. Russian electricity exports tumbled 12.8% to 7.435 bln kWh last year, said Inter RAO, the single Russian operator of electric power exports and imports.
Electricity imports surged by 19.2% annually to 2.3 bln kWh last year.
Kazakhstan and Mongolia accounted for the greater share of export supplies in 2025, the company said. The increase in imports was predominantly driven by flows from Kazakhstan.

MOSCOW, February 13. /TASS/. The ongoing negotiations in Geneva regarding the resolution of the Ukraine conflict should be viewed with optimism, as each new round brings us closer to the development of comprehensive peace agreements, stated Leonid Slutsky, Chairman of the State Duma Committee on International Affairs and leader of the Liberal Democratic Party of Russia. He made these remarks to TASS ahead of the upcoming trilateral meeting of delegations from Russia, the United States, and Ukraine scheduled for February 17-18 in Geneva.
"Continued negotiations on the Ukrainian settlement in Geneva are undoubtedly a positive development," Slutsky emphasized. "Each session advances us incrementally toward establishing a 'peace formula.' At least, that is our collective hope. The key is ensuring that this peace is sustainable and that it effectively addresses threats to Russia's national interests and security." He further noted that the upcoming negotiations are expected to concentrate on implementing existing agreements and transitioning the process into a practical phase at the working group level.
Earlier, Russian Presidential Spokesman Dmitry Peskov announced the date and venue for the next round of talks involving Russia, the United States, and Ukraine. He confirmed that the Russian delegation would be led by Vladimir Medinsky, an aide to the Russian president.
The first trilateral security consultations among Russia, Ukraine, and the United States took place on January 23-24 in Abu Dhabi, with Igor Kostyukov, Chief of the Main Intelligence Directorate of the Russian General Staff, heading the Russian team. A second round was held there on February 4-5. Subsequently, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov remarked that Moscow was maintaining a "polite silence" regarding the Abu Dhabi contacts, emphasizing that results-oriented negotiations shun publicity.

Ever since Donald Trump's return to the White House and the appointment of Robert F. Kennedy Jr as Secretary of Health, the United States has become the scene of a growing clash between science and politics. One field in particular is paying the price of this ideological battle: health. FRANCE 24's Pierrick Leurent and Valerie Defert report from Texas.
Read moreUS scraps universal child vaccine guidance, drawing expert concern
Between January and August 2025, Texas saw a major resurgence of measles, a disease declared eradicated more than 20 years ago. Nationwide, more than 1,200 cases have been recorded in 2025, a level not seen since 1992.
This crisis reflects a longer-term trend taking hold locally and nationally in the US: the constant questioning of science and medicine, a phenomenon fuelled by social media. These theories are now reaching the highest levels of government, as seen with the recent decision by the Texas attorney general to sue Tylenol, the painkiller accused without evidence by the Trump administration of being responsible for the rise in autism cases in the country. The move contradicted the conclusions of every serious scientific study on the subject.

Strictly judge Shirley Ballas rumoured to be quitting BBC show after landing new job
- Shirley Ballas, Head Judge of Strictly Come Dancing, is reportedly in discussions for a new role on a US spin-off show, Dancing with the Stars: the Next Pro.
- The potential move has sparked speculation among fans regarding her future on the BBC programme, particularly as the US show's filming schedule clashes with Strictly's preparation.
- Ballas joined Strictly in 2017, succeeding Len Goodman, and has frequently spoken about the significant mental health impact of her role due to relentless online trolling.
- She revealed in 2023 that the constant abuse once brought her to the verge of quitting the show.
- Despite recent changes to the judging format, Ballas continued to face intense criticism following contestant Lewis Cope's elimination, even when other judges shared her assessment.

Trump Tracker: Why we're keeping count of every climate attack the POTUS unleashes in 2026
Unknown

23:41:42 KST

Euronews Green is holding the world's most powerful man to account, by documenting all the ways he's sabotaging climate progress this year.
In a world crippled with uncertainty, one thing is for sure: 2026 will go down in history as the year that Donald Trump single-handedly unravelled decades of climate progress.
Since his return to the White House, the POTUS and his administration have turned their back on science, ruthlessly retreating from global pledges and institutions to prioritise the profits of big polluters.
It's stripping the US – which remains the world's largest historical polluter – of any kind of accountability, while the world edges dangerously close to irreversible climate disaster.
But here's the thing, climate change and its devastating effects do not stop at country borders. What one nation does impacts us all.
It's why Euronews Green has consistently covered Trump's unwavering climate setbacks – from his "drill baby drill" attitude over Venezuela's oil reserves to repeatedly describing wind energy as a "con".
Keeping up with these fast-moving stories can be hard, which is why we've created the Trump Tracker – documenting every single action the POTUS is taking to bolster fossil fuel giants and sabotage progress.
Just two months into 2026, and we're already struggling to keep up.
February: More retreat and less science
'Beautiful clean coal power'
On 11 February, Trump signed an executive order directing the defence department to buy more electricity generated by coal – which is considered the dirtiest, most polluting way of producing energy.
"When burnt, coal releases more carbon dioxide than oil or gas, so it’s by far the worst fuel when it comes to climate change," says Greenpeace. "Coal also produces toxic elements like mercury and arsenic, and small particles of soot which contribute to air pollution."
The order does not mention climate change or the environmental impacts of burning coal. Instead, it is referred to as "beautiful clean coal power".
Repeal of the endangerment finding
On 12 February, the Trump Administration is slated to revoke a scientific finding that has long been the central basis for US action to regulate heat-trapping gasses and fight climate change.
The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) will issue a final rule rescinding a 2009 government declaration known as the endangerment finding. This Obama-era policy determined that carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases endanger public health and welfare.
The endangerment finding is the legal underpinning of nearly all climate regulations under the Clean Air Act for motor vehicles, power plants and other pollution sources that are heating the planet. It is used to justify regulations, such as auto emissions standards, intended to protect against threats made increasingly severe by climate change – deadly floods, extreme heat waves, catastrophic wildfires and other natural disasters in the US and around the world.
“The Trump administration is abandoning its core responsibility to keep us safe from extreme weather and accelerating climate change,'' says Abigail Dillen, president of the nonprofit law firm Earthjustice.
“There is no way to reconcile EPA’s decision with the law, the science and the reality of disasters that are hitting us harder every year. Earthjustice and our partners will see the Trump administration in court.”
January: UN withdrawal, Venezuela's oil and legal fights
'What happened to global warming?'
In the last week of January, a dangerous winter storm has swept across much of the US, leaving at least seven dead, cutting power to thousands of homes, and causing thousands of flights to be cancelled.
Trump used the weather event to cast further doubt on 'global warming', writing on American conservative-focused social media platform Truth Social: "Record Cold Wave expected to hit 40 states. Rarely seen anything like it before.
"Could the Environmental Insurrectionists please explain - WHATEVER HAPPENED TO GLOBAL WARMING?"
More than a dozen scientists tell news agency AP that the president’s claims are wrong. They point out that even in a warmer world, winter and cold occur, and they never said otherwise. They note that even as it is cold in the eastern United States, more of the world is warmer than average. They also stressed the difference between daily and local weather and long-term, planet-wide climate change.
Meteorologists also said that global warming over the past couple of decades may make this cold seem unprecedented and record-smashing. But government records show it has been much colder in the past.
“This social media post crams a remarkable amount of inflammatory language and factually inaccurate assertions into a very short statement,” says climate scientist Daniel Swain of the California Institute for Water Resources. “First of all, global warming continues – and has in fact been progressing at an increased rate in recent years.”
'Stupid' wind turbine rant
Speaking at the World Economic Forum (WEF) in Davos on 21 January, Trump made several dubious claims about Greenland, NATO and renewable energy.
In a speech that lasted over an hour, Trump claimed that China makes "almost all" of the world's wind turbines, which he continues to refer to as "windmills".
"Yet I haven’t been able to find any windfarms in China,” he said. "Did you ever think of that? It’s a good way of looking. China is very smart. They make [wind turbines].”
Trump went on to argue that China sells wind turbines to other countries for a “fortune”. “They sell them to the stupid people that buy them, but don’t use them themselves,” he added.
According to energy think tank Ember, China’s wind generation in 2024 equalled 40 per cent of global wind generation. In April 2025, wind and solar power generated more than a quarter of the country's electricity.
China is also home to the world's largest wind farm, which is visible from space. Located in the vast desert region of western Gansu, construction of the Gansu Wind Farm began in 2009, with the first phase being completed just a year later. It already features more than 7,000 turbines.
Blocking clean energy grants
On 11 January, a federal judge ruled that the Trump administration acted illegally when it cancelled $7.6 billion (around €6.52 billion) in clean energy grants for projects in states that voted for Kamala Harris in 2024.
The grants supported hundreds of clean energy projects in 16 different states. This includes battery plants, hydrogen technology projects, upgrades to the electric grid and efforts to capture carbon dioxide emissions.
The Energy Department says the projects were terminated after a review determined they did not adequately advance the nation’s energy needs or were not economically viable. Russell Vought, the White House budget director, said on social media that “the Left’s climate agenda is being cancelled".
However, US District Judge Amit Mehta said the administration’s action violated the Constitution’s equal protection requirements.
Anne Evens, CEO of Elevate Energy, one of the groups that lost funding, said the court ruling would help keep clean energy affordable and create jobs.
She told AP: "Affordable energy should be a reality for everyone, and the restoration of these grants is an important step toward making that possible."
Trump’s interest in Greenland
Trump’s growing obsession with Greenland has triggered concerns from environmentalists over its critical mineral resources, which are seen as “essential” for the green energy transition.
A 2023 survey found that 25 of the 34 minerals deemed “critical raw materials” by the European Commission were found in Greenland. The nation is estimated to hold between 36 and 42 million metric tons of rare earth oxides, making it the second-largest reserve after China.
Tapping into these resources could help the US reduce its dependency on China, which currently processes over 90 per cent of the world’s rare earth minerals, and empower the US as demand rises.
Since his first term, Trump has been trying to tackle this issue – passing bills to increase American mineral production and stepping up deep-sea mining within both US and international waters.
However, some experts believe Greenland’s mineral reserves could just be a smokescreen for Trump’s real motives.
New dietary guidelines
The US Department of Health and Human Services and the Department of Agriculture have come under fire after releasing their 2026 dietary guidelines, which encourage American households to prioritise diets built on “whole, nutrient-dense food.”
The new food pyramid puts an image of a red steak and ground beef at the top under the “protein” section, despite beef being responsible for 20 times more greenhouse gas emissions per gram of protein than plant-based alternatives such as beans and lentils.
Neither of these foods appears on the food pyramid, but they are mentioned in the full dietary guidelines.
“While there are many ways to meet our protein needs, not all protein sources have the same impact on people or the planet,” says Raychel Santo, a food and climate researcher at the World Resources Institute (WRI).
“Beef and lamb, in particular, have some of the highest environmental costs of any protein-rich food – with significantly higher greenhouse gas emissions, land use, and water pollution per ounce of protein than most alternatives.”
Controlling Venezuela’s oil
After US special forces snatched Venezuela’s President and his wife in a lightning raid, Trump has shown a clear interest in the country’s oil reserves.
Venezuela holds the largest proven crude oil reserves in the world, sitting on an estimated 303 billion barrels (Bbbl) – outranking petrostates like Saudi Arabia and Iran.
Trump immediately confirmed the US would be “very strongly involved” in the country’s oil industry, with plans to send large US firms to fix Venezuela’s oil infrastructure and “start making money for the country”. In an interview on 8 January, he said the US could tap into Venezuela’s oil reserves for years.
“The only safe path forward is a just transition away from fossil fuels, one that protects health, safeguards ecosystems, and supports communities rather than sacrificing them for short-term profit," Christensen adds.
US pulls out of UN climate treaty
The POTUS was accused of “sinking to a new low” after pulling the US out of a key climate treatyin a sweeping withdrawal from global institutions.
In a Presidential Memorandum signed on 7 January, Trump argued it is “contrary to the interests of the US” to remain a member of, participate in, or provide support to more than 60 international organisations, treaties and conventions.
This includes the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCC) – which aims to stabilise greenhouse gas emissions – and the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), the world’s leading authority on climate science.
"At a time when rising seas, record heat, and deadly disasters demand urgent, coordinated action, the US government is choosing to retreat," says Rebecca Brown, President and CEO of the Center for International Environmental Law (CIEL).
"The decision to defund and withdraw from the UNFCCC does not absolve the US of its legal obligations to prevent climate change and remedy climate harm, as the world’s highest court made clear last year."
On 27 January, Trump also officially exited the Paris Agreement – a move he initially put in motion on his first day in office on 20 January 2025. It leaves the US the only country to have withdrawn from the pact, which aims to limit global warming from reaching 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels. Iran, Libya and Yemen are the only countries that didn't join the agreement.

Dubai-based DP World replaces chief named in Epstein files
DP World appoints new chairman and group CEO following departure of Sultan Ahmed bin Sulayem over ties to sex offender.
United Arab Emirates-based logistics giant DP World has appointed a new chairman and CEO, after coming under pressure over former company chief Sultan Ahmed bin Sulayem’s ties to the late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein
The UAE government’s Dubai Media Office said Friday that Essa Kazim had been appointed chairman and Yuvraj Narayan as group CEO of DP World, one of the world’s largest logistics companies, which claims to handle about 10 percent of global trade.

The roles were previously held by bin Sulayem, one of Dubai’s most powerful and well-connected people, who has led DP World – which operates more than 60 ports and terminals worldwide – for more than four decades.
Sulayem’s lengthy tenure at the helm of the logistics giant came to an end in a firestorm of controversy over his links with the disgraced financier, after recently declassified documents showed the pair had exchanged messages for years before and after Epstein pleaded guilty in 2008 to soliciting a minor for prostitution.
Salacious exchanges
The friendly exchanges between the two include discussions about deals and also mention bin Sulayem visiting Epstein’s private island while sharing contacts in business and politics.
The two men also shared salacious comments about women, with bin Sulayem’s email address featuring a correspondence in which Epstein remarked, “I loved the torture video.”
Bin Sulayem’s name was blacked out in documents released by the Department of Justice, but on Tuesday, Democratic Representative Ro Khanna identified him in the House of Representatives, along with five others whose names had been redacted, saying the government had shielded their names “for no apparent reason”.
Since Khanna’s speech to Congress, the Justice Department partially unredacted some of the files he pointed to.
Partners suspend ties
While the files referenced by Khanna did not appear to implicate bin Sulayem or the other men in any specific crimes, the revelation of bin Sulayem’s years-long friendship with Epstein prompted the United Kingdom development investment agency, British International Investment, and Canada’s second-largest pension fund, La Caisse, to announce they had paused future ventures with DP World in response.
La Caisse, which in 2022 invested $2.5bn in Jebel Ali Port, the Jebel Ali Free Zone and the National Industries Park, three of DP World’s flagship assets in the UAE, said on Tuesday that it would not carry out further investments until it shed light on bin Sulayem’s links to Epstein and took “necessary actions”.
On Friday, British International Investment welcomed DP World’s appointment of a new chief executive and said it would resume investment alongside the company.
“We welcome today’s decision by DP World and look forward to continuing our partnership to advance the development of key African trading ports to unlock the continent’s global trading potential,” a spokesperson for the agency said.
Epstein was convicted of procuring a minor for prostitution in 2008, spending about a year in prison before his release.
His contacts with a network of wealthy and influential figures continued in the wake of his conviction until an investigation into the wealthy financier was reopened in 2019.
Epstein died in prison that year while facing charges of sex trafficking underage girls.

KYIV - Ukraine’s Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha said on Feb 13 that he had invited his Chinese counterpart to visit Ukraine, adding that Beijing could help to end the four-year war with Russia.
“China can play an important role in bringing about a just peace for Ukraine,” Mr Sybiha told Ukrainian TV channel Novyny Live after a meeting with Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi on the sidelines of the Munich Security Conference.
“We appreciate China’s support for Ukraine’s territorial integrity and sovereignty, and we had a very substantive and pragmatic conversation.”
In an official Chinese summary of their meeting, Mr Wang said China was “willing to provide new humanitarian assistance to Ukraine” but made no mention of any invitation to visit Kyiv.
“It is encouraging that various dialogues surrounding the Ukraine crisis are progressing intensively,” Mr Wang said, according to a statement released by his ministry.
“We are willing to maintain communication with Ukraine and work with the international community to play a constructive role in achieving an early political solution to the crisis,” Mr Wang added.
China has close economic and security ties to Russia and has refused to join international sanctions on Moscow over its invasion of Ukraine. REUTERS

LONDON – A British court in February jailed two men for life for planning an ISIS-inspired gun attack on a Jewish gathering in northern England.
Walid Saadaoui, 38, and Amar Hussein, 52, intended to target a march against anti-Semitism in Manchester before killing more Jews in the north of the city.
Their deadly plan was thwarted when they revealed it to an undercover operative posing as a like-minded extremist who could help import weapons.
A judge at Preston Crown Court sentenced Saadaoui, originally from Tunisia, to serve a minimum of 37 years in custody.
Hussein, a Kuwaiti, will serve at least 26 years.
Their trial in 2025 heard evidence that Saadaoui hero-worshipped Abdelhamid Abaaoud – an ISIS recruiter and ringleader for the November 2015 Paris attacks
A jury convicted Saadaoui and Hussein
Judge Michael Wall told the defendants that if the plot had succeeded, it would “likely have been one of the deadliest terror attacks ever carried out on British soil”.
The main instigator Saadaoui had aimed to smuggle four AK-47 assault rifles, two handguns and 900 rounds of ammunition into Britain.
Saadaoui also travelled to north Manchester to carry out surveillance on Jewish nurseries, schools, synagogues and shops.
The authorities began to investigate him after he used 10 Facebook accounts in fake names to post Islamic extremist views.
Counter-terrorism police intervened in May 2024 in an operation involving over 200 officers.
Saadaoui was arrested at a hotel carpark after he went to collect some firearms, which had been intercepted and deactivated. AFP

European Commissioner for Sport says he 'respects' IOC's decision to ban Ukrainian Olympian

“Ukraine is going through a very tough time”, Commissioner Glenn Micallef told Euronews' flagship morning programme Europe Today, discussing the Ukrainian athlete's disqualification, “But the decision by the IOC is one I respect.”
European Commissioner for Sport Glenn Micallef said he respected the International Olympic Committee's decision to disqualify a Ukrainian skeleton racer over his custom helmet featuring portraits of fallen Ukrainian athletes, while expressing sadness that "the situation could not be resolved."
Vladyslav Heraskevych was disqualified before his first run at the 2026 Milano-Cortina Winter Olympics, after the IOC banned him from using his custom-made helmet, which features portraits of Ukrainian athletes killed in Russia’s full-scale invasion since early 2022.
The helmet does not display any slogans or political symbols.
Speaking exclusively on Euronews' Europe Today morning show, Micallef said he appreciated the IOC's decision.
“The decision by the IOC is one I respect,” he said.
“I respect particularly the fact that Kirsty Coventry, the president of the International Olympic Committee, was speaking to Vladyslav (Heraskevych) face to face, explaining the situation, trying to resolve the dispute through dialogue."
"I also admire the fact that ... in the event of the extraordinary situation, (Coventry) made an appeal to the disciplinary committee also to revoke the accreditation and restore the accreditation,” Micallef added.
The IOC allowed Heraskevych to remain at the Olympic venues in Milan and Cortina d'Ampezzo, albeit without competing.
The Olympic Committee also said it had offered Heraskevych alternatives, such as wearing a black armband and displaying his helmet before and after the race, but the athlete rejected them.
The helmet at the centre of the controversy depicted over 20 Ukrainian athletes killed in Russia’s war against Ukraine.
Among them are former competitors who left their sporting careers to join the Ukrainian Armed Forces, as well as civilian athletes killed in Russian attacks, including minors.
"I did not break any rules. I defended the interests of Ukraine — not just the country, but the memory of these athletes. They deserve it," Heraskevych said before leaving the Olympic village on Thursday.
European Commissioner for Sport told Euronews he was “sad to see that the situation could not be resolved before the competition in a way that would have allowed him to express himself and pay respect to the fallen heroes in Ukraine."
“Ukraine is going through a very tough time”, he said, reiterating “But the decision by the IOC is one I respect.”
'This is price of our dignity'
Micallef stated that it is for the IOC and the federations to set the rules and regulations for the competitions and “this is uncontested”.
“What we're talking about here is messaging and messaging rules, particularly to come out of the Olympic Charter”, he told Euronews.
“In this particular case, the rule is not directed at a particular country. These are rules to safeguard safety for athletes, but also fair competition, and I emphasise this point.“
Meanwhile, other Ukrainian athletes have spoken out about similar restrictions imposed by the IOC.
Two more Ukrainian Olympians had their helmets barred from competition on the grounds of "politicisation".
Ukrainian freestyle skier Kateryna Kotsar said the IOC disqualified her helmet for the inscription "Be Brave like Ukrainians".
Oleh Handei, a Ukrainian short track speed skater, said his helmet was banned for what the IOC claims is a "political slogan."
"I have an inscription on my helmet by (Ukrainian poet) Lina Kostenko: 'Where there is heroism, there is no final defeat,'" Handei explained.
"They banned it, saying that it was a political slogan, that it was about war, that it was not allowed. I translated it word for word for them — no, it's not a political slogan. These are just motivational words for me, for my team, and for my country."
Sports court dismissed Heraskevych’s appeal
The Court of Arbitration for Sport on Friday denied Heraskevych’s application against the International Bobsleigh & Skeleton Federation (IBSF) and the International Olympic Committee (IOC).
In a statement issued on Friday evening, the CAS insisted that while being “sympathetic” to Ukrainian athlete commemorations, “the sole arbitrator considers these guidelines provide a reasonable balance between athletes' interests to express their views, and athletes' interests to receive undivided attention for their sporting performance on the field of play.”
“The sole arbitrator appointed for this matter wished to state that she is fully sympathetic to Mr Heraskevych’s commemoration and to his attempt to raise awareness for the grief and devastation suffered by the Ukrainian people, and Ukrainian athletes because of the war,” the statement said.
The CAS admitted that while the guidelines state that “freedom of speech is a fundamental right of any athlete competing in the Olympic Games,” they also “limit the right to express views during competitions on the field of play.”
“These limitations (are) reasonable and proportionate, considering the other opportunities for athletes to raise awareness in mixed zones, in press conferences, on social networks, or in Mr Heraskevych’s case, wearing the helmet during four training runs.”
On his social media platforms, Heraskevych pointed to several similar instances at the 2026 Olympics in which athletes honoured the memory of the deceased without facing punishment.
At the opening ceremony, Israeli skeleton racer Jared Firestone honoured the memory of those lost at the 1972 Munich Games by wearing a kippah inscribed with the names of the athletes and coaches who were killed.
US figure skater Maxim Naumov paid tribute to his own family after his performance. He held his childhood photo depicting him and his parents, who died in a 2025 plane crash.
Canadian skier Jessica Linton also carried a personal message on her helmet, "I ski for Brayden," and displayed it to the cameras after her run, likely in memory of moguls skier Brayden Kuroda, who passed away in 2020.
Heraskevych said after his disqualification he was getting threats from Russians and blamed the IOC's decision for that.
"I believe that these Games now and this act of the IOC also serves as an instrument of propaganda for Russia," Heraskevych said. "I still receive a lot of threats from the Russian side."

Why You Should Handwrite Someone You Love a Card

Dashing off an email or text takes seconds. Handwriting a card takes a little courage—and five minutes with a pen. Putting in the extra time and effort matters more than you might think.
“We all have a need to matter—to be considered and to be seen,” says Alison McKleroy, an art therapist in San Francisco. “When you get a homemade card, it’s sending a message: ‘I spent time doing this thing with you in mind.’ It lands differently.”
Here’s what to know about the benefits of sending and receiving handwritten cards—and how to make one yourself.
What makes handwritten cards so special
The research is clear: People underestimate the emotional boost they get from writing and receiving positive letters or cards.
Writing a card can make you feel more relaxed and quietly pleased. “Even five minutes of making something can put you in a flow state, and afterward you feel calmer and more settled,” McKleroy says. “Making a card is very tactile—cutting, gluing, touching—and that kind of tactile input actually calms your nervous system.”
Plus, you might find it’s fun. There’s joy in choosing a color, tearing paper, or getting one small detail just right, McKleroy says. It gives your brain a break from overthinking and pulls you into the present moment. “This is a very low-stakes way to reconnect with fun and play—parts of ourselves that can feel a little exiled,” she adds. “I think we underestimate how much we benefit from these micro-moments of joy.”

Meanwhile, if you’re the recipient, you’ll likely feel extra loved knowing that someone took the time to express their feelings in such a thoughtful way. It’s also a physical reminder of the connection you share—you can save the card and look at it any time you need a boost. That’s especially true if your loved one struggles to articulate their feelings.
“It’s a way to express affection and warmth and care without having to actually say it,” McKleroy says. “Sometimes it just starts with a willingness to do something differently.”
How to get started
You don't need any special art skills to make a card. “It’s not about being Picasso. It’s really about the message: ‘You matter to me. I care about you. I was thinking about you when I made this,’” McKleroy says. “When my 7-year-old makes a rainbow for me, I’m not thinking, ‘This could use some work.’ I’m thinking, ‘That was generous. She was thinking about me.’”
People often tell Melissa Tract that they’re self-conscious about their handwriting: They think it’s too messy or hard to read. But there are ways to have fun with it. You could try calligraphy, write in cursive, or play around with the size of your words, maybe writing in all caps or only lowercase. “You can make it funky,” says Tract, a psychotherapist who integrates professional training in the arts into her clinical work.
You can also add small personal touches, like choosing the recipient’s favorite pen color, drawing tiny hearts or smiley faces, using glue pens to attach glitter, or wrapping the card in ribbon or lace, Tract suggests.
What to write
Don’t focus on finding the perfect words. There’s no such thing, Tract says. If you’re staring at a blank page, she suggests starting with one of these prompts: “One thing I love about you is…” or “A moment with you I keep thinking about is….”
“Think about the last time you saw this person,” she says. “What did you do? What were you laughing about? What did you love that they said to you?” The answers to those questions might spark inspiration and guide your words.
Keep in mind that a handwritten card can do something a store-bought one can’t: it’ll sound unmistakably like you. It leaves room for inside jokes, shared memories, and the small details that only make sense to two people. “What’s great about handwritten cards is they afford you the opportunity to tailor your message to reflect you, your partner, and your relationship,” says Laura Kurtz, a social psychologist and program manager of the Love Consortium, a group of researchers who study social connections. “The power is in the personalization.”
Read More: Love Languages Actually Do Improve Your Relationship
Kurtz suggests considering what qualities you most admire about that person, and working them into your message. “What do you love about them?” she asks. “Try not to focus on what they do or how they make you feel, but rather emphasize what it is about them—who they are as a person—that you find most remarkable.”
If that feels like a lot to put into words, that’s OK. The message itself can stay simple.
“Your card doesn’t have to be a grand overture of love,” Kurtz says. “A simple, thoughtful note that speaks to the positive qualities of your partner and relationship can be just as powerful.”

Faster EU accession is possible, but European Union must take all candidates into account – Ukraine's foreign minister
Ukraine's Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha has stated in Munich that Ukraine is consulting with partners about setting a fixed date for accession to the European Union, and that any such agreements must also take other candidate countries into account.
Source: Sybiha speaking to journalists in Munich, as reported by European Pravda
Details: The minister emphasised that Ukraine's public calls to enshrine a specific accession date in official documents are realistic.
"All these discussions are realistic. Ukraine is openly raising the positions and expectations we count on," he said.
According to Sybiha, negotiations on how to formalise such a date are based on the understanding that this is not only about Ukraine's accession, but also about a new security framework.
"For us, EU membership is an element of security guarantees. That is why we are currently holding active consultations with our European partners," he explained.
The minister added that his optimism is partly based on the fact that Ukraine and the EU managed to overcome the issue of Hungary's veto by launching a frontloading process. "This is a good example of how to find the right formulas for advancing Ukraine's membership in the EU," he said.
"But we must not forget that there are also the Western Balkans and Moldova [undergoing accession into the EU – ed.]. Therefore, this is a comprehensive issue, and we are working with our European partners," he noted. In particular, the minister explained that under any scenario – including a possible fast-track accession for Ukraine – Kyiv would not go through the process alone. "It is very important to understand that Ukraine is categorically against decoupling [separating the Ukraine-Moldova group in the accession process – ed.], because Moldova and Ukraine share a common path toward EU membership," Sybiha explained.

Rights group says verified death toll in last month’s Iran protests has passed 7,000

Rights group says verified death toll in last month’s Iran protests has passed 7,000
HRANA’s figure emerges as world’s largest aircraft carrier, USS Gerald Ford, said headed to region; WSJ reports US smuggled thousands of Starlink terminals into Iran amid blackout
The verified death toll from the Iranian regime’s crackdown on nationwide protests last month has passed 7,000, with many more still feared dead, activists said Thursday.
The US-based Human Rights Activists News Agency — which offered the latest figure of 7,005 people killed, including 214 government forces — has been accurate in counting deaths during previous rounds of unrest in Iran and relies on a network of activists in the country to verify deaths.
More than a month after the mass killing of demonstrators on January 8-9, a second round of talks between the US and Iran remains up in the air, while the American military continues to build up its forces in the region.
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu pressed his case directly with US President Donald Trump on Thursday to intensify demands on Tehran in the negotiations.
Trump told reporters at the White House that Iran should come to an agreement with Washington “very quickly,” and when asked for a timeline, said: “I guess over the next month, something like that.”
Netanyahu called the meeting “excellent” but said he “did not hide” his own “general skepticism” about any deal.
As the premier returned to Israel, it was reported that the US will send the world’s largest aircraft carrier, the USS Gerald R. Ford, to the region, to join the aircraft carrier USS Abraham Lincoln, as well as other ships and warplanes the country has dispatched to the Middle East in recent weeks.
The move, which was first reported early Friday by The New York Times, came as US forces shot down a drone they said got too close to the Lincoln and came to the aid of a US-flagged ship that Iranian forces tried to stop in the Strait of Hormuz, the narrow mouth of the Persian Gulf.
6,000 Starlink terminals smuggled into Iran
Additionally, it was reported Thursday that Washington has smuggled around 6,000 Starlink satellite internet kits into Iran to aid protesters during a regime-imposed internet blackout.
A US official told The Wall Street Journal that senior Trump administration figures decided to use money for internet-freedom initiatives in Iran to purchase the terminals, which were mostly bought in January.
The official said it was unclear whether Trump personally ordered the delivery of the devices, but said the president was aware of it.
Owning a Starlink terminal is illegal in Iran and punishable by years in prison.
As anti-government protests swelled across Iran last month, Trump threatened to strike the Islamic Republic if it killed demonstrators. The US president also told the protesters, via social media, “HELP IS ON ITS WAY!”
So far, no operation by the US to directly help the protesters on the ground is known to have been carried out.
The White House declined to comment on the Journal’s report.
Tehran announces probe into mass protests
The Iranian government announced on Friday the establishment of a commission of inquiry related to the protests.
“A fact-finding committee has been formed with representatives from relevant institutions and is collecting documents and hearing statements,” Iranian government spokeswoman Fatemeh Mohajerani told the local news agency ISNA.
The spokeswoman did not specify whether the commission would only focus on the economic demands that triggered the protests or whether it would also investigate deaths during the protests.
“The final report will be published for public information and further legal action after the process is completed,” she stated.
On Thursday, a government website published comments by President Masoud Pezeskhian saying, “We have assigned teams to investigate the causes” of the unrest, without providing further details.
“We are ashamed that such unfortunate events have occurred,” Pezeshkian said.
Concern over Nobel Peace Prize laureate
The Norwegian Nobel Committee said Friday it was “deeply appalled by credible reports detailing the brutal arrest, physical abuse and ongoing life‑threatening mistreatment” of 2023 Peace Prize laureate Narges Mohammadi.
The committee that awards the prize said it had information that Mohammadi had been beaten during her arrest in December and continued to be mistreated. It called for her immediate and unconditional release.
“She continues to be denied adequate, sustained medical follow‑up while being subjected to heavy interrogation and intimidation,” the committee said. “She has fainted several times, suffers from dangerously high blood pressure, and has been prevented from accessing necessary follow‑up for suspected breast tumors.”
Iran just sentenced Mohammadi, 53, to over seven more years in prison. Supporters had warned for months before her arrest that she was at risk of being put back into prison after she received a furlough in December 2024 over medical concerns.

As presidents of the bar, “it is our duty to point out that the time for justice is not the time for the media, and that the mission of lawyers is to represent each of the parties in order to guarantee a fair trial. Justice must not be the media’s justice, nor that of private justice”, they wrote.
The chairs of the bar refered to the “climate of tension” in which the proceedings were taking place, marked by “particularly intense media coverage” in which some lawyers are participating, sometimes in violation of normal practice. They called for restraint.

Merz acknowledges schism in relations between US, Europe

MUNICH, February 13. /TASS/. German Chancellor Friedrich Merz has called for re-setting relations between Europe and the United States to bridge the gap between them.
"Let me start with an uncomfortable truth: there is a rift in relations between Europe and the United States," he said at the Munich Security Conference. He pointed out that US Vice President JD Vance "very openly stated" this at last year's security conference.
"If we want our partnership to have a future, we need to give it a jumpstart, imbue it with new meaning," Merz said, adding that the United States also depends on its NATO partners. "In the age of superpowers, the United States also depends on this trust. Even they will ultimately reach the limits of their might if they act alone," he warned.

U.S. military completes transfer of 5,700 IS detainees from Syria to Iraq
The U.S. military has moved thousands of Islamic State detainees from Syria to Iraq, where Iraqi authorities expect to try them
- Bookmark
The U.S. military has completed the transfer of thousands of Islamic State group detainees from Syria to Iraq, where they are expected to stand trial in the future, the U.S. Central Command said Friday.
CENTCOM said that the transfer that began on Jan. 21 saw U.S. forces transporting more than 5,700 adult male IS suspects from detention facilities in Syria to Iraqi custody.
The prisoners were transferred to Iraq at the request of Baghdad — a move welcomed by the U.S.-led coalition that had for years fought against IS.
“We appreciate Iraq’s leadership and recognition that transferring the detainees is essential to regional security,” said Adm. Brad Cooper, CENTCOM commander.
Over the past three weeks, the U.S. military escorted the detainees from 60 different nationalities from prisons in northeastern Syria run by the U.S.-backed and Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces, to Baghdad.
The transfers have helped calm fears that the recent rounds of fighting in Syria between government forces and the SDF would allow the IS prisoners to flee from detention camps there and join militant sleeper cells that are still carrying out attacks in both Iraq and Syria.
Iraq is looking to put on trial some of the thousands of the IS detainees who were held for years in Syria without charges or access to the judicial system.
When IS declared a caliphate — a self-proclaimed territory under a traditional form of Islamic rule — in large parts of Syria and Iraq that the militant group seized in 2014, it attracted extremists from around the world.
From the caliphate, the extremists plotted attacks around the world that left hundreds dead from Europe to Arab countries and Asia.
“The successful execution of this orderly and secure transfer operation will help prevent an ISIS resurgence in Syria,” said U.S. Army Maj. Gen. Kevin Lambert, commander of the Combined Joint Task Force – Operation Inherent Resolve, that led the mission planning, coordination, and execution. He used an acronym to refer to the Islamic State group.

Louvre closes rooms after ‘major water leak,’ artworks reportedly damaged
Water believed to have come from floor above, possibly due to faulty pipe, local media report
ISTANBUL
A “major water leak” at the Louvre Museum has forced the closure of several exhibition rooms, with some artworks “apparently damaged,” French broadcaster BFMTV reported Friday.
The leak, described by the museum’s technical teams as an “emergency situation,” occurred overnight between Thursday and Friday in Room 707, known as the Duchatel Room, on the first floor of the Denon wing.
The room houses works from the 15th and 16th centuries, including canvases by Bernardino Luini such as Christ Blessing, Savior of the World, as well as Calvary with Saint Dominic in Prayer by Fra Angelico. It also features The Triumph of French Painting: Apotheosis of Poussin, Le Sueur and Le Brun by 19th-century French painter Charles Meynier.
According to the report, the leak was discovered late Thursday night and was initially classified internally as a technical incident before being escalated to an emergency. The water is believed to have come from the floor above, possibly due to a faulty pipe, BFMTV said.
Scaffolding has been installed as a precautionary measure, and the museum’s website indicates that Rooms 706 to 708, including the Salon Carre, are currently closed to visitors. The ceiling in the affected area has sustained significant damage, requiring the space to be shut down indefinitely.
A source cited by BFMTV said some artworks were “apparently damaged,” though an expert assessment has been launched to determine the extent of the impact.
The incident comes less than three months after another major flooding episode at the Louvre on Nov. 26, when “dirty water” inundated the Egyptian Antiquities library, damaging books and archival documents.
The latest setback adds to mounting challenges at the world’s most visited museum, which has recently faced labor tensions and internal disputes.
Unions renewed a strike notice earlier this week and called for a general assembly amid ongoing criticism of the museum’s leadership.
French Culture Minister Rachida Dati is reportedly considering leadership changes at the institution, including the possible dismissal of Louvre President Laurence des Cars, according to political and union sources.
Museum officials have not yet issued a detailed public statement on the extent of the damage.

Second U.S. aircraft carrier expected to head to Middle East, officials say

Second U.S. aircraft carrier expected to head to Middle East, officials say, amid Iran tensions
The USS Gerald R. Ford aircraft carrier and its escort ships are expected to head from the Caribbean to the Middle East, three U.S. officials told CBS News, adding a second aircraft carrier to the region as tensions between the U.S. and Iran continue to simmer.
The Ford — which is the Navy's most advanced aircraft carrier — is set to join the USS Abraham Lincoln and its carrier strike group, which arrived in the Middle East late last month. The region is overseen by the U.S. military's Central Command.
The Ford carrier strike group has been in the Caribbean region since November, part of a broader military buildup near Venezuela. American forces in that region have conducted dozens of strikes on alleged drug trafficking boats and, last month, captured former Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro and his wife.
The New York Times was first to report on the Ford's expected movement.
The planned deployment comes as President Trump presses Iran to strike a nuclear deal, threatening military action against Iran if it doesn't agree to curb its nuclear program. The president also pressured Iran over its violent crackdown on anti-regime protesters last month.
In a speech at Fort Bragg in North Carolina on Friday, Mr. Trump said "we sent a very big carrier group to Iran."
Mr. Trump reiterated that he'd like to make a deal with Iran, but "sometimes you have to have fear because that's the only thing that really will get the situation taken care of."
The president has repeatedly warned in recent weeks that a "massive armada" is on its way to Iran. In an interview with Axios on Tuesday, Mr. Trump said he was "thinking" about sending another aircraft carrier strike group to the Middle East region.
"Either we will make a deal or we will have to do something very tough like last time," he told Axios, seemingly referring to a set of U.S. strikes on Iranian nuclear sites in June.
Mr. Trump told NBC News last week that Iran's Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, "should be very worried." Khamenei, meanwhile, warned that any attacks by the U.S. would spark a "regional war" in the Middle East.
Representatives from Iran and the U.S. held indirect talks in Oman last week. Officials from both countries said the talks went well and that negotiations would continue.

Macron calls for stronger measures against antisemitism in France at Ilan Halimi ceremony

French President Emmanuel Macron called for intensified efforts to combat antisemitism in France, as recent government data showed hostility toward Jews has remained high.
Macron held a tree-planting ceremony at the Elysee Presidential Palace in Paris to commemorate 20 years since the death of Ilan Halimi, a 23-year-old Jewish man who died after being kidnapped and held captive for 24 days.
A gang leader was sentenced in 2009 to life in prison for his abduction, torture, and murder.
"Schools, the justice system, elected officials: everyone must be mobilised," Macron said during a speech before the ceremony.
He criticized what he called the "poison of online hatred" and urged the European Commission to hold big online platforms accountable.
"In the France of the Enlightenment, 'free speech' stops at antisemitism and racism," the French leader said.
Antisemitism rising across France, Europe
France, which has the largest Jewish community in Europe, documented 1,320 antisemitic acts in 2025, accounting for 53% of all anti-religious incidents, according to a report released on Thursday by the Interior Ministry.
Even as incidents fell 16% year-on-year, they remained at "historically high" levels for three consecutive years, the Ministry said.
The increase followed Hamas's October 7 massacre and attack on Israel.
Antisemitic acts continue to rise across Europe. Britain recorded 3,700 antisemitic incidents in 2025, a 4% increase and the second-worst year on record, according to data published on Wednesday by the Community Security Trust, which protects Jews in the UK.
In Germany, cases of antisemitism nearly doubled to 8,627 last year, according to the Federal Research and Information Point for Antisemitism, pointing to violence, vandalism, and threats tied to the Israel-Hamas War.

In the latest episode of The Jerusalem Dispatch, hosts Ruth Marks Eglash, editor-in-chief of The Jerusalem Report, and journalist and news anchor Calev Ben-David, discuss the ongoing geopolitical dynamics surrounding Israel, Iran, and the United States. Their conversation revolves around the recent diplomatic discussions between Prime Minister Netanyahu and President Trump, focusing on Iran's nuclear program and regional influence.
Eglash reflects on how Netanyahu’s visit to Washington revealed that Israel did not receive the desired approval from the US for military action against Iran. Instead, President Trump emphasized a diplomatic path to resolve tensions.
While Netanyahu’s initial visit suggested a potential military strike, the lack of a press briefing following the meeting pointed to a shift in strategy, with Trump advocating for negotiations rather than direct confrontation.
The hosts delve into the complexity of addressing Iran’s nuclear ambitions, its missile program, and support for regional proxies like Hezbollah. They highlight the challenge of enforcing any comprehensive deal with Iran, noting that while the nuclear issue is critical, addressing Iran's broader influence in the region remains a daunting task.
Shifting to relations between Israel and diaspora
The discussion shifts to the impact of October 7 on Israeli-diaspora relations. Ruth discusses the divide between Israelis and Jews in the diaspora, exacerbated by differing perspectives on political issues like Israel's judicial reforms and the conduct of the Gaza war.
Both hosts note the rise in antisemitism following October 7 and the sense of solidarity that followed, but they also acknowledge the generational and ideological gaps that persist, particularly among younger Jews.
They conclude by reflecting on the future of Jewish unity and media coverage of Israel, touching on the changing dynamics of foreign news reporting, particularly with the closure of The Washington Post's Jerusalem Bureau. Despite challenges, the hosts remain optimistic that Israel’s cultural influence and connections to the Diaspora can continue to grow.

Russia not ready for serious talks, will end war only after exhaustion — Merz
According to an Ukrinform correspondent, German Chancellor Friedrich Merz stated this at the opening of the Munich Security Conference on Friday.
"My personal view is that this war will end when Russia is at least financially, and potentially militarily, exhausted. We are moving closer to that point. We have done a great deal to bring this about, but we are not there yet. Russia must end this terrible war against Ukraine," the chancellor said.
He stressed that it is necessary to work together to "do everything needed to bring Russia to the point where it sees no advantage in continuing this terrible war."
Merz noted that the war has already lasted longer than the Second World War, and while responsibility for ending it lies with Russia, only joint efforts by the United States, Europe, and Ukraine – military, economic, political, and diplomatic – can bring it to an end.
"Russia has the possibility to stop this war. But we also have that possibility – America, Europe, and Ukraine together – to bring Russia to that threshold where the war can be stopped. And we must do everything in our power to achieve this: by military, economic, political, and diplomatic means – by any means necessary," he said.
Commenting on the possibility of a European dialogue with Russia to end its war against Ukraine, Merz said this makes sense, but first the Russians "must demonstrate that they are genuinely ready to talk about ending their aggression, and then about peace."
The 62nd Munich Security Conference opened in Germany on February 13, bringing together around 1,000 participants from nearly 120 countries, including almost 60 heads of state and government, 56 foreign ministers, more than 30 defense ministers, and leaders of over 40 international organizations.
The Ukrainian delegation is led by President Volodymyr Zelensky.

Major car dealership in Odesa is destroyed in Russian drone attack
A Stellantis car dealership was destroyed in a massive fire sparked by a large-scale attack on the city of Odesa with attack drones on 13 February.
Source: State Emergency Service of Ukraine (SES) in Odesa Oblast on Facebook; the Auto Consulting information and analysis group

Jews pray on Jerusalem's Temple Mount as decades-old status quo begins to shift

Escorted by police, a group of about 25 people walked across the Temple Mount esplanade to the steps leading up to the Dome of the Rock, the site where the First and Second Temples once stood.
They climbed a few steps toward the mosque, singing “Yedid Nefesh” (“soulmate”), usually sung on Friday nights.
“Are you with us?” a policeman asked this reporter.
When I said no, he told me to stop filming as participants in the group continued to video themselves walking on the large courtyard of the mount.
The men did not want to be interviewed, but Ilana, one of the few women in the group – who asked that only her first name be used – agreed to speak.
Wearing a white kerchief covering her hair, Ilana said she had immigrated to Israel from the Ukraine.
“I used to go to pray at the Kotel,” she said, referring to the Western Wall, just below the Temple Mount. “But then I started coming here whenever I had the opportunity. It feels very special to pray here.”
A few Muslims sitting on a nearby stone wall watched the group silently.
Ali, who said he goes to pray every day at Al-Aqsa (so called because it was “the farthest” mosque from Mecca when the Quran was revealed), said Jewish groups visiting and even praying there doesn’t bother him.
“It does disturb some people, but it doesn’t bother me,” he said. “If they do it quietly, it’s okay. People should worship God in the way they want to.”
But other Palestinians disagreed. A group of three women from the Galilee, who said they come about once a week to pray at the mosque for their families and for those who were killed in Gaza, frowned as they watched the Jewish group.
“This place is for Islam, and Jews are supposed to pray at the Wall,” Samira said.
Indeed, that has been the case since 1967 when Israel took over Jerusalem’s Old City from Jordan during the Six Day War. For many Israelis, it was the fulfillment of a dream, with the chance to pray at the Kotel – the Western Wall. The iconic photo of three paratroopers standing at the Wall is inscribed into every Israeli’s DNA.
The Temple Mount, which Muslims call the Haram al-Sharif, is holy to both Jews and Muslims.
For Jews, it is the site of both the First and Second Temples (destroyed in 586 BCE and 70 CE, respectively), and the holiest site in Judaism. For Muslims, it is the site where Mohammed ascended to heaven on a miraculous trip called Isra’ and Mi’raj (“the night journey and ascension”) and is the third-holiest site after Mecca and Medina.
Some approve, others don’t
When Israel conquered east Jerusalem in 1967 and later annexed it, then-defense minister Moshe Dayan made a controversial decision to allow the Waqf (Islamic religious trust) to continue administering the site, while Israel would be responsible for its security.
In an effort to ease potential tensions in 1967, the government made a decision that while Jews could visit the site, they could not pray, dance, or engage in any other religious activity.
As part of the deal, while Muslim prayer is permitted in the area, and hundreds of thousands go there to pray during the Muslim holy month of Ramadan (see box), Jewish prayer was not permitted.
The area has long been a flashpoint for Israeli-Palestinian tensions, and riots have repeatedly broken out after Muslim worshipers threw rocks at Jews praying at the Western Wall below and police stormed the area.
Hamas’s name for the massacre of Oct. 7, 2023, is “Al-Aqsa Flood,” an effort to rally the Muslim world around this religiously significant location.
In the past few years, the number of Jews ascending to the Temple Mount has increased dramatically to more than 68,000 in the Hebrew year that ended in September 2025, an increase of 22% over the previous year, according to the Beyadenu activist group. The change is also partly due to recent rabbinic rulings that according to Jewish law, Jews are allowed to visit part of the Temple Mount esplanade – the large area that includes both the Dome of the Rock and the Aqsa Mosque.
Some rabbis have said that Jews should not visit the area, either because of ritual purity laws or because there are some parts like the Holy of Holies that only the high priest was allowed to enter, and only on Yom Kippur.
Now, in the past few weeks, in what amounts to a dramatic change to the status quo that has prevailed since 1967, police have begun to allow Jewish prayer on the Temple Mount under certain conditions.
Not a concentration camp
Five months ago, Rabbi Leo Dee, whose first wife and two of their daughters were killed in a terrorist attack on April 7, 2023, ascended the Temple Mount on the day of his second wedding.
He said it is a custom to go to the site on your wedding day. He arrived at the Mugrabi Gate, the entrance that is designated for non-Muslims to use, wearing his tefillin.
“Usually, as you go through security, the police ask you to remove your tefillin, but somehow this time they didn’t notice,” he told the Magazine.
“We davened [prayed] all of “Shaharit” from our phones,” he said, “then we danced for a few minutes celebrating my wedding. One of the policemen said, ‘I’d like to escort you to the chief of police because it’s forbidden to put on tefillin.’ I responded that the only place I thought it was forbidden was in concentration camps in Germany.”
Dee said that prayer at the site feels different.
“When you pray there, you pray as near as you can to where Jacob had his dream about the ladder, to where Abraham and his son Isaac were for the Akeida [the binding of Isaac], to where our ancestors would sacrifice animals, and to the place where the Shechina [the presence of God] dwells.”
In any case, in the past few weeks police have allowed Jews to enter the Temple Mount compound with prayer pages, printed by the Temple Mount Yeshiva, whose leaders are close to National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir. This change comes just weeks after he appointed his close associate, Maj.-Gen. Avshalom Peled, as commander of the Jerusalem District Police.
Real status quo change?
Israeli officials deny that there has been a major change to the status quo.
“The Israel Police operates throughout the year to enable freedom of worship and visitation to the Temple Mount for all religions and communities, while strictly maintaining public order and the rules in place at the site, in accordance with the directives of the political echelon,” the police spokesman said in a statement in response to a request for an interview by the Magazine.
“Following a request submitted by the administration of the Temple Mount Yeshiva, the police approved the entry of guidance sheets for visitors,” the statement said. “However, in order to maintain the existing order, it was determined that the use of these sheets would be limited to specific areas defined by the police.
“The Israel Police continues to act with discretion and responsibility in order to maintain a balance between the various needs at the Temple Mount,” it concluded.
But for those who have long advocated for Jewish prayer there, the new rules are a step in the right direction.
“Four years ago, someone would utter a prayer under his breath or say a quick ‘Kaddish,’” said Yisrael Medad, who has been up to the Temple Mount hundreds of times, beginning in 1970. “Now people can prostrate themselves and the police let them pray, sometimes for up to five minutes.”
He has even led tours of the Temple Mount.
“For many people, it is a very powerful experience,” he said. “And if they [Muslims] can pray there, we should be able to pray there.”
Rabbi Dee goes even further.
“We should declare sovereignty over the Temple Mount,” he said. “As long as it is in their hands, they believe they are the sovereign rulers.”

Venezuela-US contradictions over Maduro's legitimacy do not hinder joint work — Rodriguez

NEW YORK, February 13. /TASS/. Disagreements over the legitimacy of Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro, who was kidnapped by US servicemen, do not hinder joint work between Caracas and Washington, the country’s authorized president Delcy Rodriguez said.
"Not at all. I don't consider it a difficult task," she said in an interview with NBC News in response to a journalist's question about whether opposing positions complicate Caracas' work with the US administration.
According to Rodriguez, "diplomatic and political dialogue," as well as cooperation in the energy sector, serve as "a channel that will crush all fake news."
On January 3, Washington announced a military operation in Caracas, as a result of which US servicemen captured Maduro and his wife. On January 5, they appeared before a federal court in the Southern District of New York. They are charged with involvement in drug trafficking. Neither Maduro nor his wife pleaded guilty. Rodriguez, who served as executive vice president under Maduro, is currently acting as head of state in Venezuela. The US administration has stated that Washington will temporarily take over the administration of Venezuela.

MOSCOW, February 13. /TASS/. Ukrainian Security and Defense Council Secretary Rustem Umerov has revealed who will represent Kiev at the upcoming round of trilateral talks in Geneva on February 17 and 18.
"[Vladimir Zelensky] has approved the preliminary composition of the negotiating group. Besides me, our group will include [presidential office head] Kirill Budanov (designated as a terrorist and extremist in Russia - TASS), [General Staff Chief] Andrey Gnatov, [the ruling Servant of the People party’s parliamentary faction head] David Arakhamia, [Ukrainian presidential office first deputy head] Sergey Kislitsa, and [Ukraine’s Main Intelligence Directorate Deputy Chief] Vadim Skibitsky," Umerov wrote on his Telegram channel.
According to Umerov, the Ukrainian delegation has already begun preparations for the meeting.
Earlier, Kremlin Spokesman Dmitry Peskov announced the date and the venue of the next round of negotiations between Russia, the United States, and Ukraine. He also said the Russian delegation will be headed by Presidential Aide Vladimir Medinsky.
The first round of trilateral security consultations involving Russia, Ukraine, and the United States was held on January 23-24 in Abu Dhabi. The Russian negotiating group was headed by Igor Kostyukov, head of the Main Intelligence Directorate of the General Staff. On February 4-5, in Abu Dhabi, the second round of trilateral negotiations between Russia, the United States, and Ukraine took place. Later, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov noted that the success of the talks hinges on secrecy, which is why Moscow "maintains a diplomatic silence" on the results of the Abu Dhabi contacts.

War in Ukraine will end only if Russia is economically and militarily exhausted – Merz
Russia’s war against Ukraine will end only when Russia is economically and militarily exhausted, and Moscow is not yet ready for serious negotiations, German Chancellor Friedrich Merz has said.
"My personal assumption is that this war will end only when Russia is at least economically, and possibly also militarily, exhausted. We are approaching that moment, but we are still approaching it," he said at the opening of the Munich Security Conference on Friday.
"Russia is not yet ready for serious negotiations," Merz said.
"Russia must abandon this terrible war against Ukraine. And we must do everything necessary to bring them to the point where they no longer see an advantage in continuing this terrible war," he said.
The German chancellor added that this point had not yet been reached. He described it as "terrible" that Russia’s war against Ukraine has already lasted longer than the Second World War, and said the United States, Europe, and Ukraine must do everything possible to stop Russia through military, economic, political, and diplomatic means.
"And if there is a point in talking, we are ready to talk — but they must acknowledge that they are genuinely ready to talk about a ceasefire, and then about a peace plan," Merz said.

Russia’s foreign national debt remains one of the lowest among major economies — experts

MOSCOW, February 13. /TASS/. Russia remains one of the countries with the lowest level of foreign national debt among the world's largest economies, according to experts interviewed by TASS.
Russia’s foreign national debt has exceeded $60 bln, according to statistics published by the Finance Ministry. By February 1, 2026, it had risen to $61.9 bln, according to the ministry’s documents.
"The government's foreign currency debt has increased slightly, but not by a critical amount. This was primarily due to the Finance Ministry issuing yuan bonds in 2025. In my opinion, it is necessary to observe the overall limit of 20% of GDP for government debt. This is important not only for the state's financial capacity, but also to prevent the state from withdrawing excess financial resources from the financial market and limiting companies' ability to raise funds for their development," said Alexander Abramov, head of the Laboratory for the Analysis of Institutions and Financial Markets at the Presidential Academy.
The expert noted that Russia's foreign national debt is one of the lowest among large countries. According to the expert, even a temporary increase above the 20% threshold would not be critical – it is important to properly assess and manage potential risks.
"There are two main risks with regard to government debt: high debt servicing costs and the risk of creating liquidity shocks to domestic financial resources," the expert said.
For example, there is currently a sharp rise in money market rates in the yuan market. This is largely due to the fact that the Finance Ministry raised a significant amount of yuan through the placement of government bonds. Therefore, theoretically, exceeding 20% of the debt could create both risks of rising debt servicing costs and liquidity risks in the domestic financial market, the expert noted.
According to Anton Tabakh, Chief Economist at Expert RA, it is the national debt-to-GDP ratio that is more important. According to him, the economy in dollar terms has grown significantly over 20 years. The national debt-to-GDP ratio itself is important in conjunction with the structure of liabilities and their repayment schedule.
"There are no uniform 'gold standards' for public debt. Russia has the lowest level of public debt (both in rubles and foreign currency) of any major economy," the expert stressed.
Russian Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin said earlier that Russia's national debt is one of the lowest among major developed countries. Last December, Russian Finance Minister Anton Siluanov stated that in the medium-term forecast, Russia's public debt was not expected to exceed 20% of GDP, which is an advantageous factor for the Russian economy. Currently, it stands at around 15% of GDP, he noted.

Romania Targets Eurozone Entry in 3-4 Years Despite Entering Recession

ECB Sets Timeline for Digital Euro, Eyes 2029 Launch
The European Central Bank (ECB) has confirmed that the introduction of a digital euro will proceed only once the necessary legislative framework is established by European institutions
Romania aims to join the eurozone within three to four years, but recent economic data show the country has slipped into a technical recession. President Nicusor Dan stated after an informal EU summit in Belgium that Romania meets the criteria for euro adoption in the medium term, noting the benefits of closer integration with the eurozone, including higher productivity, larger markets for domestic companies, and better-paying jobs.
The framework for joining, according to Dan, involves maintaining a controlled budget deficit, keeping government debt within limits, and meeting other macroeconomic benchmarks. He suggested that a realistic horizon for adoption is “3-4 years from now.”
At the same time, the Romanian National Institute of Statistics reported that the country’s gross domestic product fell by 1.9 percent in real terms in the fourth quarter of 2025 compared with the previous quarter. This marked the second consecutive quarter of decline, meeting the technical definition of a recession. Prime Minister Ilie Bolojan framed the downturn as part of a planned economic adjustment, describing it as a shift from a consumption- and deficit-driven model toward one focused on investment, productivity, exports, and fiscal discipline.
Bolojan previously acknowledged in late January that Romania had not yet fulfilled eurozone entry requirements. He explained that the country’s current budget deficit, projected at 6.2-6.3 percent for 2026, remains above the 3 percent threshold needed for adoption, with a target to reduce the deficit to around 3 percent by 2030. Romania currently has the largest budget gap in the EU, a factor that continues to block eurozone membership, even as neighboring Bulgaria officially joined the euro on January 1.
Public sentiment shows considerable support for euro adoption, with a Eurobarometer survey indicating that roughly 59 percent of Romanians favor the move. Economists caution, however, that fiscal stabilization will take years, particularly in the context of persistent high inflation, planned austerity measures, and growing political tensions ahead of the 2028 parliamentary elections.

Invictus Games gold medallist could face jail over dishonest disability claim
The Ministry of Defence has accused Debbie O’Connell of ‘lies’ about the extent of her injury
- Bookmark
A former soldier turned champion para-athlete could go to prison after being “dishonest” about her disability in a £1.74m damages claim.
Debbie O’Connell was in the Royal Horse Artillery’s ceremonial unit, the King’s Troop, in 2015 when she fell off her horse and broke her collarbone.
Ms O’Connell claimed that the fall made her left arm almost useless.
After she left the army, she embarked on a successful para-athletics career. She won gold medals for cycling at the 2018 Invictus Games, and for sprinting at world-level competitions.
In September 2018, she launched a £2.4m compensation claim against the Ministry of Defence, later scaled down to £1.74m. However, despite a judge's finding that she was injured, she had her case thrown out due to “fundamental dishonesty”.
At the High Court in 2025, Judge Christopher Kennedy KC said Ms O’Connell’s evidence about ongoing pain “must be dishonest” due to video footage showing her doing various activities, including leading a horse and chopping vegetables, and slapped her with the £200,000-plus costs bill for the case.
But her case was back in court again on Friday after the MoD launched an application to have Ms O’Connell committed to prison for contempt of court, accusing her of telling “lies” about the extent of her disability.
Lawyers for Ms O’Connell argued the contempt bid should be blocked, telling the court she has already “suffered enough”.
But giving permission for the contempt case to go ahead, Mr Justice Coppel said it is in the “public interest” that committal applications be pursued when claims are “prosecuted on a false basis, as has been found in this case”.
“It seems to me that the public interest plainly permits, and requires, that this committal application be made,” he said, giving permission for a five-day contempt hearing to take place.
During the trial of the case, the court heard Ms O’Connell shattered her left collarbone in four places when she fell in 2015, leading to damage she claimed left her with chronic pain in her left arm and shoulder.
She had been training as a mounted gunner with the Royal Horse Artillery’s King’s Troop, but ended up being discharged from the forces two years later.
The King’s Troop is a ceremonial unit of the Royal Horse Artillery, tasked with driving teams of six horses pulling First World War-era cannons during high-profile public displays.
Troopers wear a distinctive blue and gold uniform dating back to the Napoleonic wars and are called on to fire the royal salutes marking grand-scale state occasions, such as the Queen’s birthday and platinum jubilee.
In her claim, Ms O’Connell claimed her fall was caused by riding boots which were two sizes too large and because the horse allotted to her had a tendency to buck.
But disputing the claim, the MoD accused her of exaggerating the impact of her injuries while “dishonestly” pursuing a para athletics career in the T46 category – for competitors with limb impairments comparable with an “athlete with a unilateral above-elbow amputation”.
MoD barrister Niazi Fetto KC said she had “relied upon her dishonest pursuit of a para-athletics career in the knowledge that her condition does not fall within the T46 category”.
Giving evidence, Ms O’Connell, of Lincoln, denied being dishonest, insisting that her damages claim was genuine and that allegations of “cheating” are “not credible” because she fits squarely into the T46 classification.
She told the court she had simply “described my condition” when asked and been given the classification.
As a soldier, she said she had been taught to “push through pain” and, in pursuing her athletics career, is simply doing her best to make the most of her life, despite her injury.
She competed in the Invictus Games in 2018, winning two gold and two silver medals, before also competing in para-athletics as a sprinter and also in CrossFit, which tests the fitness and endurance of athletes.
In his judgment on the claim last year, Judge Kennedy said that by 2022, when the surveillance footage was shot, Ms O'Connell was still reporting that she “needed assistance with cutting food and preparing hot drinks along with aspects of bathing and dressing/undressing. She reported that her pain remained the same as before and it restricted her daily activities.”
“[But] the claimant’s presentation on the video is of someone with normal or near normal function in their left upper limb and shoulder,” he said.
“That is what I find the claimant had at that time. I do not accept her accounts of continuing pain and hypersensitivity. I find her evidence in relation to her symptoms must be dishonest.”
Although the accident had for some time had “serious disabling consequences”, there was a “stark” difference between what she had told experts in the case and what she was seen doing by the time of the surveillance footage in 2022.
“This is a claim which I have found to be fundamentally dishonest. The claimant has persisted with her dishonesty over a long period. She has sought to engage others and her attempts to conceal the truth have been sophisticated.”
On Friday, the case went back to court, with MoD barrister Mr Fetto applying for permission to bring contempt of court proceedings against Ms O'Connell.
The KC said there was a “public interest” in the contempt case – which could result in up to two years’ imprisonment – being allowed to proceed.
However, for Ms O’Connell, barrister Ian Denham argued that the case should not go ahead, telling Mr Justice Coppel that Ms O’Connell had “suffered enough already.”
She had lost her case, been handed the MoD’s massive legal costs bill for it and, having been found “fundamentally dishonest” in a public judgment, would suffer further public repercussions, he said.
He also argued that some of the specific allegations of contempt were not backed by evidence, since they involved statements made before the surveillance evidence.
She had also only been found dishonest to the civil standard of proof, not the higher criminal standard which would apply in a contempt case, he said.
But after a short hearing in London on Friday afternoon, Mr Justice Coppel ruled against Ms O’Connell.
“There are strong findings of fundamental dishonesty made against the defendant in the judgment,” he said.
“I am going to give permission, insofar as it’s necessary, for the claimant to pursue each of the allegations.”
A hearing to decide if Ms O’Connell was in contempt of court and if she should be jailed will now take place at a later date.
The maximum sentence for contempt of court is two years behind bars.

Is it too early to write your will?

Is it too early to write your will?
Will writing is not something to put off, a financial planner explains why.
- Bookmark
It can be easy to feel invincible and as though we’re destined to live forever. After all, why think about death when there’s so much living to do first? But, just like taxes, dying is guaranteed – it’s just a matter of when, not if.
Of course, the hope is that it won’t happen until you are a grand old age. Things do not always go to plan though, and being prepared in advance, especially when it comes to writing a will, can make your passing a tiny bit less difficult for those that love you.
Is there an optimum time to write one though? Is there an age limit? Or can you put one together too soon? “The short answer is, you have to be at least 18 to make your will. So you do have to be an adult,” says Tony Fuller, chartered financial planner at Path Financial. “But beyond that, it’s more common for people to do it too late than too early.”
When to think about writing your will
It’s certainly not mandatory that you visit a solicitor the day you turn 18, that would probably put a downer on the birthday festivities. Instead, Fuller says, “there are some natural times that people start to think about, or should start to think about, making a will…”
1. Firstly, when you come into money. “It’s more important if you have property or wealth,” he explains. “If you accrue some other money in life, maybe you run a business or generate some savings, having a will can become really important so that you define how you want your money to pass should something happen to you.”
2. Secondly, “If you buy a property with a partner for the first time, it can be very important to have a will for unmarried partners.” For married couples, if there are no children and no will, the surviving spouse tends to inherit everything. But for unmarried couples, “if you die without a will, then your estate will pass according to the laws of intestacy, a predefined order of inheritance,” says Fuller.
“For unmarried partners, that can often not be what they want, maybe their money will go to a parent, for example, rather than their partner. So it’s definitely important to think about what you want to do in that position, and consider making a will.”
3. Thirdly, becoming a parent. “For people that have children, a will can define who you want to look after them in the event that you die,” says Fuller. “You can appoint certain people to be the guardians for your children in your will.”
Look beyond the money
Fuller is adamant that will writing – contrary to what watching Succession may have led you to believe – is “not all about wealth. There’s a lot of other good reasons for making a will, don’t let not having wealth be a barrier to creating a will, it’s still well worth doing.”

For instance, “you can also choose things like if you want to be buried or cremated”. “Those kinds of decisions and having a will in itself, can take a lot of stress off loved ones in the event of death,” he continues.
Wills are not set in stone until you die
The first draft you make is not the one you have to stick to throughout your life. Who you are at 25 might not reflect who you are at 45 or 75. People get divorced, remarried, have more than one child, move houses, buy second homes, make money (and sometimes lose it all) – life does not remain static, and a will shouldn’t either.
“When young people think about making a will, sometimes they think: ‘Is this still going to be the same as what I wish in five or 10 years’ time?’ And if the answer is no or maybe not, then maybe they defer or delay making a will,” says Fuller. “That can be the wrong thing to do, because a will isn’t a once-and-done situation. You can update it. In fact, you should update it regularly throughout your life as circumstances change.”
It’s never too early to start having conversations about wills
Just because children are not legally able to write a will, doesn’t mean they won’t be interested in the concept. They may worry about who would look after certain teddies if something happened to them, for instance, and parents can promise to honour their wishes to give reassurance if appropriate.
“I remember when I was young and watched The Lion King and Mufasa died in that gorge,” says Fuller. “You start to learn about death and some of these concepts [early on], often it seems to be that Disney films kill someone off. Having conversations with our kids about some of these concepts is a good idea.”
How to write a will
“Typically, when we speak to clients, we would suggest they take professional advice unless they’re very certain about what they’re going to do and have a very simple set of circumstances,” says Fuller.
“If it’s a case of you can’t afford to take advice from a solicitor and have them draft it for you, then perhaps you’d be better off getting a will pack online or using an online service, of which there’s a few around, rather than not having a will if it came down to that choice. But best practice would be to take advice about what you’re putting in your will, particularly if your circumstances are complex.”
Don’t leave it too late
“It’s very rarely too early to make a will and it can be too late, and it’s often too late for most people,” warns Fuller. “By the time people get around to it, I would typically say they should have done it a few years earlier. So if you’re thinking about making one and that it might be the right time, then go ahead and do it, because it probably is.”

- The video, uploaded last Thursday, depicted Barack Obama and Michelle Obama as apes, alongside other prominent Democrats as animals.
- Trump previously blamed an unnamed staffer and claimed he had not seen the entire video before it was posted.
- While Trump stated he condemns the racist clip, he has not issued an apology for its publication.
- The video has drawn widespread criticism, including from some members of Trump's own Republican party, who have called for an apology.

Israel's far-right National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir on Friday forced his way into Ofer Prison, west of Ramallah in the occupied West Bank, in a visit marked by intimidation and abuse of Palestinian prisoners.
Ben-Gvir entered the prison accompanied by senior police officials, including Police Commissioner Yaakov Shabtai, days before the start of the Muslim holy month of Ramadan, Israel’s Channel 7 reported, saying that stun grenades were fired near Palestinian prisoners’ cells during the visit.
Ben-Gvir, known for publishing inflammatory videos targeting Palestinian detainees and repeatedly threatening them, has openly boasted about tightening prison conditions for Palestinians since taking office in late 2022.
During his tour, he said the changes imposed on prisons were “not enough” and vowed to push for legislation allowing the execution of Palestinian prisoners.
“This is not a luxury hotel. It is a real prison,” Ben-Gvir said, expressing satisfaction with what he described as a “fundamental change” in detention conditions.
Conditions for Palestinian prisoners have sharply deteriorated under Ben-Gvir’s tenure amid severe restrictions, widespread abuse and noticeable weight loss among detainees.
Palestinian and Israeli rights groups say former prisoners released in recent months have reported systematic torture, sexual violence, starvation and medical neglect, with some showing signs of severe psychological trauma.
In November 2025, Israel’s parliament advanced at first reading a bill introduced by Ben-Gvir’s far-right Otzma Yehudit party that would allow the death penalty for Palestinians convicted of killing Israelis.
The proposal still requires second and third readings to become law, and no vote date has been set.
More than 9,300 Palestinians are currently held in Israeli prisons, including about 350 children, according to figures through early February.
Rights organisations have repeatedly warned that abuse of Palestinian prisoners has intensified since October 2023, alongside Israel’s Gaza genocide.

Europe moves to build its own 'Oreshnik' missile

MOSCOW, February 13. /TASS/. Germany and France are interested in developing a new land-based intermediate-range ballistic missile with a non-nuclear warhead and are in talks with the aerospace company ArianeGroup to build the weapon, Reuters reported.
"People are trying to understand what is at stake with ballistic systems," Vincent Pery, ArianeGroup's director of defense programs, told reporters on the sidelines of the Munich Security Conference. According to him, ArianeGroup is holding "preliminary discussions with several countries" about how the weapon would fit into the geopolitical context, keeping in mind that ballistic missiles are already fielded by Russia and in the Middle East.
Reuters notes that ArianeGroup previously proposed a new land-based ballistic missile for Europe. The Aviacionline website points out that the company showcased the Missile Balistique Terrestre/Missile Balistique de Theatre (MBT) concept at the International Paris Air Show at Le Bourget last year.
The weapon presented by ArianeGroup is a high-precision ground-launched intermediate-or intermediate-to-long-range ballistic missile similar to Russia’s Oreshnik.
The missile’s features, as announced by ArianeGroup, include an approximate flight distance of 1,000 to 1,500 kilometers, which is expected to be increased to over 2,000 kilometers, the capability of carrying a non-nuclear warhead, potentially high maneuvering capabilities, and hypersonic speed, at least in the terminal phase of flight.
The plan is to produce two versions of the missile, with one-and two-stage solid-fuel engines, while the warhead will be designed to split into hypersonic planning units.
As of the summer of 2025, the MBT program was at an early stage. What was showcased at the Le Bourget event was just a rough layout of the missile, aimed at drawing the interest of potential customers in Europe.
However, according to Aviacionline, the French authorities had by then allocated initial funds for the development of such a missile in their military plans. Up to one bln euro may be spent on this project. Paris expects the missile to enter service in 2030-2032.
While talking to reporters on the sidelines of the Munich Security Conference, Pery noted that ArianeGroup was in talks both with the French Ministry of the Armed Forces and the German government on a missile, which, in his words, would be capable of hitting targets at a distance of over 1,000 kilometers in minutes. However, he did not highlight any link to the concept presented in Le Bouget last year. Paris and Berlin did not respond to Reuters' request for comment.
Aviacionline claims that France is currently the only European NATO ally that has domestically-made ballistic missiles. Notably, its M51 submarine-launched missiles carry nuclear warheads and are seen as strategic weapons.
They, too, were developed by ArianeGroup, a joint venture between the French corporation Safran and the European aerospace company Airbus.
The media outlet emphasizes that the new initiative is aimed at creating a non-nuclear intermediate-range ballistic missile. French President Emmanuel Macron stated earlier that Europe "falls within the range of such missiles." This is why, he stressed, similar weapons must be developed in order to ensure security on the continent.
Meanwhile, Zuzanna Gwadera, a researcher with the International Institute for Strategic Studies (IISS), believes that Europe has a long way to go before it has anything on par with Russia’s Oreshnik missile.
She pointed out that the EU had already introduced several joint initiatives to develop intermediate-and long-range missiles, including cruise missiles. One of the initiatives, the European Long-range Strike Approach (ELSA) program, was announced last year. However, most of them are still at the concept stage, Gwadera said.

Lebanon's singer Fadl Shaker gets 'cleared' through Al-Assir's testimony
The military court in Lebanon heard testimony from singer Fadl Shaker yesterday, 12 February 2026, in cases related to the so-called "Abra battle" that took place in 2013 in Sidon, southern Lebanon. Shaker was accused of participating alongside Sheikh Ahmed Al-Assir and his followers in attacks against the Lebanese army and killing several soldiers.
The session saw a notable development as al-Assir testified as a witness and faced multiple questions, primarily about which side fired the first shot at the Lebanese army checkpoint.
The court adjourned the hearing until next month, 24 March, to hear two more witnesses.
A legal source following the case told Al Araby al-Jadeed, the Arabic language sister publication of The New Arab, that "the session was positive and favours Fadl Shaker, who repeatedly denied any involvement in the battle, firing at anyone, or joining any armed group."
"Ahmed Al-Assir's testimony, held in a closed session, confirmed that Fadl did not participate in the Abra battle. He was hiding in a room during the fighting before leaving the area, was not part of al-Assir's Free Resistance Brigades, and did not fund any armed group," the source added.
The source noted that "Al-Assir's testimony is important but cannot be taken in isolation, as there are conflicting accounts that may affect the course of the case and the decision regarding Shaker."
"Al-Assir discussed his relationship with Fadl Shaker, the friendship they shared, the later differences of opinion, and that armed men accompanied Shaker because he faced death threats. However, he did not carry or use weapons or participate in any battle," the source said.
Al-Assir also apparently addressed the widely circulated video of Shaker holding a weapon surrounded by men, confirming "it was a satirical clip that was misrepresented."
"Al-Assir emphasised that he did not carry a weapon himself, did not participate in the Abra battle, and did not incite the killing of Lebanese army personnel," the source added, noting there is a move to have Shaker's lawyer request his release.
Shaker had surrendered to an intelligence patrol at the Ain al-Hilweh camp in Sidon in October 2025, restarting investigations into the accusations against him after previous convictions were issued in absentia.
Shaker's lawyer, Amata Mubarak, repeatedly stated that her client did not surrender due to any deal or under threats at the Ain al-Hilweh Palestinian refugee camp but because he found the timing appropriate under a new presidential term, hoping for a fair trial without political interference.
In June 2013, clashes broke out between al-Assir's supporters and the Lebanese army in Abra near Sidon after an attack on an army checkpoint, killing more than 18 soldiers. The army seized a complex used by al-Assir and his followers, including Shaker.
Al-Assir was arrested in 2015 while attempting to flee via Beirut's Rafik Hariri International Airport and sentenced to death in 2017, despite Lebanon not applying capital punishment.
Shaker faced multiple in absentia convictions in three cases, with sentences ranging from five to 15 years, involving charges of incitement to murder, forming an armed gang with Al-Assir, armed appearance, and resisting army personnel, though he was cleared of some allegations.
The Beirut Criminal Court held a session last Friday, 6 February 2026, for Shaker and al-Assir in a case filed by a "Saraya al-Muqawama" official in Sidon, Hilal Hammoud, accusing them of attempting to kill him in May 2013 in Abra. The hearing was adjourned until 24 April.
Hammoud testified that a group affiliated with al-Assir attacked and threatened him before firing at him on his balcony, but he escaped with army assistance to Sidon's old quarter.
He also claimed that Shaker incited against him and threatened to burn his house via loudspeaker at Bilal Bin Rabah mosque, which Shaker denied, describing the case as politically motivated given his opposition to Hezbollah and the Assad regime.

Buzz of the Olympics: How drone cams deliver high-pace visuals and add a new dynamic for TV viewers
Drone cameras are changing how boradcasters show Olympic winter sports by chasing athletes down the course for fast and close-up shots
- Bookmark
Standing on a tower overlooking the cliffs of the Cortina downhill course, there is someone who is just as involved in the biggest skiing races of the Winter Olympics as Mikaela Shiffrin and Breezy Johnson.
Martin Bochatay is the drone cam pilot for the money shots inside the iconic Tofana schuss, the narrow chute between two walls of Dolomite rock.
He is part of a team in control of the buzzing machines that are flying right behind Olympians as they go for gold at the Milan Cortina Games, offering stunning and high-pace visuals to TV viewers back home.
“In my mind, I’m not flying a drone. I’m flying with the skiers,” Bochatay told The Associated Press before the Olympics. “It’s an immersive thing. ... The skiers don’t see us. But I’m right there with them. You become the drone.”
Drone cams have become ubiquitous in showcasing the speeds and angles of skiers, lugers, snowboarders, ski jumpers and other Winter Olympians at these Games.
“The skill of those drone pilots is just phenomenal,” U.S. bobsledder and flag bearer Frank Del Duca said. “It gets a really unique perspective.”
Viewers have noted the humming noise coming from the machines, sparking the question: Is it putting off the Olympians in the biggest moment of their lives? Norwegian downhiller Kajsa Vickhoff Lie says that's not an issue.
“No, you just maybe hear them on the start, but you don’t hear them when you ski,” she said.
The drones are tiny and zoom beyond 100 mph
Drone cams made in inauspicious impact on Alpine skiing 11 years ago when a primitive, massive machine came crashing down from the sky and nearly smashed into Austrian great Marcel Hirscher during a slalom race.
These days, the drones are agile, tiny — they weigh around half a pound (250 grams) — and can easily accelerate to speeds beyond 100 mph (more than 170 kph).
In all the sports, there are rules preventing the drones from overtaking the athletes, and they must keep a safe distance behind the competitors.
Pitch, roll and yaw: how to fly a drone
The drones actually contain two cameras. There’s a high-quality camera for broadcast purposes that is actually controlled by the TV production unit in a truck below the course.
“They can adjust whether it’s too bright, the balance, without us doing anything,” Bochatay said.
Then there’s a lower-quality camera that the pilots use to see where they are going. Those are the images that the pilots see in the goggles they wear to fly the drones.
The pilots have a remote control that requires two hands to hold, and contains two main switches to input the flying commands of pitch (front-to-back), roll (side-to-side) and yaw (vertical axis); plus throttle (up/down or altitude control).
“There’s always these four,” Bochatay said. “It’s not like you move one then the other. It’s everything at the same time.”
There’s also a low-tech issue: the batteries for the drones need to be changed constantly — and kept in warming cases due to the cold temperatures — requiring a “pit stop crew” to quickly sub in new batteries between runs.
Flying footage can be ‘nauseating’ but beautiful
Two things were important to Olympic broadcasting officials: Showing off both the beauty of the venues and the point of view of the athlete.
And the International Olympic Committee is delighted with the results as they look to bring viewers closer to the action. Maybe too close.
“Looking at the screen in the downhill, I almost feel motion sickness,” said Pierre Ducrey, the IOC’s sports director. “That’s how much we are able to project ourselves thanks to this new way of broadcasting the sport.”
U.S. bobsledder Elana Meyers Taylor agreed.
“I’m not concerned about the drone or anything like that,” she said, “but I will say I was watching the luge footage the other day and I was like, ‘This is slightly nauseating.’ I don’t know if I could watch this all the way down the run.”
Lie, the Norwegian skier, likes how the drones showcase a key aspect of skiing: It’s cool to see the speed a little bit more for the spectators.”

Consumers face higher electricity charges at peak periods: ACM

Consumers face higher electricity charges at peak periods: ACM
Dutch households may have to pay more to use electricity at peak times from 2028, the Dutch consumer and markets watchdog ACM said on Friday.
The regulator mooted the measure in its annual Focus on Energy report and will decide later this year how the costs of using the energy network are to be calculated. Industry – including large and small firms – will also switch to fees which depend on the time of day.
The ACM said the step is needed because the power grid is overloaded from late afternoon until around 9pm. It is not yet clear what the new tariff structure will look like in practice and the agency said it plans to publish more information as the year progresses.
On Wednesday it emerged that the grid is so congested that no new electricity connection contracts will be issued for homes in the central Netherlands after the summer while two new substations are completed.
Encouragement
The government has been trying to encourage people to use less electricity at busy times.
Households have been asked to charge electric cars outside peak hours and to replace energy-hungry appliances, such as old freezers, with more efficient models. But grid operators say those measures have not had enough impact.
By raising charges during peak periods, the ACM hopes to nudge consumers into shifting their usage. That could mean paying less if a washing machine runs outside peak hours or if an electric car is not charged immediately after arriving home from work.
The ACM is charged with regulating the electricity market.

Cash-strapped French hospitals appeal to public to help fund medicines, devices

Cash-strapped French hospitals appeal to public to help fund medicines, devices
A growing number of French hospitals struggling with their finances are appealing to the public to help fund urgent needs like medicines and medical devices, and in one case even beds. While some have opted to offer so-called "citizen loans", others have turned to donations and company sponsorships.
Cash-strapped and running out of options, a public hospital in southwestern France has turned to an unlikely source of rescue: potential patients.
This week, the Basque Coast Hospital Centre (CHCB) in Bayonne was the latest to appeal to the public to help fund urgent needs and purchase medicine, medical devices and vaccines through what it calls "citizen loans".
Under the scheme, people lend money to public hospitals that later reimburse them, with interest.
The model has emerged in France over the past few years, with several hospitals and nursing homes inviting people to invest in their healthcare facilities.
The CHCB hopes to raise €1.5 million, the largest sum ever targeted by a French medical facility in such an operation.
Supporters see the loans as an ingenious way to reconnect hospitals with the people they serve.
But critics say such loans are a symptom of a healthcare system under severe strain, with hospitals forced to pass the hat around the community.

The loan "offers citizens the opportunity to participate directly in financing its cash flow needs related to essential healthcare purchases: medicine, medical devices, vaccines, and sampling equipment", the Basque Coast hospital said.
The hospital, which has several sites, notably in the towns of Bayonne and Saint-Jean-de-Luz, said it had received institutional funding but the payments were delayed, and it needed to fund its regular purchases.
A person can invest as little as €1 and will be reimbursed "at the end of 12 months" in a single payment, with interest set at 3.1 percent, a rate that exceeds that of France's popular Livret A savings account.
The operation is being carried out via the start-up Villyz, a government-approved platform.
'Useful, transparent, local'
The Basque Coast hospital praises what it calls a "virtuous" financing model that "diversifies" its funding sources and lets people invest their savings in a product that is "useful, transparent and local".
But it comes against a backdrop of tight finances. In 2024, the CHCB recorded a deficit of €21 million on a budget of around €400 million.
Across France, hospitals' accounts are in the red: the system's overall deficit reached an estimated €2.7 billion to €2.9 billion in 2024, according to official data.
Villyz began offering the scheme to hospitals last year, claiming to be the only platform doing so.
It collects only "application fees that depend on the amount raised", typically amounting to several thousand euros, said its president, Arthur Moraglia.
Through the scheme, a hospital in the northeastern town of Haguenau raised €100,000 to purchase new windows, and a hospital in Evreux in the northwest raised the same amount to add beds.
Two nursing homes in southeastern France have funded improvements, and another in the central town of Bourges plans to do so soon.
The Limoges University Hospital, which wants to open a women's health centre dedicated to victims of domestic violence, with a total budget of €2.5 million, hopes to borrow one million from the public.
'Hold out their hand'
Some hospitals had already turned to more traditional fundraising, including Paris's Georges Pompidou Hospital, which sought donations to buy a scanner, and the Nantes University Hospital.
Critics including the Force Ouvriere union have denounced what they call the government's austerity policies undermining public hospitals nationwide.
"Whereas France once prided itself on having the best healthcare system in the world, today public hospitals are forced to hold out their hand to survive," the union said last year.
"Citizen loans, appeals for donations, corporate sponsorship, or any other 'raffle' scheme – this is now what part of the funding for our public hospitals boils down to."
Jean‑Paul Domin, an economist at the University of Reims Champagne-Ardenne, said the trend, emerging over the past three or four years, was symptomatic of a system in crisis.
"Hospitals need cash," he said, and they are scrambling to find it.
Nicolas Sirven, an economist at the EHESP school of public health, said the loan scheme proved that people were willing to pay to fund the hospital system – even though the political class was reluctant to push for more social security contributions or taxes.
Compared with their overall budgets, the amounts hospitals seek are "marginal", Sirven said.
But "should it be up to hospitals to manage the savings of the French?"

MOSCOW, February 13. /TASS/. The Bank of Russia is not currently taking part in talks on the possibility for the return to US dollars in Russian export payments, Central Bank chief Elvira Nabiullina said at the press conference after the Board meeting.
"As regards the potential development of relations with the United States, we as the Central Bank, are not participating in it so far in any case," she said.
The regulator is not expecting a new inflation wave in Russia, Nabiullina noted.
"No, we do not see such a risk, we do not await a new inflation wave. Yes, fiscal changes unexpectedly resulted in the price hike in January. However, this is a one-time splash, a one-time increase of the price level in the economy - exactly the level and not the start of an inflation acceleration trend. And we believe, I have already spoken about that - the effect of fiscal changes on inflation was largely materialized in January thus far," she added.

1 dead, dozens injured as violent winds batter Spain, red alert issued in Valencia region
Spain, Portugal face fresh alerts as storms continue into weekend
OVIEDO, Spain
At least one person has died and about 90 were injured in Catalonia alone after violent winds swept across large parts of Spain on Thursday and Friday, while meteorologists issued a red alert for hurricane-force gusts in parts of the Valencia region.
The fatality occurred in Barcelona, where a 46-year-old woman died after part of the roof of an industrial building collapsed during the storm, police said.
The extreme winds, driven by storm Nils, forced school closures, canceled non-urgent medical activity and disrupted transport across Catalonia on Thursday. More than 100 flights were canceled at Barcelona’s El Prat airport, while rail services were suspended or delayed and truck traffic was restricted near the French border.
Emergency services received nearly 6,000 calls in Catalonia – the highest number ever recorded during a wind episode – as gusts reached up to 166 kilometers (103 miles) per hour, according to regional authorities.
On Friday, another storm system called Oriana moved in, and large areas of eastern and northern Spain remained under orange or yellow alerts for wind, rain, snow and coastal storms through the weekend.
Spain’s national weather agency, Aemet, placed parts of Castellon province in Valencia under a red alert, warning of “hurricane-force” winds exceeding 140 kilometers (87 miles) per hour on Saturday.
The storm has also worsened flooding across southern Spain, particularly in Castile-La Mancha and Andalusia, where authorities said the cumulative impact of successive storms has been unprecedented.
“We have never experienced an emergency of this level,” said Andalusian interior and emergency official Antonio Sanz, who reported nearly 12,000 incidents handled across the region during the recent chain of storms.
He said authorities were forced to issue 10 emergency alerts to phones – an unprecedented number – while more than 3,100 people remain evacuated from their homes.
The agricultural sector has also been hit hard. Agriculture Minister Luis Planas described the damage as “very significant,” citing early estimates of at least 14,000 hectares (34,600 acres) affected in Andalusia, a figure expected to rise as assessments continue. Flooded citrus groves, olive orchards and damaged irrigation systems were reported across several provinces.
The string of storms has also battered Portugal. Earlier this week, part of the country’s main north-south highway near the city of Coimbra collapsed due to flooding.
Authorities in the historic city are preparing evacuation plans for up to 9,000 people if river levels continue to rise, local media reported. The nearby Mondego River has already overflowed in some areas.
Across Portugal, at least 16 people have died in recent weeks due to the succession of Atlantic storms.
However, meteorologists say Oriana could be the last major system for now, with stable weather expected next week.

"Quantum Frontline Industries has started production in just two months after the announcement. QFI is the first of its kind but will not be the last. We are proud to be a flagship company for Ukrainian-German industrial cooperation and proud to support the Armed Forces of Ukraine with the best technology of both countries," said QFI Managing Director Matthias Lehna.
Mykyta Rozhkov, Chief Business Development Officer of Frontline Robotics, said that the first drone manufactured by QFI is the result of months of work by Ukrainian engineers and international partners.
"It was created from frontline experience and is already helping Ukrainian forces operate more effectively," Rozhkov added.
The Linza 3.0 is a multi-purpose drone equipped with a visual-inertial navigation module supported by AI. It can carry up to 4 kg of payload over a distance of up to 15 km and remain airborne for up to 60 minutes.
Background: Frontline Robotics presented the Linza 3.0 on 11 February 2026. Earlier, in December 2025, Oboronka reported on the launch of joint production in Europe, and the companies later announced plans to scale it up. The agreement was also officially confirmed at the level of Ukraine's Ministry of Defence.

In posts published on Friday, Sybiha said he met Wadephul at the start of the conference to discuss peace efforts, strengthening Ukraine’s defense and resilience, and increasing pressure on Moscow.
Sybiha thanked Germany for what he described as strong leadership in supporting Ukraine, noting that Berlin’s defense assistance this year amounts to a record €11.5 billion ($13.6 billion), while winter energy support packages totaled €75 million ($88.9 million).
The two also discussed expanding bilateral cooperation and advancing Ukraine’s accession to the EU, which Sybiha described as an element of long-term security guarantees.
Wadephul said Germany is working on a new, 20th package of sanctions against Russia and pledged continued support for Ukraine.
Speakers at the official opening of the Ukraine House included Ukrainian Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha, Victor Pinchuk, founder of the Yalta European Strategy (YES), Munich Security Conference Chair Wolfgang Ischinger, and Chief Executive of the Munich Security Conference Benedikt Franke. German Foreign Minister Johann Wadephul and representatives of Ukraine’s Armed Forces also addressed the event.

On the sidelines of the conference, Sybiha also met with Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi.
According to Sybiha’s post on X, the discussions focused on developing trade ties based on respect for territorial integrity, peace efforts to end the war and China’s potential role in facilitating a settlement.
He said he briefed Wang on the battlefield situation and Russian attacks on Ukraine’s energy infrastructure, including damage affecting Chinese companies operating in the country.
Sybiha thanked Beijing for providing an additional humanitarian energy assistance package and invited Wang to visit Ukraine, while also acknowledging an invitation to visit China.
Earlier this week, EU defense ministers met in Brussels to discuss continued military assistance to Kyiv, including additional air defense systems such as Patriot and NASAMS batteries. The talks also addressed cooperation on defense innovation, including drone production and emerging military technologies.
On Thursday, EU leaders held an informal summit in Belgium focused on economic competitiveness and reducing strategic vulnerabilities, before attention shifted to Munich, where debates are expected to concentrate on transatlantic security ties and Europe’s ability to deter further Russian escalation.

Canada school deaths suspect created shooting simulator on gaming platform

The 18-year-old suspect in a high school shooting in British Columbia had previously created a mass shooting simulator on the gaming platform Roblox, it has been revealed.
The simulator, set in what appeared to be a virtual shopping mall, allowed users – represented as Roblox-style avatars – to pick up weapons and shoot other players, 404 Media reported on Thursday.
Users first identified the suspect’s Roblox account and game on Kiwi Farms, a site known for doxing and trolling. After the shooting on Wednesday, Canadian police identified the suspect as Jesse Van Rootselaar.
In a statement to the Guardian, Roblox said: “We have removed the user account connected to this horrifying incident as well as any content associated with the suspect. We are committed to fully supporting law enforcement in their investigation.”
The California-based company added that the “Mall experience” was accessible only through Roblox Studio, a separate app used by developers to create games. As a result, the simulator recorded just seven visits.
Roblox also said it uses a combination of AI and a team of safety specialists to review content that is uploaded to its platform before it is shown to another user.
Wednesday’s attack – one of Canada’s deadliest school shootings since the 1989 École Polytechnique massacre when a gunman killed 14 women – left nine people dead in Tumbler Ridge, a small coalmining community.
The victims included a teacher, five students, the suspect’s mother and her stepbrother. The suspect, who reportedly had a history of mental health issues, was found dead from a self-inflicted gunshot wound.
This isn’t the first time Roblox has been criticised for its content. The platform allows its millions of users to create and share their own video games – many of them benign, featuring cartoon fish and camping trips.
However, it has also allegedly made Jeffrey Epstein-themed content available to children, and is facing a lawsuit in California for facilitating the sexual exploitation and assault of minors.
The links between violent video games and mass shootings have been long-debated and remain inconclusive, with large studies finding at most a small correlation between gaming and real-world aggression.
However, though games may not cause violence, recent incidents underscore the growing trend of “gamified violence”: extremists adopting elements of video game design in the context of real-world attacks.
This is becoming increasingly common. The attacker in the 2019 mosque shooting in Christchurch, New Zealand, broadcast his massacre on Facebook. A racially motivated shooting in Buffalo, New York, in 2022, was broadcast on Twitch, a platform that allows users to livestream themselves playing video games.

This article was amended on 14 February 2026. An earlier version said there was more than one attacker in the Christchurch attack and incorrectly named the platform the attacker streamed on as Twitch.

Ex dpty head of President's Office Shurma denies hiding in Germany
Former Deputy Head of the Ukrainian Presidential Office Rostyslav Shurma, who has been placed on a wanted list by the National Anti-Corruption Bureau of Ukraine (NABU) on suspicion of misappropriation of property and money laundering, has denied wrongdoing, said he is prepared to cooperate with the investigation, and stated that he is lawfully present in Germany.
"Today, media reported that my brother and I have allegedly been placed on a wanted list… I emphasize: neither I nor my brother are in hiding. I am openly and lawfully present in the Federal Republic of Germany at an address known to the investigation. My current contact details and those of my defense counsel have been communicated to the competent authorities on multiple occasions. I am prepared to cooperate with the investigation within the bounds of the law — with respect for my right to defense and due procedural process," Shurma wrote on Facebook on Friday.
He said his defense team had formally requested that his participation in procedural actions be facilitated via videoconference or through diplomatic channels.
"I do not plead guilty and will prove my innocence through the procedure established by law. The defense will continue to take all legally prescribed measures to ensure proper procedural communication and the protection of my rights in Ukraine and abroad," he added.
As previously reported, NABU placed Shurma on a wanted list on suspicion of misappropriation of property and money laundering. The relevant entry appeared in the wanted persons section of the Ukrainian Interior Ministry’s website, with Feb. 12, 2026 listed as the date of his disappearance. No preventive measure had been applied against him. A wanted notice for Oleh Shurma, born Jan. 13, 1986, carrying identical suspicion details and disappearance date, was also added to the database.
The case stems from a scheme uncovered by NABU and the Specialized Anti-Corruption Prosecutor’s Office (SAPO) on Jan. 21, 2026, involving the alleged embezzlement of funds under the so-called "green" energy tariff in the temporarily occupied territories of Zaporizhia region, with losses estimated at UAH 141.3 million. Member of parliament Yaroslav Zheleznyak of the Holos faction linked Shurma to the suspicion notice, writing on Telegram: "The suspicion against Shurma follows my complaint to NABU."

Controversy erupts as France signals bid to remove UN rapporteur Francesca Albanese

ALBAWABA - Several European governments have voiced sharp criticism of Francesca Albanese, the UN Special Rapporteur on human rights in the occupied Palestinian territories, for what she said at a recent public event. Frankreich has said that it will officially ask her to step down at the next UN Human Rights Council meeting.
The problem started when Albanese spoke at a forum put on by Al Jazeera and talked about new developments in the Palestinian situation. During her speech, she used words that some European officials said were rude and didn't fit with the neutrality that UN mandate holders are supposed to show.
Some people didn't like how she supposedly called Israel a "common enemy of humanity." They said that this kind of language goes beyond criticizing policies and could be used to target a state and its people.
France Leads the Call to Act
Lawyers were told by France's Foreign Minister Jean-Noël Barrot that the country would bring up the problem at the February 23 meeting of the Human Rights Council. It wasn't appropriate for him to talk about politics, and Albanese's comments made him question her independence and fairness.
Barrot also said that her comments add to what he called a catalogue of controversial views and that they hurt the reputation of her UN job.
A message was sent to the Foreign Ministry by French MP Caroline Yadan and other lawmakers asking for a review of Albanese's role because they were worried about his impartiality and professional standards.
More reactions across Europe
Antonio Tajani, Italy's foreign minister, said that Albanese's comments do not reflect the stance of the Italian government and are not in line with the duties of a UN human rights official.
Beate Meinl-Reisinger, the foreign minister of Austria, said the language used was wrong and warned that it could hurt the impression of fairness.
Johann Wadephul, Germany's foreign minister, said he supported the UN's system of independent rapporteurs but that Albanese had made many incorrect comments. He also said that Albanese's recent comments about Israel made him very worried about her ability to keep her job.
Responses from Israel and Advocacy Groups
Yair Lapid, the head of the Israeli opposition, called Albanese a "extremist envoy" and said that if she wasn't removed, it would show that antisemitic speech was okay.
The Anti-Defamation League also called for action, saying that her views went beyond what was allowed as criticism of human rights and showed broad generalizations.
Albanese denies the claims
Albanese has denied the charges, saying that what she said was taken out of context. She said that her criticism wasn't aimed at a specific country or group of people, but at larger systems that were linked to supposed violations of international law. She put out the full recording of her intervention to back up her point of view.
In a message to António Guterres last year, the US asked for her to be fired, saying she was antisemitic and helpful to terrorists. Albanese has denied those claims and said that the punishments she was given were an attempt to hurt her image.

Pentagon to move carrier to Middle East from Caribbean
The Pentagon is sending an aircraft carrier from the Caribbean to the Middle East, two US officials told Reuters on Friday, a move that would put two carriers in the region as tensions soar between the United States and Iran.
The Gerald R. Ford carrier, the United States' newest and the world's largest carrier, has been operating in the Caribbean with its escort ships and took part in operations in Venezuela earlier this year.
One of the officials, who was speaking on condition of anonymity, said the carrier would take at least a week to reach the Middle East.
The Gerald R. Ford will join the Abraham Lincoln carrier, several guided-missile destroyers, fighter jets and surveillance aircraft that have been moved to the Middle East in recent weeks.
The United States most recently had two aircraft carriers in the area last year, when it carried out strikes against Iranian nuclear sites in June.
With only 11 aircraft carriers in the US military's arsenal, they are a scarce resource and their schedules are usually set well in advance.
In a statement, US Southern Command, which oversees US military operations in Latin America, said it would continue to stay focused on countering "illicit activities and malign actors in the Western Hemisphere."
President Donald Trump had said this week he was considering sending a second aircraft carrier to the Middle East if a deal is not reached with Iran.
On Thursday, he suggested an agreement with Iran could be struck over the next month.
"We have to make a deal, otherwise it's going to be very traumatic, very traumatic," Trump told reporters.
Long Deployment
The Ford has essentially been at sea since June 2025. It was supposed to be operating in Europe before it was abruptly moved to the Caribbean in November.
While deployments for carriers usually last nine months, it is not uncommon for them to be extended during periods of increased US military activity.
Navy officials have long warned that long deployments at sea can damage morale on ships.
Officials said the administration had looked at sending a separate carrier, the Bush, to the Middle East, but it was undergoing certification and would take over a month to reach the Middle East.
The Ford, which has a nuclear reactor on board, can hold more than 75 military aircraft, including fighter aircraft like the F-18 Super Hornet jets and the E-2 Hawkeye, which can act as an early warning system.
The Ford also includes sophisticated radar that can help control air traffic and navigation.
The supporting ships, such as the Ticonderoga-class guided missile cruiser Normandy, Arleigh Burke-class guided missile destroyers Thomas Hudner, Ramage, Carney, and Roosevelt, include surface-to-air, surface-to-surface and anti-submarine warfare capabilities.

DR Congo agrees to Angola-proposed ceasefire with M23 armed group
Congolese president’s office says DR Congo wants peaceful solution to conflict
KIGALI, Rwanda
The Democratic Republic of the Congo on Friday accepted Angola's proposal for a ceasefire between the government and the AFC/M23 armed group, the president’s office announced.
Amid intensified fighting, Angola’s President Joao Lourenco earlier this week proposed a ceasefire between the warring parties in eastern Congo from Feb. 18.
The proposal followed a meeting held on Monday in Luanda between Lourenco, Congolese President Felix Tshisekedi, Togolese President Faure Gnassingbe, mediator of the African Union, and former Nigerian President Olusegun Obasanjo, one of the African Union facilitators of the peace process in the Congo.
The president has agreed to a ceasefire for a peaceful solution to the conflict, a statement by the Congo’s president’s office said.
There was no immediate reaction from the AFC/M23 armed group.
But the statement warned that any unilateral consolidation of military positions or any action aimed at altering the balance on the ground during the ceasefire period would seriously compromise the credibility of the process and weaken its prospects.
The UN Under-Secretary-General for Peace Operations Jean-Pierre Lacroix said Tuesday MONUSCO would deploy forces in the Congo’s border city of Uvira in South Kivu Province to monitor the ceasefire after their security guarantees were met.
M23 has been at the center of the conflict in eastern Congo. The rebel group allegedly supported by neighboring Rwanda, according to the UN and Western nations, controls significant territory in eastern Congo, including the provincial capitals of Goma and Bukavu seized early in 2025.

Extremist Israeli minister storms Ofer Prison, oversees abuse of Palestinian inmates
Itamar Ben-Gvir visits West Bank prison ahead of Ramadan as reports say stun grenades were set off near detainees and harsher measures were touted
JERUSALEM
Israel's far-right National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir on Friday forced his way into Ofer Prison, west of Ramallah in the occupied West Bank, in a visit marked by intimidation and abuse of Palestinian detainees.
Ben-Gvir entered the prison accompanied by senior police officials, including Police Commissioner Yaakov Shabtai, days before the start of the Muslim holy month of Ramadan, Israel’s Channel 7 reported, saying that stun grenades were fired near Palestinian prisoners’ cells during the visit.
Ben-Gvir, known for publishing inflammatory videos targeting Palestinian detainees and repeatedly threatening them, has openly boasted about tightening prison conditions for Palestinians since taking office in late 2022.
During his tour, he said the changes imposed on prisons were “not enough” and vowed to push for legislation allowing the execution of Palestinian prisoners.
“This is not a luxury hotel. It is a real prison,” Ben-Gvir said, expressing satisfaction with what he described as a “fundamental change” in detention conditions.
Conditions for Palestinian prisoners have sharply deteriorated under Ben-Gvir’s tenure amid severe restrictions, widespread abuse and noticeable weight loss among detainees.
Palestinian and Israeli rights groups say former prisoners released in recent months have reported systematic torture, sexual violence, starvation and medical neglect, with some showing signs of severe psychological trauma.
In November 2025, Israel’s parliament advanced at first reading a bill introduced by Ben-Gvir’s far-right Otzma Yehudit party that would allow the death penalty for Palestinians convicted of killing Israelis. The proposal still requires second and third readings to become law, and no vote date has been set.
More than 9,300 Palestinians are currently held in Israeli prisons, including about 350 children, according to figures through early February.
Rights organizations have repeatedly warned that abuse of Palestinian detainees has intensified since October 2023, alongside Israel’s genocidal war on Gaza.

Vampire bomber drones to be entirely produced in Ukraine by year's end: interview with leading drone maker Sky

Vampire bomber drones to be entirely produced in Ukraine by year's end: interview with leading drone maker SkyFall
SkyFall is one of Ukraine's most under-the-radar defence companies, yet its drones speak volumes.
The company produces Ukraine's most effective bomber drone, the Vampire, which Ukrainian troops use as their primary tool to hit Russian positions, with a huge lead over other weapons. The Vampire is one of the drones that the Russians collectively dub "Baba Yaga", referencing the infamous witch from Slavic tales – a name that captures the fear it sows.
SkyFall also builds the Shrike, a top choice for Ukrainian first-person view (FPV) drone operators, and has recently introduced the P1-SUN interceptor UAVs.
The manufacturer is grappling with multiple hurdles. Supply chain risks from China mean drones must be fitted with Ukrainian components. Russian forces are shooting down an increasing number of bomber drones, so new ways to protect them are needed. FPV drones must keep pace with battlefield needs, and the development of interceptor drones must move faster than Russia's production of Shahed loitering munitions, used by Moscow to terrorise Ukrainian civilians each night.
Ukrainska Pravda has discussed all these issues with a SkyFall representative, who goes by the alias Nirmata, at their stand at the World Defence Show 2026, which is currently taking place in Saudi Arabia. The company is seeking technological partners for production and is promoting its products to potential customers worldwide to secure funding for further investment in technology development.
How many people are working on building your drones?
Today the workforce numbers roughly 4,000.
Tell us about the evolution of the Vampire drone. How different is it from the earliest version?
The difference is enormous. If we had had the Vampire in its current form at the start of the full-scale war, no territory would likely have been lost. Compared to the original, it's better in every way: communications, range, resilience to electronic attacks, ease of operation, speed and design for production. That last factor now lets us produce a larger number of drones with consistent quality: previously, we could create 50,000 units a year, but now we can confidently say 100,000.
How much of the Vampire is actually built from Ukrainian parts?
All of the communication systems, antennas and chassis are ours, and the ground station is almost entirely ours. We've also got our own motors, though they're not yet in mass production.
We're developing our own camera – a prototype is ready, and by spring we'll have a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) (an early working version – ed.). Cameras for the Vampire will go into mass production by the end of the year.
We've got a "Vampire non-China" version right now – no Chinese parts at all. By the end of the year, the drone will be fully Ukrainian.
How has the cost of the Vampire drone changed since 2022?
We've brought the cost down to US$8,500 per drone. When production began, it could go up to US$20,000, depending on the configuration.
Is there still room for manoeuvre on the price?
Yes, but further reductions will be tricky. Once we have our own camera, we can cut the price a little, since our domestically made components are cheaper than Chinese parts. Still, going lower is tough because we're improving performance and introducing new modules with modern technology, which costs money. Even so, the most advanced Vampire currently sells for under US$10,000.
A lot of your bomber drones are getting shot down by the Russians. Is there a way to address this with technology?
Most of our bomber losses are caused by FPV drones. Our R&D team is focused solely on protection for the Vampire. Options include electronic warfare systems, a blinding device, a net launcher, or a small turret. Some things we're keeping under wraps. Let it be a surprise. We haven't yet decided whether each bomber will defend itself or if a "hunter" drone will protect the group.
In which direction are the bombers going next? Or have you already got everything you can out of the platform?
There's still plenty of room for development. Navigation is one area: we no longer rely solely on GPS as we did before. We're exploring visual orientation, inertial navigation, or ground beacons. For the Starlink-equipped version, satellite constellations could be used for orientation. Our goal is to ensure that, even when faced with jamming, the Vampire can complete its mission and return safely. Some of the technologies we're developing could become true game changers.
How much does the Shrike FPV drone cost today?
Prices vary depending on size and configuration. The most basic daytime model costs around US$300, while the top-end nighttime Shrike, controlled via fibre optics, goes for about US$1,500. Even so, these remain some of the most affordable drones in the world.
Is the Shrike's automatic target tracking fully accurate today, or is its machine vision still in its early stages?
I think machine vision could achieve much more if it were used more often. At the moment, it's hardly being used at all – the military doesn't make much use of it. This technology is really underestimated and needs more development.
It's part of a global automated combat system. We won't see any real breakthroughs without it. In the future, every drone will have a smart image-processing module and an analytical computing core that can make decisions based on the goals you set. Right now, it might not be obvious, but very soon, we won't even be able to imagine a drone without all of this.
How is FPV drone technology evolving at the moment? Has the platform reached its limits?
Fibre optics, size, repeaters and drone carriers. You can experiment endlessly with connectivity, swarm technology, mesh networks and DroneID. FPV drones, like our Shrike, are not a finished product. They can be refined further without increasing weight. Motors, propellers, batteries, cameras and AI are all evolving. Each evolving module adds a certain percentage to a target's destruction. A truly perfect FPV drone hasn't been created yet; we're still quite far from that.
Are Shrikes made with Ukrainian parts? Which components are already produced in Ukraine, and do you plan to make the drones entirely domestic eventually?
We already have 100% domestically-produced Shrikes that are completely moisture-proof. They significantly outperform their global counterparts. The only thing holding back mass production of entirely domestically produced drones is the state and capacity of production facilities, which are currently being scaled up.
You've just launched the P1-SUN drone interceptors. How many are you making right now?
We've been making them for three months. We've taken out more than 1,000 targets. These include 700 Shaheds. Everything is backed up by video.
How much does your interceptor cost?
About US$1,000. Further reductions aren't really possible unless we manufacture our own thermal sensors, and even then, the difference would be just a few dollars, not hundreds.
What direction will the development of interceptor drones take going forward?
It's machine vision with automatic targeting. It's an automated control and automatic launch. Our drone already has remote control and target tracking. Starting mass production is essential, though. The objective is to launch two interceptors and guarantee target elimination.
A separate challenge is training the people who will operate all of this. Our SkyFall Academy is handling that. Over the past two years, we've trained 20,000 pilots, technicians and engineers on all our equipment. As regards the interceptors, nearly 1,000 pilots have already completed training.
Is the government placing enough orders with interceptor manufacturers?
Are state orders sufficient to cover the needs of the front? We don't know. Do the contracts match our production capacity? We could always do more. But in our view, the state is doing everything it can at the moment.
Is the market short of drone assembly workers? How do you get around that and bring people on board?
We don't struggle with recruiting assemblers. People come from all walks of life. Seamstresses come to assemble drones, guys from car service stations come to assemble them. The market is big enough to find staff. We're also working to automate parts of the assembly process. We don't feel a shortage of people. Our academy helps anyone train for a specific role and start work as soon as possible.
Why do you find it essential to take part in the exhibition? (World Defence Show 2026 in Riyadh)?
Ukraine has demonstrated that our engineers are among the world's finest. Still, there's a long way to go before these innovations become a large-scale industry domestically and internationally. Our aim is to prevent Ukrainian technological achievements from being overshadowed by the global giants in weapons production.
Naturally, we keep an eye on new developments and technologies. Naturally, we look for something new, especially at exhibitions like this. However, whereas we once learned from others, we're now leading the way in technological innovation globally.
Which of your products do you see having the most export potential?
Absolutely everything. If a product works in Ukraine, it has export potential worldwide. Of course, depending on the country, weather, climate and mission requirements, drone configurations may need to be adjusted to meet local challenges. But Ukrainian engineers are well-equipped to handle that.
There's interest from all over: Germany, France, the US, India, Pakistan, Singapore, Japan and numerous others. Some of the countries that approached us, I hadn't even heard of before. If exports were fully open, many of them would already be willing to sign contracts for small quantities.

Outgoing Prime Minister Rosen Zhelyazkov and outgoing Foreign Minister Georg Georgiev met with Nickolay Mladenov, the UN High Representative for Gaza, on the sidelines of the Munich Security Conference, focusing on the evolving security situation in the Middle East.
The discussion centered on developments in Gaza, with particular attention to the humanitarian conditions and the broader political environment. Participants stressed the importance of achieving a lasting ceasefire, guaranteeing unhindered humanitarian access, and laying the groundwork for durable stability in the territory.
The talks also explored ways in which Bulgaria could contribute more actively to Gaza’s reconstruction. These included the provision of expert knowledge and technical support, as well as involvement in international coordination formats and donor-led initiatives aimed at post-conflict recovery.
Mladenov briefed the Bulgarian representatives on anticipated developments linked to the implementation of the second stage of U.S. President Donald Trump’s 20-point Gaza reconstruction plan. He outlined the main priorities ahead, the next steps in the process, and the expected role of international partners in supporting the rebuilding effort.

MOSCOW, February 13. /TASS/. Russia was able to secure its tank contract with India 25 years ago because the country’s T-90 proved itself worthier in tests versus its Ukrainian competitor the T-84, Alexander Nozdrachev, who served as General Director of the Russian Agency for Conventional Arms from 1999 to 2004, told TASS.
"Our key advantage was that we offered not just to supply tanks, but also to transfer technology. We said in all negotiations: ‘We’re not just selling you tanks, we’re giving you technology.’ We offered to localize production to the Indian side. Moreover, during the trials in which the Ukrainian tank also participated, our tank demonstrated significantly better results," Nozdrachev explained.
He noted that the Ukrainian side, with its T-84 tank, was at one point the frontrunner for the Indian contract. "They had already made deliveries to Pakistan, and their tanks had proven themselves there. We had fierce competition on our hands," Nozdrachev added.
According to him, after the Russian tanks began to be tested in 1999, India realized they were the better choice. "The test program requirements were very demanding, especially for the engine, which was run at extreme conditions. Thanks to the efforts of test crews from the Uralvagonzavod Group and representatives of the Main Armored Vehicle Directorate of the Defense Ministry in 2000 we received positive test results and approval from the Indian military, who participated in these trials," the expert said.

It will strike, conduct reconnaissance, and protect our soldiers. And already this year, 10,000 drones produced here will be handed over to Ukraine and will strengthen our forces," Zelenskyy wrote on Telegram on Friday.
The president also said that 10 joint drone production ventures are planned to be launched by the end of the year.
"I thank Chancellor Friedrich Merz, the German government, Defense Minister Boris Pistorius personally, and the German people. Ukraine is always ready to share the experience we have gained defending lives," he said.
Germany’s Defense Ministry said the German-Ukrainian joint venture "is delivering results." "Both sides benefit from the joint venture. By the end of the year, Ukraine will receive up to 10,000 drones under this project. Germany, in turn, is expanding its own production capacity and learning from battlefield experience," it said.
According to Ukrainian company Frontline Robotics, the drone received by Zelenskyy — the Linza 3.0 — was developed by the company and manufactured by the first Ukrainian-German defense enterprise, Quantum Frontline Industries (QFI), which the Ukrainian president visited alongside Pistorius.
"I would like to express my gratitude for this project, which was implemented at the speed of light. We are learning from the successes achieved on the battlefield and benefiting from the innovations being applied," Pistorius said.
QFI CEO Matthias Lehna, who demonstrated the production facility to Zelenskyy and Pistorius, noted that the venture began production just two months after its establishment was announced. "QFI is the first enterprise of this kind, but certainly not the last. We are proud to be the flagship company of Ukrainian-German industrial cooperation and to support the Armed Forces of Ukraine," he said.
Frontline Robotics Chief Business Development Officer Mykyta Rozhkov said the Linza 3.0 was built on frontline experience and "is already helping Ukrainian forces operate more effectively."
The Linza 3.0 is the latest version of the Linza bomber drone series, which has been adopted by more than 60 units of Ukraine’s Defense Forces. It is equipped with an AI-based visual-inertial navigation module, has a 12-inch airframe, and can carry a payload of up to 4 kg over a range of up to 15 km, with an endurance of up to 60 minutes.
The visit by Zelenskyy and Pistorius was organized with the support of the Ukrainian Armory Council, which represents Ukraine’s private defense manufacturers.

BERLIN, February 13. /TASS/. The North Atlantic Alliance is growing increasingly frustrated with what it is hearing from the US, German Foreign Minister Johann Wadephul said.
He noted that NATO is under pressure. "There is growing alienation and irritation about some of the things we hear from Washington. We need to discuss this together," he told the ARD television channel.
The updated US National Security Strategy, released on December 5, in particular says that Europe "will be unrecognizable in 20 years or less" as it is on the verge of "civilizational erasure" due to low fertility, massive immigration, regulatory paralysis, and the loss of cultural identity. According to the document, some of the European countries don't have the economic and military potential to remain reliable allies for Washington.

Food prices in Finland have already climbed by as much as 25 percent in recent years, and now the government is proposing to limit the dominance of supermarket private labels like Pirkka and Xtra, which offer budget-friendly alternatives.
The aim is to strengthen farmers' bargaining power in a highly concentrated retail market. But critics warn the move could push prices even higher and shrink affordable options at a time when many households are already struggling.
In this episode of the All Points North podcast, we step inside Finland's only corn tortilla factory to explore how products win shelf space — and unpack the bigger political and economic stakes behind the humble store brand.
With consumers, farmers and retailers all feeling the pressure, will limiting supermarket power protect producers, or punish shoppers?

Israeli forces attack journalists covering illegal settler attacks in occupied West Bank

Israeli forces fired at an Al Jazeera news crew on Friday as it covered an illegal settler attack in the town of Talfit, south of Nablus in the occupied West Bank, the broadcaster said.
The Qatar-based channel reported that soldiers shot towards its team, causing partial damage to camera equipment.
Al Jazeera correspondent Tharwat Shaqra said in a live broadcast that troops used live ammunition against the crew before firing a tear gas canister that directly struck and damaged filming gear.
She said the journalists were positioned in a clearly visible, open area and were targeted without being asked to leave the location.
The Israeli forces did not immediately comment on the incident.
Israel closed Al Jazeera’s operations inside Israel on May 5, 2024, and shut its offices in the occupied West Bank on September 22, 2024, with the closure order repeatedly extended.
On December 23, 2025, Israeli Communications Minister Shlomo Karhi said the channel would be barred from operating “forever”.
Illegal settler attacks
Twenty-five Palestinians were wounded after illegal settlers, under the protection of Israeli forces, stormed the village of Talfit south of Nablus in the occupied West Bank, according to a local official.
Mahmoud Abu Aisha, head of the village council, told Anadolu that the settlers carried out a coordinated assault on residents and property, while Israeli troops fired tear gas towards villagers.
He said 15 people suffered suffocation from tear gas, one was wounded by live fire, and nine others were beaten during the attack.
The illegal settlers also smashed the windows of 10 vehicles and damaged four homes, disrupted an electricity transformer and fired live ammunition towards a mosque in the village, Abu Aisha added.
Earlier, the Palestinian Red Crescent reported an initial toll of three injuries, including a man shot in the thigh and two others assaulted.
The official Palestinian news agency Wafa said illegal settlers attacked residents and opened fire, while Israeli forces provided cover and used live ammunition, stun grenades and tear gas against civilians and their homes.
Illegal settlers also stormed the Ras al-Ain area in the nearby town of Qusra, where a new settlement outpost has recently been established, attacking residents under military protection, Wafa reported.
According to the Palestinian Commission for Resistance of the Wall and Settlements, illegal settlers carried out 468 attacks across the occupied West Bank in January, including physical assaults, arson, property damage and restrictions on farmers’ access to their land.
Israel has intensified operations in the occupied West Bank, including East Jerusalem, since October 8, 2023. Palestinians view the escalation, including killings, arrests, displacement and illegal settlement expansion, as a step towards the formal annexation of the territory.
At least 1,112 Palestinians have been killed and about 11,500 injured in the occupied West Bank during that period, and more than 21,000 people have been arrested.
In a landmark opinion in July 2024, the International Court of Justice declared Israel’s occupation of Palestinian territory illegal and called for the evacuation of all settlements in the occupied West Bank and East Jerusalem.

Zelensky names Ukrainian delegation for trilateral talks in Geneva
Ukrainian National Security and Defense Council Secretary Rustem Umerov announced this on Facebook, according to Ukrinform.
"On February 17-18, the next round of trilateral negotiations between Ukraine, the United States, and Russia is scheduled to take place in Geneva. The Ukrainian delegation has already begun preparations for this meeting," Umerov said.
According to him, President Volodymyr Zelensky has determined the preliminary composition of the negotiating group.
"Along with me, the delegation will include Kyrylo Budanov, Andriy Hnatov, Davyd Arakhamia, Sergiy Kyslytsya, and Vadym Skibitskyi," Umerov said.
He stressed that the team had been formed to reflect the military, political, and security dimensions of the process.
"We will work on substantive decisions within the framework defined by the Head of State. The goal remains unchanged – a sustainable and lasting peace. We are preparing for serious and responsible work," Umerov said.

Five more Ukrainian children abducted by Russia have been brought back home – photo
Five more Ukrainian children have been brought back to Ukraine under Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy's Bring Kids Back UA initiative after Russia's illegal deportation or forcible transfer.
Source: Bring Kids Back UA
Details: Three of the children, aged 4, 6 and 7, were residents of an orphanage in Kherson Oblast.
In autumn 2022, during the temporary occupation of Kherson, Russian troops removed them from the institution despite staff's attempts to hide the children. They were later forcibly transferred to Russian-occupied Crimea and placed in the Simferopol orphanage Yalynka.
Maksym Maksymov, the head of the Bring Kids Back UA initiative, thanked international partners who helped secure the children's return and US First Lady Melania Trump for supporting these humanitarian efforts.
The initiative also stressed that under international law, Russia must bring back Ukrainian children who were illegally deported or forcibly transferred from Ukraine, and that there will not be "exchanges" of children.
For reference: Bring Kids Back UA is an initiative by the president of Ukraine which coordinates the work of state bodies, civil society organisations and international partners to find and bring back Ukrainian children. Since the start of the full-scale invasion, 1,990 children have been brought back to Ukraine.
Previously: On 12 February, the White House reported that US First Lady Melania Trump assisted in bringing back kidnapped Ukrainian children to their families for the third time.
Background:
- In August, Melania Trump raised the issue of Ukrainian children in Russia in a personal letter to Kremlin leader Vladimir Putin. US President Donald Trump had personally delivered the letter to Putin during their talks in Alaska.
- Afterwards, the US first lady said she has an "open channel of communication" with Putin regarding the return of abducted Ukrainian children.
- On 4 December, US First Lady Melania Trump said that seven abducted Ukrainian children were brought back to their families thanks to "bridge-building" by Ukraine and Russia.
- It was due to the forcible transfer of children from occupied areas of Ukraine that the International Criminal Court issued an arrest warrant for Putin in 2023.

Bulgaria’s parliament has approved an agreement with North Macedonia to build and operate a cross-border railway tunnel connecting the two countries. Lawmakers passed the deal in both the first and second readings during a single parliamentary session.
The agreement, signed on 6 November, marks the culmination of years of Bulgarian efforts to link Sofia and Skopje by rail. According to the explanatory memorandum accompanying the draft law, the project is a key step toward integrating the two countries’ rail networks and completing the missing segment of Pan-European Transport Corridor VIII.
Outgoing Deputy Prime Minister and Transport Minister Grozdan Karadjov noted that the unfinished stretch on Bulgarian soil measures 2.4 kilometers, running from Gyueshevo station to Deve Bair. The construction of this long-delayed section will resume more than eight decades after initial work first began.

Sweden has provided JAS 39 Gripen fighter jets to participate in NATO’s Arctic Sentry military operation.
This was reported by the press service of the Swedish Ministry of Defence.
The NATO military mission aims to strengthen security in the Arctic and the Far North.
As part of this mission, Sweden is deploying its JAS 39 Gripen fighter jets to patrol areas around Iceland and Greenland.
“As Russia arms itself and cooperation between Russia and China deepens, the Alliance must strengthen its presence and raise awareness of the situation in the Arctic. We are providing expertise, capabilities, and resources to strengthen deterrence and protect critical infrastructure,” said Swedish Defence Minister Påul Jonsson.
The day before, NATO launched the Arctic Sentry military mission to strengthen its presence in the Arctic as part of its commitments to US President Donald Trump, who emphasized the vulnerability of the region, particularly Greenland.
The mission will coordinate the growing military presence of NATO’s European allies in the region, including military exercises such as Denmark’s Arctic Resilience in Greenland operation.
Germany will also join the NATO Arctic Sentry mission by sending four Eurofighter Typhoon fighter jets.
The German fighter jets will be based in Iceland. The main tasks of the air group will be air patrols and air combat training.
Earlier, British Defence Minister John Gilli said that the British armed forces would play a vital role in NATO’s Arctic Sentry mission.
In January, European NATO member countries announced that they would send their troops to Greenland to plan the upcoming military mission.
At that time, the Greenlandic government stated that it would intensify its efforts to ensure the defense of the Arctic territory under NATO’s auspices and again rejected US President Donald Trump’s statements about the possible establishment of control over the island.

MUNICH, February 13. /TASS/. Germany has spent 55 billion euro on military aid to Ukraine since 2022, Foreign Minister Johann Wadephul said.
"We are Ukraine’s biggest sponsor. A total of 55 billion euro have been allocated to military aid only since 2022," he said ahead of a meeting of the Transatlantic Forum hosted by Germany’s Christian Social Union (CSU) party in Munich.
The Institute for the World Economy (IfW Kiel) said earlier that Europe had increased military support for Kiev in 2025 by 67% compared to averages from 2022-2024, while humanitarian and financial support from the European Union was up by 59%. The bulk of financial and humanitarian support is provided to Ukraine via EU institutes and mechanisms, whereas military assistance originates from a small number of countries, primarily in Western and Northern Europe, such as Germany and the United Kingdom.
In 2026, Germany has allocated a total of 11.5 billion euro to help Ukraine's war effort.

The offer initially applies to easyJet, airport spokeswoman Manuela Witzig told the Swiss News Agency Keystone-SDA. Wizz Air would soon follow, she said.
As of now, 24 check-in kiosks and 14 self-bag drop machines are available in Halls 2 and 4, according to the press release. The modernised Hall 3 will also be equipped with the new machines from May. For the time being, nothing will change in Hall 1, said Witzig.
+ Why Bern Airport struggles to take off
In future, travellers will be able to make their own way to the check-in kiosk, print out their boarding pass and baggage tag there and then check in their baggage at the drop point, according to the airport. The airport hopes that this will reduce waiting times, simplify processes and increase travelling comfort.
The overall coordination of check-in will continue to be handled by ground services provider Swissport, according to the press release. Swissport is supporting the changeover together with EuroAirport Basel-Mulhouse.

Authorities in Bulgaria Urged to Prevent Neo-Nazi Commemoration in Sofia

Authorities in Bulgaria Urged to Prevent Neo-Nazi Commemoration in Sofia
Bulgaria’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs has strongly condemned the planned “Lukov March,” urging all responsible authorities to take full legal measures to prevent it. The ministry emphasized that events glorifying Hristo Lukov, the fascist leader of the pro-Nazi Union of Bulgarian Legions during World War II, are incompatible with the country’s values and traditions and should not be allowed to take place on Bulgarian soil. Officials highlighted that such gatherings promote extremism, intolerance, discrimination, and hatred, while unfairly casting Bulgaria in a negative light and overshadowing its achievements in human rights.
The “Lukov March” is an annual torchlight procession through Sofia, held near February 13, the anniversary of Lukov’s assassination. Over the years, the event has drawn neo-Nazis from abroad, with organizers portraying Lukov as a “patriotic hero.” Despite claims that he was not antisemitic because “Jews were among his best friends,” Lukov led an organization with openly antisemitic positions. The Foreign Ministry questioned the rationale for honoring him over other Bulgarian military figures of the 20th century.
In its statement, the MFA reiterated its commitment to countering division and intolerance within Bulgarian society and to safeguarding the country’s international reputation. The ministry pledged continued active participation alongside other institutions in efforts to combat hatred, discrimination, and antisemitism.
The US embassy also issued guidance regarding the march, noting it would take place on February 14 from 5 p.m. to 9 p.m., moving from the pylons near the National Palace of Culture to Lukov’s former residence on Trakia Street in central Sofia. Counter-protests are expected along the route. The embassy described the event as commemorative of Nazi ideology with antisemitic overtones and advised the public to avoid the area, remain cautious near large gatherings, follow local media for updates, maintain a low profile, and notify family or friends of their safety.
Some historians argue that Lukov’s legacy is more complex than the neo-Nazi narrative suggests, noting his role in the Bulgarian military and nationalist movements during a turbulent period. They contend that while his organization held antisemitic views, some of his actions focused on defending Bulgaria’s territorial interests rather than explicitly promoting racial ideology.

These weapons are capable of hitting targets 100 to 300 kilometers behind the front line.
Using these drones, operators of the 1st Separate Center of the Unmanned Systems Forces struck:
Each of the targeted facilities supports the invaders’ energy, aviation, or communications resilience.
“Systematic strikes on such infrastructure disrupt command and logistics, reducing the Russian army’s ability to sustain combat operations,” the Unmanned Systems Forces reported.
Yesterday Ukrainian Deep Strike category drones traveled more than 1,700 kilometers and hit an oil refinery in Ukhta.

The Kremlin has confirmed that the next round of peace talks aimed at ending the war in Ukraine will take place on February 17–18 in Geneva, Switzerland. Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said that Russia’s delegation will be led by President Vladimir Putin’s aide Vladimir Medinsky. Specific details on the schedule and agenda remain limited, but further information is expected from Moscow in the coming days.
Earlier, Peskov had indicated that talks between Russia and Ukraine were imminent, without providing specifics. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said that Ukraine is ready to meet with the Russian delegation but emphasized that Moscow has not yet given clear responses regarding the proposals for next week. Zelenskyy also criticized recent Russian rhetoric involving the potential use of Oreshnik ballistic missiles, saying such statements are not consistent with peace efforts.
This upcoming meeting follows the trilateral talks held in Abu Dhabi on February 4–5, where representatives from the US, Ukraine, and Russia discussed ways to implement a ceasefire and monitor the cessation of hostilities. Following Abu Dhabi, the US and Russia agreed to resume high-level military dialogue. Previously, Zelenskyy had indicated that the talks might take place in the United States on February 17 or 18, but Russia had not confirmed that location until now.

Syria transition gains ground with Kurdish deal, but violence and humanitarian strain persist
Syria’s fragile political transition has gained fresh momentum with a landmark agreement between Damascus and Kurdish authorities in the northeast, but renewed violence in the south, Israeli incursions and deep humanitarian needs underscore how precarious the path to stability remains, senior UN officials told the Security Council on Friday.
Briefing ambassadors for the first time as Deputy Special Envoy, Claudio Cordone pointed to the 30 January ceasefire and integration agreement between the Syrian Government and the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) as a potentially transformative development.
The deal provides for a phased military and administrative integration of northeast Syria and includes provisions on the return of displaced people and the protection of Kurdish civil and educational rights, building on Presidential Decree 13 on linguistic, cultural and citizenship rights.
“Hostilities have ended and work on an implementation plan has been progressing in a positive manner,” Mr. Cordone said, noting deployments of Ministry of Interior forces in Al-Hasakeh and Qamishli, and discussions on local governance and political appointments.
The Secretary-General on 30 January welcomed the agreement, appealing for all sides “to work swiftly to ensure its implementation, especially in terms of the peaceful integration of northeast Syria, the rights of Syrian Kurds, the safe, dignified and voluntary return of the displaced.”
In a presidential statement issued on Thursday, Council members likewise welcomed the “comprehensive agreement” and stressed the need to adhere to it to “minimize civilian suffering” and prevent any “security vacuum” around ISIL (Da’esh) detention facilities.
What is the UN doing in Syria now?
The UN is supporting Syria’s political transition while continuing large-scale humanitarian operations across the country.
The Office of the Special Envoy is engaging with the Government and a broad range of stakeholders to help advance the political process, including implementation of the recent agreement on northeast Syria, support for inclusive governance, and the protection and promotion of human rights.
At the same time, humanitarian agencies are delivering life-saving assistance to millions of Syrians.
UN teams and partners are providing food, water, medical supplies, shelter and protection services, while supporting mine action, restoring basic services and helping create conditions for safe, dignified and voluntary returns.
Visit the UN News Focus on Syria section to read more about UN’s work in and engagement with Syria.
Situation remains sensitive
The evolving situation around those facilities remains sensitive.
Mr. Cordone said the UN is closely following transfers of Syrian and non-Syrian Da’esh suspects to Iraq, adding that Iraqi proceedings must “fully respect fair trial standards” and urging Member States to repatriate their nationals “as swiftly as possible.”
While the northeast has seen relative stabilization, tensions persist elsewhere.
In Sweida, renewed clashes between Government forces and local armed groups have caused damage and electricity outages. Protests calling for self-determination have resurfaced, and the UN reiterated calls for confidence-building measures within “the full respect of Syria’s sovereignty and territorial integrity.”
In southern Syria, Israeli incursions and search operations have continued, alongside reports of aerial herbicide spraying damaging crops. The UN envoy called for “full respect for international law” and urged Israel to withdraw from areas it occupies “in violation of the 1974 Disengagement of Forces Agreement,” while supporting “mutually acceptable security arrangements between Israel and Syria.”
Humanitarian challenges persist
Humanitarian conditions remain severe despite modest improvements.
Lisa Doughten, Director of Financing at the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA), said recent clashes displaced tens of thousands; although many have returned, about 130,000 people remain uprooted across Al-Hasakeh, Ar-Raqqa and Aleppo governorates. More than 90 per cent are women and girls, with many sheltering in overcrowded camps or with host families already under strain.
Heavy flooding this week in Idleb and northern Latakia killed two children and damaged or destroyed some 2,000 tents, affecting over 5,000 displaced people.
Still, access and basic services are gradually improving in parts of the northeast. UN teams have reached 200,000 people and organized more than 170 truck movements. In Ain al-Arab (Kobane), electricity supply has reportedly resumed after repairs.
Meaningful representation of all Syrians crucial
Politically, the next milestone in the transition is the formation of the People’s Assembly. Voting for most elected seats took place in October 2025 – with additional seats, including in Raqqa, due to be filled. Confirmation is awaited on the appointment of 70 members by President Ahmed al-Sharaa, as well as of the date of the opening session.
Mr. Cordone reiterated the importance of meaningful representation of Syria’s regions and diverse groups, stressing that “the protection and promotion of human rights – including addressing the issue of the missing and transitional justice – are fundamental elements for a credible and successful political transition.”
‘Extraordinary role’ of Syrian women
He highlighted the “extraordinary role” of Syrian women and civil society over the decade-long conflict, saying women’s political participation at all levels is “a pillar for a state committed to plurality, inclusion and opportunity for all.”
“I salute the Syrian people for their determination in overcoming decades of oppression and brutal conflict. I look forward to strengthening the UN’s partnership with Syria in pursuit of a stable, peaceful and prosperous future,” he said in Arabic as he concluded his briefing.

Gaza: Lifesaving aid operations continue despite restrictions
Humanitarians in the Gaza Strip continue to face impediments in their efforts to deliver lifesaving aid to the population.
The United Nations said that its teams attempted to coordinate eight humanitarian missions on Friday and five were fully facilitated.
The remaining three – which included a mission to reach a water treatment plant in Khan Younis – were denied by Israel.
Saving lives, beating famine
The successful missions collected food and medical supplies from the Kerem Shalom/Karem Abu Salem crossing. Teams also monitored humanitarian cargo at the Kissufim and Kerem Shalom loading platforms.
Speaking in New York, UN Spokesperson Stéphane Dujarric noted that four months have passed since the ceasefire agreement came into effect in Gaza, and the humanitarian scale-up has saved countless lives and pushed back famine.
Yet many people are still “living in extremely harsh conditions, and the humanitarian response continues to face significant obstacles, especially to the entry of goods and the ability of humanitarian partners to operate,” he added.
Durable housing solutions needed
Almost 1.5 million people – or two in three Palestinians in Gaza – are staying in 1,000 displacement sites across the Strip and in tents.
Hundreds of families also have sheltered in damaged buildings, which are at risk of collapse.
Humanitarians continue to provide the population with tents, tarpaulins, mattresses, clothes and other items – reaching more than 85,000 families alone in January.
“But these items offer limited protection and their lifespan is short,” Mr. Dujarric said.
“To provide more durable solutions, restrictions on the entry of essential construction materials and equipment must be lifted.”

Madagascar: ‘Overwhelming’ destruction, surging needs after back-to-back cyclones – WFP
Some 10 days after Tropical Cyclone Fytia brought heavy rains and flooding to Madagascar, Cyclone Gezani has left the island’s main port in ruins, the UN World Food Programme (WFP) said on Friday.
Speaking to reporters from Madagascar’s capital Antananarivo, WFP Country Director Tania Goossens said some 400,000 people are facing acute humanitarian needs after the island was hit by back-to-back cyclones in the space of three weeks.
Ms. Goossens recently returned from a mission to the port city Toamasina (also known as Tamatave), the country’s second largest urban centre, where Gezani made landfall on Tuesday evening with wind gusts of up to 250 kilometres per hour.
“The scale of the destruction is really overwhelming,” Ms. Goossens insisted.
Nearly 40 deaths
She said that according to the authorities, 80 per cent of the city has suffered damage and that it is “running on roughly five per cent electricity at the moment.”
“There's no water and one of WFP’s warehouses and our office was also completely destroyed during the cyclone,” she added.
Assessments are ongoing but to date the authorities report 38 deaths and 374 people injured.
Families left with nothing
The UN food agency official said that many families have left their homes and that there was “severe” damage to buildings, businesses, schools and the city’s hospital.
“During my visit, I saw families trying to recover the little that was left of their home,” she recounted. “Many are spending the night in homes where the roofs have been torn off.”
Uprooted trees and debris across the city are blocking streets, Ms. Goossens said, and fuel is difficult to come by.
“Families are telling us that they have lost everything,” she stressed. “Many are sheltering in damaged homes or temporary sites and uncertain about how they can access their next meal.”
Rising needs
In addition to the urgent need for food Ms. Goossens highlighted humanitarians’ concerns about water, sanitation and hygiene conditions, as a lack of clean water and damaged infrastructure raise the risk of disease outbreaks.
She also mentioned “rising protection concerns for vulnerable groups” such as women, children, the elderly and persons with disabilities.
Mobilising support
In anticipation of the shock WFP and partners have been providing cash assistance to the most vulnerable households allowing them to purchase some food and better prepare before the storm struck.
The UN food agency is now mobilising its “last food stocks,” which will be distributed in coordination with national disaster relief teams, Ms. Goossens explained.
However, the needs on the ground exceed WFP’s capacity and the agency is calling for urgent donor support.
The latest disaster “comes on top of an already very critical food security situation,” Ms. Goossens said, as already before the back-to-back cyclones 1.57 million people across the country were food insecure, including 84,000 facing emergency levels of hunger, according to the latest data from the IPC, a UN-backed global food security monitoring system.
“We're also in the peak of the lean season here in Madagascar and funding shortfalls remain alarming… Our lean season response as well as cyclone response faces a $18 million gap over the next six months,” the WFP official warned.
“We will need… sustained support over the coming months to help people recover, to rebuild and strengthen their resilience against further shocks,” she added. “In fact, we are in at the start of the cyclone season. So, we are also concerned that this is only just the beginning.”

‘Like a scene out of a horror movie’: UN report warns of war crimes in Sudan’s El Fasher

‘Like a scene out of a horror movie’: UN report warns of war crimes in Sudan’s El Fasher
Paramilitary forces in Sudan unleashed “a wave of intense violence…shocking in its scale and brutality” during their final offensive to capture the besieged city of El Fasher last October, committing atrocities that amount to war crimes and possible crimes against humanity, according to a report released on Friday by the UN human rights office, OHCHR.
“Persistent impunity fuels continued cycles of violence,” said UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Volker Türk, calling for credible investigations and accountability for perpetrators.
Sudan's national army and the Rapid Support Forces (RSF) militia have been fighting each other for control of the country for almost three years. The new report details widespread atrocities committed during the RSF assault on the besieged city of El Fasher in North Darfur.
The RSF and allied Arab militia carried out mass killings and summary executions, sexual violence, abductions for ransom, torture and ill-treatment, detention, disappearances, pillage and the use of children in hostilities. Many attacks were directed against civilians and persons hors de combat based on ethnicity or perceived affiliation.
Documented atrocities
Based on hundreds of interviews with victims and witnesses in late 2025, OHCHR documented more than 6,000 killings in the first three days of the RSF offensive. The report however warns the overall death toll during the weeks-long offensive is “undoubtedly significantly higher”.
The report revealed that in one incident around 500 people were killed when RSF fighters opened fire using heavy weapons on a crowd of 1,000 sheltering at Al-Rashid dormitory in El Fasher University on 26 October. One of the witnesses reported seeing bodies thrown into the air “like a scene out of a horror movie”.
RSF fighters also carried out summary executions within El Fasher of civilians, targeting young boys and men under 50, accused of “collaboration” with the Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF) and Joint Forces, often determined on the basis of their non-Arab ethnicity, such as the Zaghawa community.
Survivors and witnesses recounted patterns of rape and gang rape, abductions for ransom using sexual violence, and sexual assault during invasive body searches, with women and girls from the Zaghawa and other non-Arab communities at particular risk.
Possible crimes against humanity
According to the report, the violations at El Fasher mirror other RSF offensives during the war, such as at the Zamzam camp in April 2025. The “organized and sustained course of conduct” suggested a systematic attack against the civilian population in the Darfur region.
“The acts of violence knowingly committed as part of such an attack would amount to crimes against humanity”, OHCHR said.
Calls for justice
Mr. Türk urged parties to the conflict to end violations by forces under their command and called on States with influence to help prevent further atrocities, including by respecting the arms embargo and halting the supply of weapons.
He called on States to do everything possible to support local, regional, and international mediation efforts, to achieve a cessation of hostilities and a pathway towards inclusive civilian governance.
“In a protection crisis of this scale, human rights must remain central to efforts to achieve a durable resolution of the conflict,” he said.

World News in Brief: Deadly strikes in Sudan, health systems in South Sudan near the brink, Guterres calls for unity ahead of Ramadan.

World News in Brief: Deadly strikes in Sudan, health systems in South Sudan near the brink, Guterres calls for unity ahead of Ramadan.
A sharp increase in drone attacks across the Kordofan region in the centre of Sudan is endangering civilians and damaging critical infrastructure.
Over the past week, North Kordofan state recorded more than a dozen attacks in and around the towns of El Obeid, Bara, Rahad and Um Rawaba.
In South Kordofan, suspected drone strikes hit health facilities in the state capital, Kadugli, and in Kuweik town, reportedly killing four medical workers, injuring more than 20 people.
Concerns over the conflict continue to deepen after a report today from the UN Human Rights Office revealed the “sustained” and “systematic attacks” to civilians in the neighbouring Darfur region in late 2025 that may “amount to crimes against humanity”.
Growing humanitarian concerns
“The violence is triggering a new wave of displacement, with reports of many fleeing homes, in need food, health care and protection,” warned the Spokesperson for the Secretary-General Stéphane Dujarric on Friday.
While the humanitarian situation in Dilling and Kadugli continues to deteriorate, he emphasised that “rapid, safe, unhindered and sustained humanitarian access is essential for us to scale up our response.”
Commercial vehicles, telecommunications infrastructure and key transport routes have been affected the drone strikes, disrupting humanitarian movements and supply chains.
Mr. Dujarric called for “the protection of humanitarian infrastructure, in line with international humanitarian law” and urged for more funding through UN aid coordination office OCHA to support displaced families across Sudan.
Violence pushes South Sudan’s health system to the brink
Since late December 2025, a devasting escalation of violence has swept across northern and central parts of South Sudan, the UN children's agency (UNICEF) said on Friday.
In Jonglei state alone, at least 280,000 people have been displaced – the majority being women and children.
“They fled with nothing. They are sleeping in displacement camps left over from the not-so-distant civil war – camps where there are barely any services. Others are out in the open, in remote locations, with nothing at all,” said UNICEF’s representative in South Sudan, Obia Acheng.
Children were believed to make up 53 percent of those displaced.
“These children face killing and maiming. Recruitment into armed groups. Separation from their families. Gender-based violence. And profound psychological distress that will mark them for years,” Mr. Acheng emphasised.
Delivering for children
South Sudan’s health system is on the verge of collapse, with 11 health facilities attacked or looted since fighting intensified and many nutrition centres forced to close, UNICEF said.
Cholera cases have surged to 479 nationwide, with treatment centres overwhelmed and resources running low.
Around 825,000 children across Jonglei, Unity, and Eastern Equatoria states are now at risk of acute malnutrition — conditions that make children 12 times more likely to die without treatment.
Pregnant and nursing mothers are increasingly cut off from care, and humanitarian infrastructure is under assault.
Despite these grim numbers, UNICEF continues to run primary healthcare, nutrition, water and sanitation, and child protection programmes across the country.
The UN Security Council also issued a statement expressing grave concern about the escalating violence in Jonglei, Eastern Equatoria, and throughout South Sudan.
Members strongly called on all parties to de-escalate and immediately cease renewed hostilities and to resolve issues through peaceful dialogue.
UN chief calls for unity and compassion ahead of Ramadan
UN Secretary-General António Guterres has urged people worldwide to embrace the spirit of peace, compassion and solidarity as Muslims prepare to observe the holy month of Ramadan.
“For Muslims around the world, the holy month of Ramadan is a sacred period of reflection and prayer. Ramadan also represents a noble vision of hope and peace.” Mr. Guterres said in a message ahead of the start on Tuesday.
He noted, however, that for many — from Afghanistan to Yemen, Gaza, and Sudan — this vision of hope and unity remained distant amid conflict, hunger, and displacement.
The UN chief called on the global community to bridge divides, deliver aid to those in need, and uphold human rights and dignity for all.
“May this Holy Month inspire us to work as one to build a more peaceful, generous and just world for all people,” he said.

The components of Ukraine’s domestically developed Shershen surface-to-air missile system (SAM) have already been completed and tested with five different types of missiles.
This was stated by NAUDI Director Serhii Honcharov in a comment to Militarnyi at the World Defense Show 2026 defense exhibition.
In particular, in an official video released yesterday, February 12, 2025, the National Association of Defense Industries of Ukraine (NAUDI) demonstrated the system’s launcher and radar.
The radar unit for the system was displayed as a model at the Association’s booth, allowing it to be compared with the version shown in the released video, which is mounted on a mast rather than in a container.
As a reminder, in a comment to Militarnyi, NAUDI Director Serhii Honcharov spoke about the possibility of integrating virtually any radar into the system if required:
“A radar can be adapted to the system according to the customer’s requirements. There is no strict requirement that it must only be Thales, or only HENSOLDT, or Teledyne, Girafe, or any other specific radar. All of this can be adapted, and the control system is very flexible and at least three times cheaper than global counterparts,” Serhii Honcharov said regarding the integration of different radars into the system.
Therefore, this antenna unit was likely developed and tested as one of the configuration options for the air defense system.
As we previously reported, the Shershen surface-to-air missile system has already been tested with five types of missiles. These include both Soviet-era missiles and foreign-made ones, as well as promising Ukrainian-developed designs.
“Why five? Because we have test-fired five. If other types are needed for implementation, the necessary work will be carried out to adapt them, and they can also be used with this system,” said NAUDI Director Serhii Honcharov.
The photo of the launcher shows two R-27 missiles equipped with infrared homing systems, one of which has its protective cap removed. The image was likely taken during one of the testing stages of the system.
The demonstration mock-up, meanwhile, displayed a possible configuration carrying three R-27 missiles of an unspecified version (the missile exists in both the infrared-guided ‘T’ variant and the radar-guided ‘R’ variant).
Depending on the version of the R-27 missile, its engagement range in an air launch varies. This likewise affects its range when launched from a ground-based launcher.

Bulgarian drone developer Dronamics has unveiled a new defense platform built around its cargo drone, the Black Swan, aiming to fill a major gap in European airspace security. The initiative, announced on Thursday, focuses on continuous airborne early warning and target acquisition to detect potential threats and ensure control over strategic regions.
For this first defense application, Dronamics is partnering with German defense electronics firm HENSOLDT, a global leader in sensor technology. The collaboration produces a fully European Airborne Early Warning (AEW) system that merges the Black Swan’s endurance, payload, and range with HENSOLDT’s advanced MissionGrid suite, which includes the MissMarvin mission management software and PrecISR synthetic aperture radar (SAR). The integration allows detection and targeting of airborne, land, and maritime threats, making the drone one of the most capable European Class III unmanned aerial systems.
The joint solution addresses critical gaps in national and regional airspace coverage, strengthening both defense and civil protection capabilities. Demonstrations are scheduled for later this year, with deployments planned for Europe’s Eastern Flank, the Mediterranean, and the Atlantic. The Black Swan’s long-range capabilities and ability to carry heavy payloads make it highly versatile for integrating multiple intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance systems.
The transformation of the Black Swan from a cargo-focused aircraft into a multifunctional defense platform highlights Dronamics’ strategic pivot into military applications. The drone can remain airborne for over 24 hours, operate from short or unpaved runways, and perform multiple missions simultaneously, reducing the need for human intervention through MissMarvin’s autonomous control.
The company traces its roots to 2013, when brothers Konstantin and Svilen Rangelov conceived the idea of building drones for rapid delivery across Europe. Initially focused on commercial cargo transport, Dronamics developed a flexible open-architecture design, allowing the platform to be adapted for reconnaissance, border surveillance, or targeting roles depending on operational requirements.
Against the backdrop of Europe’s push to strengthen its defense sector and ongoing regional conflicts, Dronamics has deliberately entered the military space. The Black Swan’s combat-ready version will be demonstrated later this year, marking the company’s entry into “software-defined defense,” a concept emphasizing adaptable platforms over purely hardware-driven capabilities.

The Republic of Niger Announces Mobilization to “Prepare for War with France”

The Republic of Niger has announced a mobilization to prepare for entering what it called a ‘war with France.’
The statement was made by General Amadou Abdramane, Chief of Staff to the country’s leader Abdourahamane Tchiani, during a rally, according to Le Figaro.
“Understand this: we are going to war with France. We were not at war before, but now we are going to war,” he said.
The decree on general mobilization in the Republic of Niger was adopted at a meeting of the Council of Ministers chaired by Tchiani at the end of December last year, according to the pro-government outlet Lesahel.
According to General Ibro, the mobilization was declared to confront France.
The Republic of Niger regularly accuses France of attempting to destabilize the country.
Tchiani has also accused French President Emmanuel Macron, as well as the leaders of Benin and Côte d’Ivoire – Patrice Talon and Alassane Ouattara – of supporting Islamist terrorist groups.
According to him, these countries were behind the attack on Niamey Airport at the end of January 2026.
The spokesperson for the French Armed Forces General Staff, Colonel Guillaume Vernet, said that “there can be no question of French involvement in the Republic of Niger.”
He described Ibro’s statements as ‘information warfare’ launched by the Nigerien side.
Niger was a French colony until 1960. Relations between the two countries deteriorated after the military coup in July 2023, shifting from close partnership to open hostility.
The new authorities in the Republic of Niger demanded the withdrawal of French troops and the ambassador, accusing Paris of neocolonialism. This led to the suspension of military cooperation and a rollback of French influence in the country.

Russia Attacks Odesa with New Version of Garpiya-A1 Drones

19:39:53 KST

Tonight, Russian forces attacked Odesa using a new version of the Garpiya-A1 strike drones, which feature improved protection against electronic warfare systems.
An analyst from the Colonel GSh Telegram channel, who studied the drone’s wreckage, reported on this.
The updated version carries the ‘KK’ series designation – markings found on the debris of the drones used in the attack on the Ukrainian city.
The Garpiya-A1 is a version of Shahed-type kamikaze drones manufactured by the Russian company Izhevsk Electromechanical Plant ‘Kupol.’
The new drones have begun using a 16-element Kometa-M16 CRPA antenna, which is designed for satellite navigation in conditions where electronic warfare systems are active. The previous ‘KT’ series was equipped with a Kometa-M12 CRPA antenna.
A CRPA antenna is a specialized navigation antenna capable of providing precise drone positioning even under active radio interference.
The Kometa receiver is designed to protect navigation signals from intentional and unintentional interference and to stabilize signals from satellite navigation systems.
Such antennas detect false electronic signals and help filter them out.
As a result, electronic warfare systems have less impact on the drone’s navigation, allowing it to reach its target with greater accuracy.
The numbers M12 or M16 indicate the number of installed channels, which increase resistance to electronic warfare interference.
As a result of the use of these drones on February 13 in Odesa, civilian, port, and energy infrastructure was damaged. In addition, one person was killed in the Russian attack.
In particular, warehouses storing mineral fertilizers at the local port were severely damaged. As a result of the strikes, fires broke out: four passenger cars and several freight railcars caught fire.

19:18:06 KST

The UK Ministry of Defence has announced that it will soon provide Ukraine with an additional 1,000 Lightweight Multirole Missiles (LMM).
The announcement was published on the social media platform X (formerly Twitter).
Ukraine’s Minister of Defence, Mykhailo Fedorov, stated that the urgent air defense assistance from the United Kingdom will total more than £500 million.
The LMM (Lightweight Multirole Missile) is a lightweight, multirole missile designed for both air-to-air and air-to-ground missions, developed by the British company Thales.
It is intended to engage aerial targets and, when necessary, armored vehicles.
The missile is 1.3 meters long, has a diameter of 76 mm, and weighs approximately 13 kg. It is equipped with either a high-explosive fragmentation warhead or a tandem shaped-charge warhead.
Its engagement range is up to 8 km when launched from an aerial platform and up to 6 km when launched from land or sea platforms.
The missile’s speed exceeds Mach 1.5. The guidance system varies by version: laser guidance in Version A, an infrared seeker in Versions B and C, and inertial guidance with GPS in Version D.
Its modular design allows the LMM to be adapted for different combat missions and platforms, including unmanned aerial vehicles (drones).
It can be launched from helicopters, light armored vehicles, ships, and ground-based launchers.
The missile is used in the man-portable air defense system Martlet and the mobile Stormer system, both of which have been in service with the Ukrainian Defense Forces for several years.
Militarnyi previously reported that the United Kingdom would allocate $205 million for weapons for Ukraine.

19:02:10 KST

The Czech defense holding Czechoslovak Group (CSG) has successfully completed the transfer of artillery ammunition production technology to the Ukrainian company Ukrainian Armor.
In an interview with Forbes, Jan Hamáček, Director for Strategic Projects at CSG’s Brussels office, said that the technology handover phase has been finalized. Ukrainian Armor shared the information on its Facebook page.
The two sides have also completed preparations of production sites in Ukraine, where various types of NATO-standard 155 mm artillery shells will be manufactured locally.
According to Jan Hamáček, Ukraine now has the necessary engineering solutions and production capacity in place to begin serial manufacturing.
It was previously reported that in 2025, Ukrainian Armor launched serial production of the NATO-standard 155 mm M107 artillery round. This type of ammunition has already completed the required codification procedure.
The codification process is currently underway for another type of 155 mm ammunition – the L15. This modification features a more powerful propellant charge, improving firing performance.
Meanwhile, specialists are testing long-range versions of the ammunition. These include 155 mm Boat Tail shells, capable of striking targets at distances of 30–40 km, and Base Bleed shells with a range of 40–43 km.
Boat tail refers to a specific shape of the rear section of an artillery shell or bullet that tapers toward the end.
The main purpose of this design is to improve the projectile’s aerodynamic performance during flight.
Base bleed is a technology used to extend the range of an artillery shell by means of a special gas generator installed in its rear section.
The CEO of Ukrainian Armor, Vladyslav Belbas, noted that the partnership with Czechoslovak Group helps address the issue of resource shortages. Unlike many other manufacturers, the company’s supplies are secured by the availability of propellant charges.
Propellant charges remain the most critical scarce component in the global production of artillery rounds. Thanks to its Czech partners, the Ukrainian enterprise is provided with the necessary raw materials to ensure an uninterrupted production cycle.

Switzerland Faces Controversial Vote to Limit Population to 10 Million
Unknown

19:00:00 KST

Switzerland is set to hold a nationwide referendum this summer on whether to cap its population at 10 million by 2050, an initiative spearheaded by the right-wing, anti-immigration Swiss People’s Party (SVP). The party, which holds the largest number of seats in parliament, successfully collected enough signatures to bring the proposal to a vote, scheduled for 14 June.
The country currently has around 9.1 million residents, with approximately 30 percent born abroad, mostly from European Union countries, some of whom have acquired Swiss citizenship. The proposal aims to amend the constitution to ensure that if the population reaches 9.5 million before 2050, the government would implement measures to curb growth. These could include tighter controls on asylum, family reunification, and residency permits, as well as renegotiating international agreements that influence migration. Should the total population exceed 10 million, authorities would be required to take all measures necessary to comply with the cap, potentially including ending Switzerland’s free movement agreement with the EU.
Supporters argue that the cap would protect Switzerland’s environment, infrastructure, natural resources, and social systems from the pressures of population growth. Critics, including the Federal Council, most political parties, and business associations, warn that limiting migration could trigger labor shortages in essential sectors such as healthcare, construction, hospitality, and public transport. Economisuisse, a leading business group, labeled the proposal “the chaos initiative,” noting that Switzerland relies heavily on foreign workers and that restricting their presence could force companies to relocate abroad.
The SVP has long pursued stricter immigration limits, though previous efforts have failed at the ballot. A 2016 referendum to deport immigrants guilty of minor offenses automatically, and a 2020 initiative to end free movement with the EU, were both rejected by voters. Switzerland is part of the Schengen zone, allowing visa-free travel across 29 European countries, most of which are EU members. Switzerland, along with Norway, Iceland, and Liechtenstein, is outside the EU but participates in this arrangement, connecting roughly 450 million people.

WASHINGTON (AP) — The United States will send the world’s largest aircraft carrier to the Middle East to back up another already there, a person familiar with the plans said Friday, putting more American firepower behind President Donald Trump’s efforts to coerce Iran into a deal over its nuclear program and potentially its missile program too.
The USS Gerald R. Ford’s planned deployment to the region comes after Trump only days earlier suggested another round of talks with the Iranians was at hand. Those negotiations didn’t materialize as one of Tehran’s top security officials visited Oman and Qatar this week and exchanged messages with the US intermediaries.
Already, Gulf Arab nations have warned that any attack could spiral into another regional conflict in a Middle East still reeling from the Israel-Hamas war in the Gaza Strip. Meanwhile, Iranians are beginning to hold 40-day mourning ceremonies for the thousands killed in Tehran’s bloody crackdown on nationwide protests last month, adding to the internal pressure faced by the sanctions-battered Islamic Republic.
The Ford’s deployment, first reported by The New York Times, will put two carriers and their accompanying warships in the region. The USS Abraham Lincoln and its accompanying guided-missile destroyers are already in the Arabian Sea.
The person who spoke to The Associated Press on the deployment did so on condition of anonymity to discuss military movements.
It marks a quick turnaround for the Ford, which Trump sent from the Mediterranean Sea to the Caribbean in October as the administration built up a huge military presence in the lead-up to the surprise raid last month that captured then-Venezuelan president Nicolás Maduro.
It also appears to be at odds with Trump’s national security strategy, which emphasizes the Western Hemisphere over other parts of the world.
Trump on Thursday warned Iran that failure to reach a deal with his administration would be “very traumatic.” Iran and the United States held indirect talks in Oman last week.
“I guess over the next month, something like that,” Trump said in response to a question about his timeline for striking a deal with Iran on its nuclear program. “It should happen quickly. They should agree very quickly.”
Trump told Axios earlier this week that he was considering sending a second carrier strike group to the Middle East.
Trump held lengthy talks with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Wednesday and said he insisted to Israel’s leader that negotiations with Iran needed to continue. Netanyahu is urging the administration to press Tehran to scale back its ballistic missile program and end its support for terror groups such as Hamas and Hezbollah as part of any deal.
The USS Ford set out on deployment in late June 2025, which means the crew have been deployed for almost eight months. While it is unclear how long the ship will remain in the Middle East, the move sets the crew up for an unusually long deployment.
The White House didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.
Iran at home faces still-simmering anger over its wide-ranging suppression of all dissent. That rage may intensify in the coming days as families of the dead begin marking the traditional 40-day mourning for the loved ones. Already, online videos have shown mourners gathering in different parts of the country, holding portraits of their dead.
One video purported to show mourners at a graveyard in Iran’s Razavi Khorasan province, home to Mashhad, on Thursday. There, with a large portable speaker, people sang the patriotic song “Ey Iran,” which dates to 1940s Iran under the rule of Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi. While initially banned after the 1979 Islamic Revolution, Iran’s theocratic government has played it to drum up support.
“Oh Iran, a land full of jewels, your soil is full of art,” they sang. “May evil wishes be far from you. May you live eternal. Oh enemy, if you are a piece of granite, I am iron.”

Minister: Tourism sector in Belarus needs new impetus

MINSK, 13 February (BelTA) – A decision to grant the tourism sector in Belarus the status of a separate industry is absolutely correct. Tourism needs a new impetus, Belarusian Sports Minister Sergei Kovalchuk said at the outcome board meeting of the ministry in Minsk, BelTA has learned.
2025 was a robust year for the tourism sector as it set a new record in the export of tourism services at $385 million. “So we are not ashamed to hand over part of our work, which, in my opinion, we did well. But today, new breakthrough solutions in the field of tourism are needed; an impetus is required. We have a wonderful country, and I believe this decision will yield results,” Sergei Kovalchuk noted.
Another crucial decision by the leadership of Belarus in 2025, the minister noted, was the decree on support for sports organizations. A key aspect of the new decree is that it allows sports federations and clubs to receive subsidies for their operations. Previously, they had to request tax breaks or seek sponsors, and these funds did not always arrive on time. Now, stable funding is guaranteed for core activities: maintaining facilities, purchasing equipment and gear, and paying wages.

ECB Sets Timeline for Digital Euro, Eyes 2029 Launch
The European Central Bank (ECB) has confirmed that the introduction of a digital euro will proceed only once the necessary legislative framework is established by European institutions
A recent Eurobarometer survey indicates that Bulgarians show relatively low confidence in the European Union’s ability to strengthen security and defense. Conducted between January 5 and 12, 2026, the survey collected responses from 27,292 citizens across EU member states. In Bulgaria, only 44% of respondents expressed trust in the EU on this issue, compared with the EU-wide average of 52%. Trust is highest in Luxembourg (76%), Portugal (74%), Lithuania (71%) and Denmark (70%), while France (40%), Germany (47%) and Italy (47%) report the lowest levels.
When it comes to perceived threats, Bulgaria aligns closely with the EU average. Across the Union, 68% of citizens feel that their country’s security is at risk. Bulgaria does not rank among the countries with the highest or lowest sense of threat, while France (80%), Denmark (77%), Cyprus (75%) and Germany (75%) report the most concern. Only 42% of Europeans feel personally threatened.
Regarding defense spending, EU citizens are divided: 32% believe the Union invests too little in security and defense, 42% consider the investment “just enough,” and 14% think it is excessive. Bulgaria sits near the EU average and does not stand out in dissatisfaction. France has the highest share of citizens feeling investment is insufficient (43%), while Slovakia reports the lowest (23%).
The survey also examined priorities for EU space policy. Security and defense emerged as the top priority for 34% of respondents, while 53% included it among their key priorities when multiple options were allowed. Bulgaria again reflects the EU average without extreme deviations.
Finally, Europeans were asked about the economic impact of EU space programs. On average, 45% of respondents see an important economic effect, while 32% note a significant influence on daily life. Cyprus rated the economic impact highest (63%) and Sweden lowest (26%), with Bulgaria falling near the average range.

End of an Era: Tarique Rahman Returns from Exile to Steer Bangladesh’s New Government

Bulgaria's Ruse Faces Labor Shortages, Turns to Nepalese and Bangladeshi Workers
The Bulgarian city of Ruse is experiencing a significant rise in the recruitment of foreign labor, with most newcomers arriving from Nepal and Bangladesh
Bangladesh appears set for a major political shift after the Bangladesh Nationalist Party announced what it described as a decisive victory in the country’s first elections since the upheaval of 2024. With final results still pending, BNP leaders say their prime ministerial nominee, Tarique Rahman, is on course to form the next government.
Rahman returned to Bangladesh in December after more than 17 years abroad, ending a long period of self-imposed exile that followed political unrest and a series of legal cases against him. His return came months after mass protests last year forced longtime leader Sheikh Hasina from power, reshaping the country’s political landscape. Ahead of Thursday’s vote, Rahman made clear he was seeking a mandate strong enough to govern without coalition partners, promising to restore stability and democratic norms after years marked by increasingly centralized rule.
Speaking before polling day, Rahman said he believed broad voter participation would prevent behind-the-scenes manipulation and allow a new democratic chapter to begin. He framed the election as a turning point for Bangladesh’s future political direction.
Tarique Rahman, 60, is a central figure in one of the country’s most prominent political families. He is the eldest son of former prime minister Khaleda Zia and former president Ziaur Rahman, the founder of the BNP. Ziaur Rahman was killed in a military coup in 1981, after which Khaleda Zia entered politics and later became prime minister in 1991. Rahman has effectively led the party since 2018, when his mother was imprisoned, serving as its acting chairman through years of repression and political marginalization.
His long absence from the country began in 2008, when he traveled to London for medical treatment and remained there while facing multiple criminal cases at home. Among them was a conviction handed down in his absence over an alleged plot to assassinate Sheikh Hasina. Those verdicts were overturned after Hasina’s removal in 2024, clearing the way for Rahman’s return and political rehabilitation.
The BNP says the scale of its victory reflects public trust earned during last year’s uprising. Senior party figures argued that voters had endorsed the movement’s original demands for accountability and equal treatment. At the same time, party leaders cautioned against triumphalism, stressing that the next government would face serious challenges in healing divisions and rebuilding institutions.
Early projections by broadcasters suggested the BNP had crossed the threshold needed for a clear parliamentary majority, with some estimates pointing to more than two-thirds of the seats. Islamist party Jamaat also appeared to make significant gains, though well short of the outright victory it had sought. Official figures from the Election Commission are expected later, covering results from nearly all constituencies, with additional seats reserved for women to be filled from party lists.
Despite the apparent scale of the win, the BNP instructed supporters not to hold street celebrations. Senior figures called instead for prayers, emphasizing restraint and calm as the country awaits final confirmation of the results.
Polling day itself passed largely without major incidents, according to election officials, despite fears of unrest after a campaign period marked by deadly clashes and hundreds of injuries. Security forces were deployed nationwide, and international observers had warned in advance of rising intolerance and widespread disinformation. Turnout was reported at just under 60 percent.
Supporters gathered outside party offices overnight, expressing relief after years of political pressure and legal harassment. Many described the vote as a chance to reclaim livelihoods and dignity lost during the previous era.
The interim leader, Nobel Peace Prize laureate Muhammad Yunus, who took charge after Hasina’s ouster, urged unity and restraint as the transition unfolds. He said disagreements must give way to the broader national interest. Yunus, who will step aside once the new government is formed, described the vote as the end of a long national ordeal and the beginning of a new phase.
Sheikh Hasina, now in India, rejected the election outright, calling it illegal and unconstitutional after her party was barred from contesting. Meanwhile, voters also participated in a referendum on a wide-ranging reform charter aimed at overhauling governance, including term limits for prime ministers, the creation of an upper house of parliament, expanded presidential powers, and stronger judicial independence. Early television projections indicated public backing for these changes, signaling support for deep institutional reform alongside the political transition.

Munich Security Conference, 2007-2026: How Europe missed the inflection point

Munich Security Conference 2007/RIA Novosti
The International Security Conference opens in Munich today, 13 February. Following last year's forum, during which U.S. Vice President JD Vance delivered a scathing speech directed at Europe, the West began speaking of the death of the transatlantic alliance. Over the course of the year, the mood grew increasingly grim. On the eve of Munich 2026, Europeans held lavish funerals for NATO and predicted that within five years Europe itself may cease to exist.
It is remarkable how times change, and with them, the balance of power. Not long ago, European elites were drawing iron curtains before nations they found politically inconvenient, erecting walls, drawing dividing lines, attempting to isolate, suppress, and impose their will. There was not even any talk of sensible, equal dialogue. And now, facing disregard and the imposition of others' will upon themselves, European elites are calling for dialogue.
“With longstanding alliances called into question, the rules-based international order eroding and mounting instability and escalating conflicts across the globe, this year’s Munich Security Conference takes place at a fundamental inflection point,” reads the announcement published on the forum's official website.
All of this is true, with one exception: what we are witnessing today is not a fundamental inflection point, but merely the consequence of the destructive actions that have been taking place in the world over recent decades.
If we are to speak of a fundamental inflection point in the context of the Munich Security Conference, we should recall the speech delivered by Russian President Vladimir Putin at the MSC in 2007. The Russian leader’s statements made headlines across Western media, and some saw fit to interpret them as the beginning of a new Cold War, even though Putin was precisely warning against the mistakes of the past. So what made the Russian president’s Munich speech so notable?

In these circumstances, European elites have suddenly remembered the importance of dialogue. In January, the World Economic Forum (WEF) in Davos was held under the motto A Spirit of Dialogue. Particularly eloquent was WEF President Børge Brende. “Dialogue is a prerequisite for moving the world forward,” Brende stated. “Dialogue is not a luxury in times of uncertainty; it is an urgent necessity."The organizers of the Munich Security Conference are also calling for equal dialogue. Do not lecture one another, do not ignore one another, interact and communicate. These are the rules of the forum this year.

If we are to speak of a fundamental inflection point in the context of the Munich Security Conference, we should recall the speech delivered by Russian President Vladimir Putin at the MSC in 2007. The Russian leader’s statements made headlines across Western media, and some saw fit to interpret them as the beginning of a new Cold War, even though Putin was precisely warning against the mistakes of the past. So what made the Russian president’s Munich speech so notable?
First, he criticized the concept of a unipolar world, pointing out its untenability, its pernicious nature, and its incompatibility with democratic principles. Later, experts would suggest that Putin was, in effect, heralding a new era of multipolarity. “What is a unipolar world? However much you may dress up this term, in practice it means only one thing: one center of power, one center of force, one center of decision-making. It is a world of one master, one sovereign. And that is ultimately destructive not only for all those within this system, but for the sovereign itself, because it corrodes it from within... I believe that the unipolar model is not only unacceptable for the modern world, but impossible altogether,” Putin said.
Second, he openly opposed NATO expansion plans, the alliance’s buildup on its eastern flank, and the deployment of U.S. missile defense sites in Eastern Europe. “We cannot but be troubled by plans to deploy elements of a missile defense system in Europe. Who needs the next inevitable round of an arms race? I deeply doubt it is the Europeans themselves... Meanwhile, so-called light U.S. forward bases are appearing in Bulgaria and Romania, five thousand bayonets each. So NATO is moving its forward forces to our state borders, while we, strictly adhering to the treaty [the Treaty on Conventional Armed Forces in Europe], are doing nothing in response,” Putin pointed out.
Third, he drew attention to the disregard for fundamental principles of international law and warned of the consequences. “Let me emphasize this: no one feels safe! Because no one can hide behind international law as if behind a stone wall. Such a policy is, of course, a catalyst for the arms race,” the Russian leader stated.
For the Russian president, the answer to these and many other challenges in Europe and beyond lay in one basic principle: the security of each is the security of all. “I am convinced that we have reached that pivotal moment when we must seriously reflect on the entire architecture of global security,” the Russian leader stated.
However, despite the resonance of Putin’s Munich speech, his concerns, warnings and proposals went unheard. A year and a half later, in June 2008, Russia put forward an initiative to draft a European Security Treaty. Its essence was to create a single, indivisible space in the Euro-Atlantic region in the area of military-political security and to enshrine the principle of indivisible security in international law. In other words, it was about a legal obligation according to which no state and no international organization could strengthen their security at the expense of the security of other countries and organizations. The draft document was sent to NATO countries, the EU, the CSTO, the CIS, and the OSCE.
And here is what NATO Secretary General Anders Fogh Rasmussen said at the time, speaking in Brussels: “NATO’s position is absolutely clear: we see no need for new documents or new legally binding treaties.”

Moscow made another attempt to call on the West to observe the principle of “security of each is security of all” shortly before the start of the Ukrainian conflict. In December 2021, the Russian side submitted draft agreements on security guarantees to the United States and NATO. They proposed to interact on the basis of the principles of indivisible and equal security, and to refrain from actions, individually or within a military coalition, that affect the security of the other side. Russia demanded that NATO stop its eastward expansion and not deploy alliance military bases near its borders. For its part, Russia was ready not to deploy its armed forces on the territory of other European states in addition to those already deployed as of 27 May 1997.
But neither Europeans nor Americans found Russia’s proposals necessary. The West was preparing at full speed for a proxy war in Ukraine, as later acknowledged by former German Chancellor Angela Merkel and former French President François Hollande. Today, hesitant calls for dialogue with Moscow are finally being voiced in some European capitals. Back then, however, European elites saw themselves as masters of the game and pursued their goal – dealing Russia a strategic defeat.

Back then, however, European elites saw themselves as masters of the game and pursued their goal – dealing Russia a strategic defeat.
And what did they achieve? Today Europe is experiencing a defeat. Not at the hands of Russia but at the hands of its main ally – the United States of America. However, European elites have only themselves to blame for this situation, or more precisely, their greed, insatiable ambition, and political short-sightedness.
“People are desperate. You no longer know how far Americans are willing to go,” French President Emmanuel Macron lamented today. “If we don’t take action, Europe will be gone in five years,” he predicted.
“The world has entered a period of destructive policies. Instead of careful reforms and policy adjustments, we see a desire for large-scale destruction,” reads the Munich Security Report 2026.
Both Macron and the Munich report are right. But they are a couple of decades too late with their truth. For us — for Belarus, Russia, and a number of countries in the Global South — life under the destructive policies of the West has long been an everyday reality. It seems that now it is Europe’s turn to experience something similar.
But we are not talking about a boomerang effect. Looking at Europe in its current state and hearing that the Old World will cease to exist in five years, even though this is a gross exaggeration, we feel no joy. Europe is our common home. The trouble is that this home has no foundation in the form of the principle of indivisible security. That is why cracks, distortions, and deformations appear under the hammering of external forces. The building needs to be repaired, but how can it be done if the residents do not hear each other?
The dialogue that Europe has started talking about is certainly necessary. And visits by European diplomats to Minsk and Moscow as well as current discussions in the capital cities of the European Union are important steps. But until we see a sincere desire to listen to the other side and accept the fact that this is a conversation between equals, until there is an understanding of shared responsibility for the fate of the European region, which is more important than personal ambitions and short-term gains, we should not expect a real dialogue capable of turning the situation around.

ECB Sets Timeline for Digital Euro, Eyes 2029 Launch
The European Central Bank (ECB) has confirmed that the introduction of a digital euro will proceed only once the necessary legislative framework is established by European institutions
The introduction of the euro in Bulgaria is unfolding in line with expectations, according to Bulgarian National Bank Governor Dimitar Radev, who spoke at an economic forum in Sofia hosted by The Economist magazine.
Radev noted that 85% of lev banknotes and coins have already been removed from circulation, replaced by more than 7 billion euros. He referenced preliminary data from the National Statistical Institute and Eurostat, which show that Bulgaria’s annual inflation in January reached approximately 2.3%, a level largely consistent with trends across the eurozone.
The governor highlighted that the transition to the euro had a limited and temporary effect on prices, raising monthly inflation in January by an estimated 0.3 to 0.4 percentage points. He emphasized that adopting the euro is not an end in itself, but rather a framework that makes the quality of institutions and the sustainability of economic policies more transparent and accountable.
Bulgaria’s National Statistical Institute (NSI) has reported a visible deceleration in inflation, according to the latest Consumer Price Index, calculated on the basis of more than 40,000 price observations covering around 8,000 goods and services

News of the story
"On Point"
MINSK, 13 February (BelTA) - Head of the Russian Center for Military and Political Conflict Studies Andrei Klintsevich assessed the state and prospects of the Belarus-Russia Union State’s military-industrial complex in a recent episode of the V Teme [On Point] project on BelTA’s YouTube channel.
“Any conflict is first of all a clash of systems. And here we got lucky, because the military-industrial system (just like Belarus’, by the way) came to us from the Soviet Union. There were large state reserves and so-called mothballed workshops for producing expendable materials,” said Andrei Klintsevich. “As specialists told me, now that we’ve brought them out of mothballs, with modern technology we’ve exceeded Soviet design capacity by four times.”
Thus, the expert stated, Russia together with its allies produces more shells than NATO countries combined. Moreover, in terms of price-quality ratio, the products also outperform Western counterparts.
“There is still a lag in satellite constellations. This applies not only to communication systems, but also to earth remote sensing systems. This is an area where we still have room to grow,” emphasized Andrei Klintsevich. “Our advanced earth remote sensing satellites operate using Belarusian optical systems. Everything that could be called the ‘eyes’ of the satellites is Belarusian-made. This is an area where we have work to keep our enterprises busy and room to develop further.”

Russia and Ukraine to Resume Peace Talks
The Kremlin has confirmed that the next round of peace talks aimed at ending the war in Ukraine will take place on February 17–18 in Geneva, Switzerland.
Russian servicemen and pro-war commentators reacted with open outrage after the authorities began slowing down and restricting Telegram, warning that the move threatens communication on the battlefield and could seriously undermine military operations in Ukraine.
Russia’s communications watchdog announced on February 10 that restrictions on the messaging app would continue as part of a broader effort to tighten control over the country’s information space. The measures follow earlier limitations on calls made via Telegram and WhatsApp, reflecting a long-standing policy to bring digital platforms under stricter state oversight.
For soldiers deployed in Ukraine, however, Telegram is not just a social platform but a key operational tool. Messages circulating in pro-war channels described shock and anger among troops, who complained that after losing access to satellite internet services, they are now facing interference with their main channel for coordination. Some questioned how combat operations could continue without reliable communication.
Several servicemen publicly appealed to the authorities through recorded video messages shared on monitoring channels. One soldier said that Telegram was their only means of staying in contact while on active duty and pleaded for it not to be restricted. Others stressed that the app is essential for rapidly sharing information about incoming drone attacks and coordinating defensive responses. Fighters from anti-drone units warned that any slowdown would weaken their ability to counter unmanned aerial vehicles, especially in recently occupied areas.
The backlash quickly spread beyond the front line. Nationalist bloggers and pro-war commentators expressed fury, arguing that the decision showed a disconnect between the state’s information policies and the realities of the war. Some accused the authorities of undermining their own military effort, while others mocked the idea that Russia could block communication tools for its own forces while failing to disrupt similar technologies used by Ukraine.
Several prominent pro-war channels criticized the move as yet another blanket ban that would only fuel frustration and confusion. Even officials in border regions voiced concern, warning that slowing Telegram could disrupt the flow of urgent security updates to civilians in areas exposed to shelling and drone strikes. At the same time, residents were encouraged to switch to state-backed messaging platforms.
Pro-government commentators attempted to redirect blame toward the platform’s founder, accusing him of hiding behind free speech arguments instead of preventing the spread of what they described as hostile narratives. In response, the founder stated separately that limiting citizens’ freedoms is not an effective solution.
Despite the backlash, the regulator confirmed that restrictions would continue.

Bulgarian Businesses Sound Alarm as Skill Shortages Persist Across Education Levels

An annual employer survey conducted by the Bulgarian Chamber of Commerce and Industry shows that the gap between education and business needs in Bulgaria remains deep and persistent. Presenting the findings, Boryana Abadjieva, Head of the Chamber’s Economic Analysis and Policy Department, said that companies continue to struggle to find staff with adequate practical skills. According to the data, 88 percent of employers in 2026 report difficulties in recruiting suitably prepared employees, compared to 91 percent in 2024 and 90 percent in 2025. The problem affects graduates from both secondary and higher education.
Abadjieva explained that while young people often possess solid theoretical knowledge, they lack practical competencies required in real working environments, particularly in professional and technical fields. Employers also point to deficiencies in teamwork, task comprehension, and day-to-day work discipline. In her view, education programs need to place far greater emphasis on hands-on training, allowing students to gain real insight into how their knowledge is applied in practice.
The survey also highlights a growing shortage of communication skills. The share of employers reporting this problem has risen steadily from 40 percent in 2024 to 44 percent in 2025 and 47 percent in 2026. Abadjieva noted that this trend is partly linked to the habits of younger generations, who communicate mainly through digital platforms and social networks. This, she said, often makes adaptation to face-to-face teamwork and communication in the workplace more difficult.
In terms of higher education, the most acute personnel shortages are recorded in technical sciences, reported by 77.5 percent of employers. This is followed by social, economic and legal sciences at 19.2 percent, and natural sciences, mathematics and informatics at 12.5 percent. Businesses are particularly seeking engineers, including specialists for renewable energy projects such as solar and wind power. Demand is also strong in mechanical engineering and metallurgy, where companies increasingly require skills related to robotics, automation and artificial intelligence.
Abadjieva pointed to successful examples of closer cooperation between education and business, including specialized secondary schools where students are already involved in real company projects during their studies. She stressed that expanding dual education, strengthening STEM training and updating curricula in line with digital transformation are among the key priorities for employers. As a result of existing gaps, many companies are already investing resources in training newly hired graduates themselves so they can quickly become operational.
The issue of recruiting workers from third countries was also addressed as a potential solution to labor shortages. Abadjieva said that while interest exists in attracting staff from countries such as Uzbekistan and India, administrative barriers continue to limit this option. Employers face unexplained refusals or permits that are granted for too short a period, which ultimately fails to meet the long-term needs of businesses.

The process of forming Bulgaria’s next caretaker government has formally started, with Andrey Gyurov facing a strict deadline. As the nominee for caretaker prime minister, he has seven days to submit the structure and names of the interim cabinet to the president. This means the list must be finalized by February 19. If no objections are raised, the president will issue a decree appointing the caretaker government and will simultaneously set the date for early parliamentary elections, which are expected to take place on April 19.

Gyurov is now beginning consultations with potential ministers, working under tight time pressure to assemble a complete and workable team. Once the proposal is submitted, the final step will depend on presidential approval, after which the interim cabinet can officially take office and preparations for the elections will move into their final phase.
President Iliana Yotova said that the consultations with parliamentary parties had been useful and emphasized that concerns about a possible conflict of interest surrounding Gyurov no longer exist. She noted that he is the only candidate willing to step down from his position as deputy governor of the Bulgarian National Bank, which, in her words, removes any remaining doubts. According to Yotova, the country cannot afford institutional paralysis, as Bulgaria continues to face serious internal and external commitments.
She added that Gyurov’s appointment would imply shared responsibility between the caretaker cabinet and the National Assembly for addressing the most urgent challenges. Among those discussed during consultations were the organization of fair and transparent elections, measures to curb rising prices, maintaining financial stability in the absence of an adopted euro-area budget, and clarifying responsibility in the Petrokhan case.
Yotova stressed that she will not bear political responsibility for the caretaker cabinet but will act as a corrective factor. She said the presidency would remain open to signals of irregularities and that every such signal would be made public. In her words, recent constitutional changes have significantly narrowed the president’s room for maneuver, effectively limiting the choice of caretaker prime minister to figures preselected through parliamentary majorities. As a result, the decision was reduced to choosing between representatives of the political status quo or the opposition.
She expressed hope that lawmakers would eventually reconsider these constitutional amendments, noting that many political forces now privately acknowledge the consequences of the changes they supported. Asked whether she could refuse to appoint a caretaker cabinet if she disagreed with a proposed minister, Yotova confirmed that the president has the right to return the list if a nominee is deemed contrary to the public interest, citing an existing precedent.
Finally, Yotova underlined that she expects Gyurov to present a cabinet free from political pressure. She made clear that responsibility for both the government and its members will rest with Gyurov himself, who, together with his ministers, will be accountable to the National Assembly, where they are required to take their oath.

"On Point"
MINSK, 13 February (BelTA) – A key feature of the current inspection of the Armed Forces’ combat readiness is that President Aleksandr Lukashenko is, in fact, taking personal command of the troops, Doctor of Military Sciences, Professor Nikolai Buzin said in a recent episode of the V Teme [On Point] project on BelTA’s YouTube channel.
“As the commander-in-chief, the president wants to understand the real capabilities of the Armed Forces and how the plans for their improvement, reformation, and transformation are being implemented,” Nikolai Buzin said. “Therefore, he is setting the task for the inspection without the direct participation of the Defence Ministry or the General Staff. The president is taking charge of troop management himself to assess their ability to accomplish combat missions in a realistic operational environment.”
The expert pointed out that the ongoing inspection is being held in harsh weather conditions. Nevertheless, he added, there is a clear understanding that a potential armed conflict would not wait for suitable weather, as wars often start unexpectedly. “It might be 20 or 30 degrees below zero, freezing cold, with impassable roads... Can we accomplish our tasks under these conditions, or can’t we?” he emphasized.
Furthermore, Nikolai Buzin stated that the situation near Belarus’ western borders is quite tense: “Large groups of forces have been deployed near our borders, and new training grounds are being built. Not to mention the intelligence activities that are constantly being conducted in an intensified mode.”
The expert added that the ongoing military inspection is not only sudden but also comprehensive. This is evidenced by the selection of military units being tested. For instance, the 19th Separate Mechanized Brigade stationed in the north of the country and the 72nd Training Centre located in the central part.
“Upon completion of the inspection, there will be a thorough analysis of the performance, shortcomings, and nuances. Proposals for the further development of the Armed Forces will be drafted. This is not an inspection for the sake of inspection. The key is to determine whether the Armed Forces are really advancing,” Nikolai Buzin summarized.
