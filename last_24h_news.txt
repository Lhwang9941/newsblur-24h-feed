The 18-year-old suspect in a high school shooting on Wednesday in British Columbia had previously created a mass shooting simulator on the gaming platform Roblox, it has been revealed.
The simulator, set in what appeared to be a virtual shopping mall, allowed users – represented as Roblox-style avatars – to pick up weapons and shoot other players, 404 Media first reported on Thursday.
Users first identified the suspect’s Roblox account and game on Kiwi Farms, a site known for doxxing and trolling. After the shooting, Canadian police identified the suspect as Jesse Van Rootselaar.
In a statement to the Guardian, Roblox said: “We have removed the user account connected to this horrifying incident as well as any content associated with the suspect. We are committed to fully supporting law enforcement in their investigation.”
The California-based company added that the “Mall experience” was accessible only through Roblox Studio, a separate app used by developers to create games. As a result, the simulator recorded just seven visits.
Roblox also said it uses a combination of AI and a team of safety specialists to review content that is uploaded to its platform before it is shown to another user.
Wednesday’s attack – one of Canada’s deadliest school shootings since the 1989 École Polytechnique massacre, in which a gunman killed 14 women – left nine people dead in Tumbler Ridge, a small coalmining community.
The victims included a teacher, five students, the suspect’s mother and her stepbrother. The suspect, who reportedly had a history of mental health issues, was found dead from a self-inflicted gunshot wound.
This isn’t the first time Roblox has been criticised for its content. The platform allows its millions of users to create and share their own video games – many of them benign, featuring cartoon fish and camping trips.
However, it has also allegedly made Jeffrey Epstein-themed content available to children, and is facing a lawsuit in California for facilitating the sexual exploitation and assault of minors.
The links between violent video games and mass shootings have been long-debated and remain inconclusive, with large studies finding at most a small correlation between gaming and real-world aggression.
However, though games may not cause violence, recent incidents underscore the growing trend of “gamified violence”: extremists adopting elements of video game design in the context of real-world attacks.
This is becoming increasingly common. The attackers in the 2019 mosque shooting in Christchurch, New Zealand, broadcast their massacre on Twitch, a platform which allows users to livestream themselves playing video games; as did the shooter in the racially-motivated attack in Buffalo, New York, in 2022.

Ex dpty head of President's Office Shurma denies hiding in Germany
Former Deputy Head of the Ukrainian Presidential Office Rostyslav Shurma, who has been placed on a wanted list by the National Anti-Corruption Bureau of Ukraine (NABU) on suspicion of misappropriation of property and money laundering, has denied wrongdoing, said he is prepared to cooperate with the investigation, and stated that he is lawfully present in Germany.
"Today, media reported that my brother and I have allegedly been placed on a wanted list… I emphasize: neither I nor my brother are in hiding. I am openly and lawfully present in the Federal Republic of Germany at an address known to the investigation. My current contact details and those of my defense counsel have been communicated to the competent authorities on multiple occasions. I am prepared to cooperate with the investigation within the bounds of the law — with respect for my right to defense and due procedural process," Shurma wrote on Facebook on Friday.
He said his defense team had formally requested that his participation in procedural actions be facilitated via videoconference or through diplomatic channels.
"I do not plead guilty and will prove my innocence through the procedure established by law. The defense will continue to take all legally prescribed measures to ensure proper procedural communication and the protection of my rights in Ukraine and abroad," he added.
As previously reported, NABU placed Shurma on a wanted list on suspicion of misappropriation of property and money laundering. The relevant entry appeared in the wanted persons section of the Ukrainian Interior Ministry’s website, with Feb. 12, 2026 listed as the date of his disappearance. No preventive measure had been applied against him. A wanted notice for Oleh Shurma, born Jan. 13, 1986, carrying identical suspicion details and disappearance date, was also added to the database.
The case stems from a scheme uncovered by NABU and the Specialized Anti-Corruption Prosecutor’s Office (SAPO) on Jan. 21, 2026, involving the alleged embezzlement of funds under the so-called "green" energy tariff in the temporarily occupied territories of Zaporizhia region, with losses estimated at UAH 141.3 million. Member of parliament Yaroslav Zheleznyak of the Holos faction linked Shurma to the suspicion notice, writing on Telegram: "The suspicion against Shurma follows my complaint to NABU."

Zelenskyy: 10,000 drones manufactured in Germany to be delivered to Ukraine in 2026
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has visited the first German-Ukrainian joint venture producing drones for the Ukrainian military during his stay in Munich, receiving the first jointly manufactured strike drone.
"We saw the production line and the first flight of the drone. This is modern Ukrainian technology. Battle-tested. Equipped with artificial intelligence. It will strike, conduct reconnaissance, and protect our soldiers. And already this year, 10,000 drones produced here will be handed over to Ukraine and will strengthen our forces," Zelenskyy wrote on Telegram on Friday.
The president also said that 10 joint drone production ventures are planned to be launched by the end of the year.
"I thank Chancellor Friedrich Merz, the German government, Defense Minister Boris Pistorius personally, and the German people. Ukraine is always ready to share the experience we have gained defending lives," he said.
Germany’s Defense Ministry said the German-Ukrainian joint venture "is delivering results." "Both sides benefit from the joint venture. By the end of the year, Ukraine will receive up to 10,000 drones under this project. Germany, in turn, is expanding its own production capacity and learning from battlefield experience," it said.
According to Ukrainian company Frontline Robotics, the drone received by Zelenskyy — the Linza 3.0 — was developed by the company and manufactured by the first Ukrainian-German defense enterprise, Quantum Frontline Industries (QFI), which the Ukrainian president visited alongside Pistorius.
"I would like to express my gratitude for this project, which was implemented at the speed of light. We are learning from the successes achieved on the battlefield and benefiting from the innovations being applied," Pistorius said.
QFI CEO Matthias Lehna, who demonstrated the production facility to Zelenskyy and Pistorius, noted that the venture began production just two months after its establishment was announced. "QFI is the first enterprise of this kind, but certainly not the last. We are proud to be the flagship company of Ukrainian-German industrial cooperation and to support the Armed Forces of Ukraine," he said.
Frontline Robotics Chief Business Development Officer Mykyta Rozhkov said the Linza 3.0 was built on frontline experience and "is already helping Ukrainian forces operate more effectively."
The Linza 3.0 is the latest version of the Linza bomber drone series, which has been adopted by more than 60 units of Ukraine’s Defense Forces. It is equipped with an AI-based visual-inertial navigation module, has a 12-inch airframe, and can carry a payload of up to 4 kg over a range of up to 15 km, with an endurance of up to 60 minutes.
The visit by Zelenskyy and Pistorius was organized with the support of the Ukrainian Armory Council, which represents Ukraine’s private defense manufacturers.
