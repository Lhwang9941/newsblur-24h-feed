American policy toward Iran has oscillated between two inefficient poles: negotiations that grant time and resources to a predatory regime, and military signaling that stops short of regime change. A serious Iran policy requires an alternative that is politically legible to Iranians and operationally legible to US President Donald Trump and allied governments. Today, that alternative exists in Crown Prince Reza Pahlavi.
The standard is about leadership capacity. Movements succeed when they can mobilize the nation, message discipline, and demand international coordination– especially when the regime’s core advantage is repression. Pahlavi has repeatedly demonstrated the ability to mobilize at scale within and across Iranian borders, while translating public energy into a coherent set of actionable policy demands.
Mobilization at scale: Inside Iran and across the Diaspora
In early January, the unprecedented multi-million-person uprising inside Iran followed Pahlavi’s call for mobilization. Shortly thereafter, on 14 February, large-scale rallies abroad, organized under the Global Day of Action – with Munich’s Theresienwiese as the central gathering, concurrent with the Munich Security Conference, and more than 250,000 Iranians in attendance according to Munich police – brought together Iranians from Europe and North America. Taken together, Munich, Toronto, and Los Angeles – along with rallies in other cities – drew attendance of more than a million, making it the largest coordinated Iranian-diaspora mobilization ever.
This suggests a rare capability: mobilizing domestically under severe constraints while also coordinating disciplined participation abroad. That inside-and-outside organizational capacity is what turns revolutionary energy into sustained political leverage capable of driving regime change and a successful transitional government.
The six-demand framework
Pahlavi’s latest message to Iranians abroad is, in effect, a field manual for turning diaspora freedom into leverage for compatriots who face lethal costs at home. He asks the diaspora to become more coordinated, more disciplined, and more focused – and he directs that energy around a defined agenda.
The agenda is a six-demand framework: protect Iranians by degrading the regime’s repression apparatus; maximize economic pressure by targeting assets and sanctions evasion – including oil-shipping networks described as a ghost fleet; expand resilient internet access; expel regime officials and prosecute those accused of crimes against humanity; free political prisoners; and prepare for a democratic transition in Iran and recognize the transitional government.
This is precisely what American and allied policy has lacked. They often invoke support for “human rights” – but without a counterpart to coordinate action with, such declarations remain symbolic. Many Iranians oppose the Islamic Republic, and many voices deserve respect. But only one figure has shown the combination of national recognition, organizational reach, and strategic clarity necessary to serve as an operational counterpart.
Washington’s role: engage, coordinate coercion, flip loyalty
If Pahlavi can mobilize inside Iran and coordinate disciplined action in the diaspora, American policy should be structured to engage that capacity as its operational counterpart.
That means three practical steps.
1) Formal engagement. American officials should meet with Reza Pahlavi openly and regularly – alongside Israeli and European governments – so that policy aligns with the diaspora mobilization rather than running in parallel. If American officials are willing to talk to the regime emissaries, they should be willing to talk to the most consequential figure organizing pressure against the regime.
2) Pair military action with a credible counterpart. Deterrence and compliance have not changed Tehran’s behavior, so the threat environment must be altered. American military action is necessary but should be coordinated with a politically and operationally legible counterpart capable of amplifying its effects through internal mobilization. In other words, external coercion should reinforce – and be reinforced by – internal mobilization enabled by Pahlavi’s demonstrated leadership capacity.
3) Accelerate internal unraveling by making departure safer than loyalty. The regime’s advantage is not legitimacy: it is loyalty. A logical strategy therefore, has to make departure from the regime safer than continued service. This requires shifting incentives for the regime’s coercive and administrative pillars by pairing pressure with credible assurances.
The American government should communicate clear off-ramps for those who disengage: protection for defectors, pathways for safe exit, and conditional leniency for non-violent functionaries who stand down and facilitate a peaceful transition. This is in accordance with Pahlavi’s vision for a successful transition. The objective is straightforward: raise the cost of obedience, lower the risk of defection, and make a rapid internal unraveling more likely than prolonged confrontation in the streets.
The democratic alternative capable of governing
Trump does not have to choose between negotiations that prolong the regime’s lifespan and military signaling that stops short of political effect. A successful Iran policy should pair military action with a politically and operationally legible alternative leader who has a viable transition pathway.
Hence, for a successful regime change, the president should coordinate military action with the democratic alternative who is capable of mobilizing, and most crucially, governing Iran: Crown Prince Reza Pahlavi.

Tehran is ready for nuclear concessions if US meets demands, Iranian official says

Iran has indicated it is prepared to make concessions on its nuclear program in talks with the United States in return for the lifting of sanctions and recognition of its right to enrich uranium, as it seeks to avert a US attack.
Both sides remain sharply divided - even over the scope and sequencing of relief from US sanctions - following two rounds of talks, a senior Iranian official told Reuters.
However, Reuters is reporting for the first time that Iran is offering fresh concessions since its talks ended last week, when the sides appeared far apart and were heading toward military conflict. Analysts say the move suggests Tehran is trying to keep diplomacy alive and stave off a major US strike.
The official said Tehran would seriously consider a combination of sending half of its most highly enriched uranium abroad, diluting the rest, and taking part in creating a regional enrichment consortium - an idea periodically raised in years of Iran-linked diplomacy.
Iran would do this in return for the US recognizing Iran's right to "peaceful nuclear enrichment" under a deal that would also lift economic sanctions, the official said.
In addition, Iran has offered opportunities for US companies to participate as contractors in Iran's large oil and gas industry, the official said, as part of negotiations to resolve decades of dispute over Tehran's nuclear activities.
"Within the economic package under negotiation, the United States has also been offered opportunities for serious investment and tangible economic interests in Iran's oil industry," the official said.
The White House did not respond immediately to queries on the issue.
Iran and the United States resumed negotiations earlier this month as the US builds up its military capability in the Middle East. Iran has threatened to strike US bases in the region if it is attacked.
The Iranian official said the most recent discussions underscored the gap between the two sides, but stressed that "the possibility of reaching an interim agreement exists" as negotiations continue.
Iran seeks 'logical timetable' for lifting sanctions
"The last round of talks showed that US ideas regarding the scope and mechanism of sanctions relief differ from Iran's demands. Both sides need to reach a logical timetable for lifting sanctions," the official said.
"This roadmap must be reasonable and based on mutual interests."
Iran's Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi said on Sunday he expects to meet with US President Donald Trump's special envoy, Steve Witkoff, in Geneva on Thursday, adding that there is still "a good chance" of a diplomatic solution.
Araghchi said on Friday that he expected to have a draft counterproposal ready within days, while Trump said he was considering limited military strikes.
Citing officials on both sides and diplomats across the Gulf and Europe, Reuters reported on Friday that Tehran and Washington are sliding rapidly towards military conflict as hopes fade for a diplomatic settlement.
On Sunday, Witkoff said the president was curious as to why Iran has not yet "capitulated" and agreed to curb its nuclear program.
"Why, under this pressure, with the amount of seapower and naval power over there, why haven't they come to us and said, 'We profess we don't want a weapon, so here's what we're prepared to do'? And yet it's sort of hard to get them to that place," Witkoff said on Fox News.
Negotiations yield 'encouraging symbols'
Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian described recent negotiations as having yielded "encouraging symbols" in a post on X/Twitter on Sunday.
"Recent negotiations involved the exchange of practical proposals," Pezeshkian stated. "However, we continue to closely monitor US actions and have made all necessary preparations for any potential scenario."
Readiness to compromise on nuclear work
Behnam Ben Taleblu, senior director of the Iran program at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, said Iran's leadership is seeking to buy time via the talks.
"Iran will use that time for various reasons, including to avoid a strike and to harden nuclear, missile, and military facilities," he said.
While rejecting a US demand for "zero enrichment" - a major sticking point in past negotiations - Tehran has signaled its readiness to compromise on its nuclear work.
Washington has also demanded that Iran relinquish its stockpile of highly enriched uranium (HEU). The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) last year estimated that the stockpile was more than 440 kg of uranium enriched to up to 60% fissile purity, a small step away from the 90% that is considered weapons-grade.
Ali Larijani, a close adviser to Iran's supreme leader, told Al Jazeera TV that Iran was ready to allow extensive IAEA monitoring to prove it is not seeking nuclear weapons.
The agency has been calling on Iran for months to allow for inspection of three nuclear sites that were struck by the US in June last year during the 12-day war. Since then, Tehran has said its uranium enrichment work has stopped.
Satellite images show that Iran has begun rebuilding at a location reportedly bombed during the June strikes, recently building a concrete shield over a new facility at a sensitive military site and covering it in soil, experts say.
A deal with benefits for both sides
Among US demands are restrictions on Tehran's long-range ballistic missiles and an end to its support for regional terror proxy groups.
Iran has flatly rejected discussing its missiles, while sources have told Reuters, without elaborating, that "the issue of regional proxies is not a red line for Tehran."
Iranian authorities have said that a diplomatic solution would provide economic benefits for both Tehran and Washington.
The Iranian official said Tehran would not hand over control of its oil and mineral resources.
"Ultimately, the US can be an economic partner for Iran, nothing more. American companies can always participate as contractors in Iran's oil and gas fields."

Trump's four timing options for striking Iran if a deal is not reached - analysis
Unknown

Given that no analyst on the planet thought the drama with Iran would still be ongoing in February, let alone almost March, there are four generally expected scenarios for when the next Iran war might start if no deal is struck.
Option number one
United States President Donald Trump might attack Iran between Sunday and Thursday.
This would occur if Trump had already decided to attack Tehran but had waited for certain pieces to fall into place militarily, as well as for a clear enough sign that negotiations with the Islamic Republic would not yield sufficient fruit for him to back down.
It could also occur on Thursday if Iran makes an offer that day that Trump immediately rejects. This seems less likely than option number two, if for no other reason than US officials have said there will be a US-Iran meeting on Thursday, and the chances are that Trump would want some time to survey the latest Iranian offer.
Option number two
Trump might attack Iran around the beginning or middle of next week.
This is the most likely option. Last week, he gave a two-week deadline to the Islamic Republic to reach an agreement with him, after which he said he would attack.
Since then, that deadline has waxed or waned in his statements, and there was another US official who noted that Trump is rarely “scientific” about his deadlines, using them often more as a guiding principle to get to where he wants to arrive when he wants to get there.
If Trump decides to give Iran Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei the full two weeks and takes some time to digest a new offer from Tehran this coming Thursday, but ultimately decides it is insufficient, then he would attack around then.
Option number three
The American military could attack almost immediately after March 19, post-Ramadan.
The Muslim month of Ramadan started last week and finishes on March 19. Trump may not want to start a regional war during Islam’s holiest month. Starting a war then could harm the readiness of Sunni Muslim allies in the region for the expected counterstrike by Khamenei against them. In addition, Trump’s thoughts are never far from political consequences.
Attacking during Ramadan could play into Khamenei’s narratives of a foreign force trying to invade the Middle East and move the focus away from the regime’s crimes against its own people as it slaughtered them in massive numbers starting in January.
If Iranians are considering splitting from the regime, attacking during Ramadan could complicate their thinking. Therefore, waiting until after Ramadan has some real logic to it.
However, option number two seems slightly more likely because the current stand-off has already dragged on since late December, the costs of maintaining so many American forces in the region are escalating, and as much as Trump may want to weigh his options and have Ramadan out of the way as a factor, his instinct to make relatively quick decisive determinations will at some point probably reassert itself over what has been an uncharacteristically long and deliberative decision-making process for the US president.
Option number four
The least likely scenario: Washington could attack in the more distant future.
This is the least likely of the four options because it is costing America billions of dollars to keep two aircraft carriers, over a dozen destroyer warships, and hundreds of other aircraft in the Middle East and on alert to start a giant war at any moment.
Some of these military elements arrived in the region in early January, some in mid-January, and the last elements will arrive in the coming days.
Virtually no analysts believe Trump will keep such a large “armada” in place past mid-March without using it to go to war or disbanding it upon reaching a deal. But points to keep in mind are as follows:
• Every single analyst has been wrong to date about the predictions that Trump would have attacked or reached a deal long before now.
• Iran is extremely skilled at drawing out negotiations.
• Trump is struggling over possibly the largest decision of his presidency, with vast domestic and global pressures and counter-pressures pushing him in opposite directions.
All of these issues mean that Trump could get stuck in a holding pattern, continuing to hope that some clearer and better solution will present itself rather than a full war or a deal that will be perceived as weak.
Originally, Israeli analysts were split about whether Khamenei would order an attack on Israel in response to a US strike. Some believed that he would order a counterattack no matter what, while others thought that if Jerusalem were clear about staying out of the fray, the Islamic Republic might only counterattack against US bases and ships in the region.
As time has drawn on, Israeli leaders have made more noise about joining an American-led strike on the regime. This has also increased the probability that Tehran will attack Israel, either in response or in anticipation of expected IDF involvement.

A Border Police officer was killed by a bullet fired from a weapon by an IDF soldier in an accidental incident on Sunday.
The circumstances are under investigation by both the Israel Police and the military police.
The victim was later identified as Policeman Uri Mektaev, who was 18 years old.
Initial investigations appear to show that Mektaev was fatally shot in the head while in his home in Azor.
Police were notified shortly after. Magen David Adom paramedics attempted to perform CPR at the scene, but were forced to declare him dead.
Mektaev joined the Border Police in November and is the son of Ronen Mektaev, the deputy chief commissioner of the Fire and Rescue Authority.
He is survived by his parents and two brothers, KAN News reported.
National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir eulogized Mektaev in a post on X/Twitter on Sunday evening.
"Uri, only 18 years old when he fell, chose to serve the state like his father on the front lines of security action in the Training Brigade of the Border Police. There are no words that can comfort parents and siblings who have lost what is most precious to them before their time," he wrote.
"On behalf of myself and the citizens of Israel, I send warm condolences to his father, family, and friends. The Israel Police and the Border Guard will continue to accompany you and cherish the memory of Uri forever," he added.
Ben-Gvir, as part of his ministerial role, oversees the Israel Police, including the Border Police.
IDF kills terrorist who planned to throw explosive devices at soldiers in the West Bank
Earlier on Sunday, the IDF confirmed that soldiers during a Saturday night operation identified two terrorists approaching them while holding an explosive device.
The soldiers opened fire, killing one terrorist and arresting the other, the military confirmed.
Authorities arrest Palestinian near Hebron inciting pro-Hamas violence, support
Meanwhile, security forces arrested a Palestinian in his late 20s near Hebron under suspicion of inciting terrorism.
The individual was found to have made social media posts in which he expressed support for Hamas, praising terrorists. In one of the posts, he shared a video from the scene of a terror attack, along with calls for violence.
The suspect was transferred for questioning.
IDF Gaza Division commander changeover
Additionally, the IDF's Gaza Division held a changeover ceremony for its commander on Sunday.
Brig.-Gen. Liron Batito replaced Brig.-Gen Barak Hiram in the role.
The changeover ceremony was led by Southern Command chief Maj.-Gen. Yaniv Asor, IDF Ground Forces chief Maj.-Gen. Nadav Lotan and other IDF officials.
During his speech, Asor praised Hiram's time in the role over the past year and a half, a large majority of which involved intense combat operations in the Gaza Strip as part of the Israel-Hamas War.
Liron Batito was previously the commander of the military's Givati Brigade.
Alon Hachmon and Walla contributed to this report.

Preempting the proxy: Israel moves to contain Hezbollah before Iran clash - analysis
Unknown

Israel’s latest strikes in Lebanon are not just another round in the slow-burning shadow war with Hezbollah. They are part of something larger: an effort to ensure that if the US - or Israel - strikes Iran, Tehran’s most powerful proxy will not be able to carry out the mission it was built for.
For decades, Hezbollah has served as Iran’s forward deterrent against Israel, with a massive arsenal positioned on Israel’s northern border designed to unleash massive rocket and missile fire in the event Iran’s nuclear facilities or regime come under attack. That strategic logic has not changed. What has changed is Israel’s determination to degrade that capability before a wider confrontation begins.
On Friday, Israel carried out strikes deep in the Beqaa Valley, which - according to Lebanese officials - killed at least 10 people and eliminated several Hezbollah missile-unit commanders.
This fits into a pattern that has intensified over the past month: sustained IDF action targeting long-range missile sites, command centers, and Hezbollah’s efforts to rebuild military infrastructure. These strikes, Israeli officials acknowledge, are meant to disrupt the group’s readiness and force build-up, including missile units planning future attacks on Israel.
The timing is telling. A similar surge in Israeli activity took place late last May, just weeks before the June 12 war with Iran. Then, as now, Israel appeared intent on degrading Hezbollah’s capabilities before events elsewhere triggered escalation.
Hezbollah did not launch a missile barrage during the 12-Day War
What makes that comparison particularly relevant now is what happened next - or rather, what did not happen.
Despite longstanding Israeli assumptions that any attack on Iran would automatically trigger massive rocket fire from Lebanon, Hezbollah did not launch a sustained missile barrage during the 12-Day War - the feared all-out northern front never materialized.
Why Hezbollah stayed restrained remains debated. One explanation is that the group had little appetite for inviting Israeli attacks that could have further degraded its military infrastructure, already devastated during the October 7 war.
Another explanation concerns domestic pressure. Lebanon is economically shattered and politically fragile. A decision to unleash massive rocket barrages in the service of Iran - one that would have invited heavy retaliation from Israel - could have triggered sharp backlash from Lebanese political leaders and large segments of the public asking why the country should again be dragged into a war not its own.
Whatever the mix of considerations, the restraint was notable. There is no guarantee, however, that those same calculations will hold this time, especially if the Iranian regime believes it is facing a do-or-die moment.
The Iranians appear not to be taking any chances with Hezbollah this time.
Arab media reports suggest Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps personnel are operating inside Lebanon and advising Hezbollah on operational planning. If Tehran concludes that its core assets are under threat, it may decide that its northern lever must be activated - and reportedly has personnel on the ground to ensure orders to do so are implemented.
The tempo of Israeli strikes
That possibility helps explain the tempo of Israeli strikes.
January alone saw 87 Israeli airstrikes in Lebanon - more than double December’s number and the highest number since the ceasefire went into effect in November 2024 - with roughly half targeting infrastructure north of the Litani River, Hezbollah’s operational heartland, according to the Alma Research and Education Center.
February has also seen intense action, including drone strikes, artillery fire, and targeted eliminations. The campaign appears designed to reduce Hezbollah’s ability to launch large-scale fire if ordered to do so.
Lebanon’s internal political landscape adds another layer of complexity.
President Joseph Aoun has called for international intervention to halt Israeli strikes, warning that Lebanon’s involvement in a wider war would have devastating consequences. Prime Minister Nawaf Salam has described the current situation as a “one-sided war of attrition.” Influential Lebanese political figures are reportedly urging neutrality, concerned that Hezbollah could drag the country into a regional war not of its choosing.
That tension strikes at the core of Hezbollah’s domestic narrative. The group portrays itself as the “defender of Lebanon.” But if it launches massive rocket barrages in response to an Iran-related escalation - prompting extensive Israeli retaliation - that image would fracture, and the organization’s legitimacy inside Lebanon would be dented.
Israeli officials have indicated that escalation would not remain confined to tit-for-tat exchanges. In past confrontations, such dynamics have expanded beyond individual launch sites to broader strikes against Hezbollah’s military infrastructure, with the risk that Lebanese infrastructure could be hit as well.
Israel’s overall posture toward Lebanon since October 7 has changed dramatically. As Brig.-Gen. Yuval Gez, commander of the IDF’s 91st Division, told leaders of northern communities last week: “Our responsibility is not only to respond, but to anticipate, initiate and defend.” He said the IDF was prepared for “various scenarios,” with forces deployed along the entire border and deep into Lebanese territory. The language suggests preparation not only for deterrence, but for rapid escalation.
The central question is whether Hezbollah will once again remain on the sidelines if confrontation erupts between Israel and Iran, or whether Tehran will decide that this is the moment to activate the asset it has invested billions of dollars in building up precisely for this purpose.
Israel’s current strategy is designed to shape that decision before it is made. By degrading missile units, targeting command centers, and keeping up the military pressure, Jerusalem is seeking to ensure that even if Hezbollah chooses to fire, its capacity to damage is reduced.
It is also sending a message to the organization that if it acts on Iran’s orders, the consequences will be devastating.
One thing is clear: Israel is no longer assuming that last year’s restraint will hold. If Tehran pulls the Hezbollah lever this time, Jerusalem is working to ensure that there will be far less force behind it.

Pentagon Pizza Index: How late-night pizza orders can signal impending military action - analysis
Unknown

US Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has made his position on military fitness clear. He has no patience for "fat troops" or unready formations.
"It's tiring to look out at combat formations and see fat troops," Hegseth recently remarked. "Likewise, it's completely unacceptable to see fat generals and admirals in the halls of the Pentagon."
Yet for intelligence analysts and open-source intelligence (OSINT) enthusiasts - and particularly observers in Iran - the dietary habits of those Pentagon generals may signal something else entirely. Specifically, their late-night junk food orders are viewed by some as an indicator of impending US military action.
The theory is known as the "Pentagon Pizza Index" (PPI). It suggests that sudden spikes in pizza deliveries to US government buildings in Washington, particularly the White House and Pentagon, correlate with imminent military operations.
The legend dates to the 1980s. In 1983, on the eve of the US invasion of Grenada, and again in 1989 before the invasion of Panama to capture dictator Manuel Noriega, Washington-area pizzerias reportedly experienced unusually high demand.
The pattern became more widely discussed during the buildup to the first Gulf War in 1991. Frank Meeks, who owned more than 40 Domino's Pizza franchises in the Washington area at the time, told the Los Angeles Times that while news organizations might be asleep at 2 a.m., his delivery drivers were not.
"The PPI is a phenomenon online that claims the activity of certain pizza parlors around the Pentagon or around other buildings in Washington indicates that there's an international crisis or some kind of military action that's forthcoming," Marcel Plichta, a research fellow at the Center for Global Law and Governance at the University at St Andrews, told The Jerusalem Post.
According to the theory, when lights remain on at the Pentagon and in the White House Situation Room, staff cannot leave for dinner. As a result, pizza orders increase.
Supporters of PPI argue that it has remained relevant through major operations, including the killing of Osama bin Laden and the operation to capture Venezuelan president Nicolas Maduro and his wife. It has also been linked to operations involving Israel.
Hours before the Israeli airstrikes on Iran in June 2025, observers again pointed to unusual activity. The PPI monitoring account on X/Twitter noted that almost all pizzerias in Washington experienced a spike in activity during the overnight between June 12 and June 13.
"When there was action, for instance, when there was conflict between Israel and Iran or involving the United States, they would notice that during that period Google would say there was increased activity at these pizza parlors," Plichta said.
Pentagon official: Pizza index is "fake, but funny"
Despite the lore, Pentagon leadership remains skeptical. "It's fake, but funny," a former senior Pentagon official told the Post.
When asked about the reliability of fast food as a geopolitical barometer, Hegseth dismissed the idea and suggested he might use it to wage psychological warfare on OSINT trackers. "Next time there's going to be an airstrike, have you guys thought about maybe just going to the cafeteria?" Hegseth was asked.
"I've thought of just ordering lots of pizza on random nights just to throw everybody off. Some Friday night, when you see a bunch of Domino's orders, it might just be me on an app throwing the whole system off," he responded.
The methodology has evolved beyond pizza. Plitcha notes that some analysts now track what they call the "Bar Index," monitoring foot traffic data at nightlife venues in the Washington area to see whether staffers are absent from their usual gathering spots.
"They pull in data from like gay bars or local bars in the area out of the belief that it gives a fuller picture of what's happening," he said.
However, relying on fast food and nightlife data carries risks, he cautioned. "You see consistent spikes around meal times and around holidays that can sometimes read as a false positive. It's very easy to get confused by the data and think that there's greater activity than there actually is."
Yet, PPI remains a popular tool among online observers attempting to anticipate potential military action involving Tehran or Baghdad. But under the Trump administration, analysts may find that tracking US President Donald Trump's social media feed proves a more accurate metric than monitoring late-night food deliveries.

Violence erupts in Mexico amid military operation that reportedly killed cartel leader
Violent clashes erupted in parts of western Mexico on Sunday amid a military operation that led to the death of the Jalisco New Generation Cartel leaderm triggering widespread security concerns throughout the region.
A federal official, who requested anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly, told the Associated Press that the Mexican army killed Nemesio Rubén Oseguera Cervantes, also known as "El Mencho," during an operation in the western state of Jalisco. In a statement on X, Baja California Gov. Marina del Pilar also said the leader of a criminal organization was killed, though she didn't identify them.
The operation followed several hours of roadblocks with burning vehicles in Jalisco and other states. Such tactics are commonly used by the cartels to block military operations.
Jalisco Gov. Pablo Lemus Navarro activated a "code red," which is a protocol for a state of emergency or security crisis, in response to the clashes. In a post on X, he said public transportation was suspended across Jalisco and urged people in the area to remain in their homes until the situation was under control.
Videos circulating on social media showed plumes of smoke billowing over the city of Puerto Vallarta, a major city in Jalisco, and sprinting through the airport of the state's capital in panic.
Air Canada temporarily suspended operations at the Puerto Vallarta Airport because of what it described as "an ongoing security situation in Puerto Vallarta" that impacted the airport.
"We are monitoring the situation and in contact with local authorities who are working to resolve the issue," the airline said.
The U.S. State Department had offered a reward of up to $15 million for information leading to the arrest of El Mencho.
In February, the Trump administration designated the cartel as a foreign terrorist organization.

The three costly purchases that retirees say they regret

The three costly purchases that retirees say they regret
‘Retirement means there is no paycheck to recover from major mistakes,’ one expert warned
- Bookmark
- CommentsGo to comments
The golden years were never meant to be tarnished by regret.
Yet that’s where some retirees find themselves after making purchases that seemed good in the moment but turned out to be a drain on finances or didn’t justify the money spent on them. In the wake of these missteps, retirees often ponder what they should’ve done differently.
“When I ask [my retired clients] what they wish they had done instead, the answer is consistent: preserve funds and liquidity, strengthen guaranteed income, reduce taxes, and maintain flexibility,” Linda Jensen, founder of retirement-focused Heart Financial Group, told The Independent by email.
“Retirement means there is no paycheck to recover from major mistakes and we all know that emotional decisions can permanently damage long-term income and stability.”
While nobody can predict the future, knowing common regrets among retirees can help those in their golden years avoid costly mistakes.
Timeshare despair
Timeshares - fractional ownership properties often used for vacations - are one of the top regrets among retirees.
“The purchase that clients most regret is a timeshare,” said Marguerita Cheng, a certified financial planner and expert contributor at Annuity.org.
Fluctuating fees and lack of flexibility are two main reasons why timeshare purchases are often a decision retirees wish they could take back, Cheng told The Independent.
Industry research confirms Cheng’s observations. Some 87 percent of timeshare owners regret their purchase, with yearly maintenance fees driving that regret, timeshare exit specialists Alpha Timeshare Consultants said in a 2025 analysis.
Annual maintenance fees average over $1,200 per owner, Alpha said. Additionally, 63 percent of timeshare owners have difficulty booking the time and locations they prefer.
Making a measured decision about a timeshare with the help of a professional can ward off impulse timeshare moves that could sting later.
“Don’t rush into decisions,” Cheung said. “Allow yourself time. Working with a (certified financial planner) professional can help you navigate these scenarios.”
Homebuyer’s remorse
Another regret retirees often have is buying a second home or a vacation home. As nice as a beachside bungalow or mountaintop hideaway may seem, it’s not always a great idea, said Daniel Bleich, a board member of self-directed IRA firm Madison Trust.
“When imagining retirement, a vacation home or second home in a desirable location may seem like a good idea,” Bleich said in an email to The Independent. “In hindsight, many retirees often regret purchasing a second residence. While getting away may be enjoyable, often, the cost of taxes, insurance and maintenance [tends] to creep up as a hindrance.”
That hindrance can become even more prevalent when unexpected costs, such as medical emergencies, pop up.
“Combining this with paying two mortgages can possibly be overwhelming,” Bleich said. “Instead, many retirees would have preferred to designate a portion of their retirement savings to travel as opposed to a permanent destination.”
“To avoid this type of regret, consider renting a property first to get a feel for what the commitment might be like,” said Dr. Deon Strickland, a financial advisor at flat-fee financial advising firm Scholar Advising.
“Instead of buying something, rent it,” Strickland told The Independent. “If you think you want a mountain house, rent a mountain house for a year. Test it. Experiment before you make a big leap.”
Risky business
Retirement investments can be an emotional rollercoaster, as account balances may see significant rises and falls over time.
Those feelings - including regret - can be exaggerated when retirees allocate money to riskier, less-diversified investments when they’re already out of the workforce, Bleich said, especially when they realize they didn’t understand the details of their decision.
“Retirees who are investing to potentially generate returns for retirement tend to regret jumping on investment opportunities before truly understanding [their] full scope,” he said.
Riskier investments tend to need more time to generate returns, and retirees may not realize that when they invest. As a result, financial emergencies may force them to cash out their investment amid losses.
“Once an investor hits retirement age, watching their investment fluctuate can be stress-inducing, as there’s less time available for recovery,” Bleich said. “On reflection, investors may wish they allocated their funds across a wide variety of sectors and didn’t over-concentrate their savings on a single promising endeavor.”
To avoid the regret that higher-risk investments can trigger, retirees should make sure all of their necessary expenses are covered first, Bleich said.
Ensure you have enough money to meet your daily needs, top off your other investment and savings accounts, and set aside some money for fun things like hobbies. Then, use the remaining funds for high-upside, high-risk investments, Bleich said.
“Working side by side with a financial advisor can help retirees determine which expenditures are worthwhile, and how to best preserve their savings to last the stretch of their retirement,” he said.

DOHA, February 22. /TASS/. Iran and the US exchanged specific proposals on resolving differences over Iran's nuclear program during indirect talks in Geneva, with the republic noting some "encouraging signals," according to Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian.
"Iran is committed to peace and stability in the region. Recent negotiations involved the exchange of practical proposals and yielded encouraging signals," Pezeshkian wrote on X.
However, he stressed that Tehran continues "to closely monitor US actions and have made all necessary preparations for any potential scenario.".

How mainstream online tools are exposing Americans to organized crime, stalkers, and abusive exes
Even if you don't know data brokers, they almost certainly know you. With no nationwide U.S. privacy laws, experts warn there are often minimal safeguards against motivated people exploiting them for ill ends. Io Dodds reports

Julia had been dating her partner for about a month when the abusive phone calls began.
The partner had warned Julia when they got together that he had a stalker: a former girlfriend intent on sabotaging his life. But neither expected the woman to find the phone number for Julia’s family home and threaten her relatives with violence.
Soon Julia was being bombarded with emails, texts, and even a Venmo request with a note claiming to have "pornographic evidence" of her partner's infidelity. The woman walked past Julia's house, confronted her outside a McDonald’s, drove a nail into her car tire.
But how did the stalker know where to find Julia, who barely used social media? During a brief encounter, she got a worrying reply: "I found your info online."
That was how Julia, a white-collar worker in her thirties in the U.S. northeast, discovered the shadowy and barely-regulated industry of data brokers. When Julia searched her own name, and paid a small fee, she found her "whole life story": where she went to college, her past addresses, the names of her roommates and closest friends.
"It was shockingly personal, and made me feel incredibly vulnerable," Julia, who asked to be identified by an alias, told The Independent.
Even if you don't know data brokers — and most Americans don't, according to a recent survey — they almost certainly know you. These companies compile vast amounts of public and private information that they then sell on to customers.
Some of this data comes from public documents such as marriage certificates, drivers’ licenses and voter registrations. But bank records, loyalty cards, internet browsing histories, and even braking and acceleration logs from internet-connected cars are also sold to brokers by the collecting companies (often via a complex web of intermediaries).
The U.S. has no comprehensive nationwide privacy laws, meaning data brokers are barely regulated at the federal level and only partially in some states. Hence, experts say there are often minimal safeguards against people exploiting them for ill ends.
“We see data broker information used as a tool of abuse with alarming frequency, especially in stalking and coercive control cases,” Belle Torek, of the National Network to End Domestic Violence, tells The Independent.
“An abusive partner or ex doesn’t have to be particularly tech-savvy: they can easily Google a name and suddenly have an address, relatives, work history, and other identifiers that [they] can use to dox, harass, impersonate, and intimidate survivors.”
The consequences can be devastating. In 2020, a disgruntled attorney named Roy Den Hollander broke into the home of New Jersey federal judge Esther Salas disguised as a FedEx delivery man, killing her 20-year-old son Daniel Anderl and critically injuring her husband Mark before taking his own life.
Salas said in a statement that Den Hollander, a self-described “anti-feminist”, had used data brokers to assemble "a complete dossier" on her family, including her address and route to work.
More recently, an FBI affidavit stated that Vance Boelter — accused of murdering Minnesota Democrat Melissa Hortman and her husband Mark last June — possessed a notebook listing 11 data broker sites and their offerings. (The affidavit did not say whether Boelter accessed the sites.)
U.S. immigration authorities have also bought domestic flight data and cell phone location data from brokers to help track down undocumented immigrants, reports by 404 Media have claimed.
"It is safe to assume that data brokers have personal information ranging from your name, address, and phone number to your geolocation, political beliefs, and sexual identity," Sam Adler, co-author of an upcoming academic paper on how data brokers endanger abuse survivors, told The Independent.
An ‘uncontrollable beast’
In October 1999, a 20-year-old dental assistant named Amy Boyer was shot dead in Chicago by a stalker who had bought her details from a private investigations company.
It was an early sign of how dangerous society's ever-increasing accumulation of digital data could be in the wrong hands.
There are at least 750 data brokers in the U.S., according to digital rights group Privacy Rights Clearinghouse. They range from tiny, fly-by-night firms on strip malls to globe-spanning titans with Park Avenue headquarters.
"People search" websites, such as industry leaders Spokeo, WhitePages, and Intelius, allow practically anyone to look you up for a small fee (sometimes less detailed searches are free). Meanwhile, credit reporting giants such as Experian, Equifax, and TransUnion and data crunchers such as Acxiom, Epsilon, CoreLogic — the largest by revenue, according to data deletion service OneRep — limit their products to business customers such as marketers, banks, debt collectors, and realtors.
CoreLogic, Experian, Equifax, Epsilon,, Intelius, Spokeo, WhitePages, and the Association of National Advertisers did not respond to questions from The Independent. The Consumer Data Industry Association, an industry lobby group, declined to comment.
The industry says its services are crucial for businesses to verify customers or run background checks, as well as for law enforcement investigating crimes. They also help journalists check facts and find sources. (Like many news outlets, The Independent uses legal information provider, LexisNexis, to search public records.)
Some parts of the world have robust laws limiting this trade, such as the European Union’s GDPR. But only 20 U.S. states have similar “comprehensive” data laws — and none are as strong as GDPR, according to the Center for Information Policy Leadership.
State DMVs are explicitly permitted by law to sell personal data. Cell phone carriers, payment providers, car companies, menstrual tracking apps, and an app for tracking a child’s location: all have sold users' data to third parties, according to media reports and academic studies.
Some of this data is incredibly sensitive. The World Privacy Forum, a non-profit campaign group, testified before Congress in 2013 that it had found brokers offering lists of rape survivors, seniors with dementia, HIV/AIDS patients, and potential alcohol or drug addicts.
In theory, that kind of data is usually restricted to business clients who must agree to only use it in certain ways. "We have extremely strong controls to protect the data we hold, and we carefully vet potential customers," a LexisNexis spokesperson told The Independent.
"Our databases are not available to the public; only to verified entities… after a thorough credentialing process. We audit customers, mandate customer training on how to use data legally, and monitor data usage to identify potential abusers."
Acxiom said it does not offer data to the general public, nor allow its customers to look up specific individuals, and that all its data is “ethically sourced” from “publicly available information and trusted sources”.
TransUnion said all its customers “are bound by rigorous contractual agreements and must certify that they have an appropriate use for the product."
But not all brokers make such efforts. A 2023 Duke University study found “seemingly minimal vetting of customers and seemingly few controls on the use of purchased data”, while Adler — a doctoral student at Fordham Law School — says the industry has practically zero safeguards against misuse.
"These companies are largely unregulated and have no incentive to inquire about their users or make it more onerous for them to quickly and frictionlessly purchase data," Adler argued.
Turquoise Williams, executive director of Just Stalking Maryland Resources, said when you combine a dangerous obsession with this level of access to someone’s personal life, the consequences can be terrifying.
"It seems to be this beast that is uncontrollable," Williams, a survivor of a violent stalker, told The Independent.
‘I live in perpetual fear’
It has been four years since Julia's ordeal began, and the stalking continues to this day.
"I don't give my phone number out for almost anybody, and I live in perpetual fear of my data leaking out," she told The Independent. "I have extreme anxiety now... I've kind of stopped being forward and making new friends…I don't really go out that much anymore."
She is far from alone. According to Meghan Land, executive director of Privacy Rights Clearinghouse, data brokers have been a "common subject of complaints" to her group for "many years", especially for victims of abuse, identity theft, and fraud.
"Victims can see the unsuccessful result of what are often great efforts they’ve undertaken to protect their information," Land told The Independent.
Jessica Tunon, a financial consultant in her forties in Washington, D.C. and founder of the wellness firm Netwalking, similarly believes her stalker was able to track her by using data brokers even as she relocated multiple times.
"I always felt like I was being followed," Tunon told The Independent. "There was never a time when I didn't feel like someone was watching me. Being on high alert for that long definitely affected my health, my wellbeing, my stress."
The stalking continued for 13 years, and only stopped when she got a lawyer involved.
It’s not just abuse survivors who are put at risk. In 2020 and 2021, three brokers — Epsilon, KBM, and Macromark — admitted knowingly supplying information on millions of vulnerable elderly people to scammers who defrauded them of savings, according to the Justice Department. Two Epsilon employees were later jailed.
Last year the data removal service Atlas, on behalf of roughly 20,000 New Jersey law enforcement workers, filed class action lawsuits against 118 data brokers for failing to stop selling their information under Daniel's Law (named in honor of Judge Salas's son).
One police officer, who had helped take down an organized crime group, discovered the criminals had hired a private investigator to get her address from data broker websites and taken night-time exterior photos of her child’s bedroom window, one lawsuit alleged.
Another officer was targeted by an online influencer whose fans allegedly got his details from data brokers then spread them online, leading to death threats and a neighborhood visit from two armed, masked men.
‘A burden on your daily life’
Many data brokers say that individuals can opt out of having their personal information shared. But research suggests these requests are not always honored — and if they are, sometimes the information reappears within months.
"It is extremely challenging," says Hayley Kaplan, a privacy consultant who helps celebrities, police officers, judges, rape victims, and others, scrub personal information from data brokers. "Sometimes you can't reach anybody. They have phone numbers that are disconnected. Contact forms that don't work. [And sometimes], when you do reach them, they'll say 'no problem!', but then not actually do it."
Muriel, a rape survivor who asked to be referred to by an alias, told The Independent: "I find a lot of them to be incredibly dodgy and shady.... sometimes they'll just flat-out lie to you.”
Even when brokers remove personal data, it takes ongoing efforts to keep it offline. One woman quoted in Adler’s paper described it as “like playing whack-a-mole… a burden on your daily life.”
Adler and his co-authors propose a centralized, government-maintained register of people who’ve opted out, putting the onus on brokers to obey or face penalties.
The industry would probably resist that, just as it reportedly lobbied hard against Daniel's Law and California's DELETE Act, which gives consumers more power to opt out of having their data shared. The World Privacy Forum, the campaign group, describes past self-regulation efforts by the industry as “lacking credibility, sincerity, and staying power”.
For now, those endangered by the sale of their data must rely on patchwork regulation. California, Vermont, Texas, and Oregon all require data brokers to delete data upon request, though privacy advocates say there are loopholes.
Some people try to minimize their online footprint using P.O. boxes or state-backed home address confidentiality programs. Some 40 states offer such schemes, according to the Safety Net Project, although scope and eligibility vary.
Paid services such as DeleteMe, Optery, and EasyOptOuts can also help by automatically submitting opt-out requests to data brokers on your behalf. But these cost anything from $20 to $250 per year for one user, and they’re rarely comprehensive.
"I don't make a ton of money," says Julia. "[But] I have to pay for a lot of different services. The data cleanup services, the burner phone services, the misdirected package services. It's expensive and anxiety-inducing."
As for the brokers, her opinion is frank. "I think [they're] the scum of the Earth."

Home owners struggle as insurance premiums rise 51pc in five years

Home owners struggle as insurance premiums rise more than 50 per cent in five years
In short:
Home insurance premiums have increased by 51 per cent in the past five years, according to data analytics firm Finity.
Homes at risk of natural disasters have the biggest premiums, with a Brisbane resident in a flood-prone area quoted more than $70,000 a year.
What's next?
The Resilience Building Council is working with homeowners to create safer builds, which could reduce risk ratings and lower insurance costs.
Since the Black Summer bushfires, the cost of home insurance for Paul and Denise Cameron has almost doubled.
The retired couple, who live in Dargen, near the New South Wales Blue Mountains, built their home in the months before the catastrophic event.
"The fire came right up to the front of the house [and] took out a few of the trees along the front," Mr Cameron said.
"In one sense, I think we were lucky because the fire went sort of around us rather than straight through as it did at the other end of the street."
The annual cost to insure their home has increased from $2,603 in 2019 to $5,071 today.
That is after a 30 per cent discount from their provider, NRMA, because they hold multiple policies and have been a customer for 50 years.
They shopped around, but ultimately, only NRMA would insure them.
"When I went to a number of companies, they wouldn't insure us at all up here, so we only really had one company,"Mr Cameron said.
The average cost of home insurance has increased by 51 per cent across Australia over the past five years, according to analytics firm Finity.
In 2020, the average cost for home insurance was $1,940. By October of last year, that number was $2,938.
Darwin the most expensive city for home insurance
When looking around the country, Finity data shows residents in Darwin pay the most for home insurance, followed by Sydney and Brisbane.
The most expensive areas to insure a property are the ones hit hardest by natural disasters.
Residents in Brisbane's west pay the most, averaging $8,396 a year, with residents in Darwin City and Sydney's outer west and Blue Mountains region averaging $5,410 and $5,350, respectively.
According to documents seen by the ABC, a Brisbane woman, who was affected by the 2011 and 2022 floods, was quoted $70,000 a year by Suncorp and $60,000 a year by Suncorp's subsidiary AAMI when searching for a new insurance provider last year.
In response, a Suncorp spokesperson said in a statement that insurance premiums continued to be affected by "the increasing frequency and severity of extreme weather events, rising construction costs, and persistent inflation, challenges that impact insurance affordability for all Australians".
"Suncorp employs sophisticated data modelling techniques and comprehensive risk assessment methodologies to determine premiums for individual properties," the spokesperson said.
Two major contributors to premium increase
Finity principal Stephen Lau said an increase in disasters caused by climate change and an increase in building costs have been the main drivers for insurance price hikes.
"That premium reflects the underlying risk that the insurers face," he said.
"So, if you live in a high-risk flood area, or if you live in a high-risk bushfire area, you're likely to be charged a higher premium because it reflects that potential risk that home is facing.
"If you looked at the materials and the building's costs, and to some degree the labour costs required to help rebuild and repair homes, a lot of that work is very high [cost]."
Mr Lau said "insurers were dealing with around 300,000 claims or more" for the 2022 floods, putting pressure on demand for repairs and building materials.
Reducing the risk to your home
The Camerons worked with the Resilience Building Council (RBC), which provides a free service to support homeowners in reducing the risks of natural disasters on their homes, which will hopefully also lower their premiums.
CEO and founder Kate Cotter said the RBC supported home owners to take "specific actions" to reduce the risk to their properties and measure the risk through a ratings program that ranges from one to five stars.
"That might mean for flood, that we strengthen that structure so its walls and foundations don't fail in a flood event … we might change out floor materials and wall materials so it doesn't suffer so much damage," she said.
For other disasters, the action plan will focus on different parts of the home.
"For storms, taking action might look like protecting windows and secure roofing … for bushfires, there are lots of small actions you can take, like ember screens, cleaning up flammable materials around the home," Ms Cotter said.
"Insurers are able to price that resilience into premiums now and not just offer insurance, but also be able to reduce premiums."
For the Camerons, it wiped about $500 off their annual premium, as they had built their home with fire risk in mind.
"I sent in a variety of photographs [to the RBC] … and they sent me a certificate which I then presented to the insurance company and the insurance company eventually took it into account," Mr Cameron said.
But for others, affording insurance remains a real struggle.
According to Actuaries Institute data, 15 per cent of Australian households cannot afford home insurance, something Ms Cotter worries will only grow.
"The trajectory is only going in one direction, so unless we take action and adapt our buildings and also reduce risk at the community level, those two actions need to happen to ensure that we've got a functioning insurance market," Ms Cotter said.
The Insurance Council of Australia said that since 2020, extreme weather events had cost insurers a total of $25.3 billion, which is an average of $4.8 billion per year, up 38 per cent from the previous five years.
"Insurers and government have been leaning in to tackle Australia’s protection gap, including looking at best practice public-private-partnerships overseas," an Insurance Council of Australia spokesperson said.
"We're in discussion with the federal government about what would be effective in the Australian context across mitigation and adaptation, land use planning, and appropriate partnerships between industry and government."
Impacts on businesses rising
Businesses are also suffering, with insurance comparison site BizCover data showing business claims for severe weather events had almost doubled in the last three years.
Power outages, fires and storm damage rank as the top threats to business operations nationwide.
"It doesn't take a massive event to impact a small business, even something like a heatwave that can damage power supply really means that small businesses can't operate," said BizCover general manager Brad Miller.
In some states, severe weather event claims are the second most reported incident behind theft, with claims averaging $39,000, but reaching as high as $200,000.
Mr Miller advised businesses to shop around to compare insurance options and have a plan B.
"It's important for companies to go and have backup power options, look for surge protectors, any kind of fire mitigation strategies at potentially other locations where they can operate from and have very good tested disaster recovery plans so their outage is minimised," he said.

Iran believes potential deal with US should include sanctions relief — foreign minister

WASHINGTON, February 22. /TASS/. Tehran assumes that potential agreements with Washington on Iran's nuclear program will include the lifting of some Western sanctions, Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi said on CBS TV.
Speaking about the signing of the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) in 2015, he noted: "Ten years have passed, and there is a new situation. Our nuclear program has advanced, it is technologically more advanced than at that time, and there are, of course, more sanctions and more pressures. So I believe that a better deal than the JCPOA or the 2015 nuclear deal is possible. And there are elements that could be much better than [in] the previous deal," he added.
"I negotiated that deal," Araghchi noted, referring to the JCPOA. "We went into so many details, but I think right now, there is no need for that much details. We can agree on basic things, and we can make sure that Iran's program, nuclear program, is peaceful and remains peaceful forever, and at the same time more sanctions would be lifted," he added.
In 2015, Iran, along with China, France, Germany, Russia, the UK and the US signed the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), resolving a crisis that had begun in 2002 amid Western accusations that Tehran was seeking nuclear weapons. However, in 2018, US President Donald Trump announced Washington’s withdrawal from the JCPOA and reinstated all sanctions against Iran. In response, Tehran declared in 2020 that it would scale back its commitments under the JCPOA. Several attempts have been made to make a new agreement on the Iranian nuclear program or resume the 2015 deal but none of them has been successful.

Mexican army kills leader of Jalisco New Generation Cartel, official says
The US State Department had offered a reward of up to US$15 million for information leading to the arrest of ‘El Mencho’
The Mexican army killed the leader of the Jalisco New Generation Cartel, Nemesio Ruben Oseguera Cervantes, “El Mencho”, in an operation on Sunday, a federal official said.
The official, who requested anonymity because they were not authorised to speak publicly, said it happened during a military operation in the western state of Jalisco.
It followed several hours of roadblocks with burning vehicles in Jalisco and other states. Such tactics are commonly used by the cartels to block military operations.
Videos circulating on social media showed plumes of smoke billowing over the city of Puerto Vallarta, a major city in Jalisco, and people sprinting through the airport of the state’s capital in panic.
The US State Department had offered a reward of up to US$15 million for information leading to the arrest of El Mencho. The former police officer had led the cartel, which he founded, since 2011.
The Jalisco New Generation Cartel is one of the most powerful and fastest-growing criminal organisations in Mexico.
In February, the Trump administration designated the cartel as a foreign terrorist organisation.

Reducing inequality means taxing capital more — including inheritances

Reducing inequality means taxing capital more — including inheritances
Treasurer Jim Chalmers and the new shadow treasurer, Tim Wilson, both say they are keen to do something about "intergenerational inequality".
That theme figured in both of their maiden speeches, Chalmers in 2013 and Wilson three years later, and they still talk about it frequently.
Chalmers is the only one who can do something about it for a while, specifically with Treasury's seventh Intergenerational Report due soon and the budget in May.
Will he? He says he will. And would Tim Wilson support him if he did? Probably not.
But I've got news for both of them: inequality, and specifically the intergenerational kind, will only be dealt with by taxing the people who have the money, not by cutting the taxes of those who don't have it.
The latter is much nicer, preferred by all politicians, but it won't work.
That's because the government can't afford to do more than a little bit of that, and even a little bit of it will worsen the structural budget deficit and end up worsening inequality by cutting government services.
To help reduce inequality, government services have to be expanded, not cut back.
More broadly, capital and wealth are not taxed enough, and labour is taxed too much, especially now as we enter the new era of AI that replaces labour.
A widening gap
In the past 50 years, the labour share of the economy has fallen from 62 to 54 per cent and the capital (profit) share has done the reverse. The gap is now likely to widen much more as capital in the form of AI and robots replace (human) labour — to an unknown extent.
Apart from the generational inequality that this produces, it leaves the government underfunded, with a structural deficit that's already about $40 billion.
Reducing the capital gains tax discount and limiting negative gearing would be a start, but only a start.
A kite with those ideas on it has been hovering over Parliament House for a few weeks now, with Chalmers responding to questions about what the kite is doing there by saying: "We haven't changed our tax policies."
He went on to say, in an interview with The Monthly: "As we think about what tax reform might come next, we're guided by this idea of intergenerational fairness, especially for working people."
Tim Wilson, meanwhile, has vehemently opposed any change to the CGT discount, on the grounds that it's A TAX INCREASE!
On September 20, 1999, the 14th anniversary of the capital gains tax's introduction, a 50 per cent discount replaced the previous inflation adjustment.
It was absurdly generous: inflation in the year to September 1999 was 1.8 per cent. The average holding period for an investment property is eight years, so a 50 per cent adjustment was more than three times the previous inflation adjustment.
Even if you take the average inflation rate over the subsequent eight years — 3.2 per cent — which is also what the Reserve Bank is currently forecasting for the next three years, the new CGT discount in 1999 was, and still is, twice as generous as it needs to be to offset inflation.
That begs the question of whether capital income should be adjusted for consumer price inflation at all.
Capital must be taxed more
Personal income tax scales are not adjusted for inflation (indexed), so we get bracket creep that is occasionally, and partially, offset by "tax cuts". But capital income from investing is over-adjusted by about double the inflation rate.
The result is a clear signal that capital income is preferred over labour income, which is why house prices started rising at double the rate of incomes from September 20, 1999, leading to a housing affordability crisis 25 years later.
It's true that the arithmetic difference to house prices that halving the CGT discount would make now is less than 2 per cent, but the psychological impact was far more powerful in 1999.
That impact was amplified by the fact that most people don't know what the inflation rate was over the previous few years and certainly couldn't average it in their heads, but everyone understands a discount of 50 per cent.
The world has changed, so what that psychological impact would be now is impossible to say. But whatever it is, it's important in principle to rebalance taxation towards capital and away from labour to improve intergenerational fairness — and to raise more money.
The younger generations tend to make more (all?) of their income from labour, while older generations, especially retirees, make it from capital.
The basis of the generational unfairness that both Jim Chalmers and Tim Wilson say they want to address is the fact that capital is taxed less than labour — a lot less — both in terms of gains in price and company profits.
That inequality is worsened by the fact that wage-earners have gone backwards over the past year — wages grew 3.4 per cent and prices 3.8 per cent — while housing gave a total 12-month return of 13.3 per cent and the ASX 200 share index gave a total return of 14.9 per cent.
So not only are the owners of capital getting returns that are four and five times inflation while employees go backwards, but they are taxed less as well.
This cannot be addressed only by cutting the taxes of the employed — that's already been done, with a structural budget deficit the result. Capital must be taxed more.
LoadingTwo big holes in the regime
Removing, or at least halving, the CGT discount is a start, but nowhere near enough.
Part of the reason the imbalance exists, apart from the advent of neoliberalism in the 1980s, is that capital became more mobile with the invention of the internet.
Capital taxation has become a matter of competition between countries trying to attract it or be the place for rich people to say they live.
That isn't going to change, which means capital taxation must focus on immobile capital — that is, minerals in the ground as well as housing above it, neither of which can be relocated to the Bahamas.
Australia doesn't tax its mineral wealth anywhere near enough, which everyone knows.
Labor tried to do something about that in 2010 with the Resource Super Profits Tax, and then the Minerals Resource Rent Tax in 2012, both of which were opposed by the Coalition and the mining industry (of course), and eventually repealed.
Presumably, the Coalition would oppose it again but, as it did with the GST, would introduce it once in power, having opposed it in opposition.
Which brings us to inheritance and the primary residence, the two big holes in Australia's capital taxation regime.
In a way, they lead to the same thing: the perpetuation of inequality, dealt with to some extent by the Bank of Mum and Dad, but only for those with well-off parents.
Australia had inheritance taxes from 1915 to 1975, after which they were abolished during a frenzy of state competition for rich retirees, which ended up being a nil-all draw.
It won't be brought back, but it should be if improving "intergenerational inequality" is the goal.

Protesters hang photo of Andrew leaving police station in the Louvre
Campaign group Everyone Hates Elon say they hung a photograph of Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor taken after his arrest in the Louvre.
An individual was filmed hanging a picture of the former prince, taken by Reuters photographer Phil Noble after Mountbatten-Windsor was released under investigation, in the Paris museum.
Mountbatten-Windsor was released under investigation following his arrest on suspicion of misconduct in public office over allegations he sent confidential government documents to convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.
The royal has consistently denied any wrongdoing.

Albanese changes tune on immigration and 'ISIS brides' as One Nation effect hits
A lot has been written about One Nation cannibalising the Coalition's vote, but less attention has been given to how the rise of the once-fringe party is also framing our political discourse and activating Labor.
The One Nation freight train is pushing our politics to the right, particularly on issues of immigration. Over the past week, we witnessed the hardening of the rhetoric used by Prime Minister Anthony Albanese on the so-called ISIS brides.
Albanese has an acute and battle-hardened radar for how these issues play out in the public — and he has spent the week trying to shut down any impression that Labor would be a soft touch.
On Sunday, the PM was again clear on the issue. There was nothing accidental about what he said when asked if the government was helping the 34 women and children who have been stuck in Syria: "I'm certainly not in contact with them, nor is anyone from the Australian government. What we have is a situation whereby, is Australia providing repatriation? Which did occur in 2019 and 2022 — no is the answer to that, and is providing no support for these people."
Albanese was in the parliament when Labor was last in government, and scores of boats arrived. It may not be the same as the ISIS bride issue, but it is adjacent politically, and he knows it can cause an inferno for Labor if it doesn't shut the issue down.
As opposition leader, Albanese knew he had to demonstrate to mainstream voters that Labor had learnt its lesson and would not see a repeat of the issue. His pragmatism in adopting contentious policies such as boat turn-backs and offshore processing showed he knew the party had to be seen as credible to get elected.
Back then, the biggest risk to Labor looking soft on these kinds of policies came only from the Coalition; now they are staring down a new risk.
Coalition's shift to right leaves the middle open
One Nation's hardline rhetoric is reshaping the political contest. And that means Labor's position is also shifting — out of necessity, not because of any change in ideology.
The party's hardheads have clocked this risk. A senior Labor figure tells me the one green shoot the shift is having is that it forces the Coalition to chase more hardline positions to compete on the right. This allows Labor to "occupy the middle ground" where elections are won and lost.
But the bigger question is how much the issue is actually changing the so-called middle ground.
We are now in a political environment where expressing sympathy for the women and children stuck in Syria is no longer politically palatable. There will be no redemption story and no attempt by Albanese or his colleagues to use the power of office to try and bring these women back or make the case for their rights.
The prime minister has made it clear to his cabinet that there must be a hard line. Even with the 94 seats that Labor holds, Albanese likes to remind anyone and everyone that he won't take the political risk.
Redbridge Group director of strategy and analytics Kos Samaras says the impact on Labor is starting to emerge.
"The One Nation impact on the Coalition is well covered. What is a lot more complex is the threat One Nation poses Labor. It's there, but it only occurs if the right conditions are present, and even then, it will impact very particular groups in very particular geographies," he says.
"Victoria is a good example, and so too is South Australia. In South Australia, the Labor premier is a massive asset and acts like a security fence against this threat.
"But in Victoria, the opposite exists, and the particular cohort I am talking about is moving to One Nation, so outer urban Melton and in other outer urban seats where second and third generation migrants reside in big numbers. Good example [are the state seats of] Kororoit, Sydenham. That's to name a few.
"Where does Albo fit within this paradigm? Somewhere in between. So he is making sure he contains breakouts in Hunter, Patterson and other similar electorates, even in some Brisbane seats recently won.
"This is especially important post Bondi as these particular voters are already unhappy with both sides' response to the incident."
LoadingHard line delivers hard language
The group of 34 women and children linked to Australians who travelled to the Middle East to fight for IS has been trying to travel home from a Syrian refugee camp.
But the sympathy for their plight is fast eroding in Labor — even key left-wing figures in the party are using hardcore language to rebuke the idea that the women were victims of coercion.
Senior Labor minister Tanya Plibersek delivered some of the strongest criticism yet of the women.
"Taking children into a war zone like this is child abuse," she told reporters in Melbourne. "It is important to understand the responsibility that these parents took in making this decision."
Their plight will likely remain the subject of much more political debate here over the coming months. But the reality is, putting aside the questionable decisions that saw these women go to the war zone, the children are again the victims of the poor decisions of both their parents and politicians.
Pity the children who must now pay for the sins of their relatives.

Redefining the Persian Gulf: Iran and the shift toward multipolar security

These professions work the least but are paid the most

The wage you earn is not always a reflection of how hard you work, and there are some key factors experts say can influence your pay.
Employee Earnings and Hours data released by the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) on 23 January provides a snapshot of the most highly paid Australians, as well as the hours they are paid for.
Workplace expert John Buchanan of the University of Sydney says wages can reflect how labour markets work with higher pay for more sought-after skills, but there is also an ethical element to the debate around how much people should be paid.
I think the relative pay structure is problematic these days because people at the top have been rewarding themselves in ways that are out of kilter with what's been going on with inflation and productivity.
Buchanan points to senior managers and chief executives, including university vice-chancellors, on salaries of more than $1 million.
He says the difference in pay between vice chancellors and other academic staff has widened.
An Australia Institute (AI) analysis released last year found vice chancellors in Australia were among the highest-paid in the world, with average wages reaching nearly $1.3 million by 2023. Their wages have almost quadrupled since 1985, when they were paid $300,000 on average (based on 2024 figures, adjusted for inflation).
In comparison, median wages for other workers in the university sector have risen by just 39 per cent, from $62,159 to $86,673.
Some professions are 'massively overpaid'
Buchanan says the increase for vice chancellors reflects a broader trend around executive pay.
Chief executive officer (CEO) remuneration surged last year, according to a survey released by Odgers and OpenDirector. It found the top 300 chief executives leading companies on the Australian Securities Exchange were earning an average of $3.86 million, up 10 per cent from the year before. (Total remuneration includes base salary as well as any allowances, superannuation, bonuses or commissions.)
However, "realised pay" can be higher because it includes funds received when options and shares vest.
As reported by the Australian Financial Review in November 2025, Australia's top-earning CEO last year was Develop Global's Bill Beament, who took home $59.6 million in realised pay — partly because options in the company were converted into shares.
Buchanan says those in the finance sector also enjoy higher wages because they have access to the large amounts of cash flowing through the industry.
"They're not making the economy any more efficient," he says.
I think you've got to stand back and say 'what's fair?'
Similarly, Buchanan says managers are able to "extract money out of cash flows they've got full visibility of".
"I think executives, key parts of the finance sector, and key parts of — particularly in the private medical sector — are massively overpaid."
Employees who work the longest hours
If you exclude chief executives and other high-level managers who have strategic responsibilities or oversee a significant number of employees, the average full-time Australian adult worker earns $2,061 a week before tax, according to the ABS. That's roughly $107,172 a year.
Their "ordinary time hours" are 38 hours per week for those working full-time. These agreed hours of work don't include overtime payments, leave loadings or redundancy payments.
If you include paid overtime, figures for "total hours paid for" show adults work an average of 39.2 hours a week.
None of those who work the longest hours feature among the highest-paid workers.
Truck drivers, who work 46.5 hours a week on average — much more than the overall average of 39.2 hours — earn $2,078 a week before tax.
The top earning profession in Australia is medical practitioners, who earn on average $3,554.10 per week, and work around 40.8 hours.
Several occupations with the highest earnings clock below-average paid hours.
These include miscellaneous specialist managers (specialist managers not classified elsewhere, including high-level officers in military, police and fire services); business administration managers; tertiary education teachers; as well as advertising, public relations and sales managers.
The working hours and average pay of chief executives and other high-level managers are not included in this data. A spokesperson for the ABS says it's drawn from a sample size of 50,000 jobs and "doesn't support this level of detail".
Employees who work the shortest hours
Among those who had the lowest paid hours, only one profession also appeared on the list of top earners — tertiary education teachers.
But experts say figures for paid hours may not reflect actual hours worked.
Associate professor in economics at Queensland University of Technology, Leonora Risse, points out that academics often perform unpaid overtime, such as marking student assignments and responding to student emails.
"Often you're doing research papers or ... when inspiration hits you're going to sit down and write. You [also] do your readings," she says.
"You're not going to wait until you're officially clocked on.
"Whereas if [your job involves going] to the site and you can only do that job on-site — whether it's retail or it's mining — when you clock off, you clock off."
This means that for jobs that require you to be on-site — such as those in construction or mining — you are also more likely to be paid for any extra hours.
Why are some people paid more than others?
When it comes to high-paying careers, Buchanan says some are justified by the high level of skills and education required, while others are industry-specific.
He notes mining — the highest-paid industry on average — is very capital-intensive and requires large investments in infrastructure and other assets to operate. But its product can be produced with few employees, which means workers can be well paid without dramatically impacting overall operating costs.
Around two per cent of the working population 17 years and older are employed in the mining industry in Australia. 18 per cent are employed in healthcare and social assistance, and 10 per cent are in education and training.
The relatively low number of employees in mining also makes the industry more vulnerable to stoppages or union strikes, so employers may be more likely to agree to worker demands.
"It doesn't take many people to tie up an awful lot of capital," Buchanan says.
Risse agrees and says working conditions also play a part, with higher wages potentially reflecting what's called a "compensating factor".
"It's remote work, it's dangerous, it's risky," she says.
But Risse says this explanation only goes so far, as other frontline workers or those in nursing can also face hazardous conditions, and this hasn't bolstered their pay to the same degree.
Another factor to consider is that those working in the mining industry are often FIFO (fly-in, fly-out) workers. When they're on-site, they often work very intensively, which can be seen in their longer-than-average working hours. This could make them eligible for overtime, night shifts, weekend rates or other penalty rates that push up their pay packets.
These factors may also help to explain why those in the electricity industry — who need to be highly skilled and sometimes work in remote areas overseeing large projects — such as power plants and transmission lines, are among the highest-paid.
Highly educated and skilled
Although people working in mining-related industries are among the highest-paid in Australia, they don't top the highest-earning occupations.
Medical practitioners, ICT managers (employees who oversee an organisation's technology systems and infrastructure) and miscellaneous specialist managers top the list. Doctors earn on average $3,554.10 a week, if you include overtime payments, while ICT managers earn $3,401.60 a week.
Many of the professions in the top 10 also worked average or below-average paid hours. The main exceptions to this are medical practitioners, construction, distribution and production managers and air and marine transport professionals.
AI chief economist Greg Jericho says the high rate of pay for some occupations — tertiary education teachers, for example — reflects the level of skill required for the job.
"You can't teach at universities unless you've pretty much got a PhD," he says.
"It is not something where you are quickly replaceable by another person.
"Generally, the more skilled you are or [the more] skills required for a job, the harder it is always going to be to find people who can do that job."
The workers getting an unfair deal
Buchanan says wage differences between skilled and unskilled jobs have remained remarkably stable for centuries, but the big change Australia has seen in the last 15 years has been the decline in public sector pay.
"Teachers and nurses have taken a big hit, and public sector doctors [have been] affected by public sector wage caps [particularly in NSW and Queensland]," he says.
He points to psychiatrists working in the public sector, who are relied on to assess those with mental health issues in the criminal justice system, but whose wages are capped. Buchanan says this can have a disincentivising effect.
"They could make double or triple their money by looking after the 'worried well' [in the private sector]. That's not a good incentive structure to have in your society," Buchanan says.
We should actually be saying, if you are looking after people who are putting our society at risk, technically you're actually performing a more important social function in my view, but that's not the way the labour market's working.
Another anomaly in the wages system is that women doing similar types of work to men are still underpaid.
Even among medical practitioners, there are inequities. The ordinary average earnings for men is $96.20 an hour, while women earn $77.30 an hour.
Risse points out that many of the higher-paid industries are also traditionally male-dominated, and those at the bottom are female-dominated or disproportionately represented by low-skilled or unskilled migrants.
"[Wages are] also a reflection of society-wide dynamics [around] what type of work is considered relatively more important and the way in which pay reflects status and power in society as well."

Netanyahu says India's Modi to visit Israel Wednesday
India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi will visit Israel on Wednesday, his counterpart Benjamin Netanyahu announced, saying the trip will help forge a new alliance to counter what he described as "radical" adversaries.
"On Wednesday, the Prime Minister of India, Narendra Modi, will arrive here; he will deliver a speech in the Knesset", Netanyahu said Sunday at the opening of a cabinet meeting, referring to Israel's parliament.
The premier hailed growing ties between the two countries.
"The fabric of relations has grown tighter, and (Modi) is coming here so that we can tighten it even more", he said, mentioning cooperation in the economic, diplomatic and security spheres.
Modi visited Israel as prime minister in 2017, before Netanyahu made a reciprocal visit to India the following year.
Netanyahu said the Israel-India axis will be part of a wider regional alliance to counter common "radical" adversaries.
"In the vision I see before me, we will create an entire system, essentially a 'hexagon' of alliances around or within the Middle East", the Israeli leader said.
"This includes India, Arab nations, African nations, Mediterranean nations (Greece and Cyprus), and nations in Asia that I won't detail at the moment", Netanyahu said, adding that he will further elaborate on his plan in the future.
"The intention here is to create an axis of nations that see eye-to-eye on the reality, challenges, and goals against the radical axes, both the radical Shiite axis, which we have struck very hard, and the emerging radical Sunni axis", he said.
Modi, on Sunday night, said he was "looking forward" to discussions during the Israel visit.
"India deeply values the enduring friendship with Israel, built on trust, innovation and a shared commitment to peace and progress", he said in a post on social media platform X.
During the war in Gaza, Israel was also engaged in bitter fighting with Iran-backed Shiite groups in the region that attacked Israel in support of Hamas after the Palestinian group led the 7 October 2023 attacks, which sparked Israel's war on Gaza.
Arch-foes Israel and Iran also faced each other in a first direct confrontation last June in a 12-day war in which the Israeli and US militaries targeted Tehran's nuclear facilities and ballistic missile arsenal.
"All of these nations share a different perception, and our cooperation can yield great results and, of course, ensure our resilience and our future", Netanyahu said of the emerging alliance.

Prominent Brits are facing a reckoning over Epstein. In the US, not so much | Arwa Mahdawi

The transatlantic Epstein divide
Schadenfreude isn’t a particularly noble sentiment. But who cares, eh? These days bad things never seem to happen to bad people; accountability is fleetingly rare. So I think we should all take a moment to really appreciate how glorious the arrest of Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor on suspicion of misconduct in public office on Thursday was. Not only was the disgraced royal dragged in for questioning like a mere commoner; the arrest happened on his 66th birthday. Instead of birthday cake, he got his just deserts. And, to top things off, the occasion was immortalized with a photo – an instant classic – of Andrew leaving the police station looking shell shocked and decrepit.
Mountbatten-Windsor has now been released from custody, but the investigation into allegations he shared confidential information with Jeffrey Epstein is ongoing. King Charles has said the “law must take its course” and the head of the Crown Prosecution Service has said that “nobody is above the law”.
Lovely as that last sentiment is, it’s not entirely true. If the law really were enforced evenly, then I think Andrew would have found himself in legal trouble a long time ago. Nobody, not even the king, seems to be quite sure how the former prince has managed to fund his extravagant lifestyle over the years. There has long been speculation that he abused his role promoting British trade abroad for personal gain, though he denies the claims. And when the late Virginia Giuffre brought a civil case against Andrew in New York in 2021, alleging he sexually assaulted her when she was 17 (allegations he denies), he managed to get his hands on £12m (more than $16m) to settle the case with no admission of liability. The reason the disgraced royal is being investigated now isn’t because the system is seamlessly working as it should; it’s because of the release of the Epstein files after Giuffre spent years bravely telling her story and trying to get justice. And, of course, she died before justice could be delivered. No formal police investigation in the UK followed her claims.
Still, while this royal reckoning may be a long time coming, we must take our victories where we find them. And the fact that, in the UK, the king’s brother is being seriously investigated for wrongdoing is undoubtedly a victory. Particularly as the royal isn’t the only high-profile Brit who has found himself in serious trouble over Epstein. Peter Mandelson, the veteran politician sometimes known as the Prince of Darkness, was fired from his post as the UK’s ambassador to the US last September after the release of emails which showed his close ties to Epstein. He’s also now the subject of a criminal investigation into allegations that he passed market-sensitive information to the financier. Epstein talked about getting intelligence from both Mountbatten-Windsor and Mandelson, boasting in one email: “I’ve got the UK sewn up.”
The Epstein revelations have also shaken Britain’s ruling party. While Sir Keir Starmer seems to be hanging onto his position as prime minister for now, his government has faced immense turmoil and Starmer has had to explain why he hired Mandelson despite having some knowledge of his links to the dead pedophile, even after Epstein’s conviction in 2008 for soliciting prostitution from a minor; Andrew’s relationship with him continued afterward, too.
The wheels of justice are also moving very slowly over in France. Back in 2020, a former modelling agent called Jean-Luc Brunel was arrested in relation to his connection with Epstein. Brunel was found dead in his Paris prison cell in 2022 after being accused of rape and held on suspicion of trafficking minors. (Security in certain prison cells sure does seem lax, doesn’t it?) The case again him was later dropped. Last weekend, however, the Paris prosecutor’s office announced it would re-examine Brunel’s case as part of a broader effort to review the Epstein files for evidence that might implicate French nationals.
Meanwhile, over in the US, there seems to be very little hope that justice will come for any of the powerful men connected to Epstein. The US commerce secretary, Howard Lutnick, has so far ignored the calls for him to resign over his Epstein links. The former boss of Victoria’s Secret and Epstein associate Les Wexner has testified before a congressional committee but faced no real consequences. The billionaire businessperson Leon Black still sits on the Museum of Modern Art trustee board despite his Epstein ties. I could go on and on. Certain people, including former US treasury secretary Larry Summers, who relinquished a Harvard teaching role amid an Epstein inquiry, have had to step back from their public roles, and a lot of reputations have been marred. But the only person who has seen criminal consequences in the US for their Epstein dealings is Ghislaine Maxwell, a British woman.
The discrepancy in Epstein-related fallout on both sides of the Atlantic hasn’t gone unnoticed, with a number of lawmakers calling it out. Skye Roberts, the brother of the late Virginia Giuffre, has also said the UK is doing far more than the US is. “I think that the king can hold his head high when he comes here saying: ‘I am doing the most that I can,’” Roberts said. “While here in the United States, our president has yet to even do even remotely the same.”
Why has there been so much more accountability in the UK than the US? One theory is that the British public have slightly less tolerance for bad behaviour. “It suggests to me we [in the UK] have a more functional media, we have a more functional accountability structure, that there is still a degree of shame in politics, in terms of people will say: ‘This is just not acceptable, this is just not done,’” the University of Manchester political science professor Rob Ford told the AP.
While that might be correct to some small degree, I don’t think Britain should be patting itself on the back too much. This is not a case of Britain’s accountability structures working well. Rather it’s a reflection of just how much Trump has exploded norms in the US and just how ingrained Epstein was with the US establishment and elites. According to one New York Times analysis, the Epstein files contain more than 38,000 references to Donald and Melania Trump, Mar-a-Lago and other related words. This isn’t to say that any of these references, some of which are unverified tips, are damning; Trump has said their relationship ended in the early 2000s. But there sure do seem to be a lot of links between the two men. Could the fact that Trump is more eager to talk about UFOs and the stock market than Epstein perchance have to do with the fact that the president of the US is desperately trying to cover something up? Certainly that’s what most people with a functioning brain think. More than half of Americans in a new Economist/YouGov poll said they believe Trump is attempting to conceal crimes committed by Epstein.
All this to say: get your act together, America. Two hundred and fifty years ago, you got rid of a king. Now, however, a country that likes to boast about its democracy has become a new sort of monarchy. An unelected ruling class lords itself over the rest of us from its modern castles. Its money shapes our politics and, with the media increasingly being controlled by billionaires, our opinions. And its privilege seems to offer complete protection from our laws.
Young Palestinian American killed by Israeli settlers in West Bank
Speaking of a lack of accountability, a 19-year-old Palestinian American man was killed and four other people injured when a group of Israeli settlers, reportedly backed by Israeli forces, opened fire on a village in the occupied West Bank. More than 1,000 Palestinians have been killed in the West Bank since October 2023; far more have been driven from their homes by relentless harassment. Meanwhile, foreign reporters are still not allowed in the ruins of Gaza to document the destruction.
Bill Gates cancels keynote speech in India amid Epstein controversy
When people hear the name “Bill Gates” now, an increasingly large number of people don’t think “vaccines, philanthropy, climate crisis”. They think: that creep who allegedly tried to slip his wife, Melinda French Gates, antibiotics because he’d contracted a sexually transmitted disease with “Russian girls”. Gates denies this, but French Gates heavily alluded to a lot of “muck” in their marriage and said her husband’s relationship with Epstein is one reason for their split. Certainly all the muck seems to have had some impact on his speaking engagements.
Congressman Randy Fine compares dogs to Muslims
The Maga lawmaker and proud bigot tweeted: “If they force us to choose, the choice between dogs and Muslims is not a difficult one.” He has now presented a “Protecting Puppies from Sharia Act” in response to the (fairly limited) backlash. You know, if Fine continues to act like a braindead Islamophobe, he has a good chance of becoming president one day.

Iran: Trump 'curious' as to why Tehran hasn't 'capitulated'

Iran: Trump 'curious' as to why Tehran hasn't 'capitulated'
February 22, 2026US President Donald Trump is questioning why Iran has not yielded to mounting military pressure, according to special envoy Steve Witkoff.
"I don't want to use the word 'frustrated,' because he understands he has plenty of alternatives, but he's curious as to why they haven't ... I don't want to use the word 'capitulated,' but why they haven't capitulated," Witkoff said in an interview on Fox News on Sunday.
"Why, under this pressure, with the amount of sea power and naval power over there, why haven't they come to us and said: 'We profess we don't want a weapon, so here's what we're prepared to do'? And yet it's sort of hard to get them to that place."
The United States wants Iran to give up its supplies of enriched uranium, which Washington says could potentially be used to make a nuclear weapon, and to stop supporting militants in the Middle East and accept limits on its missile program.
"They've been enriching well beyond the number that you need for civil nuclear [purposes]," said Witkoff, claiming Tehran was enriching uranium "up to 60%" fissile purity.
"They're probably a week away from having industrial, industrial-grade bomb-making material, and that's really dangerous," he claimed.
Iran: 'If US attacks, we have every right to defend ourslves'
Iran insists its nuclear program is peaceful but says it is willing to accept some limitations in return for the lifting of financial sanctions.
Trump on Thursday gave Tehran 10 to 15 days to strike a deal on their long‑running nuclear dispute or face "really bad things," amid a US military buildup that has raised fears of a wider Middle East war.
Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian said recent negotiations with the US "yielded encouraging signals."
"We continue to closely monitor U.S. actions and have made all necessary preparations for any potential scenario," he said in a post on X.
Negotiations had reached an impasse after US and Iranian representatives met this week in Geneva.
The next round of US-Iranian talks will be on Thursday in Geneva, Oman’s foreign minister said Sunday. Oman has mediated the negotiations.
Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi warned on Sunday that his country would strike back at US interests in the Middle East in response to any military action.
"If the US attacks us, then we have every right to defend ourselves," he said in an interview with US network CBS. "If the US attacks us, that is an act of aggression. What we do in response is an act of self-defense."
Araghchi admitted that the Iranian military does not have the capability to hit targets on the US mainland, and so would therefore target American bases in the Middle East. "It is justified and legitimate," he said.
Nevertheless, in a previous interview with US network MS Now on Friday, Araghchi had said that Tehran expects to present a proposal to Washington "in the next two or three days," once it is approved by senior officials. The draft would then be forwarded to Witkoff.
Iran: student protests continue in Tehran
Meanwhile, students staged fresh protests at several Iranian universities on Sunday as the new academic semester got underway.
The demonstrations coincided with 40‑day mourning ceremonies for those killed in last month's government crackdown — the deadliest unrest in Iran since the 1979 Islamic Revolution.
Iranian state television broadcast videos of what it said were individuals "pretending to be students" attacking "pro-government students" in Tehran who were taking part in protests condemning the disturbances in January.
A video purportedly showed rows of marchers at Tehran's Sharif University of Technology condemning Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei as a "murderous leader," and calling for Reza Pahlavi, the exiled son of Iran's toppled shah, to return as monarch.
Earlier in February, Pahlavi said US military intervention in Iran could save lives, and urged Washington not to spend too long negotiating with Tehran's clerical rulers on a nuclear deal.
On Sunday, US special envoy Witkoff said he had met with Pahlavi at Trump's direction, but did not provide further details of the meeting.

Trump's Board of Peace collides with the reality of Hamas's power in Gaza - opinion

US President Donald Trump on Thursday convened the Board of Peace in Washington for a significant kick-off meeting on his 20-point plan for Gaza.
As usual, Trump glorified the board and some of its members and participants and did not spare himself from self-aggrandizement and some exaggerated declarations about the peace agreements he had achieved in extremely short periods of time. He then referred to Gaza, stating that the war was over, except for a few small flames here and there.
The president also praised his team for helping to implement his plan and expressed confidence regarding dismantling Hamas, noting that the terror organization has pledged to disarm but will be disarmed by force if it does not do so voluntarily and peacefully.
Although the US president pledged $10 billion to the board’s budget and program, managed to mobilize several world leaders to support it and even join as members, and secured commitments from five countries to inject money into the board’s coffers and to send troops to the International Stabilization Force (ISF), the gap between these lofty declarations and the practical reality on the ground in Gaza is no less embarrassing.
If this gap is not closed, or at least reduced, Gaza’s residents will sink into a continuing reality of a life of hardship in a devastated region devoid of vitality and future. Israel will face a complex security challenge, which may escalate and spill over into other arenas. Regional security stability may be undermined, with further and dangerous erosion in relations between Israel, Egypt, and Jordan.
The core obstacle: Hamas remains armed
The essence of the gap between the vision, the festive atmosphere, the lofty declarations, and the reality on the ground stems from Hamas’s demonstrable and declared refusal to disarm.
It has denied its previous promises to disarm, and the group’s leaders have publicly reaffirmed their intention to retain weapons and continue the armed struggle against Israel until the end of the “occupation,” with some statements not necessarily clarifying the nature of the “occupation.”
Beyond that, Hamas is working vigorously to restore its military and governmental capabilities, including governors, ministers, and other officials, who, in its view, should be integrated into the new technocratic governmental system.
It demands the integration of 10,000 security personnel from its apparatuses into the new security system that will be established and operated by the technocratic government and has even vetoed the entry of Sami Nasman, the prospective internal security minister, into Gaza, essentially forcing him to operate outside the enclave.
In the reality that is emerging and concretizing with each passing day, Hamas is preparing the infrastructure for the “day after,” creating mechanisms to influence the functioning of the technocratic government.
In fact, it is perfecting Hezbollah’s model in Lebanon: a terrorist organization that dictates the agenda and the scope of action of the civilian government by force.
Hamas's control of all state institutions and the fact that the technocratic government will not be able to import teachers from India, engineers from Kazakhstan, doctors from Indonesia, and professionals from other countries, means the Gazan workforce – employed by Hamas, identified with the organization, and committed to or fearful of it – will not go against the terror group, even on the day its salary is paid by the technocratic government.
As long as Hamas is not disarmed and ceases to be an effective and present governing entity in Gaza, the technocratic government has no real chance of establishing alternative governance to Hamas and preparing the conditions for the beginning of the process of rebuilding the Strip.
The same is also true of the ISF, which has not yet been established.
Five countries have already announced their willingness to send soldiers to the task force, and Egypt, Jordan, and even European countries such as Italy have announced their willingness to train Palestinians who intend to serve in the security apparatuses in Gaza. An online tender for recruiting people for the new security apparatuses has even been published.
Yet, there is not a single military force that is ready and capable of dealing with Hamas and disarming it and demilitarizing the enclave. There is not a single country or government that is ready to send its soldiers to fight Hamas. And since the terror group is not ready to disarm voluntarily or by virtue of cooperation with the 20-point plan, this is nothing more than an embarrassing show.
The only chance of narrowing the gap between the launch and establishment of the Board of Peace and the beginning of a process of reconstruction and real change in Gaza is by disarming Hamas and dismantling it as a political/governmental force and by demilitarizing the enclave.
It would be better if President Trump were to succeed in leading Turkey, Qatar, and Egypt to force the move on Hamas, but the chance of that is almost nonexistent. These three countries, certainly Turkey and Qatar, cannot realize such a goal.
The other option is to order the IDF to complete the mission, which should have been completed long ago and which was also defined by the Israeli government as a war goal. Under current conditions, this is a completely possible mission due to Hamas’s relative weakness compared to its situation a year or two ago and due to the lack of hostages in the field, which greatly limited the IDF’s maneuverability.
President Trump will be able to reach this decision only after exhausting all other options and becoming convinced that there is no chance of implementing his own plan without dismantling Hamas and demilitarizing Gaza and that only the IDF can do this job.

A strong 7.1-magnitude quake struck early Monday off Malaysia's Sabah state on Borneo island, US seismologists said.
The epicentre of the quake was located less than 100 kilometres (62 miles) northeast of the coastal state capital Kota Kinabalu at a depth of 619.8 kilometres, the US Geological Survey said.
The quake struck at 12:57 am (1657 GMT Sunday).
The USGS rated the likelihood of casualties or damage as low, and the US Tsunami Warning Center did not issue an alert, saying the depth of the quake meant tsunami activity was not expected.
The Malaysian Meteorological Department said it would "continue to monitor the situation closely," putting the quake's magnitude at 6.8.
It said tremors were felt on Sabah's west coast and in several areas of Sarawak state.

Who’s El Mencho? Jalisco cartel’s drug kingpin the Mexican army killed
- Nemesio Rubén Oseguera Cervantes, known as “El Mencho” and leader of the Jalisco New Generation Cartel (CJNG), was killed during a Mexican military operation.
- The operation occurred on Sunday in the western state of Jalisco, following hours of widespread roadblocks involving burning vehicles, a tactic used by cartels to impede military movements.
- El Mencho was a highly sought-after figure, with the US State Department offering a reward of up to $15 million for information leading to his arrest.
- Formed in 2009, CJNG rapidly became one of Mexico's most violent drug cartels, estimated to have the highest capacity for trafficking cocaine, heroin, methamphetamine, and fentanyl into the United States.
- Under his leadership, the cartel was implicated in numerous homicides targeting rival groups and Mexican law enforcement, and faced multiple US indictments for conspiracy and distribution of controlled substances.

ASX set for uncertain start after Trump tariffs drama
Wall Street kept calm after the Supreme Court struck down President Donald Trump’s sweeping tariffs, which had triggered panic in financial markets when announced last year, and stocks ticked higher. But Trump’s promise on Sunday (Australian time) to reimpose them at 15 per cent for all nations has investors bracing for an uncertain start on the Australian sharemarket.
On Wall Street, the S&P 500 rose 0.7 per cent. It had been flipping between small gains and losses before the court’s ruling, following discouraging reports showing slowing growth for the US economy and faster inflation.
The Dow Jones added 230 points, or 0.5 per cent, and the Nasdaq composite rose 0.9 per cent. Australian sharemarket futures are pointing to a gain of 16 points, or 0.2 per cent at the open for the ASX, but this number was set before Trump’s move
Many on Wall Street were likely expecting such a ruling from the Supreme Court, according to Brian Jacobsen, chief economic strategist at Annex Wealth Management. That likely led to the relatively muted reactions across financial markets, and trading remained tentative as investors tried to suss out the long-term effects.
Trump said that the Supreme Court’s ruling had other countries “dancing in the streets, but they won’t be dancing for long.”
Among the tentative moves across markets, Treasury yields edged a bit higher in the bond market.
If investors thought the tariff ruling would improve inflation significantly, it could have sent yields lower. On the other hand, if investors were worried about the US government’s debt rising faster in the future because of the loss of revenue from tariffs, long-term yields could have jumped. For now, at least, yields held relatively steady.
The stock price of Ralph Lauren, meanwhile, rushed from an early loss to a gain of 3.3 per cent after investors learned of the Supreme Court’s ruling. But it quickly flipped back to a loss before finishing with a rise of 2.2 per cent. During April last year, the stock had dropped nearly 23 per cent in four days after Trump announced his tariffs because of worries about how they would hurt its profits.
In other markets, gold’s price slumped briefly after the ruling and then erased the loss. Stock indexes in Europe added to their gains from earlier in the day, while the U.S. dollar’s value edged down against other currencies.
Heading into the day, the main event for markets had seemed to be discouraging reports showing slowing US economic growth and accelerating inflation. They found a relatively muted response from investors.
While the reports underscore the tricky situation the Federal Reserve faces as it sets interest rates, they did not change traders’ expectations much for what the Fed will ultimately do. Traders are still betting that the Fed will lower rates at least twice this year, according to data from CME Group. Some shifted bets for the timing of when the cuts could begin to slightly later in the summer.
Lower interest rates would give the economy and investment prices a boost, but they also risk worsening inflation. Fed officials said at their last meeting that they want to see inflation fall further before they would support cutting rates further.
The yield on the 10-year Treasury remained at 4.08 per cent, where it was late Thursday. The two-year yield, which more closely tracks expectations for Fed action, inched up to 3.48 per cent from 3.47 per cent.
On Wall Street, Akamai Technologies dropped 14.1 per cent for one of the market’s sharpest losses. The cybersecurity and cloud computing company reported stronger results for the end of 2025 than analysts expected, but it gave a profit forecast for the upcoming year that fell short of estimates.
Akamai plans to spend a bigger percentage of its revenue this upcoming year on equipment and other investments. It’s the latest potential indicator of how shortages of computer memory created by the AI boom are affecting customers throughout the economy.
On the winning side of the market was Comfort Systems, which rose 6.5 per cent after the provider of heating, ventilation, air conditioning and electrical services reported a stronger profit for the latest quarter than analysts expected. CEO Brian Lane said his company is seeing “unprecedented demand.”
Al told, the S&P 500 rose 47.62 points to 6,909.51. The Dow Jones Industrial Average added 230.81 to 49,625.97, and the Nasdaq composite rose 203.34 to 22,886.07.
In stock markets abroad, indexes rose in Europe following a more mixed finish in Asia.
The Hang Seng fell 1.1 per cent, but South Korea’s Kospi jumped 2.3 per cent to a record, led by major defence contractors like Hanwha Aerospace. The company is one of many benefiting from a ramp up in military spending in many countries.

EU says US must honor a trade deal after court blocks Trump tariffs

EU says US must honor a trade deal after court blocks Trump tariffs
EU says US must honor a trade deal after court blocks Trump tariffs
BRUSSELS (AP) — The European Union’s executive arm requested “full clarity” from the United States and asked its trade partner to fulfill its commitments after the U.S. Supreme Court struck down some of President Donald Trump’s most sweeping tariffs.
Trump has lashed out at the court decision and said Saturday that he wants a global tariff of 15%, up from the 10% he announced a day earlier.
The European Commission said the current situation is not conducive to delivering “fair, balanced, and mutually beneficial” trans-Atlantic trade and investment, as agreed to by both sides and spelled out in the EU-U.S. Joint Statement of August 2025.
American and EU officials sealed a trade deal last year that imposes a 15% import tax on 70% of European goods exported to the United States. The European Commission handles trade for the 27 EU member countries.
A top EU lawmaker said on Sunday he will propose to the European Parliament negotiating team to put the ratifying process of the deal on pause.
“Pure tariff chaos on the part of the U.S. administration,” Bernd Lange, the chair of Parliament’s international trade committee, wrote on social media. “No one can make sense of it anymore — only open questions and growing uncertainty for the EU and other U.S. trading partners.”
The value of EU-U.S. trade in goods and services amounted to 1.7 trillion euros ($2 trillion) in 2024, or an average of 4.6 billion euros a day, according to EU statistics agency Eurostat.
“A deal is a deal,” the European Commission said. “As the United States’ largest trading partner, the EU expects the U.S. to honor its commitments set out in the Joint Statement — just as the EU stands by its commitments. EU products must continue to benefit from the most competitive treatment, with no increases in tariffs beyond the clear and all-inclusive ceiling previously agreed.”
Jamieson Greer, Trump’s top trade negotiator, said in a CBS News interview Sunday morning that the U.S. plans to stand by its trade deals and expects its partners to do the same.
He said he talked to his European counterpart this weekend and hasn’t heard anyone tell him the deal is off.
“The deals were not premised on whether or not the emergency tariff litigation would rise or fall,” Greer said. “I haven’t heard anyone yet come to me and say the deal’s off. They want to see how this plays out.”
Europe’s biggest exports to the U.S. are pharmaceuticals, cars, aircraft, chemicals, medical instruments, and wine and spirits. Among the biggest U.S. exports to the bloc are professional and scientific services like payment systems and cloud infrastructure, oil and gas, pharmaceuticals, medical equipment, aerospace products and cars.
“When applied unpredictably, tariffs are inherently disruptive, undermining confidence and stability across global markets and creating further uncertainty across international supply chains,” the commission added.
As primarily a trading bloc, the EU has a powerful tool at its disposal to retaliate — the bloc’s Anti-Coercion Instrument. It includes a raft of measures for blocking or restricting trade and investment from countries found to be putting undue pressure on EU member nations or corporations.
The measures could include curtailing the export and import of goods and services, barring countries or companies from EU public tenders, or limiting foreign direct investment. In its most severe form, it would essentially close off access to the EU’s 450-million customer market and inflict billions of dollars of losses on U.S. companies and the American economy.

DHS Sparks Confusion After Suspending Global Entry and Reversing Course on Precheck. Here’s What We Know

The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) said Sunday it would suspend two programs that allow millions of air travelers expedited airport security screening, only to reverse course the next day following an outcry from industry groups and passengers.
The DHS said Saturday evening it would suspend TSA PreCheck and Global Entry, blaming the partial government shutdown that has halted funding to the agency, sparked by a dispute between Democrats and Republicans over funding for Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE).
TSA PreCheck had more than 20 million active members as of 2024, while some 13 million people use Global Entry. Those who enroll in the programs enter a separate, often much shorter line at airport security.

DHS said that it would halt the programs from Sunday morning to “refocus Department personnel on the majority of travelers.” Secretary Kristi Noem said: "Shutdowns have serious real world consequences, not just for the men and women of DHS and their families who go without a paycheck, but it endangers our national security."
But later Sunday, the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) said PreCheck “remains operational with no change for the traveling public. As staffing constraints arise, TSA will evaluate on a case by case basis and adjust operations accordingly.”
The TSA added that courtesy escorts provided for members of Congress have been suspended “to allow officers to focus on the mission of securing America’s skies.”
The suspension of Global Entry, a U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) program, appeared to remain in place.
Industry backlash
The reversal followed an outcry from airline industry leaders, who said the short notice would cause chaos for passengers.
Chris Sununu, CEO of Airlines for America, which represents American Airlines, Delta Air Lines, Southwest Airlines, and United Airlines, said his organization was “deeply concerned that TSA PreCheck and Global Entry programs are being suspended and that the traveling public will be, once again, used as a political football amid another government shutdown.”
“The announcement was issued with extremely short notice to travelers, giving them little time to plan accordingly, which is especially troubling at this time of record air travel,” he added in a statement.
U.S. Travel Association President and CEO Geoff Freeman called the suspension “extremely disappointing,” and argued that lawmakers have used travel personnel as a “means to achieve political ends.”
A larger battle
The battle over airport lines comes as Democrats and Republicans continue to negotiate over how to end the partial shutdown over DHS funding.
Many DHS operations remain untouched during the shutdown, but agencies such as TSA are bearing the brunt of the impact as roughly 95 percent of its employees, about 61,000, have been forced to work without pay since the funding lapse began on Feb. 14 at midnight.
As part of what she said was an effort to “conserve resources” in response to the funding shortfall, Noem said that the Federal Emergency Management Agency would “halt all non-disaster related response to prioritize disasters,” the same day that a major blizzard is set to hit the East Coast. As much as 20 inches of snow is expected to fall in New York City.
According to Noem and the DHS, FEMA will not focus on past disasters during the shutdown, but only those “requiring immediate emergency action to protect lives or prevent catastrophic damage.”
The snowstorm has already affected airlines and airports, with more than 6,000 flight cancellations reported through Monday from Virginia to Maine ahead of the blizzard.
Rep. Bennie G. Thompson, a Mississippi Democrat and ranking Member of the Committee on Homeland Security, accused the Trump Administration of making travel “less safe.”
“This is Trump and Kristi Noem purposely punishing the American people and using them as pawns for their sadistic political games. TSA PreCheck and Global Entry REDUCE airport lines and ease the burden on DHS staff who are working without pay because of Trump's abuse of the Department and killing of American citizens,” he said in a statement.
The partial shutdown continues as the White House said last week that Democrats and Republicans are “still pretty far apart” on DHS and ICE funding. The shutdown began after Democrats demanded changes to immigration operations and President Donald Trump’s mass deportations in the aftermath of immigration officers shooting and killing two U.S. citizens during their crackdown in Minneapolis.

Netanyahu says Israel will forge regional alliance to rival ‘radical axes’
Israel to join with India, Greece, Cyprus and other Arab, African, Asian countries that ‘see eye to eye’, says PM.
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has announced that Israel plans to build a network of allied nations in or around the Middle East to collectively stand against what he called “radical” adversaries.
Netanyahu made the comments on Sunday while announcing the upcoming visit to Israel of Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, whose country the Israeli leader said would be part of the “axis of nations that see eye to eye” with Israel.

Netanyahu, who is wanted by the International Criminal Court on war crimes charges, also referred to Greece, Cyprus and other unnamed Arab, African and Asian countries.
“In the vision I see before me, we will create an entire system, essentially a ‘hexagon’ of alliances around or within the Middle East,” Netanyahu said, according to the Times of Israel.
“The intention here is to create an axis of nations that see eye to eye on the reality, challenges, and goals against the radical axes, both the radical Shia axis, which we have struck very hard, and the emerging radical Sunni axis.”
Modi said he fully agrees with Netanyahu on the “bond between India and Israel”, including the “diverse nature of our bilateral relations”.
“India deeply values the enduring friendship with Israel, built on trust, innovation and a shared commitment to peace and progress,” Modi wrote in a post on X.
Since the start of Israel’s genocidal war on Gaza, its assaults have been weakening the Iran-led “axis of resistance”, including Hezbollah in Lebanon. Israel and Iran also directly clashed last June in a 12-day war, in which the US military also joined to attack Iran’s nuclear sites.
Netanyahu did not elaborate on what he meant by “emerging radical Sunni axis”, but he has previously identified the Muslim Brotherhood as its leading element.
Relations between Israel and several predominantly Sunni Muslim states have soured amid the bloodshed in Gaza, including with Turkiye, whose President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has sharply criticised Netanyahu, and Saudi Arabia, which has accused Israel of genocide.
Prospects for normalisation between Israel and Saudi Arabia also appear to be eroding. In recent months, the kingdom has rebuked Israel’s recognition of Somalia’s breakaway region, Somaliland, as well as the Israeli moves towards annexation in the occupied West Bank.
Since 2020, Israel has pushed to establish formal ties with Arab and Muslim states as a way to shore up its regional standing as part of the US-backed so-called “Abraham Accords”.
Under that framework, Israel has been enjoying close relations with the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Morocco.

US says trade deals in force despite court ruling on tariffs
Sign up now: Get ST's newsletters delivered to your inbox
NEW YORK - US trade deals with the European Union, China and other partners remain in force despite the Supreme Court ruling that struck down many of US President Donald Trump’s tariffs,
“So we’re having active conversations with them. We want them to understand that these deals are going to be good deals,” US Trade Representative Jamieson Greer said on the CBS program “Face the Nation.”
He added: “We expect to stand by them. We expect our partners to stand by them.”
But European Central Bank president Christine Lagarde said on the same show she is not sure what the consequences of the US court decision are.
“So I hope it’s going to be clarified, and it’s going to be sufficiently thought through, so that we don’t have, again, more challenges, and the proposals will be in compliance with the constitution, in compliance with the law,” said Lagarde.
Mr Greer said a meeting planned for April between Mr Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping is “not to fight about trade.”
“It’s to maintain stability, make sure that the Chinese are holding up their end of our deal and buying American agricultural products and Boeings and other things, and making sure they’re sending us the rare earth that we need,” Mr Greer said on ABC.
On Feb 20, the US Supreme Court ruled 6-3 that the president had exceeded his authority in imposing tariffs under a 1977 economic emergency powers act, saying Congress had to give its approval.
New tariffs
Mr Trump reacted furiously and announced a new 10 per cent global duty on imports under a different legal authority, then raised it to 15 per cent on Feb 21.
“It’s important to understand that over the years, Congress has delegated enormous tariff setting authority to the president,” Mr Greer said on CBS. He added that tariffs imposed outside the authority struck down by the court remain in effect.
Asked about Mr Trump’s decision to quickly raise the new tariff from 10 per cent to 15 per cent, Mr Greer said the latter was the top level the president was allowed by law.
Mr Greer was also asked about Mr Trump’s aggressive use of tariffs despite the fact that polls show most Americans disapprove of this policy.
“The president has been campaigning on tariffs and protecting American industry for many years, and he does what he says, he delivers on his promises,” Mr Greer said. AFP

Nile Basin nations pledge good-faith talks on shared water challenges
Government officials emphasize their countries' dedication to dialogue, describing regional initiative as essential platform for addressing rising water and food demands, growing impacts of climate change across Nile Basin
JUBA, South Sudan
Governments from member states of the Nile Basin Initiative (NBI) gathered in the South Sudan capital of Juba on Sunday to mark Nile Day, calling for renewed commitment, mutual respect, and stronger cooperation in managing the shared river.
Speakers at the event highlighted their countries' commitment to good-faith dialogue, describing the initiative as a critical platform for addressing rising water and food demands, as well as the negative effects of climate change across the Nile Basin.
The governments participating in the Nile Basin Initiative gathered in Juba to celebrate Nile Day, themed "Voice of the Nile: Community, Youth, and Women Engagement in Water Governance." This included representatives from Burundi, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Egypt, Ethiopia, Kenya, Rwanda, South Sudan, Sudan, Tanzania, and Uganda.
South Sudan's Foreign Minister Monday Semaya Kumba said the country is committed to the Nile Basin Initiative cooperation agreement and reiterated its respect for all member states' rights.
"We are committed to the principles of equitable sharing of the Nile resources. Above all, we are dedicated to the mutual values related to Nile Basin matters and to the sustainability of its resources," he said.
He emphasized that they will work closely with counterparts in the Nile Basin to ensure sustainable cooperation, equal benefits, and successful collaboration within the framework.
Hani Sweilem, Egypt's water resources and irrigation minister, asserted that Egypt remains dedicated to working through the NBI, as it is the only inclusive framework capable of uniting the ten Nile Basin countries.
"Egypt remains committed to the consultative process in good faith and in a spirit of cooperation, calling upon all Nile Basin countries to do the same. Continued support from member states and development partners is essential to building consensus, trust, and inclusivity.
"It is also crucial to refrain from taking any premature institutional steps toward a Cooperative Framework Agreement (CFA) coalition before a basin-wide consensus is reached," he stressed.
Elharith Mustafa Abdurrahman, chairman of the water resources technical organ in Sudan, stated that this event celebrates their collective commitment to dialogue, cooperation, and mutual equity in managing and utilizing the Nile's water resources.
"This spirit of cooperation is more relevant than ever, especially given the increasing demands for water, energy, and food, alongside the growing challenges posed by climate change across the basin. This year's theme, 'Voices of the Nile: Community, Youth, and Women Engaging in Sustainable and Resilient Governance,' resonates deeply with Sudan."
He added: "We firmly believe that sustainable and resilient governance is built on a foundation of inclusivity. By empowering our communities, youth, and women, we ensure that the benefits of our cooperation are tangible, equitable, and owned by those who depend on the Nile. Their voices are essential for building trust and shaping a future that works for everyone."
He reaffirmed Sudan's commitment to the Nile Basin Initiative, viewing it as an essential platform for addressing common challenges ranging from rising water and food demands to the escalating effects of climate change.
"We are dedicated to working with all partners to direct this institution, enhancing its effectiveness as a vehicle for sustainable solutions and paving the way for an inclusive cooperative framework that reflects the interests of all valued stakeholders."
Ethiopian Water Resources and Irrigation Minister Habtamu Itefa Geleta said that as they gather to celebrate gains for a sustainable future, they also commemorate over two decades of structured regional cooperation under the Nile Basin Initiative.

What it's like to land a plane on an ice runway in Antarctica

Australian Antarctic Program relies on ice runway at Wilkins Aerodrome
In short:
Each year, a small team of expeditioners base themselves on an Antarctic glacier to set up one of the world's most remote airstrips.
The ice runway at Wilkins Aerodrome is a critical asset, but getting it ready for flights involves extreme dedication.
What's next?
The ice runway is only open during summer, and the Australian Antarctic Division says there are no plans for an all-season paved runway.
Australian pilot Dan Colborne has been flying planes to Antarctica for more than two decades, but the thrill of touching down on the ice never wanes.
"I still get an absolute kick out of it every single time," Captain Colborne said.
"It's just an amazing place … to see, to visit and to fly into."
Today, the pilot is landing an Airbus A319 on the ice runway at Wilkins Aerodrome — Australia's aviation gateway in Antarctica.
The remote facility is located on top of a glacier, 70 kilometres inland from Casey Station.
"The biggest thing coming into Wilkins is there's just nothing — it's just white and white and white," said Captain Colborne, who flies for aviation charter company SkyTraders.
He said the clarity of the air, combined with the lack of landmarks on the ground, can create "whiteouts" where depth perception becomes a challenge for pilots.
"That actually throws up a few little interesting illusions as well [and] the distance is really hard to judge,"he said.
Antarctica's notoriously wild weather, and the surface of the ice runway, can also pose difficulties.
But he said lots of planning takes place to ensure a smooth arrival.
"The Wilkins runway crew do a great job in grooming the ice so it gives us enough friction for the wheels," Captain Colborne said.
"It still can be, depending on the weather and the snow and the wind conditions, maybe a little bit slippery.
"But we've got some pretty good procedures in place that have been bedded in for many years that mitigate all that risk."
Extreme conditions force runway's closure
Wilkins Aerodrome is a key asset for the Australian Antarctic Program, allowing cargo and personnel to be flown from Hobart in just 4.5 hours, rather than a week by ship.
But operating an intercontinental aerodrome on the coldest and windiest continent on the planet requires extreme dedication.
"[It takes] a lot of work," said Jack McLeod, who was the aerodrome manager throughout 2025.
His small team would spend days, sometimes weeks, preparing the 3.5-kilometre ice runway for incoming flights.
"All day, all week, we just start clearing the runway [with] snow blowers, large blades on the front of loaders, bulldozers, scrapers behind tractors," Mr McLeod said.
"We've just got to pick up snow, move it out and then get bare ice exposed."
The aerodrome handles almost 20 return flights from Hobart each year, ranging from passenger jets to the Royal Australian Air Force's C-17 Globemaster heavy-lift plane.
Prior to the arrival of any flights, tests are conducted using an 88-tonne "proof roller" to ensure the ice runway meets the Civil Aviation Safety Authority's strict regulations.
"We basically simulate the weight of an aeroplane, plus a little bit more, with a trailer," Mr McLeod said.
"[We] will tow [it] up and down the whole runway surface and just confirm any failure points and repair them if we need to so that we can safely land the plane."
But there were times when blizzards shut the aerodrome for days, forcing Mr McLeod's team to clear the snow and re-test the runway once the extreme conditions eased.
"Sometimes weather, or forces out of our control, will just restrict that flight from coming in," he said.
"So, we will do all the prep work just for a plane to get cancelled, and then we just get ready to do it the next day."
No plans for all-season, paved runway
Wilkins Aerodrome, which officially opened in 2008, only operates from late October until early March.
But during the peak of summer, when the ice temperature rises above -5 degrees Celsius, the runway is forced to close for safety reasons.
To establish year-round aviation access in Antarctica, the Australian government announced plans for an all-season paved runway near Davis Station in 2018.
But after spending $19 million on consultants and advice, the plan was scrapped in 2021 due to costs and environmental concerns.
Last October, Australian Antarctic Division boss Emma Campbell was asked at a Senate hearing if the project would be reconsidered.
Ms Campbell replied: "At the moment, there are no plans for an all-weather runway, but we do have a really strong and capable blue ice runway [at Wilkins Aerodrome]."
'Friends for life' formed through hard work
For the team tasked with maintaining Wilkins, it's a job they relish — even when temperatures plunge below -30C and winds exceed 100 kilometres per hour.
"[It's] difficult, as you can imagine, but extremely rewarding," mechanic Tyler Kernahan said.
"The team that we work with is just fantastic, so the bond you form with your team out here at Wilkins is amazing."
Mr McLoud agreed.
"We will have friendships for life," he said.
"We've gone through a lot of hardships, but also a lot of fun."
The ABC travelled to Wilkins Aerodrome with the support of the Australian Antarctic Division.

Macron announces pick for new budget minister

PARIS — Emmanuel Macron has picked 33-year-old David Amiel to become France's new budget minister, the French presidency announced on Sunday — a crucial role as the French government attempts to get its deficit under control amid a deep political crisis.
Amiel replaces Amélie de Montchalin, a close ally of Macron who was appointed as head of France's top court of auditors earlier this month. The controversial move led to accusations that the French president was politicizing a key French institution.
Navigating budgetary debates has proven tricky since the 2024 general election in France, which led to a hung parliament. The French parliament ousted the two prime ministers who preceded current leader Sébastien Lecornu over their budgetary plans.
In his first statement in his new role, Amiel said he would seek to ensure that the hard-fought budget for 2026, which was officially passed only last month, is properly rolled out. He also listed a series of aims including getting a better grip on tax evasion and welfare fraud.
The current budget is expected to leave France with a deficit of 5 percent of its gross domestic product for 2026, per the government’s most recent estimate. Amiel has spent the last three months as minister for France's public sector, his first government role.

Mexican security forces reportedly kill drug cartel boss ‘El Mencho’

One of the world’s most wanted drug traffickers – the Mexican cartel boss known as “El Mencho” – has reportedly been killed by his country’s security forces.
The drug lord, whose real name is Nemesio Oseguera Cervantes, was killed on Sunday in the western state of Jalisco, Mexican newspapers reported, citing government sources.
The 59-year-old gangster was the leader of a group that in recent years has become Mexico’s most powerful and notorious criminal organisation: the Jalisco New Generation Cartel.
The US had offered a $15m (£11m) reward for the capture of a drug boss accused of smuggling huge quantities of cocaine, fentanyl and methamphetamine across its southern border.
In a sign of El Mencho’s huge influence across Mexico, as well as other parts of Latin America, his killing sparked an immediate outbreak of disorder across the region he ruled.
Media reports said burning vehicles and “narco” roadblocks could be seen across the states of Jalisco, Guanajuato, Nayarit, Michoacán and Tamaulipas. Video footage showed huge clouds of smoke rising into the skies above Puerto Vallarta, a major tourist city on Mexico’s west coast.
Jalisco’s state governor, Pablo Lemus Navarro, urged its 8 million citizens to stay at home “until the situation is brought back under control”. Lemus said public transport services were being suspended and said locals should not travel on the state’s roads because of the “violent events” that had spread to at least five parts of the country.
More details soon …

CAIR director sparks controversy over Israel draw backlash and support online

ALBAWABA - Khaled Al-Turani, the Executive Director of the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR) in Ohio, caused a lot of trouble when he said that Israel has "the largest human skin bank in the world." He said these things while testifying in front of the Ohio Senate Judiciary Committee, where he was against Senate Bill 87 (SB 87).
The proposed law being talked about in Ohio would officially recognize antisemitism and make some anti-Israel protests and actions illegal under the law.
Al-Turani posted a video on Instagram in which he talked about a March 2014 report from Israel's Channel 12 that claimed Israel has the world's largest human skin bank. He asked where the skin came from, saying, "Where do you think they got all this skin?" They have more human skin than both China and India.
He also said that the skin came from Palestinian bodies and that calling Israel "Nazis" could get you in trouble under the proposed law.
The comments quickly spread on social media, where they got both support and harsh criticism. Some people agreed with Al-Turani and said his comments were meant to show how much the Palestinians were suffering. Others called the comments inflammatory and unproven.
The controversy has also brought back old claims about organ harvesting. In the past, human rights groups and the media have raised concerns about how Palestinian bodies were handled after they were returned from Israeli custody. Some reports said that some of the bodies were missing internal organs. But Israeli officials have denied these claims, and they are still very much in dispute.
Activists brought up pictures and reports from Gaza showing mutilated bodies in online discussions, saying that these cases need to be looked into by the international community. Others wanted people to be held accountable and called for investigations around the world into claims of wrongdoing.
Critics of SB 87 say that the bill could limit political expression, especially in universities and civil society, by punishing some forms of anti-Israel activism. But supporters of the law say it is meant to fight antisemitism and keep Jewish communities safe.
The event has sparked a larger discussion in the US about free speech, political activism, and the limits of protest in light of the ongoing conflict in Gaza.

Defense Forces control Yampil
According to Ukrinform, the Operation Task Force East reported this on Facebook.
Ukrainian units in the area under the Operation Task Force East continue to hold back the enemy and inflict severe losses. Since the beginning of the day, they have repelled 26 Russian assaults.
In the Sloviansk sector, the Russians are increasing pressure on Yampil.
As noted by the military, despite manpower losses, they continue to attempt to infiltrate this area. Ukrainian units stopped previous attempts to use combat equipment toward Yampil.
In particular, a tank was destroyed by strike drone crews. Enemy infantry groups are systematically coming under fire and being exterminated.
Yampil is under the control of Ukrainian Defense Forces units, the military emphasized.
In the Kostiantynivka direction, the Russians carried out ten offensive actions near Kostiantynivka, Ivanopillia, Shcherbynivka, Berestok, Rusyn Yar, Sofiivka, and Novopavlivka. Three attacks are ongoing.
In the Pokrovsk sector, since the beginning of the day, Russian troops have attempted 23 times to dislodge Ukrainian soldiers from their positions in the areas of the settlements of Shakhove, Rodynske, Lyman, Pokrovsk, Udachne, and Molodetske. Nineteen attacks have already been stopped.
The Russians have intensified their efforts to capture Pokrovsk and Myrnohrad. The situation remains difficult. Logistics are significantly complicated by the expansion of the combat zone and the constant activity of enemy drones, but they are being maintained, the military emphasized.
At the same time, the Ukrainian Defense Forces are countering the Russian army's intentions. In particular, they are conducting enhanced aerial reconnaissance, additional mining of likely enemy routes, and blocking logistics. In addition, they are conducting systematic search-and-strike operations.
The military reported that Ukrainian drone units and artillery are actively engaged. The Russians are suffering severe losses.
As reported by Ukrinform, the village of Krynychne in the Zaporizhzhia region is under the control of the Ukrainian Defense Forces, despite reports in Russian media claiming its alleged capture.

Mexican army kills leader of powerful drug trafficking cartel who US once offered $15M for arrest
Under El Mencho’s leadership, the cartel has been implicated in numerous homicides targeting rival groups and Mexican law enforcement
- Bookmark

Nemesio Rubén Oseguera Cervantes, widely known as "El Mencho" and the formidable leader of the Jalisco New Generation Cartel (CJNG), has been killed during a Mexican military operation, a federal official has confirmed.
The operation, which took place on Sunday in the western state of Jalisco, was preceded by hours of widespread roadblocks involving burning vehicles – a common tactic employed by cartels to impede military movements.
The official, who requested anonymity due to not being authorised to speak publicly, provided details of the incident.
El Mencho was a highly sought-after figure, with the US State Department offering a reward of up to $15 million for information leading to his arrest. This reward was reiterated in a December 2024 post, identifying him as a founder and current leader of CJNG and one of Mexico's most wanted fugitives.
Formed in 2009, CJNG has rapidly become one of Mexico's most violent drug cartels. It is assessed to possess the highest capacity for trafficking cocaine, heroin, and methamphetamine, and more recently, fentanyl into the United States.
Under El Mencho’s leadership, the cartel has been implicated in numerous homicides targeting rival groups and Mexican law enforcement, as well as alleged assassination attempts on Mexican government officials.
The Trump administration previously designated CJNG as a foreign terrorist organisation.
Since 2017, El Mencho has faced multiple indictments in the US District Court for the District of Columbia, with the most recent superseding indictment on April 5, 2022, charging him with conspiracy and distribution of controlled substances for unlawful importation into the US, and firearm use in drug trafficking. He was also charged under the Drug Kingpin Statute for operating a continuing criminal enterprise.

Greenland rejects Trump’s offer to send US hospital ship to Arctic island
US President Donald Trump writes on Truth Social that a ‘great hospital boat’ is going to Greenland as he mocks its healthcare system.
Greenland said “no thanks” to US President Donald Trump’s plan to send a hospital ship to the Arctic island after he repeatedly threatened to seize the Danish autonomous territory for “national security” reasons.
Prime Minister Jens-Frederik Nielsen said in a post on Facebook on Sunday that Trump’s proposal to send the US medical vessel had been “noted”.

“But we have a public healthcare system where treatment is free for citizens. It is a deliberate choice,” Nielsen said, reiterating Greenland remained open to dialogue and cooperation.
“But talk to us instead of just making more or less random outbursts on social media,” he added.
The historically strong bilateral ties after World War II between NATO allies Denmark and the United States have come under severe strain in recent months as Trump ratcheted up talk of a possible US takeover of the mineral-rich and strategically located Arctic island.
Danish Defence Minister Troels Lund Poulsen told Danish broadcaster DR that the population of Greenland “receives the healthcare it needs”.
“They receive it either in Greenland or, if they require specialised treatment, they receive it in Denmark,” he said. “It’s not as if there’s a need for a special healthcare initiative in Greenland.”
On Saturday, Trump said in a post on his Truth Social account – with an AI-generated image of the US Navy vessel the USNS Mercy – that it was on its way to Greenland to treat those being medically neglected.
“We are going to send a great hospital boat to Greenland to take care of the many people who are sick, and not being taken care of there. It’s on the way!!!” Trump wrote.
Trump has repeatedly expressed his interest in the US taking control of Greenland, citing it as a way to secure US national security. However, Greenland and Europe rejected the US desire to take the Arctic island and have upheld Greenlandic sovereignty.
Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen said she was “happy to live in a country where access to healthcare is free and equal for all”.
Greenland is a place “where insurance or wealth does not determine whether one receives dignified treatment,” she added in an apparent criticism of the US healthcare system, which is not universal.
Threats to take Greenland ebbed after Trump struck a “framework” deal with NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte in January to ensure greater US influence.

Mexican drug lord "El Mencho" killed in military operation, says government source

MEXICO CITY, Feb 22 - Mexican drug lord Nemesio Oseguera, commonly known as 'El Mencho,' has been killed in a military operation, two government sources familiar with the operation told Reuters on Sunday, as the Mexican government ramps up pressure on local cartels after U.S. intervention threats.
An ex-police officer, Oseguera was the shadowy leader of the powerful Jalisco New Generation Cartel (CJNG), an outfit that took its moniker from the western state of the same name that is home to Mexico's second city, Guadalajara.
Mexico's security minister said it could not immediately comment on the matter.
Over a relatively short period of time, the CJNG morphed into a continents-spanning criminal enterprise rivaling former allies in the Sinaloa Cartel, the gang of captured kingpin Joaquin 'El Chapo' Guzman, now in a U.S. prison.
The military operation against Oseguera follows a pressure campaign from the Trump administration on Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum's government to ramp up its crackdown on drug trafficking, including U.S. threats to intervene directly in Mexico.
"The operation for his arrest was led by the Defense ministry, and he ended up being killed," said one of the sources.
The White House did not immediately reply to a request for comment.
The news of Oseguera's death followed a federal security operation in the city of Tapalpa in Jalisco, according to a social media post by governor Pablo Lemus Navarro, who urged residents to stay home until the situation was brought under control.
"We remain in Code Red. We reiterate the recommendation to avoid leaving your homes. The clashes are occurring in several federal entities," he added in a subsequent post.
Videos on social media showed cars ablaze, sending dark smoke into the sky, on roads in Jalisco. Mexican media outlets reported burning vehicles and gunmen blocking highways in more than half a dozen states across the country, particularly in the north and northwest.
Alfredo Ramirez Bedolla, the governor of the state of Michoacan, wrote on X that he had received reports of state highways being blocked as a result of the operation in Jalisco. REUTERS

New York mayor Mamdani orders citywide travel ban ahead of major snowstorm
New York Mayor Zohran Mamdani on Sunday ordered a travel ban and shutdown of the city's traffic network ahead of a massive snowstorm expected to hit the northeast United States. The ban will not affect essential workers or New Yorkers needing to travel due to emergencies.
New York Mayor Zohran Mamdani ordered a shutdown Sunday of the city's entire traffic network to all but emergency travel ahead of a massive snowstorm expected to hit the northeast United States.
Starting at 9pm Sunday to noon Monday a "state of emergency closes the streets, highways and bridges of New York City for all traffic, cars, trucks, scooters and E-bikes," Mamdani told reporters.
The ban will not affect essential workers or New Yorkers needing to travel due to emergencies, according to Mamdani. New York is home to over eight million people.
"We are asking New Yorkers to avoid all non essential travel," the mayor said. "New York City has not faced a storm of this scale in the last decade."

The fast-developing storm is threatening to pummel the US East Coast with a foot or more of snow beginning Sunday, just weeks after the region recovered from another devastating weather system.
Meteorologists issued blizzard warnings for New York and parts of at least six states, warning Saturday that heavy snow and gale-force winds are forecast to slam all major cities along the densely populated Interstate 95 northeast corridor, including Boston, Philadelphia, and even Washington further south.
The NWS headquarters said snowfall rates of more than one inch (2.5 centimeters) an hour will occur at times along parts of the East Coast, with huge snow totals making travel nearly impossible. Power outages are likely.
The mega-storm that swept across the eastern half of the country in late January was linked to more than 100 deaths nationwide, and slammed some cities with heavy snow and sleet that froze into rock-hard ice.
New Jersey Governor Mikie Sherrill declared a state of emergency beginning midday Sunday, freeing up funds and allowing the swift deployment of resources to address the weather crisis.

UK music college removes mention of Russian festival after appeal from Ukraine
Ukraine's embassy in the UK, together with the Ukrainian community in London, has succeeded in having a mention of the Russian Kalinka festival removed from materials promoting an event at the Royal College of Music.
Source: Ukraine's Foreign Ministry, as reported by European Pravda
Details: The embassy team drew the organisers' attention to the unacceptability of promoting a Russian festival while Russia's full-scale aggression against Ukraine continues.
In response, the Royal College of Music explained that the mention of the Kalinka festival was related to the retrospective part of the anniversary programme and referred to a Russian music event held in 2014.
At the same time, a representative of the college apologised for the misunderstanding and said that all digital materials would be updated to remove the relevant mention.
The Ukrainian Foreign Ministry stressed that there should be no place for Russian culture, which is used as a tool by the aggressor state, on the international stage and in the global cultural space.
Background:
- In January, the Teatro del Maggio Musicale in Florence cancelled a performance by Russian artists who openly support the Kremlin regime's policy towards Ukraine.
- A concert in the Netherlands by pianist Elisabeth Leonskaya was cancelled in November after she performed with pro-Putin musicians.

Oman confirms US-Iran talks will take place in Geneva on Thursday
Oman’s Foreign Minister Badr Albusaidi has confirmed that further talks between the United States and Iran will take place on Thursday amid spiralling tensions between the two countries.
“Pleased to confirm US-Iran negotiations are now set for Geneva this Thursday, with a positive push to go the extra mile towards finalizing the deal,” Albusaidi said in a social media post on Sunday.
The announcement comes as the US continues to bolster its military assets in the region raising concern about an all-out war against Iran.
Hours before Oman’s announcement, Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi said Tehran was ready to put in place a “full monitoring mechanism” to guarantee the peaceful nature of its nuclear programme and ease tensions.
Asked by Face the Nation moderator Margaret Brennan why Iran would want to pursue enrichment on its soil rather than buy enriched uranium from abroad, given the US military build-up and risk of an escalation, Araghchi said the issue was a matter of “dignity and pride” for Iranians.
“We have developed this technology by ourselves, by our scientists, and it is very dear to us because we have created it – we have paid a huge expense for that,” he said.
Araghchi cited among the costs two decades of US sanctions, the targeted killings of Iranian scientists and US-Israeli attacks on nuclear facilities in July.
“We’re not going to give [our nuclear programme] up; there is no legal reason to do that while everything is peaceful and safeguarded” by the United Nations nuclear watchdog, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA).
As a “committed member” of the Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT), which mandates nonnuclear-weapon states not to seek or acquire nuclear weapons, Iran is “ready to cooperate with the agency in full”, Araghchi added.
But under the treaty, Tehran also has “every right to enjoy a peaceful nuclear energy, including enrichment.”
“Enrichment is a sensitive part of our negotiations, the American team knows about our position and we know their position, we have already exchanged our concerns and I think a solution is achievable,” the minister said.
Enrichment is the process of isolating and garnering a rare variant, or isotope, of uranium that can produce nuclear fission. At low levels, enriched uranium can power electric plants. If enriched to approximately 90 percent, it can be used for nuclear weapons.
US officials, including President Donald Trump, have previously suggested that Washington is seeking “zero enrichment” by Tehran.
Earlier this month, Secretary of State Marco Rubio said any deal with Iran would need to include agreements on ballistic missiles and support for its allies in the region.
Araghchi, however, said on Sunday that Iran was “negotiating only nuclear” at the present time.
“There is no other subject,” he told CBS News, adding that he was optimistic that a deal could be reached.
The second round of nuclear talks concluded in Geneva on February 17. The US and Iran also held indirect talks in Oman earlier this month.
The Iranian delegation is working ahead of the meeting to present a draft that included “elements which can accommodate both sides’ concerns and interests” to reach a “fast deal”, Araghchi said.
The top Iranian diplomat added the agreement would likely be “better” than the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), negotiated by former US President Barack Obama in 2015.
“There are elements that could be much better than the previous deal,” he said, without eleborating. “Right now there is no need for too much detail, but we can agree on our nuclear program to remain peaceful forever and at the same time, for more sanctions [to be] lifted.”

Ukraine war latest: Ukraine hits Russian planes, ships in Crimea, artillery in major strikes on occupied territories
Key developments on Feb. 21-22:
- Ukraine hits Russian planes, ships in Crimea, artillery in major strikes on occupied territories
- Ukraine confirms Flamingo strike on key Russian ballistic missile factory
- Russia hits American sweets factory with missile in northeastern Ukraine
- Explosions rock Ukraine's capital and outskirts as Russia launches mass missile attack, killing 1, injuring 17
- Woman arrested after suspected terrorist attack kills police officer, injures 25 in western Ukraine's Lviv
Ukraine's armed forces struck Russian ships, planes, and artillery units in Russian-occupied Crimea and the occupied part of Zaporizhzhia Oblast, the General Staff announced on Feb. 21.
In Crimea, close to Sevastopol, Ukrainian forces hit two Russian border patrol ships of Project 22460 Hunter, part of the Rubin class of Russian Coast Guard vessels designed to combat surface and airborne threats.
Ukraine previously targeted the same class of ship in December with sea drones, although the General Staff did not confirm if drones were used in the latest attack.
Further north on the peninsula, Ukraine hit two Be-12 Chayka aircraft stationed at the Yevpatoria Aviation Repair Plant. Ukraine first hit Be-12 aircrafts in September 2025, also in occupied Crimea.
The Soviet-designed Be-12 Chayka is an anti-submarine amphibious aircraft equipped with high-value systems used for detecting and engaging submarines. They have been used in combat over the Black Sea.
The full extent of the damage on the Crimean Peninsula is still being assessed, the General Staff said.
"The Ukrainian Defense Forces continue to systematically reduce the aggressor's combat potential, depriving it of the ability to conduct offensive operations," they added.
In Zaporizhzhia Oblast, Ukrainian forces destroyed Russia's equivalent of HIMARS — a Tornado-S multiple launch rocket system. They have a firing range of 120 kilometers using high-precision, wide-range rockets, terrorizing Ukrainian civilians in frontline regions.
"Tornados are a nightmare for Kharkiv, Zaporizhzhia, Sumy, Kherson, Nikopol, and other peaceful cities of Ukraine," said Robert 'Madyar' Brovdi, Commander of Ukraine's Unmanned Systems Forces.

Ukraine's military launched an overnight operation, striking the Votkinsk Machine Building Plant — a key missile production hub in Russia's Udmurt Republic — with long-range cruise Flamingo missiles, Ukraine's Armed Forces General Staff confirmed on Feb. 21.
The Votkinsk Plant is a strategic, state-owned defense enterprise and one of the most important missile factories in Russia. It produces short-range Iskander-M ballistic missiles — used frequently in attacks against Ukraine — and intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs), capable of carrying nuclear warheads as far as the United States.
It is also suspected that the plant produces Russia's new Oreshnik ICBM.
"The enterprise of the military-industrial complex 'Votkinsky Plant' was hit. A fire was recorded on the territory of the facility. The results are being clarified," Ukraine's General Staff posted on social media.
According to independent Russian Telegram news channel Astra, at least 11 people were reported injured as a result of the attack.
During the operation, Ukraine also fired Flamingo missiles at a gas processing plant in Russia's Samara Oblast, a fuel and lubricants warehouse in Russian-occupied Donetsk, a drone workshop in Donetsk Oblast, and a military warehouse in Zaporizhzhia Oblast, according to the General Staff.
Ukraine's long-range cruise Flamingo missiles are reported to have a range of up to 3,000 kilometers (1,864 miles) and carry a warhead weighing around 1,150 kilograms.
Shortly before the strike on Feb. 20, Denys Shtilierman, the co-owner of Firepoint, the Ukrainian firm behind the Flamingo, posted a video on X showing the launch of a Flamingo missile with the cryptic caption, "No context. Context – later."
Shtilierman later reposted the General Staff's message confirming the strike with the caption, "And here is the context."
The Votkinsk Plant has expanded throughout the full-scale war, bypassing international sanctions to hire thousands of new workers, add new buildings, and importing advanced machinery. A Kyiv Independent investigation published in June 2025 previously found that supplies from China, Taiwan, and Belarus — funneled through third-parties to evade sanctions — enabled this expansion.
That expansion translated directly into more devastating missile attacks against Ukrainian cities. In 2024, Russia produced nearly three times more Iskander-M ballistic missiles than in 2023. The year 2025 saw a significant escalation in Russia's aerial assault against Ukraine.

Russia hits American sweets factory with missile in northeastern Ukraine
Russia struck a sweets factory in northeastern Ukraine owned by the American multinational company Mondelez on Feb. 21, Ukraine's Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha said in a post on X.
The factory, located in Trostianets in Sumy Oblast, was struck by a missile, Sybiha said. The plant has operated since the 1990s, and produces a range of well-known products, including Oreo and Milka.
"When Russia targets facilities owned by American companies on Ukrainian soil, it does so knowingly," Yulia Svyrydenko, Ukraine's prime minister, posted on social media on Feb. 22.
According to Svyrydenko, Mondelez has invested more than $250 million into the factory over the years.
A video posted to LinkedIn by Svyrydenko shows the factory heavily damaged after the attack. The extent of the damage and the potential cost to repair the factory remain unclear.
Andy Hunder, president of the American Chamber of Commerce in Ukraine — of which Mondelez is a member — told the Kyiv Independent that targeted strikes against American owned companies are nothing new.
"Forty-seven percent of the members of the American Chamber of Commerce have had damage or destruction to their facilities across Ukraine," he said.

Explosions rock Ukraine’s capital and outskirts as Russia launches mass missile attack, killing 1, injuring 17
One man was killed after Russia launched a large-scale combined missile and drone attack on Ukraine in the early hours of Feb. 22.
Fifty missiles and 297 long-range kamikaze drones targeted the country, most of them at Kyiv and its suburbs. The Ukrainian Air Force reported downing 33 missiles and 274 drones.
Wall-shaking explosions first took place in Ukraine's capital at around 4:00 a.m. local time, according to Kyiv Independent journalists on the ground. More blasts were heard at approximately 4:30 a.m. local time and continued intermittently throughout the early morning.
The attack caused a building to collapse in the town of Fastiv, 60 kilometers southwest of Kyiv, killing a 49-year-old man and injuring seven others, according to Kyiv Oblast governor Mykola Kalashnyk. A total of 17 people were injured across the oblast as a result of the attack, including four children, he said.
Kyiv city mayor Vitali Klitschko also reported that a woman and a child were injured in the attack.
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said early on Sunday afternoon that the attack not only targeted energy facilities, but also water supply and railway infrastructure.
"This week alone, Russia launched more than 1,300 attack drones against Ukraine, over 1,400 guided aerial bombs, and 96 missiles of various types, including dozens of ballistic ones," he added.
Since October, Russia has systematically targeted Ukraine’s energy and heating infrastructure, as the country goes through one of its coldest winters in years.
The attack also targeted seven other oblasts, according to Zelensky, including the coastal region of Odesa in the south of Ukraine. Kamikaze drone attacks caused damage and fires to energy infrastructure, according to the oblast governor's, Oleh Kiper.
Ukraine's largest private energy company, DTEK, reported that Russia hit an electrical substation in the attack on Odesa. The strike inflicted "severe damage," DTEK Spokesperson Pavlo Bilodid told the Kyiv Independent.
Crews are already on the ground working to repair the facility, he said.

Woman arrested after suspected terrorist attack kills police officer, injures 25 in western Ukraine’s Lviv
A woman has been arrested in connection with a suspected terrorist attack — believed by Ukrainian officials to have been ordered by Russia — that killed a police officer and injured 25 others in the western city of Lviv in the early hours of Feb. 22.
"The police, in cooperation with the Security Service of Ukraine, have arrested a suspected saboteur," Ihor Klymenko, Ukraine's minister of internal affairs, said on Sunday morning.
According to Lviv Mayor Andrii Sadovyi, the detainee is a woman and a citizen of Ukraine.
Two blasts rocked Lviv's historic Old Town in the early hours of Feb. 22, shattering windows in the area.
The explosions took place after officers arrived at the scene responding to a reported store intrusion, Ukraine’s National Police said in a statement. A second explosion took place after another police crew arrived at the scene, Lviv Oblast’s Prosecutor’s Office added.
Ukraine's national police identified the police officer killed in the explosion as 23-year-old Viktoria Shpylka.
Twelve people have been hospitalized due to injuries, with two in serious condition, according to Sadovyi. All of the injured victims, with the exception of one teenager, are law enforcement employees who responded to the call.
"There is every reason to believe that the crime was carried out on the orders of Russia. It's not the first time that the enemy has deliberately set up deadly traps for Ukrainian law enforcement officers," Klymenko said.

'We went in with one soul and came out broken': They served in Shura Base and got no mental health support

Reservists and active-duty soldiers who served in the IDF’s casualty identification units, along with other personnel stationed at the Shura military base, told the Knesset Labor and Welfare Committee on Sunday about the difficulties they are now facing and called for expanded mental health support. The discussion revealed that hundreds of soldiers who were also students in hesder yeshiva who took part in the identification efforts at the start of the war are not eligible for assistance from the army because they are currently in an unpaid service period (known as shalat).
The hearing focused, among other groups, on approximately 200 hesder soldiers who served at Shura Base in the early days of the war. Media reports and appeals from several lawmakers indicated that these soldiers returned to their yeshivas after about a week of service without receiving a therapeutic support framework.
During the discussion it emerged that those who served at Shura for 45 days or more were recognized as eligible for combat-soldier benefits, including in-depth resilience programs and workshops. However, hesder soldiers who served for a shorter period are not entitled to these programs. In addition, they are not eligible to participate in the “Amit Program,” which helps soldiers process service experiences and supports reintegration into routine life.
Other personnel who served at Shura in roles that did not involve direct contact with the deceased also described difficult experiences, noting that they are not entitled to the rehabilitative support provided to other service members.
“We were all there at Shura Base. We went in with one soul and came out with another — new, cracked and aching with the pain of the nation, yet never more proud of our people and our heritage," said Sharga Dahan, a former military rabbi who served at Shura during the war.
"Hesder yeshiva students were called up to assist in unimaginable situations, carrying on their young shoulders the honor of the holy ones. Those who stood beside them, in the silence and the smell that the soul does not forget — invisible people who did their work quietly and modestly — also need strengthening, an embrace and support," he added. "The cleaners in the treatment rooms, cadets who helped maintain order and direct the refrigerated trucks, truck drivers, doctors, construction, electrical and logistics personnel — everyone was there and assisted in everything these processes required. They saw the sights, smelled the smells, felt the intensity and the sanctity. They carry Shura within them every moment. I call on this committee — do not forget them. Do not let them cope alone with a soul that has changed forever.”
Noam Ron, who served in reserve duty at Shura, testified about his service at the camp. “I was at Shura for 580 days on behalf of the communications unit. Most of us were reservists, and there were also regular soldiers, all aged 18 to 23. Seven days a week we entered the treatment rooms to handle computers for hours, no matter what was happening inside the room when we were at zero distance. We saw everything, we smelled everything," he described.
"In the first or second week of the war there was one resilience meeting for the entire headquarters together — dozens of people. I did not see a mental health officer until July 2025. Since then I contacted the unit’s resilience personnel every day until they were finally convinced and gave us one two-day resilience workshop — and everything remained open. It accompanies us every day, and we are asking for a response and support framework that will allow us to begin our lives properly,” he said.
Capt. (res.) Shmuel Malul, an officer in the Northern Casualty Identification Unit, said those who served at Shura are not the only soldiers who need assistance. "It is important to remember and point out that it is not just about those serving in the Shura Base, because there are entitlements and benefits that have already been approved for those serving in Shura and not in other places, and it starts with the little things," he explained. "The Northern Division handled hundreds of soldiers, starting with the absorption process, transportation and identification, and separation from families. We are 420 reserve soldiers in the unit and I did over 400 days of reserve in a row, and we also had the cover teams who were not in the first circle, but were there, saw, smelled and experienced everything.".
‘Not the responsibility of the army’
Lt. Col. Uriel Zamir, head of the regular service branch in the Meitav unit, explained that during unpaid service periods, when hesder soldiers are studying at yeshiva, they are not under the army’s responsibility and receive treatment through their health maintenance organizations. He noted that 209 hesder soldiers were deployed to Shura Base at the start of the war, of whom about 101 were directly involved in handling the deceased. According to Zamir, these soldiers are currently being treated by their HMOs, with guidance from the IDF and the Defense Ministry.
Zamir added that in September 2024 the IDF issued an open call to anyone who had taken part in activity at Shura to attend a resilience workshop. “A total of 122 soldiers registered, and 98 actually attended — 47% of all the hesder soldiers who served there. Recently we have been working on responses for reservists at Shura, and any response given to them will also be given to the hesder soldiers.”
Lt. Col. Uzi Bechor, commander of the Combat Reaction Unit in the Medical Corps, also addressed the issue. “I agree this is a unique population that carried out a complex role in the war and was exposed in part to traumatic events, and it is our duty to care for them," he said. "As long as a soldier is in service, treatment is provided by a mental health officer. Once a person is discharged, there are two options: the first is within the ‘Amit Program,’ intended for individuals without a clinical diagnosis, which provides holistic responses as well as psychological treatment. The second is for someone with significant symptoms and a diagnosis, who can apply to the Rehabilitation Department for recognition and treatment. As noted, a soldier in unpaid service is not on active duty and treatment is provided through the HMOs. Now we must examine whether this response is sufficient and whether we, as the IDF, need to do more.”
In summing up the discussion, committee chair Michal Waldiger, a Knesset lawmaker from the Religious Zionism party, demanded that hesder soldiers be included in eligibility for the Amit Program as a first step, and that the 45-day service criterion for additional resilience programs be reconsidered.
“We heard here from those who were there," she said. "To distance them is to ignore a significant and acute problem, and if we do so now it will confront us even more forcefully later. Sending such people to seek solutions through the HMOs is wrong — this is the army’s responsibility. Turn to the heads of the yeshivas and find a way to identify everyone who needs mental health treatment.”
Waldiger also called for accelerating the implementation of a dedicated program for the casualty identification units and demanded that the IDF and the Defense Ministry provide the committee with regular updates on the matter.

Parramatta is Australia’s undisputed gateway to India. And it’s proving very good for business

Parramatta is Australia’s undisputed gateway to India. And it’s proving very good for business
Start-up firm Infoneoo is typical of India’s dynamic technology sector.
It was launched a little over a year ago but it already has hundreds of employees working from cubicles in a glass office tower on the outskirts of the sprawling capital Delhi. The company delivers “AI-led” business services to clients at home and abroad.
It has strong links to western Sydney.
When founders Manoj Matai and Sukanto Mitra were setting up Infoneoo, they were put in touch with an Australian IT firm called iSoft based in Bella Vista, near Castle Hill. It eventually made an investment in the fledgling Indian company.
“We were looking for someone who could invest but, more importantly, be a strategic partner,” Matai said in his Delhi office.
The two firms now have a “complementary relationship” that has opened up new opportunities, he says.
Infoneoo’s story is an example of the growing economic links between the subcontinent and western Sydney being forged by members of the Australian Indian community, especially those based in Parramatta and surrounding suburbs.
The two companies were brought together by Ameet Nandlaskar, founder of Innovesta, a company based in north-western Sydney that facilitates investments between Australia and India.
“It was a real win-win situation that is creating jobs on both sides,” says Nandlaskar of Infoneoo’s story. “I’m seeing a lot of interest and activity between Australia and India.”
Matai expresses similar optimism from Delhi. “This is the time for Australia and India,” he says.
More than one-third of residents in Parramatta and some surrounding suburbs were born in India. There is also a large Indian diaspora population in the north-west of Sydney including Schofields, The Ponds and Marsden Park.
These cultural connections with the subcontinent have helped make western and north-western Sydney a focal point for economic engagement between India and Australia. This encompasses a range of sectors including finance, IT, business services, travel, biotech and food.
That dynamic led Saravana Bhavan, the world’s largest vegetarian restaurant chain, to Parramatta. The company was looking to expand to Australia, betting that the Indian diaspora was growing fast enough to support them.
And since opening their first location in Parramatta in 2014, the chain has found huge success; it is eyeing its 12th expansion within Australia.
“We have opened in Sydney, Brisbane, Melbourne and are looking at Adelaide next. And it all started in Parramatta, where we opened based on the demographic make-up of the area,” says company director Shekar Mani.
He said it was demographics that drove the chain to Parramatta and fuelled the chain’s success. The Parramatta location is busy and it has a broad variety of patrons, from workers having lunch to families having dinner.
Mani says he is increasingly seeing non-Indians eat at his restaurants, a reflection of the shrinking cultural divide in Australia.
But Mani says the chain is “powered” by the Indian diaspora, who flock to the locations for affordable and familiar meals. He also believes the chain’s success is rooted in the diaspora’s growing purchasing power, and their influence over local economies.
“They have become the gatekeepers to the economic relationship between India and Australia. The Indian community is flourishing here. Indian migration has gone bonkers in the last five years, and they have built their own ecosystem.”
Mani says his chains are key cogs within that ecosystem. It is a major customer of imported ingredients and a large-scale employer of recently arrived migrants and students.
Like many businesses that have one foot in India and another in Australia, Saravana Bhavan acts as a cultural hub, an anchor for the diaspora and their growing economic influence. The firm has 33 outlets within India and 47 in other nations.
On the other side of Parramatta, at the border of neighbouring Harris Park, staff at Indian chain jewellers Malabar Gold and Diamonds are preparing for the daily rush of customers.
Malabar, one of the biggest jewellery chains globally, opened its doors in the area in 2024 to enormous fanfare. It immediately attracted lines of locals who recognised the brand.
Santosh Chikkamari, a business development executive at Malabar, said the business had expanded around the world following the global Indian diaspora.
“Just because they relocate doesn’t mean they stop buying gold. They don’t stop wearing gold; they don’t stop celebrating their festivals. So that emotion is always there with the Indian community, and we work with those emotions,” Chikkamari says.
Chikkamari describes being embraced warmly by the Indian diaspora, saying there is consistent demand, driven by the growing community.
“During our festivals, we can see up to 200 people lined up every day. We knew there was demand, and we strive to match it.
“The community wanted (our products). We just had to meet them where they are.”
Australia’s Indian-origin community has grown rapidly during the past 20 years and numbers about 1 million people. About 90 per cent of Indian-born migrants live in capital cities, especially Sydney and Melbourne.
Peter Varghese, a former secretary of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade who authored an Indian economic strategy for the Australian government in 2018, says the economic influence of the Indian diaspora has expanded rapidly.
“When you consider that the diaspora’s numbers really only started picking up strongly around 2010, the impact it’s had has already been very significant across business, but also in terms of political engagement,” he says.
“And that has perhaps happened a little quicker than expected.”
Varghese says the diaspora community has an important role to play in facilitating Australia-India trade and investment.
India, with more than 1.4 billion people, is the world’s most populous nation. It is also the world’s fastest growing major economy and it is one of Australia’s biggest trading partners.
A historic trade deal signed between Australia and India in 2022 that reduced barriers to trade and investment has helped strengthen economic ties. A more ambitious pact called the Australia-India Comprehensive Economic Cooperation Agreement is being negotiated.
The Parramatta region’s status as a hub for Australia’s Indian community was underscored by the visit of India’s Prime Minister Narendra Modi to the area in 2023.
Modi was feted by almost 20,000 ecstatic fans, mostly members of the diaspora, at a “reception” at the Qudos Bank arena in Olympic Park.
Harris Park, a suburb adjacent to Parramatta’s CBD, was put on the international map when Modi and Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese unveiled a plaque commemorating the “Little India” restaurant strip in the neighbourhood.
Harris Park, home to more than 20 Indian eateries and sweet shops, is emblematic of the diaspora’s contribution to Australia’s food culture.

Ron titled a song ‘God loves everyone’. Not everyone was happy
Each week, Benjamin Law asks public figures to discuss the subjects we’re told to keep private by getting them to roll a die. The numbers they land on are the topics they’re given. This week, he talks to Ron Sexsmith. The award-winning Canadian singer-songwriter, 62, has written songs for, among others, Stevie Nicks and Emmylou Harris. His latest album is Hangover Terrace.
RELIGION
Did you have a religious upbringing? I was the only kid in my family who went to church.
Oh, really? How did that come about? Well, one day, these people knocked on our door trying to get kids to come to Sunday school at a place called the Brockview Bible Chapel, not too far from where I lived [in Ontario’s St Catharines]. My brothers weren’t interested at all, but I was intrigued: they said there’d be singing. So, every Sunday, I’d put my suit on, wait at the corner of my street and the bus would pick me up. I got a free Bible at the end of the year for perfect attendance and I still have it. I just found the stories really intriguing, and I’ve always been a sort of God-conscious person.
“God-conscious person”. Tell me about that. It’s hard to explain without sounding kind of nuts. But I had a record a bunch of years ago called Exit Strategy of the Soul, which I called “shadow gospel”; it was a spiritual album without the dogma and guilt that comes with religion. I never saw God as being this angry thing in the sky who judged people. I always felt it was more about unconditional love which, in my opinion, is the only kind of love that’s worth anything. I don’t know how it works. Nobody knows. But I’ve always felt the presence of this other thing. So when I say “God-conscious”, it sounds religious, but I certainly wouldn’t attempt to explain it like that.
Other people go to church. Where do you go? I go for walks every day. It’s a good way to work things out in my head and to commune with the sun and nature.
MONEY
Why pursue a music career? For all the financial security that it offers? [Laughs] Certainly not. I didn’t do well in school, but I loved music. I remember on my seventh birthday, we were getting ready for my birthday party. As the DJ on the radio said, “Happy birthday to Elvis Presley”, I fell down the stairs, right to the bottom. In a weird way, when I got up and dusted myself off, I knew what I wanted to do. And I’ve always felt this cosmic connection with Elvis.
How did you start off? My older brother, Don, was playing cover tunes in bars. When I finished high school, he said, “Well, I can get you an audition. All you’ve got to do is learn a bunch of cover songs.” I was only thinking as far as Christmas. I thought if I could make a bit of money, enough money to buy some Christmas presents for my family …
Cut to now, decades later … Well, I’ve never made any money in music, to be honest. I’ve made a living, but I’ve never had the big ship come in where I had an enormous hit record. That never happened, and I’m actually fine with that. But it’s funny: in my 20s, I got turned down by everyone in Canada and was getting ready to pack it in. Then, when I was about 29, I got some interest from Los Angeles, which led to a publishing deal, and then a record deal. And then I felt doors start to open.
What’s the richest you’ve ever been? There was a period in the mid-2000s when a lot of my songs were being covered. I still couldn’t afford a house in Toronto, but it meant I was able to tour for a number of cycles with my band. I felt relatively established. And now there were people in the industry who believed in me.
What would you tell a younger Ron Sexsmith about money and the business side of music? Oh, man, I’m terrible with money. It all goes over my head; I don’t know anything about it. Thankfully, my wife, who’s part of my management team, is very capable with all that kind of stuff. And now we have a house. I was 53 by the time I was able to buy my first house, just from hanging in there and being a survivor of the roller coaster that is the record industry.
POLITICS
What do you think about the idea that all art, including music, is inherently political? I think there’s some truth in that. Whatever you’re making – a book, a record or art hanging on your wall – is a statement. I’m not a provocateur with my music; I’m not really interested in that. But, sometimes, a song can rattle people. I had a song called God Loves Everyone in 2002, which was written after I read about the death of a kid named Matthew Shepard in Wyoming in 1998. [The 21-year-old university student, who was gay, was assaulted, tortured and left to die.] Some fundamentalist groups there got really upset.
Wait: “God loves everyone.” What could be more positive than that? Well, there are people out there who felt very offended by that: “Well, no, God only loves people who think like this or look like that.” One woman even came backstage at a concert in Chicago and started praying for me. She thought I was going to Hell for writing that song.
Wow. I didn’t want for it to be a political song, but it is about unconditional love and some people don’t want to hear about that.
In these fractured times, is it naive or hopeful to think music can still bring people together? Even at this late hour, music really is the universal language. It’s a healer. Whether you’re conservative or liberal, you can still be at the same concert, all enjoying the same music, hearing the same message. It’s a powerful thing. I can’t imagine life without it.
Ron Sexsmith will perform in Sydney (City Recital Hall) on April 18 and in Melbourne (Melbourne Recital Centre) on April 23.

‘These are preventable deaths’: 40 Victorians suing hospitals over the loss of their loved ones

‘These are preventable deaths’: 40 Victorians suing hospitals over the loss of their loved ones
At least 40 Victorians are preparing to launch legal action against the state’s hospitals over claims their loved ones died by suicide after being prematurely discharged or denied critical care.
In one case, healthcare workers deemed a patient a “high risk of suicide” just hours before he was sent home from hospital. He took his life less than two days later.
The situation has prompted health experts and healthcare workers to call for more mental health beds, staff and community services to meet the growing demand for help.
Daniel Opare, Shine Lawyers’ medical law practice leader in Victoria, is representing dozens of families who have lost loved ones to suicide shortly after they were sent home from psychiatric units or turned away. Most of the deaths occurred between 2021 and now.
“These are not rare or isolated tragedies,” he said. “It is a pattern of people seeking help and being turned away, or being sent home far too early.”
He said clinicians were under extreme pressure to free up beds and not making decisions in patients’ best interests.
“Relatives and carers know when something is wrong, and ignoring them can have fatal consequences,” Opare said.
On the day he was discharged from the mental health unit at Maroondah Hospital in May 2023, clinical staff wrote in their notes that Richard Ang was at high risk of suicide.
The 61-year-old—whose mental health spiralled downwards following a marriage separation and the loss of his job at Metro Trains—had spent two weeks in hospital following a suicide attempt.
“Despite how unwell he was, he had expressed a strong desire to get better and be there for his family,” said his 32-year-old son, Martin, who called an ambulance after finding his dad in a critical state at the family home in Wheelers Hill in Melbourne’s south-east.
The hospital notes, obtained by this masthead, are chillingly specific. Ang had not only expressed suicidal thoughts to clinicians but had talked about his plan, right down to the location.
But he was discharged four hours later after a psychiatrist revoked the treatment order that had kept Ang in the mental health ward.
“I spoke to the doctors. I was like, ‘Are you sure he’s all right?’” Martin recalled. “He was just not looking people in the eye. He was not responsive.”
Less than 48 hours after Richard was discharged, Martin discovered his father had taken his own life.
“I thought I was dreaming ... It’s some scene that you watch from a movie,” Martin said. “I thought, ‘Maybe I found him in time.’ The body was cold.”
Martin is seeking compensation from Eastern Health through Shine Lawyers for the pain and suffering caused by his father’s death. The experience has left him needing counselling and significant time away from work.
He is also calling for expert panels to determine when a treatment order can be revoked, rather than leaving these high-stakes decisions to a single clinician.
While the state government has invested more than $223 million into suicide prevention and response initiatives following the mental health royal commission, many working in the sector say more is needed.
Professor Patrick McGorry, executive director of youth mental health organisation Orygen and former Australian of the year, said patients were being discharged too early from mental health units every day.
“Back in the ’80s, we would keep someone with an acute episode in for six weeks and then carefully plan the discharge,” he said. “Now they spend a few days in hospital if they’re lucky enough to even get in.”
McGorry said he had lost count of the number of people who had taken their own lives after failing to access appropriate mental health support.
“These are preventable deaths. These people do not have terminal illnesses. If they were looked after carefully and properly during that acute, risky period, the death rate could be reduced dramatically.”
There has been a 7 per cent rise in suicides in Victoria since the pandemic. In the same period, there have been reductions in NSW and Queensland.
Mental health-related emergency department cases are also on the rise, increasing by almost a third over the past decade, according to Victorian Health Department data.
Coroner’s Court data shows that 520 Victorians took their lives within six weeks of being a mental health inpatient between 2009 and 2018.
Health and Community Services Union Victorian secretary Paul Healy said mental health workers were under intense pressure to free up beds to alleviate overcrowding in emergency departments and ambulance ramping.
“You are told, ‘Get people in, get people out’ – sometimes you have to discharge three people a shift,” said Healy, whose union represents mental health workers.
“It leads to a situation where people are not in the best place to be discharged.”
Healy estimates there is a deficit of at least 200 adult acute mental health beds. He said an additional 1500 staff were needed to service these beds.
Jason Daddy never made it into an acute mental health bed. In 2022, his wife, Therese, phoned the mental health triage service at Werribee Mercy Hospital six times over the course of a month to seek help for her increasingly depressed and anxious husband.
She desperately wanted her husband – an engineer who designed trains for Metro Trains as well as seats in Teslas – to be admitted to hospital.
On June 19, 2022, Therese drove him to the emergency department at the busy hospital in Melbourne’s west in the hope he would finally get clinical care.
She claims that when she arrived at the emergency department, staff were dismissive and told her she was capable of caring for him at home because she had worked as a midwife.
“I was stuck between a rock and a hard place because they didn’t want us there, and my husband didn’t want to be there either,” she recalled. “They just wanted us gone.”
Daddy took his life at home 19 days after being turned away from the hospital’s acute mental health beds.
Therese is still struggling to come to terms with the loss of her kind, warm and intelligent husband.
“It’s not just the grief, it’s the trauma of being dismissed,” she said. “Every time I see a hospital now, I just feel that same panic. You lose your trust in the people who are meant to keep you safe.”
A state government spokesman said every suicide was one too many and its thoughts were with families who had lost loved ones.
He said the government had made significant investments to overhaul Victoria’s mental health system after the royal commission, which tabled its final report in 2021.
This included increasing the workforce by more than 25 per cent and delivering more than 170 new acute public mental health beds.
But Phillipa Thomas, chief executive of Mental Health Victoria, said the state’s mental health system was currently overwhelmed by a perfect storm of understaffing, funding gaps and increasing demand for services.
“Despite a royal commission and isolated areas of new investment, fundamental issues within the mental health system remain unaddressed and constrain the ability of clinicians and health services to respond to what are complex, resource intensive, and often highly unpredictable circumstances,” she said.
The final report from the Royal Commission into Victoria’s Mental Health System made 65 recommendations, which the state government promised to implement in full. In 2022, Victoria imposed a new levy on businesses to fund improvements to the mental health system.
The state’s mental health watchdog has called for greater transparency about how the payroll tax – which raises more than $1 billion each year – is being spent.
A spokesperson for Eastern Health said while it was unable to comment on individual circumstances due to privacy and confidentiality, it followed established clinical, legal and governance frameworks.
A spokesperson for Mercy Health, which runs Werribee Mercy Hospital, said the health service extended its sincere condolences to Daddy’s family and loved ones following his death.
“The safety and wellbeing of our patients is always our highest priority,” they said.
“Our emergency departments and mental health and wellbeing teams assess every person who presents for care and determine the most appropriate treatment and support based on their clinical needs, in line with established clinical guidelines.”

Fresh hope for Cheryl Grimmer family as DPP considers re-opening murder case

Fresh hope for Cheryl Grimmer family as DPP considers re-opening murder case
The NSW Director of Public Prosecutions is considering reopening the case of Cheryl Grimmer, a toddler who vanished from a beach south of Sydney, after the trial of her alleged killer collapsed on a technicality almost seven years ago.
The Grimmer family, who have endured five decades of heartbreak, have already begun sending “fresh evidence” to police in the hope of starting the prosecution anew.
Cheryl was just three when she disappeared from Fairy Meadow beach in 1970 after swimming with her family.
The following year, a teenage boy confessed to police: “I took her by the hand and put one hand around her mouth and carried her around to the sand hills.”
However, the confession sat in a box for five decades until a review of the cold case unearthed the document and police arrested a Victorian taxi driver in 2017. His identity was suppressed to the pseudonym “Mercury” because he had not yet turned 18 at the time of Cheryl’s death.
The prosecution abruptly ended just two years later when a Supreme Court judge ruled Mercury’s confession was “inadmissable” because no parent was in the room. The ODPP, believing its case was doomed to fail, dropped the charge.
Director of Public Prosecutions Sally Dowling has now penned a letter to the Grimmer family saying she was prepared to review the decision to abandon the case.
Dowling said she could revisit the case based on either how the evidence stood in 2019, when Mercury walked free, or on the back of “fresh evidence” collected by the family.
“I also note your reference to fresh information received by your family from potential witnesses which you consider relevant or potentially relevant,” she wrote to the Grimmer family late last week.
“I would invite you to consider whether you wish to progress with a review ... which would be based on the brief of evidence available at the time of the initial decision to discontinue proceedings, or whether you would prefer to refer the fresh information that your family has received to the NSW Police for investigation.”
The DPP was not an investigatory body and could not receive the fresh information directly from the family, Dowling said. Rather, it had to go through the NSW Police first.
“In the event that the NSW Police thereafter obtained additional relevant and admissible evidence and furnished it on this Office, it could be taken into account as part of a review,” she said.
The Grimmer family, in a letter provided to the Herald, said they had immediately reached out to NSW Police to begin the process.
“To maximise the chances of the DPP Office’s review finding that the prosecution against Mercury should be recommenced, we have forwarded our information to NSW Police and asked whether they would be able to generate additional evidence within three months to support the case for the prosecution to be recommenced,” their statement reads.
The Grimmers, who migrated to Australia from England shortly before the disappearance of their toddler, said British police “may be called on” to support NSW Police in the investigation.
NSW MP Jeremy Buckingham last year used parliamentary privilege to name Mercury, despite the court order suppressing the alleged killer’s identity.
“For 55 years, Cheryl’s family and the community of the Illawarra have continued in their relentless, indomitable and inspirational quest for justice for this beautiful girl,” Buckingham said.
“I take the opportunity to say directly to Mercury ... you are a coward, a slug and a murderer.
“You should do the right thing and hand yourself in, explain how you made that confession in 1971 and admit to your egregious crimes. You have not gotten away with anything.”
Buckingham repeatedly used Mercury’s name in the debate, and it appears in the official record from parliament, but that protection does not extend to the media.
Buckingham told the Herald he wanted ‘Cheryl’s Law’ to change how the Children (Criminal Proceedings) Act 1987 was applied in Mercury’s case.
The Grimmer family have been lobbying the government saying the act should not have applied to a man in his 60s, as it was reserved for children and young people in the legal system.
“We presented evidence that in 2019 the NSW Supreme Court made significant errors of law leading to the wrongful exclusion of a 1971 confession and suppression of the accused’s identity,” their statement reads.
“We asked the DPP to re‑lay charges against Mercury – supported by fresh witnesses, legislative materials, and case authorities – and to confirm there is no bar to identifying him.”
They thanked Dowling for re-considering the decision to drop the charge against Mercury.

Tony Burke considers denying visa to Israeli journalist who called for 100,000 casualties in Gaza

Tony Burke considers denying visa to Israeli journalist who called for 100,000 casualties in Gaza
A controversial Israeli journalist could be barred from Australia because of inflammatory comments he made lamenting the fact there hadn’t been more casualties in Gaza and applauding the killing of Palestinian journalists.
Israeli journalist Zvi Yehezkeli is scheduled to speak at fundraising events next month in Sydney and Melbourne, but Home Affairs Minister Tony Burke is considering using his powers to deny him a visa.
Burke told this masthead: “It always surprises me when someone, who has made the sorts of comments that this individual has, advertises a speaking tour before they’ve even received a visa.”
The looming decision comes as the Royal Commission on Antisemitism and Social Cohesion prepares to hold its first public hearing on Tuesday, and the government moves to ban the Islamist group Hizb ut-Tahrir under new laws passed after the Bondi terror attack.
“The ASIO advice is now in. This is the first time we have been able to ban, potentially, a group which falls short of a terrorist listing,” Burke told the ABC’s Insiders on Sunday.
On Sunday, Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said that the royal commission would determine whether more could have been done to stop the terror attack, but that both his government and the commission would continue to work on improving social cohesion.
The peak Palestinian advocacy group in Australia is calling for Burke to deny Yehezkeli a visa.
Burke has previously declined the visa applications of current and former Israeli politicians who have made divisive statements about the war in Gaza.
In an Israeli television appearance in December 2023, Yehezkeli said the Israel Defence Forces should have started the war in Gaza by killing 100,000 Gazans.
“In my opinion, the IDF should have launched a more fatal attack, with 100,000 killed in the beginning,” he said.
At the time, about 20,000 Palestinians were estimated to have been killed in Gaza.
Pressed by his fellow panellists on whether he wanted to see non-combatants killed, Yehezkeli said: “I don’t know who was or wasn’t involved, and who is and isn’t innocent.”
The prominent commentator said a more forceful response to the October 7, 2023, attacks that killed an estimated 1200 people in Israel would have helped to achieve a ceasefire and hostage release on Israel’s terms.
“I’m talking about a military attack; you need to be more fatal than the attack we saw,” he said.
He later defended the comments in a subsequent interview.
Hamas, the militant group that launched the October 7 terror, was estimated to have had about 20,000 fighters before the 2023 attacks.
French-Israeli human rights lawyer Omer Shatz accused Yehezkeli of “publicly and directly [inciting] others to commit genocide against Palestinians in Gaza” in a submission to the International Criminal Court.
Yehezkeli has been listed as a speaker at mental health fundraising events in Melbourne on March 9 and Sydney on March 11 run by Israeli non-profit group the Institute for Social Momentum.
Australia Palestine Advocacy Network president Nasser Mashni said Yehezkeli’s comments were even “more sickening and egregious” than remarks that had sparked calls for Israeli President Isaac Herzog to be uninvited from travelling to Australia after the Bondi Beach massacre.
“Australia must not welcome Israelis who openly advocate for genocide,” he said. “Minister Burke must deny his visa.”
A spokesperson for the Department of Home Affairs said: “Due to privacy reasons, the department cannot comment on individual cases.”
Yehezkeli was contacted for comment.
Referring to Yehezkeli’s 2023 call for 100,000 casualties in Gaza, Mashni said: “Heartbreakingly, he got his wish, as the official death toll continues to be revised higher and higher.”
A study by The Lancet medical journal found that 75,200 Gazans were killed between October 2023 and January 2025, higher than the 49,090 registered by the Hamas-run Ministry of Health.
In a March 2024 interview, Yehezkeli said: “In order to destroy Hamas and its capabilities, you need to take measures, just like in the northern Gaza Strip, to destroy all the capabilities in general. You need to bring Gaza to the point of a humanitarian disaster.”
In August 2025, Yehezkeli applauded an Israeli strike on Nasser Hospital in Gaza’s Khan Yunis that led to the death of Reuters photographer Hussam al-Masri, Al Jazeera cameraman Mohammad Salameh, two freelance photojournalists – Mariam Dagga and Moaz Abu Taha – and journalist Ahmed Abu Aziz. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said he regretted the strike, calling it a “tragic mishap”.
“If Israel has decided to eliminate the journalists, better late than never,” Yehezkeli said on an evening news broadcast, describing them as “Nukhba terrorists in every sense”, a reference to Hamas’ elite fighting squad, according to Israeli newspaper Haaretz.
Yehezkeli later released a video claiming his commentary had been misunderstood.
“Everyone knows that a journalist in Gaza cannot be a free journalist and is subordinate to Hamas. I certainly did not call for killing journalists, only those who use ‘press’ credentials as cover to fight, which makes them terrorists in every respect,” he said.
In January, Burke cancelled the visa of Sammy Yahood, a Jewish social media influencer who called for the ban of Islam and was booked to speak in Australia, saying that “spreading hatred is not a good reason to come”.
In 2024, Burke denied a visa to former Israeli cabinet minister Ayelet Shaked on the grounds that she would undermine social cohesion, sparking a diplomatic dispute with Israel.
Last August, Burke cancelled a visa for far-right Israeli politician Simcha Rothman days before he was due to arrive in Australia for a speaking event.

Australian neo-Nazi group included women bashers, stalkers, drug dealers and accused paedophile

Australian neo-Nazi group included women bashers, stalkers, drug dealers and accused paedophile
The Australian neo-Nazi group which held an anti-Jewish rally outside NSW Parliament last year and continues to harbour ambitions to form a political party, included serious domestic violence offenders, drug dealers, stalkers and an accused paedophile.
The National Socialist Network formally disbanded in January to avoid designation as a hate group under new laws passed following the Bondi mass shooting.
However, its former members have remained active in Australia’s far-right ecosystem and the group has played a prominent role in the anti-immigration March for Australia protests.
The NSN’s leadership has said it continues to harbour ambitions of forming a political party, and the criminal records of its members and associates provide an insight into the likely core membership of any future party.
In a statement, Jack Eltis, who headed the NSW chapter of the NSN, downplayed the criminal records of its members — saying he had not personally witnessed criminal behaviour and was “honoured” to be associated with them — while also claiming “involvement in criminality was always immediate grounds for removal” from the group.
But while the NSN and its various offshoots used slick online propaganda to leverage racist tropes about migrant crime to gain mainstream attention, while painting itself as a group of “honourable” men, a months-long investigation by this masthead has found it was a beacon for criminals.
Among the 60-odd black-clad members of the NSN who held an anti-Jewish rally outside parliament in October was serial domestic violence offender Jamie McGowan.
Four years ago, in December 2021, McGowan came home from work and got into an argument with his partner over a sandwich.
Her young son had, he believed, eaten ham he’d left in the fridge. He began shouting at the child and when his partner intervened, they started arguing.
McGowan hit her in the face multiple times, choked her and dragged her around their house by the arm as her two young children watched on. He headbutted the fridge and broke a door in the apartment.
McGowan initially denied the assault, claiming the bruises on his partner were caused by self-harm.
But police obtained a 27-minute audio recording of the violent rampage. In it, McGowan could be heard telling his partner: “I’m about to rip your head off your fucking shoulders c---” and “I’m going to snap your f---ing neck c---″.
The recording, transcribed in police documents tendered in court and obtained by this masthead, captured what police described as his partner “struggling to breathe” while McGowan told her to “shut up c---“. At another point, she screamed at him to “get off me” while her two children could be heard screaming and crying.
“I felt terrified,” she said in a police interview. “I thought I was going to die with my daughter in my arms and my son on the bed”.
Court records show McGowan, who also appeared in photographs at other NSN gatherings and was an active member of the group’s NSW chapter, has an extensive history of apprehended violence orders.
Dating back to 2015, police have applied for AVOs against him on behalf of at least six different women.
McGowan was not the only member of the NSW chapter of the NSN with a history of AVOs. Senior member Chris Birmingham as well as Dwayne Bullen, Daniel Sharp, Adam Carrig and Gavin Begbie have all had restraining orders taken out against them by women or family members.
He is also not the only member to have served time in prison. Adrian John Carr, a Wollongong-based NSN member who helped to start a Nazi cell in that city in 2021 previously served prison time over a grievous bodily harm conviction in 2015. He was also sentenced to a community corrections order in 2023 for firearms and drug possession charges.
During the COVID-19 pandemic, Carr, who Eltis said left the group in August 2025, recorded himself yelling at Centrelink staff and customers and shouting “Sieg Heil” while wearing a costume sheep’s head, apparently in protest to social distancing measures.
Another criminal Nazi, Benjamin Jacob Thomas, was not a member of the NSN — he was in prison for much of the organisation’s existence — but was previously part of the same Illawarra Nazi cell, Activ88, as Carr.
Thomas, who has had the words “Mein Kampf” tattooed on his forehead, was already in jail in 2022 over a separate matter when he was sentenced to three-and-a-half years in prison for paying a child to set fire to one of his Nazi associates new $90,000 Ford Ranger Raptor because of a dispute over a woman.
The same associate was subsequently convicted and jailed for assault and intimidation after he repeatedly punched and kicked a woman while she was pregnant.
Another NSN associate not at the rally was Jonathan Salter, 25, a now-former Australian Defence Force member who was arrested at the Holsworthy barracks in August and is facing multiple charges of accessing, possessing and distributing child abuse and extremist material.
Salter, who has been pictured at NSN training sessions, is currently in custody. He is yet to enter a plea and was last week refused bail in the Supreme Court. Documents obtained by this masthead show prosecutors allege he possessed multiple “exceptionally serious examples” of child abuse material, including children as young as one being horrifically abused.
Investigators also allegedly found “extensive messages and files” showing his support for “white supremacy, Nazi ideology and violent extremism”, including multiple videos of the Christchurch massacre and “various NSN propaganda documents”.
In one online conversation, he allegedly said he had quit the group, complaining the NSN was not moving in a “serious direction”. Eltis told this masthead Salter had attended two NSN training sessions but was “subsequently denied membership on character grounds”.
Another member, Chris Carrig, was convicted in 2024 for harassing and intimidating a Jewish man at a bus stop in Macquarie Park in Sydney’s north-west.
Carrig — who has also been convicted over a vandalism spree at Macquarie University in which he spray-painted slogans such as “Heil Hitler” — taunted and humiliated the man, who was wearing a kippah.
“Jews catching the bus, that’s a bit low,” Carrig said in a video he uploaded online.
“Go call uncle Goldberg, he’ll get you a BMW.”
Eltis said the NSN had only asked “ideological, personal and character” questions of applicants, and had not asked for their surnames. He said any future political party would involve “more extensive background checking”, but also dismissed the criminal histories of its members, saying AVOS, for example, could be “issued frivolously”.
“In any endeavour I may be involved in, people will be held to high character standards for their in-person and online conduct just the same as they were with NSN,” he told this masthead.
Last month Eltis said in a livestreamed conversation with the head of the March For Australia, Bec Walker, who uses the alias Bec Freedom online, that the group would still seek to form a political party if it was unable to avoid new hate speech laws.
“Obviously, it would be a bit different going forward. We wouldn’t continue the same, you know, operations and aesthetics, but, yeah, a political party would be the approach,” he said.
“And people already know who we are … they know the leadership and what we’re about.”
The NSN’s senior leadership also contains criminals. Its national leader, Thomas Sewell has been convicted for multiple assaults, and Joel Davis, one of the organisation’s most prominent members who is currently behind bars after last year telling followers to “rhetorically rape” Wentworth MP Allegra Spender, has previously been convicted for drug supply after he was caught selling ecstasy to an undercover police officer at a music festival in 2013.
This masthead has previously revealed that a senior member of the neo-Nazi group is also a close right hand of misogynist influencer and accused sex trafficker Andrew Tate.
Last month, an investigation exposed NSN leadership’s close entanglement with dozens of convicted terrorists and extremist groups overseas, as experts warned the neo-Nazi group is more volatile than ever since its on-paper dissolution.
Other NSN members have convictions that demonstrate the organisation’s dark pull among those with substance abuse and mental health issues. In April 2023, police were called to a busy street in Wollongong to reports that a shirtless man had been punching cars and lying down on the road.
The man, who is now 24-years-old, had been observed by witnesses lying down in the middle of the road yelling “please someone run me over and kill me”.
He was stopped by officers who conducted checks on his identity which revealed he was “well recorded for mental health” issues related to autism. During a search, documents tendered in court state that the man headbutted the rear side window of a police vehicle, causing it to smash. The documents state he “began headbutting the footpath and continued saying he wanted to die”. He was issued a 12-month conditional release order.
Others with a criminal past include Nicholas Williamson, a 34-year-old from Sydney’s northern beaches. Despite attending a prestigious private school and enjoying what a court described as “an ideal childhood”, in 2019 Williamson pleaded guilty to two counts of drug supply after he admitted to storing MDMA at his house in exchange for cash and cocaine.
A university dropout who in the early 2010s played bass in a post punk band called My City Screams, Williamson told the court at the time he had been depressed and anxious after breaking up with his girlfriend.

Once a boozy rite of passage, has university O-Week changed for good?

Once a boozy rite of passage, has university O-Week changed for good?
One-hundred shots of beer in 50 minutes. If you vomit, you drink it.
For many former university students, O-Week was about intoxication more than orientation. A hazy week of pub crawls, toga parties and beer-skolling marathons, most involving drinking alcohol, sometimes to excess.
But with the cost-of-living crunch and research showing Gen Z are less likely to drink, university O-Week has increasingly become a more wholesome, less boozy affair. There are free barbecues, flower crown and origami sessions, or cake and book clubs – most have no link to alcohol at all.
University of Melbourne psychology and economics degree student Rachel Winter moved from Canberra last year, just in time for her first O-Week.
At 17, she wasn’t old enough to take part in pub crawls, but she didn’t really want to either.
“It tastes bad and it’s expensive, so it’s not worth it. Ever since I discovered social dancing, there were so many other activities that are more fun than getting drunk,” she said.
Now 18, she’s president of the DanceSport Club, which runs classes in tango, ballroom, bachata and salsa.
She said students were more interested in their health and wellness, and there were limitless options including sporting clubs, writing clubs, crocheting, a bubble tea society, and K-pop and Taylor Swift appreciation societies.
More than 12,000 students will descend on the University of Melbourne for orientation activities from Monday, with more than 230 clubs, societies and graduate groups, and 200 different activities and events.
Gianluca Di Censo, a fellow at National Centre for Education and Training on Addiction research, says Zoomers are predicted to be about 18 times more likely to abstain from alcohol compared to Baby Boomers, and drink about 43 per cent less a week. They have internalised health messages and are worried about impacts on their health and wellbeing.
But Di Censo said it was hard to say if more drugs were on the menu.
“Our national surveys show an increase in illicit substance use, but this is typically measured as past-year use,” he said. “Weekly use is still quite low.”
However, LaTrobe University Associate Professor Amy Pennay, from the Centre for Alcohol Policy Research, said 16- or 17-year-olds, who classified themselves as light drinkers or abstainers, reported heavy drinking when they got to O-Week and the first semester of university.
“They say, ‘it was kind of a blip. You know, we felt the pressure. It was really nerve-wracking, meeting new people’, and then ... after they kind of settle into university, that settles again,” Pennay said.
She said young people were more likely to socialise online, rather than at a park or pub.
“Flirting as well, online and those kinds of things you used to need a drink to build up the Dutch courage, the screen is providing that Dutch courage,” she said.
It’s a far cry from the experience of early-2000 graduates at Monash University’s Clayton campus.
“Green Week” revolved around “the centurion”, a drinking game where students skolled 100 shots of beer in 50 minutes. If you vomited, you had to drink it. Many did. The week was held around July, well after O-Week.
A Monash alumnus, now an upper gastrointestinal surgeon, who asked not to be named because of his profession, said he had got to 50 shots before he vomited, but a friend of his drank his own vomit to stay in the game.
“Centurion gave me the skills to pursue surgery and appreciate the importance of the oesophagus,” he joked.
Monash deputy vice chancellor Professor Sarah McDonald said there’d been a significant shift over the past decade, with alcohol no longer playing a central role in Orientation Week.
“There is a much stronger focus on inclusive, alcohol-free events than there was five or 10 years ago,” she said.
The National Tertiary Education Union’s Monash University branch president Ben Eltham said it seemed students were “more sober, more committed, more studious” than the old days.
So, is there still a place for a pub on campus? “Yes,” he said. “But we need to recognise that students are having different types of recreation these days.”
Sinking beers at the pub was also a “pretty expensive thing for a student to do”, he said.
La Trobe student union president Amelia Sevior said the university experience had shifted dramatically.
Her mum, who went to La Trobe 10 years ago as a mature aged student and made lifelong friends, can’t believe all her daughter’s classes are online. There was no reason for her to be on campus at all.
“I think university life is completely different,” Sevior said.
National Union of Students president Felix Hughes, 22, also believes university culture has lost a bit of its soul, and students aren’t getting as much out of it as they used to.
When voluntary student unionism was legislated in 2006, student organisations experienced a dramatic drop in funding.
“When there are events, it’s maybe a one-off in the semester, rather than just regular O-Week events,” he said.
Hughes said students struggled to afford groceries, petrol or rent, let alone alcohol.
Even if they could afford to drink alcohol, many student-run bars or pubs have closed, including The Hammer and Swine at Swinburne, which shut in 2023.
La Trobe’s student union-run Eagle bar was turned into a for-hire function space, while the Corkman, near Melbourne University, was illegally pulled down in 2016.
Monash Clayton’s Sir John’s Bar is still run as a licensed student venue.
Hughes believes it’s safer to drink on campus, than outside venues where there’s less supervision, or access to mental health support or first-aiders.
Australian Medical Association Victoria representative Sarah Whitelaw said overall, the 18-24 age bracket was drinking less, but more likely to drink in risky ways.
In 2022/23, the National Drug Strategy Household Survey found 14.8 per cent of 18-24-year-olds were more likely to drink 11 or more standard drinks in a single day at least monthly - a level associated with an increased risk of injury and hospitalisation.
“That’s the sort of drinking that we’re talking about at O-Week, that we worry about. We know ... they’re 14 times as likely to experience an injury requiring medical attention, and 10.5 times as likely to have experienced an injury requiring admission to hospital,” Whitelaw said.
Those injuries included falls, fights, accidental alcohol overdoses, sexual assaults, car accidents and, in the past few years, e-scooter injuries.
“Yes, it is still a really big problem. Yes, alcohol is responsible for a higher rate of hospitalisations than any other drug. We’re still dealing with huge numbers, and it is a real concern,” Whitelaw said.
Alcohol and Drug Foundation tips for safe drinking
Drink a “spacer”: a glass of non-alcoholic drink or water every few drinks.
Take sips, not gulps, and drink at your own pace.
Have someone you trust close by.
Use a smaller glass.
Don’t let people top up your drink. Always finish your drink before getting a new one.
Know the alcohol content of what you are drinking, and avoid highly alcoholic drinks.
Eat before and while drinking: it slows your drinking pace and fills you up.
Don’t just sit and drink - play pool or dance. You’ll tend to drink less.
It’s OK to say no, you can even plan your response in advance.
Respect people’s decision not to drink and don’t encourage risky drinking behaviours.
If a person who has been drinking or is tired, don’t let them drive home.
If a friend has had too much to drink, encourage them to switch to non-alcoholic drinks.
Alcohol and Drug Foundation head of evidence and innovation Craig Martin said people did still see O-Week as a party. “I think we’ll see a lot of alcohol and illicit drugs at O-Week across the country, even if it’s declined slightly,” he said.
“It’s important that we get those harm-reduction messages out there. I used to work in ICU and looked after many a drunk young man who became a quadriplegic by ute surfing.”
A Liquor Control Victoria spokesperson said that during O-Week, compliance inspectors visit campuses and venues with a focus on preventing underage drinking, ensuring proper ID checks and stopping any irresponsible or unlawful liquor promotion.
Financial economics exchange student Philomene Macarie, 20, has joined the DanceSport club at the University of Melbourne, but she also likes a drink. It remains a significant part of her university experience.
She says peer pressure to drink has significantly decreased in recent years.
“I’ve never lived in a country where alcohol is as expensive as here. I think I would drink a bit more if it was cheaper.”

Released emails reveal heavy political lobbying as massive gas project extended

Released emails reveal heavy political lobbying as massive gas project extended
Woodside engaged in a concerted lobbying campaign to convince Environment Minister Murray Watt’s department to water down conditions designed to reduce emissions emanating from its North West Shelf project – one of the largest gas projects in the country.
Emails released under freedom-of-information laws show the conditions attached to Watt’s approval of Woodside extending the plant’s operation to 2070 were changed several times after the gas giant’s lobbying.
In May last year, Watt said he had imposed “strict” conditions on his provisional approval of Woodside’s bid to extend its North West Shelf operation in Karratha to 2070. At the time, he refused to reveal the conditions, he said, so Woodside had the opportunity to respond to the terms.
The documents show his department was negotiating the terms of those conditions with Woodside until September 6, 2025, before Watt announced on September 12 the 48 conditions upon which his approval of the North West Shelf extension rested.
The released emails show Woodside was particularly opposed to two conditions: that it monitor levels of various emissions in real time, and that it reduce emissions on five-yearly intervals.
On August 26, a Woodside official, whose name was redacted from the documents released by the Environment Department, wrote to department deputy secretary Rachel Parry to complain about several conditions the department was seeking to impose.
“As discussed in our meeting with the minister yesterday we received your revised document with highlighted mark-ups on Sunday and note some of the conditions that we had previously advised as needing change have not been addressed,” the Woodside official wrote.
One of those proposed conditions would have compelled Woodside to demonstrate at five-year intervals that it had reduced carbon monoxide, methane and particulate matter emissions to lower levels than had been emitted over the previous 12 months.
According to Woodside: “Condition 8 does not recognise that emissions intensity will, in fact, increase year-on-year as NWS production declines. Our projections indicate we will be unable to meet this requirement from 2026 onwards.”
The five-yearly component of that condition was later dropped, with Watt’s final condition requiring Woodside to maintain carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, methane and particulate matter emissions at levels no greater than during the 12 months before Watt’s approval.
The government gave Woodside a partial win on its bid to have the department’s preference for continuous emissions monitoring dropped and replaced with “predictive monitoring” systems for existing fuel processing.
The department argued in emails with Woodside that predictive models offered a “high potential for inaccurate emissions data, not allowing for the detection of emissions spikes or deviations from normal operations”.
Watt’s approved condition allows Woodside to implement continuous emission monitoring or predictive emission monitoring of air emissions by June 30, 2030, though Woodside will be required to implement continuous monitoring of air emissions before starting third-party gas processing.
The emails offer a rare glimpse into the relationship between the energy giant and the government.
On June 12, 2025, a Woodside official wrote to departmental executives to request a 10-business-day extension to respond to Watt’s conditions.
The company asked the government department to “align” its public messaging with Woodside’s media statement.
“Can you please confirm your agreement to the extension via return email as in our media statement tomorrow, we are looking to state that an extension was agreed, not specifying that it has been requested,” an official wrote.
“We’d appreciate [it] if your media statement was aligned.”
Woodside’s Karratha gas-processing plant is less than 1 kilometre from Murujuga, an ancient rock art site that holds more than 1 million petroglyphs documenting some 47,000 years of human history.
Murujuga was placed on the UNESCO World Heritage List in July 2025, after successful lobbying efforts by Watt.
Watt’s intervention came after the World Heritage Committee published a recommendation last May to knock back the site’s inclusion on the list over fears that industry – including the gas-processing plant – was damaging the petroglyphs.
Watt’s approval of the North West Shelf project extension is being challenged in the Federal Court of Australia and the WA Supreme Court by community group Save Australian Rock Art.
Mardathoonera woman Raelene Cooper, a Murujuga traditional custodian and spokesperson for Save our Songlines, said she was surprised that “anyone still believes a word this government says”.
“The government have basically given Woodside everything they’ve asked and rolled out the doormat for them to keep trashing Murujuga.”
A spokeswoman for Watt said: “The minister accepted the advice and recommendations of his department and imposed 48 strict conditions on Woodside. As this matter is currently before the courts, it would be inappropriate to comment further.”
A Woodside spokesperson said the Australian government’s approval of the North West Shelf Extension followed a comprehensive and extended assessment by both Commonwealth and West Australian state regulators in accordance with statutory processes.
“There are three separate legal proceedings in the Federal Court of Australia challenging the federal government’s environmental approval of the North West Shelf Extension.
“Woodside will vigorously defend its position in these proceedings, but as these matters are before the court we will not comment further.”

This Sydney suburb was promised a mosque. Seven years and millions of dollars later, the site sits empty
A proposal to build a mosque in southern Sydney, which has received almost $5 million in community funds and the support of a former NRL star, has stalled, and after almost seven years, two court battles, and a lengthy debate with the local council, the site remains empty.
Non-profit Hurstville Community Centre in December 2019 proposed turning the defunct Botany Gardens Nursing Home at 88-92 Botany Street, Carlton, into a place of public worship for Muslims to partake in prayer, youth activities, counselling, and education between 9am and 10pm, seven days a week.
The plan included partial demolition and alteration works to the nursing home to build a mosque and 27 car park spaces on the 1988-square-metre site. The developer outlined a maximum capacity of 120 people at any one time, and ruled out holding functions such as weddings, funerals, or Eid celebrations onsite, and prohibited amplified speakers or audio systems.
But after several years in the pipeline, a planning row, and numerous legal hurdles between the owners and the council, there is no building to show for the approved project – the site remains empty.
Hurstville Community Centre took Georges River Council to court and won, after the development application was refused in December 2021 over amenity and site unsuitability concerns. In 2022, it received council approval to begin construction, despite more than 2000 resident submissions which were mostly against the project.
Work then halted in February 2025 after the council discovered “excessive demolition” to the existing structure between May and September 2023. The builders were taken to court in December 2025, and fined $12,000, on top of the $15,000 the council spent on legal fees.
The non-profit also held a community fundraiser for the mosque project in December 2022. More than 80 items, including a red Mazda RX-8, KitchenAid stand mixer, luxury jewellery and a Breitling watch were auctioned off, raising more than $4.8 million.
Cross-code rugby league, rugby union, and boxing champion Sonny Bill Williams has also made frequent appearances on the organisation’s “Hurstville Masjid” Facebook and Instagram pages in support of the project.
“I guess I have an emotional attachment to this Masjid because it’s in my area … it’s where I learned Islam,” Williams said in a video. “I just think that we will finally have a place of our own in Hurstville, that’s the most important thing … it’s about us trying to help the community, leaving it in a better place for our kids and our kids’ kids.”
However, there has been no activity on the account, or any construction updates since June 2023.
Williams, who converted to Islam in 2009, posted a video on his personal Instagram account in February 2025 to provide an update on the project.
“We are here, unfortunately almost three years later, at the site of the Hurstville Masjid. It’s just a matter of technicalities between the builders and council, and that’s what has held us back for the past year,” he said.
Sheikh Kamal Taleb, who appeared alongside Williams, said: “Unfortunately as you could see not much progress has happened.”
Independent councillor Ben Wang will move a motion at a council meeting on Monday to hold a public forum for residents to discuss the plan, status of the site, and other community concerns. Wang said the project was a “long journey” and a “difficult situation for all involved”.
“Residents have been objecting to this for a very long time … I just want to promote transparency – it’s hard, we haven’t got the full story. I want the council to publish on their website the whole details, give an update, including answering questions, also to help dispel any misinformation,” he said.
A spokesperson for Georges River Council said they would “continue to ensure that any ongoing or future works comply with all relevant planning approvals and conditions.”
Hurstville Community Centre, and Sheikh Kamal Taleb, who the organisation said oversaw the project, were contacted for comment.

$1b data centre given planning tick in just 75 days as state gets cosy with big tech

$1b data centre given planning tick in just 75 days as state gets cosy with big tech
A massive Port Melbourne data centre, costing almost $1 billion, cleared Victorian planning hurdles in just 75 days over summer, in a sign of the state’s desperation to attract global tech investment.
It comes as the diaries of the minister tasked with enticing data centres to Victoria, Danny Pearson, reveal he met big tech chief executives and lobbyists 16 times last year.
The Port Melbourne project is part of a wave of new data centres being built to handle Australia’s increasing demand for artificial intelligence and cloud storage. While AI use is expanding, there is growing community concern over data centres’ high energy and water needs.
The Port Melbourne project will add to NextDC’s existing “hyperscale” facilities in Melbourne; others have been built by Microsoft, Amazon Web Services, CDC, and AirTrunk.
NextDC’s Port Melbourne site had housed News Corp’s major newspaper printing plant, where The Age was also published for a brief period under an agreement with News Corp. The printing plant was demolished in 2024.
The scale of Australia’s data centre construction boom is reflected in recent results from industrial builder Goodman Group, which revealed the centres now account for three-quarters of its $14 billion workbook.
Victoria holds one-third of Australia’s data centre market and is competing against New South Wales, which has 56 per cent. Data centres are increasingly built in major cities, largely in industrial areas, to be closer to users, and to access existing power and water infrastructure. These urban locations also provide the large construction workforces and specialised tech staff needed to build and operate the facilities more efficiently than in regional areas.
NextDC formally proposed the Port Melbourne data centre, to cost $911 million to build, at the end of October. In January, 75 days later, Planning Minister, Sonya Kilkenny, approved the application. She did not meet NextDC before approving the plan.
The Port Melbourne centre is just the latest quick turnaround for developers of the high-tech buildings: AirTrunk had a $973 million Tullamarine project approved last April after 44 days, while an $85 million NextDC centre in Geelong was approved in 28 days.
Government planning reports show an industrial permit approval in metropolitan Melbourne usually takes around 173 days. The Port Melbourne project was fast-tracked because its cost exceeds the $20 million threshold for state-significant developments in Melbourne.
Asked on Friday about the planning application’s rapid approval, and how Victoria compared with other Australian states for turnaround times, a NextDC spokeswoman declined to comment.
The Allan government has championed rapid approvals as a win for the state’s economic renewal. Premier Jacinta Allan visited the site in June, when NextDC first said publicly it would apply to build the data centre. In November, Allan promised to be “ruthless” about attracting data centre construction, which the heavily indebted government hopes could bring in $25 billion in private investment.
Minister for Economic Growth and Jobs Danny Pearson said in December the major investment would mean more jobs and training for the next generation of tech workers.
Pearson’s diary for 2025 revealed 16 meetings with key players – including NextDC, AirTrunk, Microsoft and Amazon.
In February, he met AirTrunk chief executive Robin Khuda. In March, he met Microsoft’s managing director Steven Worrall. In April, he hosted a Data Centre Roundtable attended by a who’s who of the sector, including Amazon, CDC, and NextDC. The meetings continued through May, June, September, October, and December.
Asked in December about his many meetings with data centre developers, Pearson was emphatic it was simply his job: “They’re investors in this state, yeah? And I want their dollars here.”
Pearson has said that regulation of data centres in Victoria will be light. “You put AI on a leash and you let it run,” he told The Australian Financial Review in January. “If it starts to get away from you … then you look at trying to say, ‘We need to intervene.’ ”
Data centres bring with them “power purchase agreements” signed with electricity generators, typically lasting a decade or two to buy renewable energy at a fixed price. Pearson argues Victoria can use data centres “to fast track the decarbonisation of the Victorian economy”.
A government spokesman on Friday said it was “both expected and appropriate for ministers to engage with their stakeholders”, and that the Port Melbourne centre would support thousands of construction jobs and hundreds of ongoing roles once it was finished.
Opposition Energy spokesman, David Davis, said while data centres made an important economic contribution, the projects required more rigorous planning and energy assessments.
Data Centres Australia represents the sector and chief executive Belinda Dennett said the speed with which the Port Melbourne facility had been approved was appropriate because the state was in a global competition to attract tech investment.
“Data centre investment is a priority for the state’s economic growth, for productivity and for jobs,” she said. “The [Victorian government] understands that speed to market is critical to the sector and that to attract global workloads and investment, approval time frames need to meet global standards.”
The speed of the approval drew criticism from the Greens, though, with Victorian leader Ellen Sandell accusing state Labor of “letting huge data centres take up precious space in the middle of our biggest city”.
Sandell questioned both the environmental and employment benefits of the project. “Once the ribbon is cut on these data centres there are hardly any jobs in them,” Sandell told state Parliament last week. She said the state should not be “sacrificing our drinking water, our energy and our prime inner-city land just to supplement the profits of big tech billionaires”.
The five-storey facility is on industrial land adjacent to the West Gate Park wetlands, and close to the West Gate Freeway. Under state rules for industrial zones, the development was exempt from the usual public notice and community objection phase that would happen if it was close to homes, a school or a hospital.
Lord Mayor Nick Reece warned the Port Melbourne project had exposed a “clear policy gap,” leaving city councils without the tools to manage the impacts of such developments on energy, water and emissions. And while welcoming the investment, he called for urgent action to create proper policies for new centres. “Data centres are the biggest thing to hit the energy grid since the introduction of air conditioning in the 1960s,” he said. “We need to get it right.”
The government’s planning assessment of NextDC’s Port Melbourne data centre, which will operate 24 hours a day and support up to 180 staff and visitors, said it was “an appropriate use and development of the land and is unlikely to result in unacceptable off-site impacts”.

‘The door has slammed’: What happened to Australia’s next crop of ultra-wealthy tech founders?

‘The door has slammed’: What happened to Australia’s next crop of ultra-wealthy tech founders?
In the boom years, Australian tech founders were lionised like surf champions riding a perfect swell. Billions of dollars sloshed through venture funds. Software-as-a-service companies selling things such as subscriptions to accounting or coding tools were valued at eye-watering amounts. The bankers who earn big fees listing start-ups on the public markets circled like seagulls over hot chips.
But they ate little. Some of Australia’s most promising tech companies deferred listing, happy to avoid the spotlight of the markets and tap deep-pocketed investors here and abroad for funding instead.
Now the tide has retreated, valuations are down and staff are being laid off. Behind it all is a fear that powerful new AI coding tools such as Claude will make it much easier for newcomers to replace the dependable streams of subscription revenue these businesses thrived on. And the question echoing through boardrooms, from Sydney to San Francisco, is blunt: did our unicorns wait too long?
Prominent venture capital investor Daniel Petre says the market correction for software companies has been brutal. “If you were a SaaS [Software-as-a-Service] company in good shape and initial public offering-ready in 2025 and did not list, then the door has now slammed in your face,” he says.
The big bright spot for Australian start-ups this year is Eucalyptus, which sold last week for $US1.15 billion ($1.6 billion) to a US-listed rival called Hims & Hers. But Eucalyptus was never in the software-as-a-service game; it sells weight-loss drugs such as Wegovy and Mounjaro.
And even then, Eucalyptus did not go public in its own right. Unease with the public markets, especially the local bourse, is clear in parts of Australia’s tight-knit start-up world.
There was one telling moment, in September last year. SafetyCulture founder Luke Anear was sitting on stage at the Tech Council of Australia’s annual summit in Sydney when the ASX’s head of listings, James Posnett, stood up from the crowd and made his pitch. The $165 million capital raising that SafetyCulture had spent a year grinding through in private markets, Posnett said, could have been done in “a day or two” on the public exchange.
Anear’s reply was instant: “Yeah, because the ASX has never been brutal on any company.”
The room laughed, but beneath the quip about the constant reporting requirements for public companies and harsh judgments of often short-term investors was something more uncomfortable. SafetyCulture, valued at $2.5 billion, has been building its workplace operations software for two decades. It is perhaps best known for its early safety checklist product.
Culture Amp, the Melbourne-based HR tech platform once valued at $2 billion, has been around since 2009 and lets companies survey their workforces anonymously. Their growth had been remarkable, and both were supposed to be the next chapter in the Australian tech success story – the heirs to Atlassian, the next Canva. Instead, both companies enter 2026 with new chief executives at the helm, depressed valuations and an initial public offering (IPO) window that looks as elusive as ever.
The leadership changes took the start-up sector by surprise. In November 2024, Anear stepped down as SafetyCulture chief executive after 20 years, handing the reins to Kelly Vohs, a US-based executive who had spent a decade running companies in the portfolio of the giant global asset manager Blackstone. Then, in January this year, Culture Amp co-founder Didier Elzinga made a similar move, shifting to executive chairman and installing former chief financial officer Caroline Rawlinson into the top job.
Together, the moves were striking: some of Australia’s most prominent unicorn founders stepping back before delivering the full cash returns their investors and early employees – who often accept lower salaries than they might get elsewhere in exchange for shares in the company – had waited years for.
In November, details leaked from an annual investor day for Blackbird Ventures and the picture wasn’t pretty for either unicorn, the term used to describe billion-dollar tech start-ups. Blackbird, which is the country’s largest venture capital firm and a major backer of both companies, wrote down Culture Amp’s valuation by 23.5 per cent. SafetyCulture was also marked down.
The write-downs came amid real challenges. Culture Amp had cut 6 per cent of its workforce – about 60 jobs – earlier that month, its second round of layoffs since 2023. SafetyCulture posted a $49 million loss for its most recent financial year, up from $35 million the year earlier, on revenue of $197 million.
Petre, the veteran venture capitalist, says the window to go public isn’t permanently shut, but recovery depends on whether these companies can prove their resilience. “Assuming they can, and overall SaaS valuations recalibrate up a bit, then late 2026 and early 2027 should see the IPO door open again. If it turns out that they struggle to show continued growth, and valuations do not recover much, then it would be fair to say they missed their chance to IPO at a decent valuation.”
Culture Amp’s new boss, Rawlinson, says her focus is firmly on the business rather than any IPO timeline. “An IPO is only one pathway to liquidity for shareholders, or source of growth capital,” she tells this masthead. “Culture Amp is cash flow positive and can self-fund our growth plans. Our focus is on continuing to grow the business and delivering industry-leading product innovations like our AI Coach.”
SafetyCulture did not make its chief executive available for interview, but a spokeswoman said that “we’re focused on building a generational company that has never been solely about software”.
”Our platform also spans hardware, consumables and insurance, so we believe we are well placed to navigate the future, regardless of the volatile nature of the public or private markets.”
In both cases external expectations seem to be shifting: from all-conquering economic powerhouses to, well, normal companies.
Blackbird partner Rick Baker says both companies are now “real businesses” that are mostly cash-flow positive. “In some cases we’ve already sold some of our holdings to other investors in the private markets,” Baker says. “IPO windows open and close, and we still feel positive that 2026-27 holds good prospects for businesses with strong fundamentals.”
When a company times an exit right (even after being on the markets), the results can be momentous. Nick Molnar and Anthony Eisen listed their buy-now-pay-later business Afterpay on the ASX in 2016 with a modest $25 million public offering. Five years later, they sold to Jack Dorsey’s Block in a deal worth $39 billion. One of the co-founders was a former investment banker. As one high-profile Melbourne-based venture capital investor puts it: “Knowing when to sell is a fundamental skill.”
Sam Kroonenburg, who co-founded cloud training platform A Cloud Guru and sold it to Pluralsight for $2 billion in 2021, says his decision to exit was more pragmatic than it might appear. “We knew markets were frothy and multiples wouldn’t stay there forever,” he tells this masthead.
But Kroonenburg resists the idea that he and his brother Ryan pulled off some perfectly calculated move. “Timing exits is part judgment, part courage and part luck,” he says. “Anyone who claims it is purely skill is kidding themselves. We were fortunate to exit when we did. I would not frame it as a masterstroke.”
He’s also sympathetic to those who stayed the course. “It’s easy in hindsight to say companies should have IPO’d in 2021. But founders are not trying to time markets, they are trying to build enduring businesses.”
What nobody anticipated, Kroonenburg says, was how quickly AI would reshape the landscape. “In hindsight, exiting near the peak of the SaaS cycle and starting again at the beginning of the AI era looks strategic, but it was not. That was luck.”
Anish Sinha, a former Goldman Sachs analyst and co-founder of insurtech Upcover, says the issue isn’t timing but competition. “The bigger threat is actually a new wave of AI-native start-ups that are faster and more nimble, and don’t carry the same legacy,” Sinha says.
In essence, observers believe AI tools such as Claude Code could let companies that are clients of software-as-a-service firms replicate their tools cheaply, or new upstarts undercut their pricing.
Meanwhile, Australian investors are voting with their feet. Data from trading platform eToro shows US equity holdings among Australian investors rose from 22 per cent in late 2023 to 37 per cent by the end of 2025, with one in three now expecting US markets to deliver the strongest long-term returns.
While SafetyCulture and Culture Amp wrestle with their path forward, the companies around them face their own challenges. Australia’s biggest privately held technology company, Canva, is positioning itself as a winner from AI – though its publicly listed peers such as Adobe and Figma are down 40 and 77 per cent, respectively, over the past year – as it holds off on a long-awaited listing. Airwallex, the fintech powerhouse valued at $12 billion, had been signalling an IPO, but an AUSTRAC compliance probe has complicated that timeline.
What’s clear is that the 2020-21 window – when capital was cheap, multiples were sky-high and investors would fund almost anything – was a golden opportunity. Afterpay and A Cloud Guru seized it. Others waited.
“There will be a time, most likely, that we will list, but I’d like it to be a bit further along,” Anear told the tech summit in September. The question Australia’s start-up ecosystem is wrestling with is whether “a bit further along” arrives in time.

Iran says has right self-defence if US talks fail

Iran's top diplomat said Sunday that his country would strike back at U.S. interests in the Middle East in the event of an attack, though he still saw a chance for a diplomatic resolution.
Speaking to U.S. broadcaster CBS, Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi said he expected new talks on the details of a deal, "probably" Thursday, as fears loomed of renewed conflict after Washington carried out a major redeployment of military assets to the region.
U.S. threats of military action have multiplied since a nationwide protest movement sparked a major crackdown that rights groups say killed thousands of people.
On Sunday, Iranian students held competing pro- and anti-government protests at several universities, with critics of the clerical leadership risking arrest or worse if they are caught.
"If the U.S. attacks us, then we have every right to defend ourselves," Araghchi said, alluding to American interests in the region as potential targets.
Still, he said, "there is a good chance to have a diplomatic solution."
After a recent round of talks in Geneva, Iran said it was preparing a draft proposal for an agreement that would avert military action.
"I believe that when we meet, probably this Thursday in Geneva again, we can work on those elements and prepare a good text and come to a fast deal," Araghchi told CBS.
Axios had earlier reported, citing an unnamed senior U.S. official, that if Iran submitted its proposal in the next 48 hours, Washington was ready to meet again later in the week "to start detailed negotiations".
The U.S. has sent two aircraft carriers to the Middle East in recent weeks, along with other jets and ships, and has also shored up its air defences in the region to back up its threats of military intervention.
U.S. President Donald Trump's chief Middle East negotiator Steve Witkoff said Saturday in a Fox News interview that the president was questioning why Iran had not yet given in to U.S. pressure.
"He's curious as to why they haven't... I don't want to use the word 'capitulated', but why they haven't capitulated," he said.
"Why, under this pressure, with the amount of seapower and naval power over there, why haven't they come to us and said, 'We profess we don't want a weapon, so here's what we're prepared to do'?"
Western governments fear Iran's nuclear programme is aimed at developing a bomb, which Tehran has long denied, though it insists on its right to enrich uranium for civilian purposes.
On the subject of enrichment, Araghchi said Sunday: "As a sovereign country, we have every right to decide for ourselves, by ourselves."
Fears of war
A previous round of diplomacy last year was interrupted by Israel's bombing campaign against the Islamic republic.
That sparked a 12-day conflict in June that the U.S. briefly joined with strikes on nuclear facilities.
Despite the recent Oman-mediated talks, Iranians' fears of a new conflict have grown.
"I don't sleep well at night even while taking pills," Tehran resident Hamid told AFP, saying he worried for his "family's health... my kids and grandchildren."
IT technician Mina Ahmadvand, 46, believes that "at this stage, war between Iran and the U.S. as well as Israel is inevitable and I've prepared myself for that eventuality."
"I don't want war to happen, but one should not fool around with the realities on the ground."
The concerns have prompted several foreign countries to urge their citizens to leave Iran, including Sweden, Serbia, Poland and Australia, which warned "commercial flights are currently available but this could change quickly."
Protests
Iran has previously said that quickly striking a deal is in its interests if means relief from sanctions that have hamstrung its economy, which contributed to protests late last year over the high cost of living.
Those demonstrations quickly expanded into mass anti-government protests that marked one of the largest challenges to the Islamic republic's leadership in years, prompting a deadly crackdown by authorities that saw thousands killed, according to rights groups.
On Sunday, Iranian students gathered for fresh pro- and anti-government rallies commemorating those killed following similar gatherings the day before.
Local and diaspora media outlets reported demonstrations at multiple Tehran universities, with some participants waving the flag of Iran's deposed monarchy, and others chanting "death to the shah." who was toppled by the 1979 Islamic revolution.
Trump had initially cheered on the protesters, threatening to intervene on their behalf amid the crackdown, but his threats soon shifted to Iran's nuclear programme.

Labour must take drastic action to regain its standing | Letters

The plans set out by Larry Elliott certainly suggest a way forward for the Starmer government (If Keir Starmer is ousted, Labour could still win the next election. Here’s how that would work, 19 February). But politics and political approval also involve a balance sheet in which there has to be some recognition of the negative ways in which support had been lost. For many liberals, “old” Labour voters and sections of the left, Keir Starmer lost credibility on three issues: the relatively trivial one of “freebies”, and the much more substantive ones of benefit cuts for the most vulnerable and policies concerning Gaza.
All the political choices taken in these contexts ignored values and ideals with long histories, not least of democratic commitment to the mitigation of the abuse of power and the needs of the most powerless. Policies about various locations for domestic investment might be welcome, but the question remains of how to define policies that, rather than ignoring what has been lost, recognise the importance of those values that have, for many of us, simply been ignored. That they continue to be ignored is a matter of shame.
Mary Evans
Patrixbourne, Kent
Larry Elliott is unduly optimistic about the prospects for a second term for Labour. He argues that the shock of Brexit has faded but, like a slow bruise concealed by Covid and the Conservative circus, it continues to disfigure our economy.
For most remainers and, I suspect, Brexiters with buyer’s remorse, there is no surprise about Keir Starmer’s hopeless political judgment. It was first writ large in his decision to force his party to vote for Boris Johnson’s catastrophic Brexit despite knowing the colossal harm it would cause. After that error, he was forced by his own hand to compound it with the EU red lines that continue to strangle him, every other prospective Labour leader, and our economy.
Much as they would like to forget it, Brexit will remain the biggest economic injury to this country since the second world war, and Labour remains central to it.
The only thing Starmer can do is to implement electoral reform. It will not save Labour at the next election, but it will at least increase the chance of a left-of-centre alliance capable of delivering the meaningful change that people clearly want.
Trevor Lawson
Haddenham, Buckinghamshire
Larry Elliott, bemoaning the UK’s lack of growth, argues that conditions are ripe for business investment as the delays to capital spending caused by Brexit and the war in Ukraine fade. A recent study by the National Bureau of Economic Research estimated UK business investment at 12%-18% below what it would have been without Brexit as a result of the “large, broad and long-lasting increase in uncertainty”.
As the global economy enters an era of heightened uncertainty, all the signs indicate that the uncertainty associated with an isolated and politically unstable UK will continue to impede the levels of investment necessary to reverse post-Brexit economic deterioration. Time, I think, to acknowledge that the only way to generate sufficient investment to restore respectable economic growth, and thereby Labour’s standing, would be to rejoin the single market.
Sean Rickard
Newton Blossomville, Buckinghamshire
Larry Elliott charts a possible course for Labour to win the next general election, but why should we care about the Labour party and its electoral chances?
Labour should not assume that voters have an emotional attachment to the party which transcends policy and competence. We care only about practical ideas which will improve our country, and if those are proposed by other parties then that is where our votes will go.
In particular, given our fragmented politics, it is arrogant foolishness of Labour to rule out working with the Liberal Democrat and Green parties. The best hope to defeat the right may come from electoral pacts which focus on opposition to the dangerous regressive parties.

Employers should contribute to universities | Letters

On the subject of student debts (Student debt is a generational injustice. Why are we squeezing graduates harder than the super-rich?, 16 February), Gaby Hinsliff writes: “If the government has better options, then let’s hear them sooner rather than later.” Any better option must address the problem that the courses that universities offer – brilliant though they mostly are – aren’t what the economy needs and so aren’t maximising returns.
Universities are funded to offer the courses students want to study, not what society and employers value most. Understandably, young people pursue choices based on their ambitions rather than the national interest. This creates an oversupply in forensic science, for instance, and skills shortages in engineering.
To balance students’ opportunity with labour market needs, employers need skin in the game of higher education. Rather than graduates being left to pay off high debts, employers should contribute. They do already in the form of higher salaries for graduates, some of which is “taxed” at source as loan repayments. Instead of paying their debts, what if employers paid their fees directly to the unis where their graduate employees studied?
This would incentivise universities to match future skills needs and maximise the employability of every student, whatever they study. Employers would be able to influence courses, but not control them because universities would still share long-term interests with their graduates.
This isn’t a pie-in-the-sky proposal. It is an idea that has gathered momentum among economists and thinktanks to the point where a proposal I wrote for the Higher Education Policy Institute was modelled by independent economists in 2024 and found to provide billions in taxpayer savings while slashing student debts. It would cost employers no more than the current system for the next 25 years and would create sustainable funding for our higher education sector.

Gaby Hinsliff isn’t quite right. It wasn’t the peace dividend, generally regarded as arriving in the early 1990s, that made free university education possible. Grants arrived in the 1960s and remained until the Blair government decided that everyone should have a degree, without considering that that made one effectively worthless. Funding 5% of school leavers is sustainable, funding 50% isn’t.
The trouble with the present system is that it’s effectively Schrödinger’s loan – a debt that isn’t a true debt but is effectively a tax. It thus becomes a millstone that will last most graduates the whole of their working lives. The present government didn’t institute the system, but is saddled with resolving it while also dealing with a broader affordability crisis with many other areas making greater demands for a solution.
Forgiveness is not really an option, although, given that most of the capital will not be repaid, replacing the interest with a tax would probably raise the same amount of money. And that’s before we reform the visa system so that universities can boost their funding by recruiting foreign students.

Amid the discussion as to whether degrees are affordable or value for money, it is interesting that Suella Braverman (as Reform UK’s spokesperson on education, skills and equalities) wants 50% of young people to go into trade jobs instead of university. Part of the answer must surely be the neglected idea of degree apprenticeships, where you learn as you earn.
In my career with a Hampshire local authority supporting businesses and skills, I was impressed that a world-famous lift manufacturer, a health insurance business and a local university all promoted degree apprenticeships – but, sadly, these were the exceptions rather than the rule.
The government needs to redirect some of its funding to encourage employers to create more degree apprenticeships. Perhaps instead of Tony Blair’s famous ambition that 50% of young people should go into higher education, we need 50% to become qualified to at least level 5 – whether in plumbing or philosophy?

Falling measles vaccination rates can have terrifying consequences for families | Letter

Your report on the response to the measles outbreak in north London highlights the profound consequences of falling immunisation uptake (‘A lot of vaccine hesitancy’: how north London council is responding to measles outbreak, 16 February). Behind the statistics are real and frightening experiences for families like ours.
My granddaughter, not yet eligible for the vaccine, was admitted to hospital in late November with respiratory syncytial virus and bronchiolitis. Shortly after being discharged, she developed pneumonia, later followed by a rash: measles. She became seriously ill and needed urgent readmission. Sitting for hours holding her small body, unsure how the illness would progress, is something our family will never forget. She was so weak she could barely cry.
She recovered, but the risk was clear. Measles is highly contagious and can lead to severe complications. It also impairs immune memory, increasing susceptibility to other infections for months, as we have found. Babies who are too young to be vaccinated rely largely on community immunity for protection.
I do understand that some parents feel hesitant, but the consequences of low uptake are borne not only by those who delay immunising their children but by the most vulnerable.
Families do need support. Listening and addressing concerns is key to counter online misinformation and local services must continue to explore innovative ways of facilitating easier access.

Don’t defend the academics who schmoozed with Jeffrey Epstein | Letter

I hope Prof Marquis understands how revealing of himself he is in his presumptions about Jeffrey Epstein’s putative attraction for academics (Why are so many academics in the Epstein files? It’s not just about money, 20 February). Most academics, I suspect, would have felt queasy about having anything to do with Epstein, and if they had been invited to fly private in his “Lolita Express”, would certainly not have accepted. (Some of us try not to fly at all for environmental reasons.) And so far from feeling ground down by the “constant and myriad indignities” of life in the academy, many university teachers are well aware of the privileges of their position relative to the lack of autonomy and dreariness of so many other kinds of work.
The professor also has it back to front when he invites us to “look beyond sex and money” in order to understand Epstein’s power over the gullible. Most of us, academics or otherwise, can see perfectly well that there was nothing but sex and money involved.

US sets 48-Hour deadline for Iranian nuclear proposal as talks hang in the balance

ALBAWABA - The Trump administration has signaled readiness to resume nuclear negotiations with Iran this week, but only if Tehran delivers a detailed written proposal within the next 48 hours.
A senior U.S. official said American negotiators are prepared to meet their Iranian counterparts in Geneva on Friday should Iran submit a comprehensive draft outlining the framework of a potential agreement. Without such a proposal, Washington may reconsider its diplomatic track.
Officials describe the current push as a critical juncture, with some viewing it as possibly the final diplomatic opportunity before military options gain priority. President Donald Trump has previously warned that failure to reach what he calls a “meaningful agreement” could lead to serious consequences.
Trump’s envoys, Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner, are expected to attend the Geneva talks if Iran responds within the specified timeframe. During the previous round of discussions, U.S. representatives requested a formal Iranian proposal to move negotiations into a more detailed phase.
Washington’s position reportedly centers on prohibiting uranium enrichment on Iranian soil. However, U.S. officials have indicated they may consider a limited or symbolic enrichment arrangement if Iran can convincingly demonstrate that it has permanently closed all pathways to developing a nuclear weapon.
Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi has stated that Tehran is finalizing its proposal and intends to submit it once approved by Iran’s leadership. He emphasized that negotiations remain focused exclusively on nuclear issues and reiterated Iran’s right to peaceful uranium enrichment.
Meanwhile, political debate continues in Washington. Some lawmakers are urging stronger action, while others advocate allowing diplomacy to proceed before escalating tensions further.
With military deployments already heightened in the region, the next two days could determine whether talks regain momentum — or whether the standoff deepens into a more dangerous phase.

Mexican army kills leader of powerful drug trafficking cartel who US once offered $15M for arrest
Under El Mencho’s leadership, the cartel has been implicated in numerous homicides targeting rival groups and Mexican law enforcement
- Bookmark

Nemesio Rubén Oseguera Cervantes, widely known as "El Mencho" and the formidable leader of the Jalisco New Generation Cartel (CJNG), has been killed during a Mexican military operation, a federal official has confirmed.
The operation, which took place on Sunday in the western state of Jalisco, was preceded by hours of widespread roadblocks involving burning vehicles – a common tactic employed by cartels to impede military movements.
The official, who requested anonymity due to not being authorised to speak publicly, provided details of the incident.
El Mencho was a highly sought-after figure, with the US State Department offering a reward of up to $15 million for information leading to his arrest. This reward was reiterated in a December 2024 post, identifying him as a founder and current leader of CJNG and one of Mexico's most wanted fugitives.
Formed in 2009, CJNG has rapidly become one of Mexico's most violent drug cartels. It is assessed to possess the highest capacity for trafficking cocaine, heroin, and methamphetamine, and more recently, fentanyl into the United States.
Under El Mencho’s leadership, the cartel has been implicated in numerous homicides targeting rival groups and Mexican law enforcement, as well as alleged assassination attempts on Mexican government officials.
The Trump administration previously designated CJNG as a foreign terrorist organisation.
Since 2017, El Mencho has faced multiple indictments in the US District Court for the District of Columbia, with the most recent superseding indictment on April 5, 2022, charging him with conspiracy and distribution of controlled substances for unlawful importation into the US, and firearm use in drug trafficking. He was also charged under the Drug Kingpin Statute for operating a continuing criminal enterprise.

Stars and royals gather for the BAFTA film awards, with ‘One Battle’ and ‘Sinners’ leading the race
LONDON (AP) — Hollywood stars and British celebrities, from Paddington Bear to the Princess of Wales, gathered Sunday for the British Academy Film Awards, where politically charged thriller “One Battle After Another” and blues-steeped epic “Sinners” led the field of nominees.
The two films snagged early prizes, with Wunmi Mosaku taking the supporting actress award for “Sinners,” and Sean Penn winning the supporting actor trophy for “One Battle After Another.”
“Sinners” writer-director Ryan Coogler also won the prize for best original screenplay.
Oddsmakers suggest Shakespearean family tragedy “Hamnet” could beat the front-runners to best picture if British film industry voters respond to the emotionally rich story, earthy English setting and intense performances in Chloé Zhao’s adaptation of Maggie O’Farrell’s historical novel.
Stars including Leonardo DiCaprio, Timothée Chalamet, Emma Stone, Cillian Murphy, Glenn Close and Ethan Hawke were among those walking the red carpet outside London’s Royal Festival Hall before a black-tie ceremony hosted by Scottish actor Alan Cumming.
Prince William and Catherine, Princess of Wales also attended, three days after William’s uncle Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor was arrested by police and held for 11 hours over allegations he sent sensitive government information to the late financier and sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.
The scandal has rocked the royal family led by King Charles III, though William and Kate remain popular standard-bearers for the monarchy. William is due to present an award in his role as president of the British Academy of Film and Television Arts.
Among the biggest receptions from gathered fans was for Paddington, the puppet bear who stars in a musical stage adaption of the beloved children’s classic.
Oscars bellwether
“One Battle” went into the ceremony with 14 nominations, including best picture and acting nods for five of its cast. “Sinners” was just behind with 13, while “Hamnet” and the ping-pong odyssey “Marty Supreme” each had 11 nominations.
Guillermo del Toro’s reimagining of “Frankenstein” and Norwegian family drama “ Sentimental Value” each got eight nominations.
“Frankenstein” took awards for production design and for the hair and makeup artists who spent 10 hours a day transforming Jacob Elordi into the movie’s monstrous creature.
The British prizes, officially called the EE BAFTA Film Awards, often provide hints about who will win at Hollywood’s Academy Awards, held this year on March 15. In the Oscar nominations, “Sinners” leads the race with a record 16 nominations, followed by “One Battle After Another” with 13.
Cumming told the audience that it had been a strong year for cinema, if not a cheerful one, with nominated films tackling themes including child death, racism and political violence:
“Watching the films this year was like taking part in a collective nervous breakdown,” he said. “It’s almost as though there are events going on in the real world that are influencing filmmakers.”
The ceremony was more glitz than gloom, though, including a performance by Ejae, Audrey Nuna and Rei Ami — the voices of animated band HUNTR/X in box office juggernaut “KPop Demon Hunters” — singing the movie hit “Golden.”
The BAFTA best film nominees are “One Battle After Another,” “Hamnet,” “Marty Supreme,” “Sinners” and “Sentimental Value.” The BAFTAs also have a distinctly British accent, with a separate category for best British film. Its 10 nominees include “The Ballad of Wallis Island,” “Pillion,” “I Swear” and “Bridget Jones: Mad About the Boy.”
Directing contenders are Paul Thomas Anderson for “One Battle,” Josh Safdie for “Marty Supreme,” Coogler for “Sinners,” Yorgos Lanthimos for dystopian tragicomedy “Bugonia,” Joachim Trier for “Sentimental Value” and Zhao for “Hamnet.” Zhao will be the first female director to win two BAFTAs if she takes the prize. She won the directing award in 2021 for “Nomadland.”
Best leading actor nominees are bookies’ favorite Chalamet for “Marty Supreme,” DiCaprio for “One Battle After Another,” Ethan Hawke for Broadway biopic “Blue Moon,” Michael B. Jordan for “Sinners,” Jesse Plemons for “Bugonia” and Robert Aramayo for playing an advocate for people with Tourette’s syndrome in biographical drama “I Swear.”
The leading actress category includes the strongly favored Jessie Buckley for her performance as Agnes Hathaway, wife of William Shakespeare, in “Hamnet.” She’s up against Rose Byrne for “If I Had Legs I’d Kick You,” Kate Hudson for “Song Sung Blue,” Chase Infiniti for “One Battle After Another,” Renate Reinsve for “Sentimental Value” and Emma Stone for “Bugonia.”
Putin critic wins best documentary
The best-documentary prize went to “Mr. Nobody Against Putin,” about a Russian teacher who documented the propaganda imposed on Russian schools after the invasion of Ukraine.
The film’s American director David Borenstein said that teacher Pavel Talankin had shown that “whether it’s in Russia or the streets of Minneapolis, we always face a moral choice,” referring to the protests against US immigration enforcement in Minnesota.
“We need more Mr. Nobodies,” he said.
It beat documentaries including Mstyslav Chernov’s harrowing Ukraine war portrait “2000 Meters to Andriivka, ” co-produced by The Associated Press and Frontline PBS.
Most BAFTA winners are chosen by 8,500 members of the U.K. academy of industry professionals. Contenders for the Rising Star award — the only prize decided by public vote and a reliable picker of future A-listers — are Infiniti, Aramayo, “Sinners” star Miles Caton and British actors Archie Madekwe and Posy Sterling.
Donna Langley, the U.K.-born chairwoman of NBCUniversal Entertainment, will be awarded the British Academy’s highest honor, the BAFTA fellowship.
The ceremony airs on BBC in the United Kingdom starting at 7 p.m. (1900 GMT) and on E! in the U.S. at 8 p.m. EST.

New law puts Kansas at vanguard of denying trans identities on drivers licenses, birth certificates

New law puts Kansas at vanguard of denying trans identities on drivers licenses, birth certificates
New law puts Kansas at vanguard of denying trans identities on drivers licenses, birth certificates
TOPEKA, Kan. (AP) — Kansas is set to invalidate about 1,700 driver’s licenses held by transgender residents and roughly as many birth certificates under a new law that goes beyond Republican-imposed restrictions in other states on listing gender identities in government documents.
The new law takes effect Thursday. Democratic Gov. Laura Kelly vetoed the measure but the Legislature’s GOP supermajorities overrode it last week as Republican state lawmakers across the U.S. have pursued another round of measures to roll back transgender rights.
The bill prohibits documents from listing any sex other than the one assigned birth and invalidates any that reflect a conflicting gender identity. Florida, Tennessee and Texas also don’t allow driver’s licenses to reflect a trans person’s gender identity, and at least eight states besides Kansas have policies that bar trans residents from changing their birth certificates.
But only Kansas’ law requires reversing changes previously made for trans residents. Kansas officials expect to cancel about 1,700 driver’s licenses and issue new birth certificates for up to 1,800 people.
“It tells me that Kansas Republicans are interested in being on the vanguard of the culture war and in a race to the bottom,” said Democratic state Rep. Abi Boatman, a transgender Air Force veteran appointed in January to fill a vacant Wichita seat.
Kansas’ new law enjoyed nearly unanimous GOP support. It is the latest success in what has become an annual effort to further roll back transgender rights by Republicans in statehouses across the U.S., bolstered by policies and rhetoric from President Donald Trump’s administration.
Trump and other Republicans attack research-backed conclusions that gender can change or be fluid as radical “gender ideology.” GOP lawmakers in Kansas regularly describe transgender girls and women as male and as they say they’re protecting women.
Like fellow Republicans, Kansas Senate Majority Leader Chase Blaisi said Trump’s reelection and other GOP victories in 2024 show that voters want “to return to common sense” on gender.
“When I go home, people believe there are just two sexes, male and female,” Blasi said. “It’s basic biology I learned in high school.”
Kelly supports transgender rights, but GOP lawmakers have overridden her vetoes three of the past four years. Kansas bans gender-affirming care for minors and bars transgender women and girls from female sports teams, kindergarten through college.
Transgender people can’t use public restrooms, locker rooms or other single-sex facilities associated with their gender identities, though there was no enforcement mechanism until this year’s law added tough new provisions.
Transgender people have said carrying IDs that misgender them opens them to intrusive questions, harassment and even violence when they show it to police, merchants, and others.
In 2023, Republicans halted changes in Kansas birth certificates and driver’s licenses by enacting a measure ending the state’s legal recognition of trans residents’ gender identities. Though the law didn’t mention either document, it legally defined male and female by a person’s “biological reproductive system” at birth.
However, a lawsuit led to state court decisions that last year permitted driver’s license changes to resume.
Legislators in at least seven other states are considering bills to prevent transgender people from changing one or both documents, according to a search using the bill-tracking software Plural.
But none would reverse past changes.
The extra step by Kansas legislators reinforces a message “that trans people aren’t welcome,” said Anthony Alvarez, a transgender University of Kansas student who works for a pro-LGBTQ rights group.
Kansas is likely to notify transgender residents by mail that their driver’s licenses are no longer valid and they need to go to a local licensing office to get a new one, said Zachary Denney, spokesperson for the agency that issues them.
The Legislature hasn’t earmarked funds to cover the cost, so each person will pay it — $26 for a standard license.
Alvarez already has had four IDs in four years as he’s changed his name, changed his gender marker and turned 21.
He’s always planned to stay in his native Kansas after getting his history degree this spring.
But, he said, “They’re just making it harder and harder for me to live in the state that I love.”

T20 World Cup: South Africa beat India by 76 runs in Super Eight
India were bowled out for 111 chasing 188-run target and must now win their next two games to qualify for the semifinals.
India have been handed a 76-run defeat by South Africa in their first cricket match of the Super Eight stage of the T20 World Cup and now must win their next two games to have a chance of reaching the semifinals.
The defending champions were bowled out for 111 in 18.5 overs while chasing a target of 188 at the Narendra Modi Stadium in Ahmedabad, India on Sunday.
It was the cohosts’ first loss of the tournament and also ended their 12-match winning streak in the T20 World Cup that they had carried on from their title-winning run in 2024.
South Africa’s bowlers put on a near-perfect display against a strong Indian batting lineup, and were backed by their fielders to leave the pre-tournament favourites reeling.
India lost their in-form opener Ishan Kishan on the fourth ball of the innings to the offspin bowling of South Africa’s captain Aiden Markram while trying to hit against the spin.
One-down batter Tilak Varma was the next to fall as he was caught behind off the first ball of Marco Jansen’s over.
India’s captain Suryakumar Yadav and out-of-form star batter Abhishek Sharma tried to rebuild their innings until Sharma fell in the fifth over after scoring 15 runs off 12 deliveries.
Incoming batter Washington Sundar and Yadav were the next two wickets to fall as India failed to build a big partnership in front of a large home crowd.
A 35-run partnership between all-rounders Hardik Pandya and Shivam Dube lifted the Indian run chase briefly, but South Africa’s disciplined bowling and near-faultless fielding resulted in regular dismissals for the home side.
When Dube fell for 42 off 37, India’s fate was sealed.
Jansen’s superb bowling earned him four wickets for 22 runs off 3.5 overs , while left-arm spin bowler Keshav Maharaj took three for 24 in his four overs.
All of South Africa’s bowlers were economical, with Lungi Ngidi leading the way by conceding only 15 runs in his four wicketless overs.
Earlier, player of the match David Miller’s crucial innings of 63 runs off 35 balls stabilised South Africa’s innings after they were reduced to 20-3 in four overs.
He shared a 97-run partnership with Dewald Brevis, who scored 45 off 29 balls, as the pair resurrected the Proteas after Markram decided to bat first after winning the toss in the first Super Eight match in Group 1.
Despite Miller’s dismissal in the 16th over, South Africa were able to post a formidable total of 187-7, thanks to a 24-ball 44 not out by Tristan Stubbs at the end of the innings.
Jasprit Bumrah picked up 3-15 off his four overs.
The loss propels South Africa to the top of Group 1 in the Super Eight stage, with India at the bottom with a net run rate of -3.80.
The defending champions must win their remaining two games to have a chance of qualifying for the semifinals.
West Indies and Zimbabwe are the other two teams in their group and will face each other on Monday.
South Africa face the West Indies on Thursday, while India play Zimbabwe on Friday.

Bones of St Francis of Assisi go on public display in Italy
The remains of Italy's patron saint, St Francis of Assisi, have gone on public display to mark 800 years since his death.
Italian officials say about 400,000 people from around the world have reserved a place to see his bones in the central Italian town of Assisi.
The 13th Century skeleton is being displayed from Sunday at the lower church of the famous Basilica of St Francis of Assisi.
His remains have only been seen in public once before - for a single day in 1978 to a very limited group of people.
St Francis is one of the most venerated figures in Christianity and was born in the Italian city of Assisi in 1181 or 1182.
He renounced his wealth and devoted his life to the poor, founding the order of the Franciscans. He is also the patron saint of animals and the environment.
The Feast of St Francis is celebrated annually on 4 October to mark the day of his death in 1226.
The late Pope Francis, who died last year after leading the Roman Catholic Church for more than a decade, chose his name and modelled his papacy after the radical humility of Saint Francis.
St Francis of Assisi's bones will be on display until 22 March.

France will summon US envoy Charles Kushner over comments on activist’s death
The State Department had said leftism is ‘on the rise’ and its role in Quentin Deranque’s death shows the ‘threat it poses to public safety’
France will summon US ambassador Charles Kushner to protest against comments by the Trump administration over the death of a far-right activist, the foreign affairs minister said.
Jean-Noel Barrot was reacting to a statement by the State Department’s Counterterrorism Bureau, which posted on social media that “reports, corroborated by the French Minister of the Interior, that Quentin Deranque was killed by left-wing militants, should concern us all”.
Deranque, a far-right activist, died of brain injuries last week from a beating in the French city of Lyon. He was attacked during a fight on the margins of a student meeting where a far-left lawmaker, Rima Hassan, was a keynote speaker.
The State Department said in its post that “violent radical leftism is on the rise and its role in Quentin Deranque’s death demonstrates the threat it poses to public safety. We will continue to monitor the situation and expect to see the perpetrators of violence brought to justice”.

Nicki Minaj shares photo of ‘meaningful’ bible signed by Trump
The ‘God Bless The U.S.A.’ Bible is sold for $1,000 online

Nicki Minaj owns a hot pink Lamborghini and a gold Visa card — but her newest prized possession is a Trump Bible.
The rapper, 43, bragged Saturday on X that she had received a leather-bound autographed bible with President Donald Trump’s signature on the cover.
“One of the most meaningful gifts I’ve ever received in my entire life,” Minaj wrote.
The China-made “God Bless The U.S.A.” Bible, also known as the Trump Bible, is a copy of the King James edition Bible produced in partnership with country singer Lee Greenwood. It was first sold in 2021 for $60, and the signed one that Minaj shared is listed online starting at $1,000.
Minaj’s post sparked backlash from social media users, with many criticizing the product itself for being religiously offensive. One wrote: “One of the most sacrilegious gifts I’ve ever seen in my entire life.”
“One of the most meaningful gifts you’ve received is a trump stamped bible? this is a mockery of God and you are a fake Christian,” another criticized. A third chimed in, “A desecrated Bible signed by a guy that’s never read it?”
America’s Next Top Model alum Adrianne Curry weighed in, saying, “signing bibles is.....just....NOT it.”
In 2019, Trump said in front of a room full of religious leaders that he doesn’t know the Bible “very well at all.” He also admitted in October: “I don’t think there’s anything going to get me in heaven. I really don’t. I think I’m not maybe heaven-bound.”
It comes as Minaj’s association with Trump has raised eyebrows in recent months.
The artist’s seemingly sudden MAGA conversion became known in November 2025, when she personally thanked the President for his threats against the Nigerian government over the alleged “killing of Christians.”
She then praised Trump’s administration during a panel speaking to Turning Point USA leader Erika Kirk, Charlie Kirk’s widow.
“This administration is full of people with heart and soul, and they make me proud of them,” Minaj told Kirk at the panel at the time. “Our vice president, he makes me ... well, I love both of them. Both of them have a very uncanny ability to be someone that you relate to.”
Earlier this month, the rapper attended a U.S. Treasury event where she declared herself as “probably the president’s number one fan, and that’s not going to change.”
She added: “The hate or what people have to say, it does not affect me at all. It actually motivates me to support him more. He has a lot of force behind him, and God is protecting him. Amen.”

Tories would scrap ‘debt trap’ of high interest student loans, says Kemi Badenoch

Kemi Badenoch has said the Conservatives would scrap the “unfair debt trap” of high interest rates on student loans, piling pressure on Labour ministers to tackle the growing outrage over the high costs.
The education secretary, Bridget Phillipson, admitted the system of plan 2 loans had “problems” but suggested the government’s priority would be maintenance grants for poorer students, rather than tackling the high interest rates.
“The reality is that we inherited a system, and the Conservatives left behind this system, the system they’re now complaining about. But it does have problems, it does,” she told the BBC. “But there are also problems when you seek to make changes happen.”
The Tories said they would abolish real interest rates on plan 2 student loans, which can mean graduates pay tens of thousands more than they borrowed to fund university fees.
The shadow education secretary, Laura Trott, said the loans should not rise faster than RPI inflation, a move which would cut the size of the loans for millions of graduates who started courses after 2013.
She said the change would be funded by cutting tens of thousands of university courses that do not provide “value for money” for students.
“Britain’s young people are facing a worse deal under Labour,” Badenoch, the Tory leader, said.
“Youth unemployment is at its highest level in a decade, graduate recruitment is at the lowest level on record, and too many are going straight from education to welfare.
“Leaving university has become a moment of despair. Not just for young people but their parents too.
“In particular, the plan 2 student loans are an unfair debt trap: millions of graduates are doing the right thing, paying every month, yet watching the balance they owe growing bigger because interest piles on faster than repayments.
“If Labour had any sense, Rachel Reeves would act now and use her spring statement to adopt this plan.”
The row over the cost of student loans has escalated since the chancellor’s decision last November to freeze the salary threshold for plan 2 student loan repayments for three years.
Recently, the Labour MP Nadia Whittome said she had left university in 2019 with £49,600 of debt and her repayments had shaved just £1,000 off that, despite her earning in the top 5% of salaries as an MP.
“If MPs are barely making a dent in their student loan debt after six years of repayments, what chance do other graduates have?” she said.
Phillipson said the salary threshold for repayments would be frozen in the coming years, bringing more graduates into having to repay their debt.
“This is a system that developed over many, many years, came in in 2012-13, was not a system that we designed.
“There are flaws in that system, I’d be the first to admit it, but it is galling that the very people that designed, implemented and delivered that system are now complaining about the fundamental problems that they see within it, and alongside that, I would add, are now saying that university is not for some young people.
“Always coming from people, by the way, who went and had the benefits of a university education and want to deny it to other young people.”
Trott said there was a “a shift that needs to happen in the system” and suggested creative arts courses were an example of those not providing value for money for students.
“I’m not going to come on here and say that this is not difficult, but I think it’s the right thing for young people.
“It would mean that instead of going into one of these university courses, which has a negative outcome for them, they could go into an amazing apprenticeship where they’re going to come out with no debt whatsoever, and they’re going to come out with great job prospects. I think that is a better trade.”
The Treasury minister Torsten Bell said such a policy would have a catastrophic effect on universities.
“Nothing about what would deliver the supposed 100k cut in student numbers in here, unless this is a hard commitment to introduce a cap on student numbers well below current levels,” he posted on X. “In which case they may have just accidentally announced they’d close a chunk of universities.”
A source close to the shadow chancellor, Mel Stride, said the Conservative party wanted to put a longer-term focus on rebalancing the economy, especially towards young people and those paying outsized marginal tax rates.
“There is a palpable sense of unfairness – and even despair – among some people that they’ve done all the right things and are getting screwed,” the source said.
“People who went to uni, got a decent job and find themselves with sometimes ridiculously high marginal tax rates. They’re paying eye-watering interest on their student loans to subsidise others doing low-quality degrees who will never repay.
“It ends up being not just unfair but really bad economics too – people start to think: ‘What’s the point?’ We have to give people some hope.”

TSA says PreCheck ‘remains operational’ after DHS said it was ending program during shutdown
Trump administration previously said it was suspending expedited check-in program as part of ‘emergency measures to preserve limited funds’ during ongoing partial government shutdown

TSA PreCheck will continue to function at U.S. airports during the partial government shutdown, officials announced on Sunday, despite the Trump administration previously saying the expedited check-in program would be paused.
“At this time, TSA PreCheck remains operational with no change for the traveling public,” the Transportation Security Administration wrote in a statement on X. “As staffing constraints arise, TSA will evaluate on a case by case basis and adjust operations accordingly.”
Earlier Sunday, the Department of Homeland Security said the program would be temporarily halted, citing “emergency measures to preserve limited funds” during the shutdown and a need to “refocus Department personnel on the majority of travelers.”
The Independent has requested comment from DHS and the TSA on what prompted the apparent change.
TSA PreCheck lets paid subscribers access shorter security lines with less intensive screening at the airport. It had more than 20 million active users in 2024.
Other government travel programs and services remain paused, including Global Entry processing and courtesy escorts for members of Congress and their families, according to DHS.
Chris Sununu, CEO of the industry group Airlines for America, argued in a statement on Sunday that travelers are being “used as a political football amid another government shutdown.”
“The announcement was issued with extremely short notice to travelers, giving them little time to plan accordingly, which is especially troubling at this time of record air travel,” he wrote.
“It’s past time for Congress to get to the table and get a deal done that ensures TSA can fully operate and their frontline employees can be paid for the important work they do to keep our skies secure.”
Funding for DHS, which oversees TSA, expired February 14, as Democrats in Congress pushed to impose new limitations on aggressive immigration enforcement after agents fatally shot U.S. citizens Alex Pretti and Renee Good last month in Minnesota.
Since then, most DHS headquarters staff has been furloughed, and TSA airport employees have been working without pay.
Officials in both parties blamed the other side for the shutdown.
Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem accused Democrats of putting “politics over public safety.”
“This is the third time that Democrat politicians have shut down this department during the 119th Congress,” she said in a statement. “Shutdowns have real world consequences, not just for the men and women of DHS and their families who go without a paycheck, but it endangers our national security.”
Democratic Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer accused the Trump administration of using “bullying tactics.”
“The Trump administration is choosing to inflict pain on the public instead of adopting common sense ICE reforms,” he said in a statement. “In the 43-day historic Trump government shutdown, DHS never changed the Global Entry program’s status. Democrats are fighting against this exact kind of abuse.”
The confusion over PreCheck comes at a time of heightened scrutiny towards DHS.
The department has faced widespread criticism over its military-style immigration enforcement tactics, and a recent exposé accused Secretary Noem of carrying on an affair with a top adviser, which she denies.

NBC’s big Olympics bet looks smarter as Milan audience up 94% from Beijing
NBC’s Olympics bet looks strong again as viewers pour back in for the Milan Winter Games
- Bookmark
Many wondered four years ago if NBC’s 2014 decision to secure U.S. media rights to the Olympics through 2032 for $7.75 billion was a bad business deal.
With NBC having its most-watched Winter Games in 12 years, those concerns appear to have quieted.
According to Nielsen and Adobe Analytics, NBC averaged 24 million viewers across its prime afternoon coverage (2-5 p.m. EST) and Primetime in Milan (8-11 p.m. EST and PST) through Friday. That is a 94% improvement over the 2022 Beijing Games.
This is the second straight Olympics where viewers have returned in large numbers. The 2024 Paris Summer Games were up 82% from 2021 in Tokyo.
Complete numbers from the 17 days — including the United States’ 2-1 overtime victory over Canada in men’s hockey Sunday morning — are expected to be released on Monday.
“I think that the Paris Games deserve a lot of the credit for rejuvenating that interest and enthusiasm, and some of that momentum continued through to Milan,” NBC Sports President Rick Cordella said from Milan.
Molly Solomon, NBC's president and executive producer for the Olympics, and her team also deserve credit for changing the network’s coverage approach after Beijing.
Instead of waiting until prime time to showcase key sports, those events were shown live via streaming along with NBC’s network and cable channels. The primetime show was reimagined to highlight key events with more interviews and analysis to supplement what viewers might have seen live earlier in the day.
“How do we best make sure that we are continuing to tell the story (of athletes) after they leave the venues? I do think that one of the improvements we made from our Paris coverage was to follow the athletes to their after-parties and reunions with their friends and families,” said Solomon, who is overseeing coverage from NBC Sports’ headquarters in Stamford, Connecticut.
“When Alex Ferreira won (the gold medal in men’s halfpipe), we went to the bar where he was celebrating. There was a Team USA celebration for Mikaela Shiffrin, where we were there for the toast, and she talked about not being able to help Breezy Johnson get on the platform.
“These athletes trusted us to have our cameras there, and I do think it made for even richer storytelling and taking the audience there.”
NBC adopted a format used for years in other countries while also listening to viewers who demanded change. NBC had streamed all Olympic sports since the 2012 London Games, but took a big leap when NBC Universal launched Peacock in 2020.
Through Friday, 14.8 billion minutes of the Milan Games had been streamed in the U.S., more than doubling the total for all prior Winter Games combined (6.9 billion).
Viewer gains can also be credited to the U.S. team’s performance, which underperformed in Tokyo and Beijing. Those games were played in hermetically sealed environments with mostly empty venues due to COVID-19.
Thursday’s win by the U.S. in women’s hockey over Canada in overtime and Alysa Liu’s gold medal in figure skating averaged 26.7 million across NBC, USA Network, Peacock, and NBCUniversal’s other digital platforms.
USA Network and Peacock averaged 5.3 million viewers for the gold-medal hockey game, making it the most-watched women’s hockey game on record. It peaked at 7.7 million in overtime when Megan Keller scored the game-winning goal.
“It was truly a golden hour. We popped between control rooms, and you just never know what’s going to happen,” Solomon said. “The energy in our control rooms on site, we couldn’t believe the confluence of drama and excitement, but that really is what the Olympics is about. It’s unpredictable, thrilling, and it just coincided in the golden 64 minutes.”
NBC is poised to continue the momentum for the next two games. The 2028 Summer Games in Los Angeles will have wall-to-wall live coverage throughout the day, while the 2030 Winter Games in the French Alps will see NBC return to the coverage formula that worked in Paris and Milan.
The 2032 Summer Games in Brisbane, Australia, will have challenges because most events will take place overnight in the U.S., but the 2034 Winter Games in Salt Lake City will again provide another live Olympics.
NBC has the rights to the Olympics through 2036. It agreed to the 2034 and ’36 Games last year for $3 billion.
“Paris begets Milan, and Milan will beget LA. I think the Olympics are just unique in many respects,” Cordella said. “The U.S.-Swiss curling match, there are hundreds of thousands of people online streaming. They’re seeking it out and watching these matchups of these athletes; they probably didn’t know about them before the Olympics began. It’s compelling TV, and that’s kind of what the Olympics does.”

Trump shares right-wing conspiracy theorist’s post that calls Michelle Obama ‘anti-white racist’ after he posted racist ape video
Trump shares statement from Laura Loomer calling on president to kill Netflix deal
- Bookmark
- CommentsGo to comments
President Donald Trump reposted a message calling Michelle Obama a “racist” and ranted against a former high-ranking official in Barack Obama’s administration as he prepares to face Democrats in Congress at the State of the Union address.
In a Truth Social post on Saturday, the president reposted a message from far-right activist and conspiracy theorist Laura Loomer describing the former first lady as an “anti-white racist.” In his own caption, the president took aim at another Black woman in the same administration: former White House adviser Susan Rice.
Threatening Netflix to fire Rice, who serves on the company’s executive board, Trump wrote: “Netflix should fire racist, Trump Deranged Susan Rice, IMMEDIATELY, or pay the consequences.”
Loomer’s post was must more extensive and urged the president to kill an upcoming merger between Warner Bros. and Netflix, which the far-right activist feared would expand the Obamas’ influence within both companies. The former president and his wife own a production company, Higher Ground Productions, which produces a variety of content on Neftlix’s platform.
Of the Obamas, Loomer wrote: “[P]ositive messaging of the Democrats' upcoming witch hunts against Trump from Barack Hussein Obama ... and his anti-White racist wife Michelle ... would likely be blasted across all streaming services as the Obamas' Higher Ground Productions continues to grow within Netflix.”
The two posts came in response to Rice warning that companies seen as guilty of cozying up to the Trump administration would face consequences of their own if Democratic lawmakers retake the House and Senate in midterm elections this fall — along with the White House in 2028.
She made the comments on a podcast hosted by Preet Bharara, a former U.S. attorney fired by Trump during his first term.
“If these corporations think that the Democrats, when they come back in power, are going to, you know, play by the old rules, and, you know, say, ‘Oh, never mind. We’ll forgive you for all the people you fired, all the policies and principles you’ve violated, all, you know, the laws you’ve skirted.’ I think they’ve got another thing coming,” Rice said.
Trump’s apparent support for Loomer’s description of Michelle Obama as “racist” comes as he has continues to refuse to apologize for a scandal that enveloped him this month around the posting of a bizarre AI video from his Truth Social account depicting her and her husband as apes.
The racist depiction of the nation’s first Black president was immediately condemned by politicians on both sides of the aisle, forcing the White House to offer a defense, then walk it back entirely and delete the post.
Republicans on the Hill were clearly uncomfortable with the video and called its posting a mistake. Sen. Tim Scott, the Senate’s only Black Republican, called it racist.
The former president responded on a podcast, stating that “it's important to recognize that the majority of the American people find this behavior deeply troubling.
Trump has blamed the post on a staffer who has access his Truth Social account, Natalie Harp, whom he said did not watch the video fully before posting it to his account.
In a statement to reporters on Air Force One, Trump claimed to have watched part of the video and sent it to his team for review and a possible post on his account. He denied seeing the part of the video where the former president and former first lady appeared.
“I gave it to the people, generally they’d look at the whole thing but I guess somebody didn’t and they posted it. And then we deleted it,” said Trump.
This isn’t the first time he’s taken content or advice directly from Loomer, either.
The far-right activist found herself with new access to the Oval Office in 2025 as Trump returned to the White House and used it to direct a purge of figures tied to Michael Waltz, then-Trump’s national security adviser, for supposed disloyalty.
Loomer has also supported a loyalty-driven purge of officials across other parts of the government, with one notable victim being the daughter of former FBI Director James Comey. His daughter, Maurene, was fired from the Department of Justice in July.
Through her constant, vitriolic attacks on Democrats, Loomer has faced her own accusations of racism, including in the fall of 2025, when she was widely condemned for hurling a racist slur at Democratic Rep. Jasmine Crockett, whom she called a “ghetto Black B****.”

Russian embassy in Seoul hangs up banner glorifying war against Ukraine and refuses to take it down, Korean media reports

Russian embassy in Seoul hangs up banner glorifying war against Ukraine and refuses to take it down, Korean media reports
A banner reading "Victory will be ours" has appeared on the Russian embassy building in Seoul ahead of the fourth anniversary of Russia's invasion of Ukraine. The South Korean government has asked Moscow to remove it, but Russia has refused.
Source: Chosun (Korean media outlet)
Details: The roughly 15‑metre-long banner, which features a Russian flag and the slogan "Victory will be ours", appeared on the embassy building on the morning of 21 February.
Criticism is mounting in diplomatic circles in Seoul, since "displaying a phrase declaring victory in an invasion war in the heart of another country is a significant deviation from diplomatic conventions".
Diplomatic representatives in South Korea, including those from European countries, have expressed concern about the banner to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
Moreover, Russian Ambassador Georgy Zinoviev stated at a press conference at the embassy on 11 February: "Russia is not unaware of how much North Korean troops contributed to liberating the southern part of the Kursk region from Ukrainian forces and Western mercenaries," adding, "We will not forget the greatness of the North Korean troops."
The South Korean government warned that the banner and the ambassador's statements are "clearly excessive". The Foreign Ministry recently stated: "Russia, which has violated the UN Charter, cannot be tolerated for publicly expressing its stance on an illegal war on the walls of its embassy."
The ministry pointed out that placing such messages on the embassy building could provoke the South Korean public and adversely affect relations between South Korea and Russia. Since there is also a Ukrainian embassy in Seoul, there are concerns that this may create unnecessary diplomatic tension.
The ministry has demanded that the banner be removed, but the Russian embassy has refused to do this. The South Korean government cannot remove it by force due to the Vienna Convention, which guarantees the inviolability of diplomatic missions.
Chosun noted that on 24 February last year, the third anniversary of the invasion, Russia held a demonstration in Seoul to express support for the war against Ukraine featuring a large national flag. The Russian embassy in South Korea is reported to be planning a similar event for the fourth anniversary.

Israel gave only 66 building permits to Palestinians in 11 years

Israeli authorities issued 66 building permits to Palestinians in 11 years, over 20,000 to settlers
Palestinians in the West Bank were granted just 66 building permits over an 11-year period, while Israeli authorities approved 22,000 permits for settlers - highlighting one of the many forms of discrimination Palestinians face amid occupation.
The permits were issued to the Palestinians and the illegal settlers between 2009 and 2020, according to Haaretz.
Widespread demolitions were carried out by Israeli authorities since January in the Taawun neighbourhood, south of Nablus in the northern West Bank, with Haaretz describing this as "just one example of the accelerating pace of demolitions across the West Bank."
Taawun, which lies in Area C- under full Israeli civil and security control under the 1993 Oslo Accords- did not receive any building permits from Israel despite not being near any Israeli road or settlement, according to Haaretz.
In January alone, the Israeli army demolished 24 Palestinian structures in Area C due to a lack of building permits, Haaretz said.
Permits for Palestinian construction are rarely approved, resulting in high rates of demolition of homes under the pretext that they have been "illegally" constructed.
Alongside Area C, the West Bank was divided into two additional administrative areas under the 1995 Oslo II Accord: Area A, under full Palestinian civil and security control; and Area B, under Palestinian civil administration with Israeli security control.
The United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA), said that at least 2,461 Palestinian structures were demolished over the past two years due to the absence of building permits.
This compares with 4,984 demolitions recorded over the previous nine years.
As a result, approximately 3,500 people were displaced during the two-year period.
Haaretz reported that the demolition campaign over the past two years has coincided with the displacement of around 80 Palestinian communities, attributed to the rapid expansion of settler farms and outposts.
Last October, the Norwegian Refugee Council (NRC) said Israel had demolished more Palestinian homes and structures in the occupied West Bank, including East Jerusalem, over permit issues in the first nine months of 2025 than during the entirety of 2024.
The NRC recorded a 39 per cent rise in demolitions linked to permit denials compared with the same period the previous year. It noted that 929 structures were demolished for lacking permits during that earlier period, while 1,281 structures were demolished over permit issues throughout 2024.
Palestinians and human rights groups say that the demolitions stem from a planning system that effectively denies Palestinians the right to build in Area C. They have said that the policy amounts to collective punishment and violates international law.
The latest developments come amid a plan recently approved by the Israeli government to resume Israeli land registration in the occupied West Bank.
The move would enable authorities to seize land from Palestinians unable to prove ownership, with the Palestinian Authority presidency describing the decision as amounting to "de facto annexation” of the West Bank.
The resumption of land registration procedures in the Israeli-occupied territory would also apply to Area C, marking the first time since the 1967 occupation that Israel has moved to register land there as state property.

Iranian students stage anti-government protests for second day at some universities
Students held protests which led to clashes at several Iranian universities for a second day on Sunday, according to local news agencies and social media posts, with Iran facing a US military buildup as it seeks to reach a nuclear deal with Washington.
The fresh unrest follows anti-government demonstrations last month in which thousands of people were killed in the worst domestic unrest since Iran's 1979 Islamic Revolution.
Iran's state TV carried videos of what it said were individuals "pretending to be students" attacking pro-government students in Tehran who were taking part in protests to condemn January's disturbances, with these individuals allegedly injuring students by throwing rocks.
Protests also took place at universities in Mashhad in the northeast, according to videos published by the US-based rights group HRANA, which said the intervention of security forces in the protests led to injuries.
On Saturday a video purportedly showed rows of marchers at Tehran's Sharif University of Technology condemning Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei as a "murderous leader", and calling for Reza Pahlavi, the exiled son of Iran's toppled shah, to be a new monarch.
The recent protests, which started in December over economic hardships and quickly turned political, were repressed in the most violent crackdown since the 1979 Islamic Revolution.

Terrorist attack in Lviv: Twelve victims remain in hospital, two in critical condition
According to Ukrinform, Lviv Mayor Andriy Sadovyi reported this on Telegram.
“As of now, there are 12 people in our hospitals who were injured in the terrorist attack. Two of them are in critical condition. All of the victims are employees who responded to the call. Except for one teenager who lives nearby,” he said.
Sadovyi called the terrorist attack a hostile special operation aimed at killing as many law enforcement officers as possible.
The mayor also called on the Security Service of Ukraine to pay attention to comments on social media under posts about the terrorist attack in Lviv.
“I ask the SSU to take into account the opinions of all commentators. If you disregard the bot farms, there are quite a few interesting accounts,” he wrote.
Some users are writing hateful comments about the police in a Facebook post about the death of police officer Viktoria Shpylka.
As reported by Ukrinform, explosions were heard in Lviv on the night of February 22. There was no air raid alert in the city at that time. The police said that the explosions occurred after patrol officers arrived at the scene.
It has been preliminarily established that homemade explosive devices were detonated. A 23-year-old police officer was killed in the terrorist attack.
There are also reports of 25 people wounded, three of whom are in critical condition.
In the morning, it was reported that the police, together with the Security Service of Ukraine, had detained the alleged perpetrator. Law enforcement officers are identifying others involved in the crime.
Interior Minister Ihor Klymenko said that there is every reason to believe that Russia was behind this terrorist attack.

It's a quiet box office weekend as 'GOAT' edges 'Wuthering Heights'
Sony Pictures Animation’s film “GOAT” is leading a quiet weekend at the North American box office, beating “Wuthering Heights” in a second-weekend showdown
- Bookmark
It was a battle of the holdovers at the North American box office this weekend, with the family friendly film “GOAT” edging out the R-rated “Wuthering Heights.”
Sony Pictures Animation’s “GOAT” took in $17 million, while Warner Bros.’ “Wuthering Heights” earned $14.2 million, according to studio estimates Sunday. Both films are in their second weekend.
Overall, it was a quiet weekend at movie theaters around the country, with new offerings all opening under $10 million. Those results applied to the faith-based sequel “I Can Only Imagine 2,” the Glen Powell black comedy “How to Make a Killing” and the horror film “Psycho Killer,” which currently has a 0% rating on Rotten Tomatoes. One bright spot in theaters was Baz Luhrmann’s immersive documentary “EPiC: Elvis Presley in Concert,” which earned $3.3 million from only 325 locations in its limited IMAX release. That film expands to nationwide distribution on Feb. 27.
“GOAT” dropped a slim 38% in its second weekend in theaters, which the studio attributed to positive word-of-mouth. The Stephen Curry-produced movie, about a small goat with big sports dreams (voiced by “Stranger Things'” Caleb McLaughlin) has made over $58.3 million. Globally, its running total is at $102.3 million.
“Wuthering Heights” meanwhile fell 57% from its opening last weekend, bringing its domestic total to $60 million. Internationally it added another $26.3 million, pushing its global total to $151.7 million against an $80 million production budget. The movie's top international market continues to be the U.K., where it has made $22.5 million alone.
Third place for the weekend went to Lionsgate and Kingdom Story’s “I Can Only Imagine 2,” a follow-up to the 2018 Dennis Quaid movie that made $86 million against a $7 million budget. The sequel opened with $8 million, a far cry from the first film’s $17 million launch, though that was in line with expectations. It did score a rare A+ CinemaScore.
Amazon and MGM’s “Crime 101” fell 59% in its second weekend, bringing in $5.8 million to take fourth place. The Chris Hemsworth and Mark Ruffalo heist thriller has now made $24.7 million against a reported $90 million budget. “Send Help” rounded out the top five with $4.5 million.
“How to Make a Killing” landed in sixth place with $3.6 million. A24 released the StudioCanal movie in 1,600 North American theaters. The film, loosely inspired by “Kind Hearts and Coronets,” stars Powell as a man who, in a quest to acquire a $28 billion inheritance, decides to kill off his family members. Directed by John Patton Ford (“Emily the Criminal”), “How to Make a Killing” was not well-received by critics: it’s sitting at a “rotten” 47% on Rotten Tomatoes.
“Pyscho Killer,” released by 20th Century Studios, fared much worse and opened outside of the top 10. The horror-thriller written by Andrew Kevin Walker ( “Seven” ) and directed by Gavin Polone (a notable television and film producer in his directorial debut) tanked in its first weekend in theaters with $1.6 million in ticket sales from 1,110 theaters. Audiences were not any happier with it than critics; According to PostTrak, only 31% of ticket buyers would “definitely recommend” it.
Top 10 movies by domestic box office
With final domestic figures being released Monday, this list factors in the estimated ticket sales for Friday through Sunday at U.S. and Canadian theaters, according to Comscore:
1. “GOAT,” $17 million.
2. “Wuthering Heights,” $14.2 million.
3. “I Can Only Imagine 2,” $8 million.
4. “Crime 101,” $5.8 million.
5. “Send Help,” $4.5 million.
6. “How to Make a Killing,” $3.6 million.
7. “EPiC: Elvis Presley in Concert,” $3.3 million.
8. “Solo Mio,” $2.6 million.
9. “Zootopia 2,” $2.3 million.
10. “Avatar: Fire and Ash,” $1.8 million.

Yoga classes aim to bring moments of peace to Gaza’s traumatised children
Recreational activities combined with yoga in Gaza help children recover a sense of normalcy despite war, teacher says.
Gaza City – In northern Gaza, a Palestinian teacher has transformed a tent into a small space for yoga classes, offering children moments of peace from the hardships of daily life in the besieged enclave.
The idea to bring the practice to Gaza City came from Hadeel al-Gharbawi, who has been working on finding ways to help children cope with trauma. Through simple movements and breathing, the class offers moments of calm, safety and joy.

Children sit cross-legged on a thick mat, eyes shut. Some concentrate, while others fight back shy smiles, sneaking sideways glances to see whether their classmates are following the teacher’s instructions, amused by the unfamiliar exercise.
“I wanted to expand the activities I do with children beyond drawing and colouring. I searched online and discovered that yoga can help children recover from trauma,” al-Gharbawi told Al Jazeera.
“Since yoga isn’t widely available here in Gaza, I decided to learn online and practice it with the children. Through yoga, they can release stress and cope with the difficult life around them.”
Children in Gaza have been exposed to continuous cycles of violence and trauma, profoundly affecting their mental health, according to a report by the World Health Organization.
The constant bombing, displacement, loss of family members and physical pain of Israel’s two-year war on Gaza have caused emotional distress, social withdrawal and grief, among other symptoms, the report says.
International organisations have been warning that the conflict will leave a long-lasting impact.
“All children in Gaza require mental health, and psychosocial support services after two years of horrific war, displacement, and exposure to traumatic events,” the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF) said earlier this month.
This is why yoga classes are more than physical exercise in Gaza; they allow children to step away from fear, release emotions, and feel in control, even for a few minutes, the participants say.
“We come here to do yoga, to learn and to do art,” Suwar, a displaced student, told Al Jazeera. “These activities allow us to forget, even for a short time, the war, the harsh weather and the queues for water. Yoga, in particular, gives us a moment of calm and helps us feel safe and happy.”
Alongside yoga, the tent offers educational and recreational programmes that al-Gharbawi said aim to activate the children’s imaginations.
“Combining learning with playful and therapeutic activities helps the children deal with trauma and regain a sense of normalcy,” al-Gharbawi said.

A notorious camp in Syria tied to alleged IS families is emptied as final convoy departs
Officials say Syria has emptied the al-Hol camp, long known for holding women and children with alleged links to the Islamic State group
- Bookmark
A notorious camp in Syria that once housed tens of thousands of women and children with alleged links to the Islamic State group has been emptied, officials said Sunday.
Fadi al-Qassem, the Syrian Foreign Ministry representative for the al-Hol camp administration, said the final convoy left the camp Sunday morning.
Hundreds of residents of the remote camp in northeastern Syria have been transferred to the Akhtarin camp in Aleppo province in recent weeks and others have been repatriated to Iraq.
Officials have said the decision to empty the al-Hol camp was made because of its remote location in the desert — far from services and close to areas where the authorities do not have complete control of the territory.
The U.N. refugee agency said it assisted in the return of 191 Iraqi citizens from Syria’s al-Hol camp to Iraq on Thursday.
The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a U.K.-based war monitor, also reported that an unspecified number of residents "left the camp individually, without waiting for the organized convoys.”
After the defeat of IS in 2019, around 73,000 people were living at al-Hol, most of them Syrian and Iraqi citizens but also including thousands from other countries. The camp’s residents are mostly women, including wives or widows of IS members, and their children.
Since then, the number has declined, with some countries repatriating their citizens, leaving about 24,000 as of last month.
The camp’s residents were not technically prisoners and most have not been accused of crimes, but they had been held in de facto detention at the heavily guarded facility for years.
Last month, Syrian government forces captured the al-Hol camp in a weekslong offensive against the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces, or SDF, which had been running the camp near the border with Iraq for a decade. A ceasefire deal has since ended the fighting.
During and after the fighting, many families are believed to have escaped from the camp.
The fate of the similar but smaller Roj camp in northeastern Syria, which is still under SDF control, remains unclear. Most of the residents of that camp are foreigners, whose countries have largely refused to take them back.
Syrian authorities turned back a group of 34 Australian women and children on Feb. 16 after they left the Roj camp, headed toward Damascus to board a flight back to Australia. Australian authorities later said they would not repatriate the families.
A Syrian government official who spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to comment publicly said Sunday that the issue stemmed from “the lack of prior coordination with the Syrian government” by the SDF and families of the would-be returnees before attempting to send them to Damascus.
The official added that “whether they will be allowed (to return) will depend on the Australian government.”

Ghana takes transatlantic slavery case to UN

Ghana takes transatlantic slavery case to UN
February 22, 2026Ghanaian President John Mahama wants to push the proposal, which is supported by 40 African Union (AU) members, at the United Nations in March. He says the initiative is "firmly grounded in international law" and, together with the endorsement of the African Union, Ghana will formally table the resolution before the UN General Assembly.
The resolution is just the first step, Mahama said on the sidelines of the recently concluded AU summit in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. With wide support amongst AU nations, Mahama says the "truth about the story of the transatlantic slave trade must be told" and recognized as the "gravest crime against humanity."
The 'gravest crime' in human history
There is broad historical consensus that the transatlantic slave trade between the 15th and 19th centuries, which involved the kidnapping, enslavement and transport of millions of Africans to the Americas and the Caribbean, was one of the biggest tragedies in human history.
It's estimated that over 400 years, 15 million men, women and children were forcibly transported. Other sources say 12 to 12.8 million were enslaved. About 10.7 million arrived in the Americas alive, while between 1.5 and 2 million died during the crossing, also known as the Middle Passage.
In Addis Ababa, Mahama said: "People jumped out of ships, who preferred to die. People who were too ill or sick and were thrown overboard to be eaten by sharks."
Historical and legal validity
Kojo Asante from the Ghana Center for Democratic Development (CDD-Ghana) told DW the crime "definitely" has "historical and legal validity."
He says the transatlantic slave trade has significantly shaped affected nations to this day. African states have fought for recognition, or at least an apology, from former slave trading nations. For some governments, this has been a decades-long battle, Asante tells DW.
In Ghana, the subject has long been on the agenda. Mahama is not the first president to champion this initiative, says Asante: Nana Akufo-Addo, his predecessor, also championed reparations.
Next step: Demands for reparations?
The AU declared 2025 "The year of reparations: Justice for Africans and people of African descent through reparations." The resolution sees reparations as future mechanism to assist development efforts.
Mahama made it clear that it's about recognizing historical truth, rather than discussing monetary compensation. Financial questions would be discussed in future.
Western resistance
Asante says there is evidence of a resistance movement in ultra-conservative circles in the United States. Sources close to Donald Trump are said to argue against being held accountable for the actions of their ancestors regarding slavery.
The transatlantic slave trade is a politically sensitive and debated question – especially in nations that benefitted economically from slavery and colonialism.
Support for initiative among younger people
Asante says that especially history oriented young people support the initiative, even if the topic remains somewhat abstract.
At the same time, Asante warns against a strong fixation with the past.
"I think people don't want to be too romantic about this because they want their leaders in Africa to still govern well," he tells DW.
"What you do today with power, what you do today with your opportunities is also important. And there are many challenges, governance deficits in many African countries perpetrated not by colonial masters, by leaders on their own citizens," Asante says.
A competition?
Mahama's assertion that the slave trade is the "gravest crime against humanity" has drawn criticism. Some critics have asked if other historical crimes are being relativized.
Asante pushes back.
"This is not a competition. I think it's just more a question of acknowledging the transatlantic slave trade for what it was," he told DW.
He adds the ongoing effects and incidences of racismshow how current the issue is.
African responsibility
Mahama said the truth about the transatlantic slave trade needed to be fully told.
"The first step towards healing is truth," he said.
It's often pointed out that some African elites benefited from the slave trade. Historians estimate a majority of people captured in Africa were enslaved by other Africans and then sold on to European slavers.
Forms of slavery already existed in African societies well before the transatlantic slave trade. Yet while the transatlantic slave trade was not the only form of slavery, Asante says this trade had a disproportionately large economic, political and societal impacts along Africa's Atlantic coast.

Lobbyist hired by thinktank accused of investigating Guardian reporter

A lobbyist who examined journalists on behalf of an influential thinktank has now been accused of recently investigating a Guardian reporter.
Tom Harper, a senior director at the US public affairs company Apco, was the author of a 58-page report examining the journalists behind a 2023 Sunday Times story about undisclosed donations to Labour Together, the thinktank that was instrumental in Keir Starmer’s Labour leadership victory.
His report, which was commissioned by the thinkthank, claimed – without evidence – that the story was based on data hacked from the Electoral Commission, which it linked to Russia.
The report also examined the religious and ideological positions of some of the journalists and sources involved.
According to the Sunday Times, Harper has since been examining Henry Dyer, an investigations correspondent at the Guardian, who has been reporting on the revelations. It said Harper had been making inquiries about Dyer as recently as last week, and suggesting – without any evidence – he could have been part of a wider pro-Russia campaign.
Apco was contacted for comment. It is already being investigated by the standards committee of the Public Relations and Communications Association, a trade body for the PR industry, over its research into journalists.
The political fallout over Labour Together’s decision to commission the research is also continuing. Josh Simons, now a Cabinet Office minister, was director of Labour Together when it paid Apco £36,000 to investigate the “sourcing, funding and origin” behind the story examining its political donations.
There are calls across the political spectrum for Starmer to sack Simons. It follows a Guardian report that Simons accused journalists of having links to Russian intelligence. He is already the subject of a Whitehall ethics inquiry over the affair.
An investigation revealed Simons had falsely concluded journalists investigating Labour Together’s donations had obtained information about the thinktank from a Russian hack.
Simons was also involved in telling security officials that one journalist was “living with” the daughter of a former adviser to Jeremy Corbyn. Officials were told by Simons’ team that the former adviser was “suspected of links to Russian intelligence”.
The disclosures are contained in emails that Simons and his chief of staff at Labour Together sent to the National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC), a division of the spy agency GCHQ, in 2024. A spokesperson for Simons said: “These claims are untrue.”
Labour Together has been hugely influential within the party. It was originally headed by Morgan McSweeney, who recently resigned as Starmer’s chief of staff amid the fallout from Peter Mandelson’s ill-fated appointment as Britain’s US ambassador.
McSweeney used Labour Together as a vehicle to build a strategy and machine that could replace Corbyn as leader and wrest control of the party away from the former Labour leader’s allies and supporters.
The thinktank’s decision to commission Apco’s investigation was revealed by the Democracy for Sale publication earlier this month. It commissioned the research after a critical story in 2023, which revealed fresh details about £730,000 of undeclared donations to Labour Together, which was run by McSweeney at the time of the gifts.
The Electoral Commission had fined the thinktank more than £14,000 for failing to declare the funding.
The Apco report examined two Sunday Times journalists and the potential sources of the story. Ten pages of Harper’s report were about Gabriel Pogrund, a Sunday Times journalist. It talked about his faith, as well as claims – without evidence – that some of his stories had come from pro-Russia actors.
In 2024, Simons forwarded a shorter version of the report to GCHQ. It did not contain the section about Pogrund.
Paul Holden, a freelance journalist who provided the Sunday Times with documents for their original report on Labour Together’s donations, recently showed the Guardian his source materials. They indicate the story was actually based on files leaked from the Labour party by whistleblowers.
A spokesperson for Simons has said: “Labour Together commissioned Apco to investigate the information Paul Holden obtained for his book, as has repeatedly been made clear.”

The Guardian view on Scottish Labour: Keir Starmer needs Anas Sarwar’s act of betrayal to pay off | Editorial
Unknown

At Scottish Labour’s spring conference last year, Sir Keir Starmer bullishly addressed mounting discontent at his government’s performance, telling his audience: “I always said it would take time to turn this ship around.” On Friday, ahead of the Holyrood election in May, Anas Sarwar’s party will assemble again in Paisley. Sir Keir – whose time Mr Sarwar now considers up – is not expected to be on the speaking roster.
The Scottish Labour leader’s call for Sir Keir’s resignation this month was instantly interpreted through the prism of a (stillborn) Westminster coup. In truth, it was more an act of self-isolation stemming from exasperation. As they attempt to challenge the hegemony of the Scottish National party (SNP), unionist parties in Scotland must constantly look over their shoulders and worry about what London is doing. But at the time of the general election, no one could have anticipated the chaotic sequence of unpopular policies and U-turns – now compounded by the Mandelson scandal – which appears to have quashed hopes of a Scottish Labour renaissance at Holyrood.
In July 2024, Labour won the most votes and seats in Scotland, benefiting from a 16-point swing from the SNP. The result was hailed as a political sea change and, for the party of John Smith and Gordon Brown, the beginning of a restoration. But in 10 weeks’ time Labour could trail in a dismal third behind Reform UK, as a fifth successive SNP government is comfortably elected. Only about a third of Scots who voted Labour in 2024 now say they will do so in May, with Reform and the SNP the major beneficiaries.
Confronted with such dire statistics, Mr Sarwar has thrown a Hail Mary pass: by moving against Sir Keir, he hopes to reassert his independence, distance his party from a tainted brand, and redirect attention to the SNP’s vulnerabilities after 19 years of political domination. The Scottish government’s own declining poll ratings testify that there are plenty of those to exploit, particularly in relation to education and public health.
Could it work? Following his gambit, Mr Sarwar has cut a more liberated figure, able to focus his energy on devolved issues. But Labour’s performance in office has been the gift that kept on giving to its leader, John Swinney. Welfare cuts, illiberal immigration and asylum proposals and Rachel Reeves’s fiscal rules have enabled him to squeeze Mr Sarwar’s party from the left. Reform, meanwhile, hopes to harvest disillusioned votes from the pro-union working class.
Versions of the same political perfect storm are, of course, playing out across Britain. In the Gorton and Denton byelection on Thursday, a formerly rock-solid seat for Labour is delivering a three-way race in which it could finish third behind Reform and the Greens. In Wales, Plaid Cymru’s grip on the progressive vote, and Reform’s rise, threatens an ignominious rout after a century of Labour dominance.
If disaster unfolds in Scotland as well, Mr Sarwar’s rebellion this month is likely to be swiftly replicated in Westminster. The Scottish Labour leader and Britain’s prime minister previously enjoyed a notably close relationship. Yet faced with the possibility of an omni-meltdown in May, Sir Keir’s prospects of survival may rest on his former ally’s act of political betrayal paying off. There could be no greater illustration of the mess Labour is in.

Iranian students rally as universities reopen after nationwide protests
Many students remain incarcerated after being taken by security forces during and after the bloody protests in January.
Tehran, Iran – Thousands of Iranian students demonstrated at universities in Tehran and across the country for a second day as they reopened a month after deadly nationwide protests.
Thousands were killed during the demonstrations, mostly on the nights of January 8 and 9 during a state-imposed communications blackout, as the country faces the threat of another war with the United States and Israel.

The top higher-education institutes in the capital – including the University of Tehran, Sharif University of Technology, Amirkabir University, and Shahid Beheshti University – saw large numbers participating in the protests on Sunday.
Clashes broke out between anti-establishment students and those in favour of the theocratic state, many of them affiliated with the paramilitary Basij organisation of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC).
Streets outside the universities also saw a heavy presence by heavily armed security forces, including some filmed being called “dishonourables” after violently pushing back against students at a main entrance of the University of Tehran.
Students also protested at the Ferdowsi University of Mashhad, located in the holy Shia city in northeastern Iran, which was a hot spot for protests in January. Footage circulating online showed security forces charging at students inside the university.
In the village of Abdanan in the western province of Ilam, where protests took place last week, large crowds gathered on Sunday to cheer and welcome the release of a retired teacher who had been violently arrested by security forces at his home a day earlier.
Tens of thousands, including schoolchildren and university students, have been arrested during and in the aftermath of the nationwide protests. Iranian authorities have refused to provide detailed arrest figures.
Opposing narratives
In Tehran’s universities on Sunday, there was once again a large discrepancy between the version of events broadcast by state media and viral footage of the protests released online by grassroots organisations, including student bodies.
State and IRGC-affiliated media showed Basij students, operating with state permits and backed by security forces, rallying near the main entrances or major areas of campuses to burn US and Israeli flags. They chanted “Death to America”, “Death to the shah”, “Allah akbar”, and “Either death or Khamenei”, in reference to 86-year-old Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.
State media said the pro-establishment students “honoured victims of recent foreign-backed riots” and also claimed that the Basij members were attacked by “pretend students” who were shouting “norm-breaking” slogans.
Some of the slogans in question being shouted by anti-establishment protesters included, “Death to the dictator”, “Woman, life, freedom”, and “The blood that has been spilled cannot be washed away”. In many videos released online, students can be seen saying that they were being attacked by Basij members.
Some of the footage circulating online showed a number of students raising Iran’s flag from before the 1979 Islamic Revolution, which features a lion and sun, to express backing for Reza Pahlavi, the son of Iran’s ousted US-backed shah. The IRGC-affiliated Fars news agency confirmed this, claiming that the move was aimed at “sending footage to anti-Iran media outlets” outside the country.
Pro-state students demonstrating on Saturday and Sunday also accused anti-establishment protesters of somehow being responsible for the unrest in January and allegedly rejoicing in the deaths of thousands.
“They bloodied January and ended up dancing about it,” state media showed Basij students chanting.
This was in reference to countless Iranian families and their supporters, who have in recent days been holding mourning events commemorating 40 days since their loved ones were killed during the nationwide protests. They have somberly clapped, played music in front of mosques, and held up “victory” signs to break state-imposed norms during such events.
Iranians from diverse ethnic backgrounds across the country say they have undertaken the unprecedented practice not out of joy, but to express pride for family members and compatriots killed while peacefully protesting.
The Iranian government claims 3,117 people were killed during the protests, all by “terrorists” and “rioters” who were armed, trained, and funded by the US and Israel. It has rejected accusations by the United Nations and international human rights organisations that blame state security forces for being behind the protest killings.
Iranian authorities also continue to demand “evidence” from the international community while rejecting an independent UN fact-finding mission and imposing draconian internet restrictions for a seventh consecutive week.
The government says it formed a local fact-finding mission, but has provided no clarity on when results may be expected.
The US-based Human Rights Activists News Agency (HRANA) says it has verified more than 7,000 fatalities during the nationwide protests, more than double the government’s number, and is investigating nearly 12,000 other cases.
Mai Sato, UN special rapporteur on human rights in Iran, said more than 20,000 civilians may have been killed. US President Donald Trump put the death toll at 32,000 people on Saturday.

Has Donald Trump lost his most powerful tariff weapon?

Has Donald Trump lost his most powerful tariff weapon?
February 22, 2026Even by Donald Trump's standards, 2026 has been unusually frenetic.
From the ousting of Venezuela's Nicolas Maduro, to his threats to annex Greenland, to his repeated vows to use military action against Iran, a lot has been happening. Amid all these geopolitical upheavals, there is one key tool that has pretty much defined both of Trump's presidencies: tariffs.
Trump's obsession with tariffs goes back a long way. Those who have observed the US president over the decades say it is tied to his view of the booming Japanese economy of the 1980s.
Trump formed the view that Japan's economic success was based on what he felt were the unfair terms of its economic relationship with the US. He came to see tariffs as a magic bullet for balancing the terms of trade with countries — a view he has firmly held for more than 40 years, regardless of the country or the economic dynamics at play.
He often turns to tariffs when cornered. At the height of the Greenland crisis, when European leaders strongly rebuked his rhetoric, he threatened tariffs against those who opposed his plans. His resolute confidence in their effectiveness, regardless of the issue, seems unshakeable.
"I always say tariffs is the most beautiful word to me in the dictionary," he said at his Inauguration Day parade in January 2025. "Tariffs are going to make us rich as hell, it's going to bring our country's businesses back."
Trump's preferred trade tool has been removed
That's why Friday's (February 20) US Supreme Court decision to rule his emergency tariffs illegal could be such a defining moment of his second term. Has the US top court's decision removed the main leverage Trump had for his economic policy? Will it cause him to change course? Or will he simply double down?
Jacob Funk Kirkegaard, nonresident senior fellow with the Peterson Institute for International Economics, told DW that while the ruling doesn't remove tariffs from the Trump playbook, it may blunt their Impact.
"No matter what happens going forward, this removes Donald Trump's preferred avenue for making tariffs the issue with which he deals with any foreign policy or any policy issue overall by simply saying, you know, at very short notice, this country gets, you know, 20%, 30%, 50% tariffs," Kirkegaard said. "That degree of unpredictability in US trade policy has now gone away."
However, Trump's decision, in the wake of the ruling, to install a 10% global tariff and then ramp it up the next day to 15%, was interpreted by some as a sign that he has no intention of softening his approach.
"So much for people who imagined a loss at the Supreme Court would lead to a more restrained trade policy," Deborah Elms, head of trade policy at the Hinrich Foundation in Singapore, said on LinkedIn.
Not all of Trump's tariffs have been invalidated either. Tariffs on steel, aluminum and cars — sectors of particular interest to China and the EU — remain in place. The Trump administration is also exploring ways to impose more tariffs under different statutes.
Yet so many of the so-called reciprocal tariffs Trump imposed on countries around the world have been taken off the table and replaced with the new global tariff. This new tariff already has an expiry date of 150 days due to legal restrictions and needs the US Congress's approval to be extended.
What's the future of Trump's trade deals?
The most immediate question governments around the world now face relates to the trade agreements they struck with the US to reduce most of the "Liberation Day" tariffs. Will the Supreme Court decision tempt the likes of India or the EU to pull back from the deals they have done, in the hope of securing better terms?
Experts say countries are unlikely to allow existing deals to suddenly collapse, as they fear potential retaliation from the US further down the line, once the legal situation has become clearer.
"From our recent conversations with governments, we aren't expecting to see any jurisdictions immediately walk away from the agreements that have been inked in recent months," Andrew Wilson, deputy secretary-general of the International Chamber of Commerce, told the Financial Times.
They add that those countries that have already negotiated tariff rates of around 15% with Trump might be happy to leave things as they are.
However, initial reactions from EU leaders such as German Chancellor Friedrich Merz and French President Emmanuel Macronsuggest a belief that tariffs might be coming down for European exporters. The EU may yet pause the ratification process for the EU-US trade deal, with the European Parliament's trade committee due to hold an emergency meeting on Monday.
Kirkegaard says that from an EU perspective, Trump's new global tariff of 15% would likely already render the trade agreement broken, as that rate could be on top of the already agreed 15% rate.
"That would be unacceptable to the EU, and therefore we will have to see what the specific legal guidance with regard to transatlantic trade coming from the Trump administration will be," he said.
Earlier this month, India and the US reached an interim trade agreement, which saw India agree to an 18% "reciprocal tariff." Following Friday's ruling, India has delayed plans to send a trade delegation to Washington for a meeting between the two sides to finalize the text of the deal, due to begin on February 23.
"Some deals — such as those with Switzerland or India — made explicit reference to the emergency tariffs, as the new tariff rates were framed as reductions from those emergency levels. As the legal reference tariff rate has now disappeared, these deals might have to be redrafted," said Carsten Brzeski, Global Head of Macro for ING Research.
All eyes on Trump's China visit
If Japan was the gateway drug for Trump on tariffs, China has become his most enduring fix.
The ruling has added a whole new dynamic to Trump's planned visit to Beijing on March 31. When Trump launched his "reciprocal" tariff blitz last April, levies on China hit 145% at one stage. The two sides reached a fragile truce in May, significantly reducing the tariffs.
At first glance, Friday's ruling seems to give Beijing a key advantage in any future trade talks, given that one of the main levers Trump has used against China appears to have been taken away.
However, analysts say that China will be careful to maintain calm ahead of the meeting next month.
"It will give China a moral boost in their negotiations with Trump's team ahead of the summit, but they are prepared for the scenario that nothing actually changes in reality," said Sun Yun, director of the China program at the Stimson Center, a Washington-based think tank.
Ali Wyne, an expert on US policy toward China at the International Crisis Group, says Chinese President Xi Jinping will not "flaunt or brandish" the Supreme Court ruling when the two sides meet and is instead likely to focus on maintaining positive relations with Trump.
Several analysts have pointed out that while Trump has lost his easiest method for issuing tariffs, he still has other ways — and this is unlikely to be lost on China or other countries, who may have an eye on more favorable terms, but who see maintaining positive relations with Trump as the best way to achieve it.
Will Trump take the off-ramp offered by the SC ruling?
Some have speculated that the ruling could provide Trump with a political off-ramp for his tariff policies, given that they have become unpopular with voters in an economy still grappling with persistent inflation. A Washington Post-ABC News-Ipsos poll released on Friday found that 64% of voters disapproved of his handling of tariffs.
Then there's the fact that many in Trump's own Republican Party are critical of his tariff policy, particularly with the US mid-term elections due to take place in November. A few Republican members in both the US House of Representatives and Senate have at times voted to rebuke and curtail the tariffs on trade partners such as Canada.
"We don't think that President Trump will use the ruling as a backdoor option to back down on his tariff agenda," said Brzeski. "On the contrary, announcements since the Supreme Court’s ruling strongly confirm that Trump has no intention of removing his 'most beautiful word' from the English dictionary."
Trump has very pointedly declined any off-ramp, for now.
"I have the right to do tariffs, and I've always had the right to do tariffs," he said after Friday's ruling.
That remains true, but clearly not in the way he previously thought. Precisely how that will impact the effectiveness of his go-to policy tool will become apparent in the months ahead.

Greenland says 'no thanks' to Trump US hospital boat
Greenland's prime minister has asked US President Donald Trump to talk to him instead of making "random outbursts on social media", after Trump said he was sending a US hospital boat to "take care" of people on the island.
Trump wrote on Truth Social that he was going to send a boat filled with medical supplies, alleging "many people" on the island are sick and "not being taken care of".
Jens-Frederik Nielsen responded "it's going to be a no thanks from us," and said that Greenland provides free healthcare for all citizens.
Trump has long coveted the vast arctic island - but conceded in January that he would not take it by force, after previously refusing to rule out doing so.
Soon after, he announced a "framework for a future deal" around the US and Greenland, after Denmark and Nato allies made it clear that they would not give in to his calls to relinquish sovereignty.
In his post on social media, Trump said that he and his Greenland envoy Jeff Landry were "going to send a great hospital boat to Greenland to take care of the many people who are sick, and not being taken care of there. It's on the way!!!"
The post included what appeared to be an illustrated or AI image of the USNS Mercy, one of two hospital ships operated by the US navy. It is not clear when the ship would arrive or what prompted the decision.
Responding to the post, Nielsen said that Trump's idea "is noted. But we have a public healthcare system where treatment is free for citizens."
"It's not like that in the United States, where it costs money to go to the doctor," he wrote on Facebook.
Nielsen added that Greenland remained open to cooperating with the US but underlined the importance of discussing issues directly.
"Talk to us instead of just making more or less random outbursts on social media," he said.
Trump's post came soon after Denmark's Joint Arctic Command said it had evacuated a crew member who required urgent medical treatment from a US submarine close to Nuuk. It is not clear if Trump's post was related to the incident.
A month on from Trump announcing a "framework for a future deal" over Greenland, details are still unclear, though earlier this month US vice president JD Vance alleged that European countries were "willing to make a lot of accommodations".

Yemeni government forces close STC offices in Aden
Forces from the Yemeni government's Southern Giants Brigades began closing the offices of the dissolved Southern Transitional Council (STC) in Yemen’s interim capital Aden on Sunday, as part of government measures following last week’s unrest at the Maashiq gate.
The move comes after authorities accused STC supporters of attempting to storm the Maashiq area on Thursday evening, where the government headquarters and Maashiq Palace are located east of the Crater district.
The STC seeks a separate state in southern Yemen and has previously received support from the United Arab Emirates, before Saudi Arabia forced the UAE out of Yemen.
Employees and members of the Southern General Assembly told The New Arab's Arabic edition Al-Araby Al-Jadeed that units from the Southern Giants Brigades took control of the General Assembly and Advisory Council building in Tawahi district.
They said armed personnel and armoured vehicles were deployed inside and around the building, the main gate was closed, and administrative staff and council members were prevented from entering and ordered to leave.
Aden Independent Channel, affiliated with the STC, said in a Facebook post that "Saudi-backed forces closed the headquarters of the General Assembly" in Tawahi and barred members and employees from entering.
In a separate post, it said "Saudi-backed forces closed the headquarters of the Foreign Affairs Authority of the Southern Transitional Council in Tawahi district and prevented members and employees from entering the building".
Sources within the STC told Al-Araby Al-Jadeed that other Giants Brigades forces seized the headquarters of the STC's Foreign Affairs Authority in Tawahi at dawn on Sunday, ordering guards to vacate the building before stationing forces inside and around it.
The same sources said that late on Friday night, orders were delivered to STC leaders to close all council offices in Aden and across southern governorates, in line with directives from Yemen’s Presidential Leadership Council.
In a statement issued on Sunday, the STC’s Foreign Affairs Authority condemned the closures, saying the council expresses its "absolute condemnation of the arbitrary decision taken by parties within the Presidential Leadership Council to close all STC offices in the capital Aden".
It added: "This measure, which included our headquarters and prevented us from carrying out our duties, is not merely targeting administrative offices, but a systematic attempt to tighten the noose around the southern cause and silence the voice of its people."
The statement said that "despite these provocations, the Southern Transitional Council reaffirms its firm commitment to seeking a comprehensive political solution".
It added that "the path to sustainable peace inevitably passes through enabling the people of the South to determine their own future, in accordance with the fundamental references of the southern cause, represented in the political declaration issued on 2 January and the Southern National Charter".
Earlier on Saturday, Aden Governor Abdulrahman Sheikh outlined a series of measures taken since his appointment on 7 January, including relocating military forces outside the interim capital and assigning security forces responsibility for maintaining order.
He described the issue as decisive and said it would not be reversed, citing the need to enhance security, stability and the civilian character of the city.
Sheikh said freedom of expression remains guaranteed and that protests may be held in designated areas, but warned that authorities would not tolerate actions leading to chaos, breaches of public order or the storming of institutions.
The developments follow clashes at Maashiq gate on Thursday evening, after which Aden’s security committee accused the dissolved STC of backing armed groups that attacked security forces and attempted to storm the main entrance to the Maashiq area.
Security forces subsequently carried out raids and arrests of several individuals on charges of incitement and participation in the events.
Among those detained was Mohammed Hussein Jarallah, acting head of the STC’s local body in Aden, who was released on Saturday evening, according to STC sources.
The closures coincided with the gradual resumption of broadcasting by Aden Independent Channel after nearly two months off air, with the channel airing its first news bulletin from inside Aden on Saturday evening.

France remained on course for the Six Nations title after a scrappy 33-8 win against Italy on Sunday, February 22. ,Fabien Galthié's side is favored to win back-to-back titles and is the only team to have won all three matches. France grabbed five tries for a bonus point and has 19 tries so far, having managed a tournament-record 30 last year.
Jet-heeled left winger Louis Bielle-Biarrey, lock Emmanuel Meafou and makeshift flyhalf Thomas Ramos scored first-half tries at Stade Pierre-Mauroy in Lille, two of them set up by star scrumhalf Antoine Dupont.
But after leading 19-0 inside 30 minutes, the French tried too much entertaining as indiscipline allowed Italy back in. An opportunist try from fullback Ange Capuozzo followed by Paolo Garbisi's penalty pulled it back to 19-8.
The scoreboard stayed static until 31 minutes into the second half when the ever-alert Ramos kicked into the right corner to give winger Gaël Dréan a try on test debut. That try came about when Italy was down to 14 players after winger Louis Lynag– the son of Australian flyhalf great Michael Lynagh – was carelessly sinbinned for a deliberate knock-on. Italy's bench was angry at the try, which came with the Italians effectively down to 13 because Capuozzo was not yet back on the field following treatment for a shoulder injury.
Center Emilien Gailleton showed his strength when he broke a tackle to dive over in the closing stages, and Ramos converted.

European Commission urges US to honor trade deal

European Commission urges US to honor trade deal
February 22, 2026The European Commission on Sunday demanded that the United States respect the terms of a trade deal reached last July.
The call from Brussels comes after US President Donald Trump said he was raising a global 10% tariff to 15% in response to the US Supreme Court blocking many of his emergency tariffs.
The court decision has cast uncertainty over the ratification of the deal, which had been put on hold and was to be approved by the European Parliament on Tuesday.
What did the EU Commission say about the terms of the US trade deal?
The Commission called for Washington to provide "full clarity" on the measures it plans to implement following the Supreme Court ruling.
"EU companies and exporters must have fair treatment, predictability and legal certainty," the Commission said.
"The current situation is not conducive to delivering 'fair, balanced, and mutually beneficial' transatlantic trade and investment, as agreed to by both sides," it said, pointing to the deal reached by the US and the EU last year. "A deal is a deal."
"In particular, EU products must continue to benefit from the most competitive treatment, with no increases in tariffs beyond the clear and all-inclusive ceiling previously agreed," it said.
In an earlier statement issued on Friday, the Commission said it was studying the potential effects of the court's decision.
What was the trade deal between the US and the EU?
Trump imposed tariffs on multiple countries shortly after he took office in January 2025, in a bid to reduce the US trade deficit and boost manufacturing in the country.
In July 2025, Trump threatened to impose a 30% tariff on all EU goods.
After negotiations between Brussels and Washington, the two sides reached a deal setting tariffs of 15% on most EU exports to the US. It would also require the EU to buy $750 billion (€636.5 billion) of US energy products through 2028.
EU officials later put the ratification of the deal on hold in response to Trump's push for the US to take over of Greenland, which is an autonomous territory of EU member state Denmark.

The next US-Iran talks will be Thursday in Geneva, Oman says
The next US-Iran talks will be Thursday in Geneva, Oman says
DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) — The next round of talks between the United States and Iran will be Thursday in Geneva, Oman’s foreign minister said Sunday, shortly after Tehran’s top diplomat said he expected to meet U.S. envoy Steve Witkoff then.
Foreign Minister Badr al-Busaidi said on social media he was pleased to confirm the development, “with a positive push to go the extra mile towards finalizing the deal.” Oman previously hosted the indirect talks on the Islamic Republic’s nuclear program and facilitated the latest round in Geneva last week.
There was no immediate comment from the White House.
Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi had told CBS in an interview aired Sunday that a “good chance” remained for a diplomatic solution on the nuclear issue, adding it was the only matter being discussed.
The Trump administration has been pushing for concessions from its longtime adversary and has built up the largest U.S. military presence in the Middle East in decades.
President Donald Trump warned on Friday that limited strikes against Iran are possible, even as Araghchi at the time said Tehran expected to have a proposed deal ready in the next few days.
Araghchi told CBS that Iran was still working on the draft proposal. He added that Iran has the right to enrich uranium. On Friday, he said his U.S. counterparts had not asked for zero enrichment as part of the latest round of talks, which is not what U.S. officials have said publicly.
Both Iran and the U.S. have signaled they are prepared for war if talks on Tehran’s nuclear program fail.
Minutes after Oman’s confirmation of talks, Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian said on social media that “recent negotiations involved the exchange of practical proposals and yielded encouraging signals. However, we continue to closely monitor U.S. actions and have made all necessary preparations for any potential scenario.”
The U.S. has said Iran cannot have nuclear weapons or the capacity to build them and that it cannot enrich uranium. Tehran has long insisted that any negotiations should only focus on its nuclear program, and that it hasn’t been enriching uranium since U.S. and Israeli strikes on Iranian nuclear sites in June.
Although Iran insists its nuclear program is peaceful, the U.S. and others suspect it is aimed at eventually developing weapons.
Talks were deadlocked for years after Trump’s decision in 2018 to unilaterally withdraw the U.S. from Iran’s 2015 nuclear deal with world powers. Since then, Iran has refused to discuss wider U.S. and Israeli demands that it scale back its missile program and sever ties to armed groups.
New protests in Iran
Confirmation of new talks came as new anti-government protests began in Iran, according to witnesses, as university students in Tehran and another city demonstrated around memorials for thousands of people killed in a crackdown on previous nationwide demonstrations about six weeks ago.
Iran’s state news agency said students protested at five universities in the capital, Tehran, and one in the city of Mashhad on Sunday. The scattered protests erupted Saturday at universities following 40-day memorials for people killed in January during anti-government rallies.
Iran’s government has not commented on the latest protests.
Many Iranians have held ceremonies marking the traditional 40-day mourning period in the past week. Most of the protesters are believed to have been killed around Jan. 8 and 9, according to activists tracking the situation.
Iranians across the country are still reeling with shock, grief and fear after the earlier protests were crushed by the deadliest crackdown ever seen under the rule of 86-year-old Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei. Thousands of people were killed and tens of thousands are believed to have been arrested.
Although the crackdown tamped down the largest protests, smaller ones are still occurring, according to protesters and to videos shared on social media.
During the 1979 Islamic Revolution that toppled the shah and brought the Islamic Republic to power, 40-day memorials for slain protesters often turned into rallies that security forces tried to crush, causing new deaths. Those were then marked 40 days later, with new protests.
Posts on social media Saturday and Sunday have alleged that security forces tried to restrict people from attending some 40-day ceremonies.
The U.S.-based Human Rights Activists News Agency says at least 7,015 people were killed in the previous protests and crackdown, including 214 government forces. The group has been accurate in counting deaths during previous rounds of unrest in Iran and relies on a network of activists there to verify deaths.
The death toll continues to rise as the group crosschecks information despite disrupted communication with those inside the Islamic Republic.
Iran’s government offered its only death toll from the previous protests on Jan. 21, saying 3,117 people were killed. Iran’s theocracy in the past has undercounted or not reported fatalities from past unrest.
The Associated Press has been unable to independently assess the death toll, given authorities have disrupted internet access and international calls in Iran.

After 4 years of war by Russia in Ukraine, peace is still elusive despite a US push for a settlement

After 4 years of war by Russia in Ukraine, peace is still elusive despite a US push for a settlement
After 4 years of war by Russia in Ukraine, peace is still elusive despite a US push for a settlement
When Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine surpassed 1,418 days last month, it officially exceeded a historic milestone — the same span of time it took Moscow to defeat Nazi Germany in World War II.
And unlike the Red Army that pushed all the way to Berlin eight decades ago in what it called the Great Patriotic War, Russia’s 4-year-old, all-out invasion of its neighbor is still struggling to fully capture Ukraine’s eastern industrial heartland.
After Moscow failed to seize the capital of Kyiv and install a puppet government in February 2022, the conflict turned into trench warfare with tremendous cost. By some estimates, nearly 2 million soldiers are dead, wounded or missing on both sides in Europe’s most devastating conflict since World War II.
Russia has occupied about 20% of Ukrainian territory since illegally annexing Crimea in 2014, but its gains after the Feb. 24, 2022, invasion have been slow. NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte this month likened Moscow’s advance to “the speed of a garden snail.”
Russian troops have moved only about 50 kilometers (about 30 miles) into the Donetsk region of eastern Ukraine in the past two years in a grinding battle for control of a few strongholds.
Despite the slow pace and high cost, President Vladimir Putin has maintained his maximalist demands in U.S.-mediated peace talks, saying Kyiv must pull its forces from the four Ukrainian regions that Moscow illegally annexed but never fully captured. He has repeatedly brandished his nuclear arsenal to prevent the West from boosting military support for Kyiv.
A war of attrition
Initially involving quick movements of large numbers of troops and tanks in Russia’s opening blitz and Ukraine’s counteroffensive in fall 2022, the fighting morphed into bloody positional warfare along the 1,200-kilometer (750-mile) front line.
The Washington-based Center for Strategic and International Studies estimated Russian military casualties at 1.2 million, including 325,000 killed. It put Ukrainian troop casualties at up to 600,000, including up to 140,000 killed.
“Russia has suffered the highest casualty rate of any major power in any war since World War II, and its military has performed poorly, with historically slow rates of advance and little new territory to show for its efforts over the last two years,” it said, noting Russian troops were advancing an average of 70 meters (76 1/2 yards) a day in two years to capture the transport hub of Pokrovsk.
For the first time in military history, drones are playing a decisive role, making it effectively impossible for either side to covertly mass significant numbers of troops.
Since early in the conflict, Ukraine has relied on drones to offset Moscow’s edge in firepower and stem its advances, but Russia has drastically expanded drone operations and introduced longer-range optical fiber-tethered drones to avoid electronic jamming. They widened the kill zone to 50 kilometers (about 30 miles) from the front, leaving the terrain tangled in strands of filament.
The mixture of high-tech drones and World War I-style trench fighting has seen small groups of infantry — often just two or three soldiers — try to infiltrate enemy positions into towns flattened by Russian heavy artillery and glide bombs. Ferrying supplies and evacuating the wounded is a major challenge as drones target supply routes.
Long-range attacks
Ukrainian officials described this winter as the most challenging of the war. Russia exponentially increased its strikes on the country’s energy system, causing blackouts in Kyiv where power supplies to many were cut to a few hours a day amid bitter cold.
Russia also has increasingly targeted power lines aiming to halt energy transfers and split Ukraine’s power grid into isolated islands, increasing pressure on the grid.
Ukraine retaliated with long-range drone attacks on oil refineries and other energy facilities deep inside Russia, aiming to drain Moscow’s export revenues.
Its drones and missiles sank several Russian warships in the Black Sea, forcing Moscow to redeploy its fleet from Russia-occupied Crimea to Novorossiysk. And in an audacious attack code-named “Spiderweb,” Ukraine used drones from trucks to hit several air bases hosting long-range bombers across Russia in June, a humiliating blow to the Kremlin.
US pressure, conflicting demands
U.S. President Donald Trump, who once promised to end the war in a day, has pushed to end the fighting, but mediation efforts have run into sharply conflicting demands.
Putin wants Ukraine to pull its troops from the part of the Donetsk region it still controls, abandon its bid to join NATO, curb its military and grant official status to the Russian language, among other demands Ukraine has rejected.
Russia left the door open to Kyiv’s prospective European Union membership, but it firmly ruled out any European peacekeepers deployed to Ukraine as part of a settlement.
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy wants a ceasefire along the existing line of contact, but Putin rules out a truce, demanding a comprehensive peace agreement.
“The territorial issue is important to the Kremlin, but the war has a more ambitious goal: to create a Ukraine that would be entirely within Russia’s sphere of influence and not perceived by Moscow as ‘anti-Russia,’” observed Tatiana Stanovaya of Carnegie Russia Eurasia Center.
Ukraine and its allies accuse Putin of dragging out talks while he seizes more territory. The Kremlin accuses Kyiv and its European supporters of trying to undermine a tentative agreement reached by Trump and Putin at their Alaska summit.
While sticking to their positions, Putin and Zelenskyy have praised U.S. mediation and tried to curry favor with Trump.
After a disastrous White House meeting a year ago, Zelenskyy has adopted a more practical negotiating stance, emphasizing Ukraine’s goodwill.
After Trump called for a presidential election in Ukraine, Zelenskyy signaled readiness for it even though it’s banned under martial law. The election could be coupled with a referendum on a peace deal, he said, but insisted the vote was only possible once a ceasefire is established and Ukraine gets security guarantees from the U.S. and other allies.
Elusive settlement
Zelenskyy said the White House has set a June deadline for the war’s end and will likely pressure both sides to meet it. But even as Trump appears eager for a peace deal before the U.S. midterm elections, challenges remain.
With Putin insisting on Ukraine’s pullback from Donetsk and Zelenskyy ruling it out, a quick deal appears unlikely. Zelenskyy also expressed skepticism about a compromise U.S. proposal to turn the eastern region into a free economic zone.
The Kremlin expects its attacks eventually will force Kyiv to accept Moscow’s terms. Ukraine hopes it can hold on until Trump loses patience and increases sanctions on Russia, forcing Putin to halt his aggression. But Trump often appears to be losing patience with Zelenskyy instead.
The war and Western sanctions have increasingly strained Russia’s economy. Growth has slowed to a near halt, due to persistent inflation and labor shortages. The latest U.S. sanctions on Russian oil exports have added to the strain.
But even with the economic challenges, Russia’s defense plants have increased weapons output and its government has shielded key social groups like soldiers and industrial workers from hardship.
“Its economy is poorer, less efficient and less promising than it might otherwise have been,” wrote Richard Connolly of the Royal United Services Institute. “But it remains capable of sustaining the war. Its elites are more dependent on the regime, not less. Its political system is insulated from the transmission of economic discontent into pressure for regime change.”

TSA says PreCheck still operational after previous announcement of suspension during funding fight
TSA says PreCheck still operational after previous announcement of suspension during funding fight
NEW YORK (AP) — The Transportation Security Administration said Sunday that its PreCheck program would remain operational despite an earlier announcement from the U.S. Department of Homeland Security that the airport security service was being suspended during the partial government shutdown.
“ As staffing constraints arise, TSA will evaluate on a case by case basis and adjust operations accordingly,” the agency said.
It was not immediately clear whether Global Entry, another airport service, would be affected. PreCheck and Global Entry are designed to help speed registered travelers through security lines, and suspensions would likely cause headaches and delays. Since starting in 2013, more than 20 million Americans are signed up for TSA PreCheck, according to the Department of Homeland Security, and millions of those Americans also have overlapping Global Entry memberships. Global Entry is a U.S. Customs and Border Protection program that allows pre-approved, low-risk travelers to use expedited kiosks when entering the United States from abroad.
The turmoil is tied to a partial government shutdown that began Feb. 14 after Democrats and the White House were unable to reach a deal on legislation to fund the Department of Homeland Security. Democrats have been demanding changes to immigration operations that are core to President Donald Trump’s deportation campaign.
The security disruptions come at a time where a major winter storm will hit the East Coast from Sunday into Monday. Nine out of ten flights going out of John F. Kennedy International Airport, LaGuardia Airport and Boston Logan Airport have been cancelled for Monday.
Homeland Security previously said it was taking “emergency measures to preserve limited funds.” Among the steps listed were “ending Transportation Security Administration (TSA) PreCheck lanes and Customs and Border Protection (CBP) Global Entry service, to refocus Department personnel on the majority of travelers.”
“We are glad that DHS has decided to keep PreCheck operational and avoid a crisis of its own making,” said Geoff Freeman, president and CEO of the U.S. Travel Association.
Before announcing the PreCheck shutdown, Secretary Kristi Noem said in a statement Saturday night that “shutdowns have serious real world consequences.”
One group of fliers will definitely be affected, according to TSA.
“Courtesy escorts, such as those for Members of Congress, have been suspended to allow officers to focus on the mission of securing America’s skies,” the agency said.
Airlines for America, a trade group representing major carriers, said Saturday night that “it’s past time for Congress to get to the table and get a deal done.” It also criticized the announcement by saying it was “issued with extremely short notice to travelers, giving them little time to plan accordingly.”
“A4A is deeply concerned that TSA PreCheck and Global Entry programs are being suspended and that the traveling public will be, once again, used as a political football amid another government shutdown,” the organization said.
Democrats on the House Committee on Homeland Security criticized Homeland Security handling of airport security after the initial announcement on Saturday night. They accused the administration of “kneecapping the programs that make travel smoother and secure.”
Sen. Andy Kim, a New Jersey Democrat, said Noem’s actions are part of an administration strategy to distract from other issues and shift responsibility.
“This administration is trying to weaponize our government, trying to make things intentionally more difficult for the American people as a political leverage,” he told CNN on Sunday. “And the American people see that.”

US says ambassador’s comments on Israel and the Middle East were taken out of context
TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) — An uproar continued Sunday after the U.S. ambassador to Israel, Mike Huckabee, said Israel has a right to much of the Middle East, as more Arab and Muslim countries objected and the U.S. said his comments were taken out of context.
Huckabee spoke in an interview with conservative commentator Tucker Carlson that aired Friday. Carlson said that according to the Bible, the descendants of Abraham would receive land that today would include much of the Middle East, including parts of modern-day Jordan, Syria, Iraq and Lebanon. He quoted from Genesis Chapter 15 and asked Huckabee if Israel had a right to that land.
Huckabee responded: “It would be fine if they took it all.”
A spokesperson for the U.S. Embassy said Sunday that Huckabee’s comments were taken out of context and that there is no change to U.S. policies on Israel.
In the interview, Huckabee added: “They’re not asking to go back and take all of that, but they are asking to at least take the land that they now occupy, they now live in, they now own legitimately, and it is a safe haven for them.” He added that Israel isn’t trying to take over Jordan, Lebanon, Syria, or Iraq but is trying to protect its own people.
Condemnation by Arab countries
A joint statement Sunday by Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Jordan, Bahrain, United Arab Emirates, Qatar, Indonesia, Pakistan, Turkey, Syria, Kuwait, Lebanon, Oman, the Palestinian Authority and several Arab governing bodies called Huckabee’s remarks “dangerous and inflammatory” and ones that endanger the region’s stability.
“These statements directly contradict the vision put forward by U.S. President Donald J. Trump … based on containing escalation and creating a political horizon for a comprehensive settlement that ensures the Palestinian people have their own independent state,” the statement said.
Huckabee, an evangelical Christian and strong supporter of Israel and the West Bank settlement movement, has long opposed the idea of a two-state solution for Israel and the Palestinian people.
Carlson has been critical of U.S. support for Israel in the war in Gaza and has come under fire for his own far-right views, including the white-supremacist theory that says whites are being “replaced” by people of color.
Israeli concerns about Iran
Meanwhile, tensions are high in Israel as the country prepares for a possible attack from Iran. Iran previously said it will attack both Israel and U.S. bases in the Middle East if the United States attacks it.
Trump warned on Friday that limited strikes against Iran are possible, even as the country’s top diplomat said Tehran expects to have a proposed deal ready in the next few days following nuclear talks with the United States.
The movements of additional U.S. warships and airplanes to the region, with the USS Gerald R. Ford aircraft carrier near the mouth of the Mediterranean Sea, don’t guarantee a U.S. strike on Iran, but they bolster Trump’s ability to carry out one if he chooses.
Netanyahu warned last week that if Iran attacks Israel, they will risk a “response that they cannot even imagine.”
Israel attacked Iran last year during indirect U.S.-Iran talks, sparking a 12-day war. The United States inserted itself in the war by bombing Iranian nuclear sites.

Hughes scores in overtime as US beats Canada for first men’s hockey gold at the Olympics since 1980
Hughes scores in overtime as US beats Canada for first men’s hockey gold at the Olympics since 1980
MILAN (AP) — The United States is on top of the hockey world for the first time in nearly a half-century. No miracle needed.
Jack Hughes scored less than 2 minutes into overtime and the U.S. beat Canada 2-1 in the gold medal final at the Milan Cortina Olympics on Sunday, earning the nation’s third men’s title at the Games and its first since the “Miracle on Ice” in 1980 — 46 years to the day of the upset over the mighty Soviet Union, too.
Unlike that ragtag group of college kids that pulled off one of the biggest shockers in sports history in Lake Placid, the Americans in Milan were a machine that rode goaltender Connor Hellebuyck and a roster full of NHL players through the tournament unbeaten.
Still, they were underdogs again against the stacked Canadians and came out on top — again.
“This is all about our country right now,” said Hughes, who lost at least one and maybe two of his front teeth taking a high stick during the game. “I love the U.S.A. I love my teammates. It’s unbelievable. The USA Hockey brotherhood is so strong.”
Early in the three-on-three overtime, Zach Werenski took the puck away from Nathan MacKinnon and passed it to Hughes, who was wide open streaking to the net. Hughes fired a shot past Jordan Binnington 1:41 in to send players into a wild celebration as the rival Canadians watched from the bench.
Asked his favorite moment during his Olympic debut, captain Auston Matthews quipped, “I think when Jack scored. ... I’ll definitely remember Jack’s goal.”
There was a note of sadness amid all the joy as Werenski and Matthew Tkachuk carried a Johnny Gaudreau No. 13 jersey around the ice in tribute to the beloved player who was killed along with his brother in 2024.
Gaudreau’s parents, Guy and Jay, his widow, Meredith, and their oldest children were in attendance. It was Johnny Jr.'s second birthday and he was brought on the ice with older sister Noa for the team photo.
“We just wanted to show the Gaudreau family our support,” Brady Tkachuk said of the player known as “Johnny Hockey.” “He was so near and dear to a lot of us, and we miss him dearly. We did it for him.”
Hellebuyck was extraordinary, stopping 41 of the 42 shots he faced as Canada tilted the ice toward him over the final two periods. He made the save of the tournament by getting his stick on the puck on a shot from Devon Toews in the third period, then minutes later denied Macklin Celebrini on a breakaway — something he also did to Connor McDavid earlier.
“He was our best player by a mile,” winger Matt Boldy said. “He’s an absolute stud. He wants to be in those moments. He wants to make the saves. And he did just that, so he was definitely our MVP.”
It was a glorious weekend for Team USA, with the women’s hockey team also defeating Canada in overtime to win gold. For the men, it was only fitting the Americans needed to go through Canada, their northern neighbor that beat them at the 4 Nations Face-Off a year ago and has won every international competition over the past 16 years that featured the world’s best players.
Not anymore.
Winning a fast-paced, riveting game that was full of big hits and plenty of post-whistle altercations, the U.S. got a goal from Boldy 6 minutes in and led until Cale Makar tied it late in the second period. Hellebuyck and the penalty kill was a perfect 17 for 17 at the Olympics.
“I can’t even believe this,” Hughes said. “I mean it’s such an unbelievable game, USA-Canada. Such a good game. There’s so many great players. We’re a great team. That’s exactly how we wanted it to go. We’re underdogs to Canada, (but we) beat them. It could have gone either way.”
Hughes paid a painful price when he took the high stick and wound up face down on the ice. The teeth were out, but the celebration wasn’t far away.
“More people are going to be looking at his medal than his teeth,” Boldy said.
The U.S. finally came through after generations of churning out talent from the grassroots level like a production line. All but two of the 25 players on the team went through USA Hockey’s National Team Development Program.
That group of 23 includes captain Auston Matthews, the top line of Brady and Matthew Tkachuk and Jack Eichel, and the second set of brothers, Jack and Quinn Hughes. Much of the team played together either at the program, under-18s, the world junior championship or some combination of them.
The U.S. winning silenced criticism of general manager Bill Guerin and his management group choosing a roster full of experienced veteran players to fill specific roles and leaving four of the top 10 American goal-scorers in the NHL this season at home. The players they brought got the job done.
“There are whisky drinkers and milk drinkers and we got a lot of whisky drinkers on this team,” coach Mike Sullivan said. “One of the things that Billy Guerin and I talked about from the very beginning was trying to build a team in the true sense of the word, so we looked at a deep group of American talent and these decisions were very difficult. They weren’t easy. You look at how this group is constructed, there was a thought process that we had players that could play in all situations.”
Some decisions were no-doubters, like Sullivan giving the net to Hellebuyck, who stopped 131 of the 137 shots he faced throughout the tournament and was at his best against Canada.
“He was our backbone — today even more so than the rest of the tournament,” forward Vincent Trocheck said. “He saved our lives there a couple times in the third. He was unbelievable.”
Canada, back-to-back Olympic champions in 2010 and ’14 and winners of three of the first five, fell short while playing without injured captain Sidney Crosby. The 38-year-old two-time gold medalist and three-time Stanley Cup champion left the quarterfinal game against Czechia and sat out the semifinal game against Finland.
“It was a tough decision,” Crosby said. “Obviously, in your head you always want to be out there and find very way possible. But not at the expense of what needs to be done. And them watching how we played today, the guys played incredible.”
McDavid, who wore the “C” in Crosby’s absence, suffered another devastating defeat on the doorstep of a title. He and the Edmonton Oilers have lost to Matthew Tkachuk and the Florida Panthers in the Stanley Cup Final each of the past two years.

US north-east braces for heavy snow and ferocious winds amid blizzard warnings

Blizzard conditions were forecast to bring major disruption across the north-eastern United States on Sunday and well into Monday, with a dangerous combination of heavy, wet snow and ferocious winds gusting up to 70mph.
Residents along the east coast scrambled to prepare for the late-winter storm that spurred blizzard warnings from Maryland to Massachusetts, affecting more than 35 million people.
More than a foot of snow was expected, with gales inland and warnings of potential coastal flooding.
The National Weather Service warned that once the storm intensified on Sunday afternoon it could prove significantly more severe than projections that were made just a few days ago.
The weather service said 1 to 2ft of snow was possible in many areas as it put out blizzard warnings for New York City and the Long Island peninsula to the east, for coastal communities in New Jersey, Connecticut, Delaware, Maryland, Rhode Island and, further north, Boston and other parts of Massachusetts.
A storm surge of 2 to 4ft could cause moderate coastal flooding and beach erosion from Delaware Bay to Cape Cod almost 400 miles to the north during high tide cycles.
The storm was projected to arrive on Sunday morning in areas around Washington DC before stretching toward Philadelphia and New York City and reaching Boston in the evening, just as the icy leftovers of last month’s major snowstorm that also brought Arctic temperatures to the region were finally melting away.
The storm could cause whiteout conditions that “will make travel treacherous and potentially life-threatening”, the weather service said, adding that: “The strong winds and weight of snow on tree limbs may down power lines and could cause sporadic power outages.”
Airlines have cancelled more than 6,000 flights in and out of US airports through Monday, according to flight-tracking site FlightAware, with major hubs JFK, LaGuardia, Newark, Philadelphia, and Boston Logan the hardest hit.
The New York City mayor, Zohran Mamdani, declared a state of emergency on Sunday, which releases extra funding to deal with a major weather event. In an unusual move he announced that all non-essential travel would be banned on city roads between 9pm on Sunday and noon on Monday, and announced that public schools would have a full snow day on Monday. “No online school, no remote learning, full classic snow day,” he said in a post on X.
NYC residents, who were under a blizzard warning for the first time in almost a decade, were urged to stay indoors if possible until the storm passes on Monday. “Staying home means you are staying safe,” Mamdani told Fox News on Sunday morning.
The mayor said the city would expand on efforts it used to deal with a major snowstorm weeks ago. New York had brought in additional snow-clearing equipment from outside the city, Mamdani said, and planned to expand use of geocoding to keep track of bus stops, crosswalks, pedestrian ramps and unsheltered bus stops that need clearing.
A state of emergency also began at noon on Sunday throughout New Jersey, governor Mikie Sherrill announced, with all 21 counties simultaneously under a blizzard warning for the first time in 30 years. Many churches canceled Sunday services and other activities, and officials in Atlantic City urged residents and visitors to its famous casinos to stay off the streets, especially in low-lying neighborhoods prone to flooding.
Sherrill urged New Jerseyans, on social media: “If you are out now, it’s time to get home. Please stay off the roads and stay inside. Take this storm seriously.”
In Boston, mMayor Michelle Wu declared a snow emergency in effect from 2pm on Sunday, with public schools and city offices to be closed on Monday.
“Boston is looking to face down yet another winter storm this season and one that is looking like it will be of historic proportions,” Wu said at a press conference on Sunday morning.

100+ West Bank Palestinians detained since start of Ramadan

In a statement released Sunday, PPS said the latest wave of detentions spans most West Bank governorates, with al-Quds among the most affected, where raids have frequently ended in the forcible expulsion of worshipers from Al-Aqsa Mosque, Al-Mayadeen reported.
The group noted that Israeli authorities had themselves announced an acceleration in detention operations at the start of Ramadan, with recent settler attacks providing political cover for the expanded campaign.
Since the beginning of "Israel's" war on Gaza in October 2023, approximately 22,000 Palestinians have been detained across the West Bank, PPS said. A figure that reflects one of the most sustained and historically consistent policies of collective repression carried out against Palestinian civilians.
The statement detailed a recurring pattern of violations accompanying detentions, including severe beatings, organized violence against detainees and their families, vandalism and destruction of homes, theft of vehicles, cash, and jewelry, demolition of prisoners' family homes, and the use of detainees as human shields.
The Prisoners' Society also flagged the conduct of field interrogations, stressing that the abuse inflicted during these sessions is "no less severe" than that which accompanies formal detention.
The group further condemned the use of detention campaigns as a tool to advance Israeli settlement expansion in the West Bank, with settlers serving as enforcers of a new territorial reality, particularly in the wake of moves toward formal annexation.
These conditions align with broader documentation by human rights organizations. B'Tselem and Physicians for Human Rights–Israel have reported catastrophic conditions inside Israeli detention facilities, including systematic torture, malnutrition, denial of medical care, and the deaths of at least 75 to 98 Palestinians in Israeli custody since October 2023.
As of early 2026, roughly 7,400 West Bank Palestinians are held in Israeli prisons and detention centers, with around 3,500 held under administrative detention, meaning without charge or trial.

Sudan slams Uganda for hosting RSF's Daglo amid war

Sudan slams Uganda for hosting RSF's Daglo amid war
Sudan's army-aligned government on Sunday criticised Kampala for hosting rival paramilitary chief Mohamed Hamdan Daglo, slamming his reception by Uganda's president as an "affront to humanity".
Since April 2023, the Sudanese military, led by army chief Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, has been at war with the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces, commanded by Burhan's former deputy, commonly known as Hemeti.
Hemeti on Friday met with Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni at Entebbe's State House, a day after a United Nations probe found his forces had committed acts of genocide in Darfur.
Sudan's foreign ministry on Sunday criticised the meeting, saying the RSF's atrocities had been "documented by the international community and condemned by regional organisations of which Uganda is a member", including the African Union and the Intergovernmental Authority on Development (IGAD).
Daglo, speaking during his visit, said he travelled to Uganda after President Museveni was approached by the Sudanese army seeking his mediation.
His visit came a week after Museveni hosted Malik Agar, Burhan's deputy in his ruling Transitional Sovereignty Council.
Addressing supporters on Friday, Daglo called for Africa-led mediation.
"From the first day of the war, we said negotiations must be African. Peace should be made in Africa: IGAD and the African Union," he told the gathering.
Efforts to secure a ceasefire have repeatedly collapsed.
In January, Sudan's army was studying a new proposal from the United States and Saudi Arabia.
Talks mediated by the Quad - comprising the US, the United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia and Egypt - have stalled for months, with Burhan alleging the group favours the UAE, which is accused of arming the RSF. Abu Dhabi denies backing the paramilitary.
Friday's meeting was the RSF commander's second with Museveni. His first in December 2023 came during a regional tour, when analysts said Hemeti attempted to rally legitimacy with African leaders.
He has since declared a rival administration in Darfur, which has received no international recognition.
In his speech on Friday, Daglo described the conflict as an "existential war" and vowed victory.
He said his forces would have already captured the capital Khartoum and Port Sudan on the Red Sea "if it weren't for drones from neighbouring countries", after reports of Egyptian and Turkish strikes on his supply lines into Darfur.
On the other side of the country, Daglo assured his supporters their "brothers were moving well in the Blue Nile", where fighting on the border with Ethiopia has raised concerns of a new front opening.
He also claimed his forces had swelled from 160,000 at the start of the war to half a million.
Since April 2023, the war has killed tens of thousands, displaced over 11 million people and created the world's largest hunger and displacement crises.

Jonathan Greenblatt on the ADL's role, criticism, and combating Jew hatred

In a world where rising antisemitism and hatred have dominated news cycles, Jonathan Greenblatt, the CEO of the Anti-Defamation League (ADL), sheds light on the organization’s role in combating hate and fostering Jewish identity. Speaking with Shifra Jacobs, Greenblatt highlighted the increasing threats to Jewish safety, the responsibility of Jewish institutions to protect and promote thriving communities, and the need to adapt to a rapidly changing world.
Rising antisemitism
Greenblatt acknowledges the surge in antisemitic incidents in recent years. He explains that despite the successes of Jewish communities, the rise in hate crimes and discriminatory attitudes cannot be ignored. For example, antisemitic incidents have reached record highs. Greenblatt emphasizes that the ADL’s mission is clear: to protect Jewish people, advocate for their rights, and educate the public on issues related to extremism and hate. He asserts that Jewish safety and identity are not opposing forces but rather complementary issues that must be tackled simultaneously.
The ADL’s role
ADL’s approach is threefold: protection, advocacy, and education. Greenblatt details how the ADL works to protect Jews by responding to hate incidents, monitoring extremist activities, and training law enforcement on issues of extremism. Additionally, the ADL engages in political advocacy, legal action, and shareholder engagement to ensure that the rights of Jewish people are defended both in courts and boardrooms. Finally, the ADL educates the next generation by reaching millions of children annually, working to change hearts and minds through programs in schools, social media, and online platforms.
Antisemitism and Zionism
Addressing the growing global concern, Greenblatt shared alarming statistics about the increase in antsemitic attitudes worldwide. A global study conducted by ADL showed that nearly 46% of adults across 103 countries harbor anti-Semitic beliefs. The conversation delved into the complex relationship between antisemitism, anti-Zionism, and the perception of Jews globally. Greenblatt made it clear that antisemitism is not only rooted in religious or racial discrimination but also in political ideologies. He described how anti-Zionism has morphed into a form of political hate, often leading to the propagation of harmful stereotypes and blood libels.
The impact of October 7
A particularly poignant moment in the discussion was the reflection on the events of October 7. Greenblatt expressed deep sorrow for the losses suffered by both Jews and Palestinians, underscoring the complexity of the situation. While he supported Israel's right to defend itself, he also called for a peaceful resolution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict that respects the dignity and equality of Palestinians. Greenblatt’s Zionism, he noted, is rooted in humanism, and he continues to advocate for a peaceful future for both Israelis and Palestinians.

Average of five Palestinians killed by Israel every day in Gaza since ceasefire
The Gaza Centre for Human Rights said on Sunday that 642 Palestinians have been killed since a ceasefire agreement was reached in Gaza in October 2025, accusing Israel of continuing to violate the deal on a daily basis.
In a statement, the centre said the average number of people killed since the agreement stands at nearly five per day.
The victims include 197 children, 85 women and 22 elderly people, representing 47.2 percent of the total fatalities.
It added that 1,643 people have been wounded, at a daily average of approximately 12.3 injuries, including 504 children, 330 women and 89 elderly people, accounting for 56.1 percent of those injured.
The organisation said that cumulative data over the 133 days since the ceasefire was reached shows that Israeli forces have committed an average of 13.5 violations per day.
It said that Israel's actions were "emptying the agreement of its substance and turning it into cover for the continuation of aggression".
The centre said the figures reflect "a repeated pattern of targeting protected groups under international humanitarian law, particularly children and women", which it said amounted to serious violations of the Geneva Conventions and international law.
Violations are not limited to daily killings and bombardment but also include Israel’s failure to allow in 600 aid trucks per day as stipulated in the agreement, including 50 fuel trucks. These represent the minimum needs of the population of the Gaza Strip.
The centre said only 43 percent of the agreed number of trucks have been allowed to enter, while fuel deliveries have not exceeded 15 percent of the stipulated amount, leading to paralysis of basic services and delays in infrastructure repair.
It also cited the continued and arbitrary disruption of travel through the Rafah crossing. According to the centre, Israel has only allowed 40.3 percent of the agreed number of travellers through the crossing, in what it described as "a clear violation of freedom of movement and contractual obligations" under the ceasefire deal.
“All these data indicate that Israel continues to commit acts of genocide against the population of the Gaza Strip in multiple forms”, the centre said.
It said these actions are taking place "in a context devoid of any hostilities that could justify, even formally, these unilateral attacks".
The centre warned that the situation is unfolding amid what it called "troubling" international silence, entrenching a climate of impunity and sending the message that crimes can continue without accountability.
It also expressed concern over the absence of effective positions or interventions from transitional bodies established to manage Gaza in the current phase, including President Donald Trump's "Board of Peace" the associated National Committee for the Administration, saying this deepens the vacuum and leaves civilians without real protection.
The Gaza Centre for Human Rights called on the international community and the guarantors of the agreement to act urgently to halt violations, ensure compliance with international humanitarian law and open independent international investigations as a prelude to prosecuting those responsible before international courts.
It added that Israeli forces continue to target Palestinians in Gaza daily under various pretexts, including claims of threats to troops near the so-called yellow line, long-distance fire and drone strikes.

Huckabee's remarks on Israel and Middle East were taken out of context, embassy says

U.S ambassador's comments on Israel and the Middle East were taken out of context, embassy says
An uproar continued Sunday after the U.S. ambassador to Israel, Mike Huckabee, said Israel has a right to much of the Middle East, as more Arab and Muslim countries objected and the U.S. said his comments were taken out of context.
Huckabee spoke in an interview with conservative commentator Tucker Carlson that aired Friday. Carlson said that according to the Bible, the descendants of Abraham would receive land that today would include essentially the entire Middle East, including parts of modern-day Jordan, Syria, Iraq and Lebanon. He quoted from Genesis Chapter 15 and asked Huckabee if Israel had a right to that land.
Huckabee responded: "It would be fine if they took it all."
A spokesperson for the U.S. Embassy said Sunday that Huckabee's comments were taken out of context and that there is no change to U.S. policies on Israel.
In the interview, Huckabee added: "They're not asking to go back and take all of that, but they are asking to at least take the land that they now occupy, they now live in, they now own legitimately, and it is a safe haven for them." He added that Israel isn't trying to take over Jordan, Lebanon, Syria, or Iraq but is trying to protect its own people.
A joint statement Sunday by Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Jordan, Bahrain, United Arab Emirates, Qatar, Indonesia, Pakistan, Turkey, Syria, Kuwait, Lebanon, Oman, the Palestinian territories and several Arab governing bodies called Huckabee's remarks "dangerous and inflammatory" and ones that endanger the region's stability.
"These statements directly contradict the vision put forward by U.S. President Donald J. Trump … based on containing escalation and creating a political horizon for a comprehensive settlement that ensures the Palestinian people have their own independent state," the statement said.
During the six-day 1967 Mideast war, Israel captured the West Bank and east Jerusalem from Jordan, Gaza and the Sinai Peninsula from Egypt and the Golan Heights from Syria. Israel withdrew from the Sinai Peninsula as part of a peace deal with Egypt following the 1973 Mideast war. It also unilaterally withdrew from Gaza in 2005. Since the ceasefire with Hamas began in October, after two years of fighting, Israel's military controls most of Gaza's eastern half.
Israel has attempted to deepen control of the occupied West Bank in recent months. It has greatly expanded construction in Jewish settlements, legalized outposts and made significant bureaucratic changes to its policies in the territory. Trump has said he will not allow Israel to annex the West Bank and has offered strong assurances that he'd block any move to do so.
Huckabee, an evangelical Christian and strong supporter of Israel and the West Bank settlement movement, has long opposed the idea of a two-state solution for Israel and the Palestinian people.

UK protection officers instructed to guard 2010 Epstein dinner party, reports say
UK media cited emails from the Epstein files that appear to detail plans for Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor to stay with the late sex offender
London police officers assigned to King Charles’ younger brother Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor were instructed to provide security for a dinner party at Jeffrey Epstein’s New York home in 2010, British media reported on Sunday.
The Sunday Times, which first reported the story, cited emails from the Epstein files that appear to detail arrangements for Mountbatten-Windsor to stay with the late convicted sex offender in December 2010, along with his two protection officers from London’s Metropolitan Police force.
In an email sent the night before the event with the subject line “Security for party”, a staff member informed Epstein the two officers had been given “instructions on the door”.
The reports come after police said on Friday they were contacting former protection officers who worked for Mountbatten-Windsor, urging anyone with allegations of sex offences relating to Epstein to come forward.
Police said they have not identified any wrongdoing by the protection officers at this stage. Asked to respond to Sunday’s reports, the Metropolitan Police said it had no further comment.
Mountbatten-Windsor was arrested on Thursday on suspicion of misconduct in public office in a separate investigation and was released under investigation after being held by another police force, Thames Valley, for more than 10 hours.

Police kill armed man attempting to enter Trump’s Mar-a-Lago, officials say

US Secret Service and local police shot and killed a man armed with a shotgun early on Sunday after he breached a secure perimeter at President Donald Trump's Mar-a-Lago resort in Palm Beach, Florida, law enforcement officials said.
Trump, who is currently in Washington, was not at the social club at the time. The incident occurred at a time when the United States is facing a spike in political violence. In 2024, a gunman's bullet grazed Trump's ear during a campaign rally in Pennsylvania, and a man later convicted of attempted assassination was spotted hiding in the bushes of a Florida golf course with a semi-automatic rifle while Trump was on the course.
The man in Sunday's incident, who appeared to be in his early 20s, was carrying a shotgun and a fuel can, the US.
Secret Service said, adding that he was observed at the resort's north gate around 1:30 a.m. EST (0630 GMT).
Two US Secret Service agents and a Palm Beach County Sheriff's deputy confronted the man and ordered him to drop the two items, Palm Beach County Sheriff Ric Bradshaw said at a press conference on Sunday morning.
The man put down the gas canister and raised the shotgun "to a shooting position," prompting law enforcement to open fire, Bradshaw said.
The man was declared dead at the scene. No law enforcement officers were injured.
White House spokesperson Karoline Leavitt said the Secret Service "acted quickly and decisively to neutralise a crazy person, armed with a gun and a gas canister, who intruded President Trump's home."
FBI probes motive
Law enforcement officials did not reveal any information about the motive for the incident. The FBI has taken over the investigation and is collecting evidence from the scene, officials said.
FBI Director Kash Patel said in a social media post that the agency is "dedicating all necessary resources" to the investigation.
Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said he spoke with Trump after the incident. Bessent thanked the Secret Service for protecting the president and his family.
"We don't know whether this person was a mastermind, unhinged or what," Bessent said on the Fox News program "Sunday Morning Futures with Maria Bartiromo."
In 2024, Trump faced two assassination attempts, including one at his golf course in West Palm Beach. The perpetrator of that incident was sentenced to life in prison this month.
Melissa Hortman, a Democratic state lawmaker in Minnesota, was shot and killed in June 2025 along with her husband. Months later, conservative activist Charlie Kirk was also assassinated.

Transcript: Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi on "Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan," Feb. 22, 2026
The following is the transcript of the interview with Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi that aired on "Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan" on Feb. 22, 2026.
MARGARET BRENNAN: We turn now to the escalating tensions between the U.S. and Iran. The U.S. has assembled what is, by some measures, the biggest military buildup in the region since the 2003 invasion of Iraq, as the world's largest warship also heads towards the region. But President Trump has said he'd prefer a diplomatic deal with Iran. For the latest, we go now to Tehran and the Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi. Welcome to 'Face The Nation.'
FOREIGN MINISTER ABBAS ARAGHCHI: Well, thank you, Margaret. Thank you so much for having me this evening.
MARGARET BRENNAN: So do you believe President Trump plans to strike Iran, or is he using this threat as leverage?
MINISTER ARAGHCHI: Well, I'm not- I cannot judge. But one fact is there that if they want to find a resolution for Iran's peaceful nuclear program, the only way is diplomacy. And we have proved this in the past, and I believe that still, there is a good chance to have a diplomatic solution which is based on a win-win game, and a solution is at our reach. So there is no need for any military buildup. And military buildup cannot help it, and cannot pressurize us.
MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, you said on Friday that you would have a draft proposal within two to three days. Have you gotten the supreme leader to sign off on that proposal yet? And if so, when will you give it to envoy Steve Witkoff?
MINISTER ARAGHCHI: Well, we are still working on that, and we are trying to make it something which consists of elements which can accommodate both sides' concerns and interests, and we are working on those elements. And I believe that when we meet, probably this Thursday, in Geneva again, we can work on those elements and prepare a good text and come to a fast deal. This is my understanding. I see it quite possible.
MARGARET BRENNAN: So you have confirmed a meeting with Steve Witkoff Thursday in Geneva, but your leadership has still not signed off on the proposal. Is that right?
MINISTER ARAGHCHI: But these are two separate things. Of course, we continue our negotiation. At the same time we are working on it- on- on- on on the elements of a deal, and draft of the text. So I hope that when we get there, we are prepared to talk and negotiate on those drafts.
MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, let me ask you this. You helped negotiate that 2015 nuclear deal under the Obama administration. How would this deal with Trump be different than that one?
MINISTER ARAGHCHI: Well, 10 years have passed, and there is a new situation. Our nuclear program has advanced, technologically more advanced at that time, and there are, of course, more sanctions and more pressures. So I believe that a better deal than JCPOA or 2015 nuclear deal is possible. And there are elements that are- could be much better than the previous deal. So--
MARGARET BRENNAN: --Like what?
MINISTER ARACHI: I have the experience- I have the experience of that- that deal, as you said, I negotiated that deal. We went into so many details, but I think right now, there is no need for that much details. We can agree on basic things, and we can make sure that Iran's program, nuclear program, is peaceful and will remain peaceful forever, and at the same- same time, more sanctions would be lifted.
MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, just very quickly you're talking about nuclear, you are offering a nuclear only deal at this stage? Because Secretary Rubio said anything meaningful would also have to involve ballistic missiles and your support for proxies in the region.
MINISTER ARAGHCHI: Right now, we are negotiating only nuclear and there is no other subject.
MARGARET BRENNAN: Okay. Would you be willing to allow weapons inspectors unfettered access to your nuclear sites and for American inspectors to be among them?
MINISTER ARAGHCHI: Well, we are a committed member of NPT, Non-Proliferation Treaty, and we have a safeguard agreement with the agency, International Atomic Energy Agency, and we are ready to- to cooperate with the agency in full, according to the, you know, safeguard and we may accept, in certain conditions, the additional protocol to the safeguard, to the NPT. And I think a full verification mechanism, full monitoring mechanism, is acceptable and can be in place.
MARGARET BRENNAN: Okay, so you continue to say that your nuclear program is peaceful. And you know, there are a lot of skeptics around the world, including in the United States Congress. There is pressure on President Trump from within his own party. There were 52 Republican senators, 177 House Republicans who have called on President Trump to demand zero enrichment and full dismantlement of your nuclear program. Why should President Trump consider allowing Iran to have even the smallest bit of enrichment?
MINISTER ARAGHCHI: Well, first of all, enrichment is our right. We are a member of NPT, and we have every right to enjoy a peaceful nuclear energy, including enrichment. How we use this- this right is something you know related to us only. The enrichment is a sensitive part of our negotiation. The American team know about- they know our position, we know their position, and we have already exchanged our concerns, and I think a solution is achievable, but I'm not going to negotiate through media.
MARGARET BRENNAN: No, I understand, but we have seen very public statements from the president that he said no enrichment, and that's a red line. But when you say it's your right, okay, but you could get enriched uranium and buy it from someplace else. You know this. You've done this. Is demanding the right to enrich on Iranian soil really worth the risk right now? You're facing a potential destruction of your country and the regime based on the kind of military buildup we're looking at.
MINISTER ARAGHCHI: Well, I think, as a sovereign country, we have every right to decide for ourselves, by ourselves. We have developed this technology by ourselves, by our scientists, and it's very dear to us, because we have paid a lot- we have paid a huge expense for that. We have been on the sanctions for- for at least 20 years and we have lost our scientists, and we have- we have had a war because of that. So that is now a matter of dignity and pride for Iranians, and we are not going to give it up. There is no legal reason to do that, while everything is peaceful, while everything is safeguarded by the agency, while we had an agreement in the past when we were- we remain fully committed to that, and you know, it was the U.S. who just withdrew with no justification. So we are a committed member of NPT. We want to use our right. We want to have our right and to exercise that.
MARGARET BRENNAN: But you understand this could be make it or break it for you here. I mean, look, your air defenses were largely demolished by Israel this past summer. They dominate your military. They killed the leader of your most powerful proxy in Hezbollah the United States bombed your underground nuclear facilities. Your economy is in shambles right now. So why do you think the regime could even survive unless you give this up?
MINISTER ARAGHCHI: Well, that is not the case when you talked about the air defense and the war we had with Israel. You know, yes, we had problem with our air defense, but Israelis had also problem with their air defense and our missile- missiles were able to hit targets inside Israel. So it's- so you know, they started the war, but after 12 days, they asked for a cease fire, unconditional cease fire. Why? Because they couldn't defend themselves against our missiles. So we have a very good capability of missiles, and now we are even in a better situation than previous war. So as a matter of fact, we are in a powerful position to defend ourselves. We know how to defend ourselves. We did it in the- in 12 day war, and we are fully prepared to repeat that, if necessary.
MARGARET BRENNAN: Respectfully, Israel has air superiority over Iran. But let's talk about what you're- you are saying in terms of your--
MINISTER ARAGHCHI: --no, our missiles- our missiles have also- our missiles have also superiority over the space of Israel. They can hit their targets. They hit their targets in a very exact way, and they can do it again.
MARGARET BRENNAN: Okay. Well, there are 40,000 American personnel in the Middle East right now, in Iran's letter to the U.N. Security Council, you seem to threaten them, because you said America will bear full responsibility. You said you don't want war. But if that's what happens, all bases, facilities and assets of the hostile force in the region will be legitimate targets. Are you saying Iran will hit U.S. bases in the Gulf, or will you also bomb the Gulf countries that are your neighbors?
MINISTER ARAGHCHI: Well, I'm not going to say what we are going to do exactly. Obviously, we defend ourselves. If the U.S. attack- attacks us, then we have every right to defend ourselves. If the U.S. attacks us that is the act of aggression. What we do in response is the act of self defense. So- and it is justifiable and legitimate. So our missiles cannot hit the American soil. So obviously we have to do something else. We have to hit, you know, the Americans' base in the region. That- that is- that is a fact. I am a diplomat. I'm not supposed to talk about, you know, our military plans, but what can I say is that why we should go for war when there is every possibility for a peaceful solution?
MARGARET BRENNAN: Mr. Foreign Minister, I have more questions for you, but I am out of time here. We are going to watch this diplomacy very carefully to see what happens in the coming days. Thank you for joining us. We'll be right back--
MINISTER ARAGHCHI: Thank you, thank you--
MARGARET BRENNAN: --with a lot more 'Face the Nation.' Stay with us.

USA win men’s Olympic ice hockey gold

Team USA claimed the Olympic men’s ice hockey title on Sunday with a 2-1 overtime victory over Canada in Milan, sealing the country’s first gold medal in the event since 1980.
Jack Hughes scored the decisive goal 1:41 into sudden death overtime. Zach Werenski carried the puck out of defence and fed Hughes, who beat Canada goaltender Jordan Binnington from close range to end the contest.
The United States last won Olympic gold in men’s hockey at Lake Placid in 1980.
“I love the USA, I love my teammates – it’s unbelievable,” Jack Hughes told NBC after the match. “The USA hockey brotherhood means so much.”
The final drew a full crowd at the Milano Santagiulia arena and followed a tense 60 minutes of regulation play. Matt Boldy gave the United States a first period lead with a solo effort past two defenders. Canada levelled late in the second period through Cale Makar.
Canada outshot the United States 41-26 over regulation and overtime. Connor Hellebuyck, the American goalkeeper, made 41 saves and kept his side in the match during extended pressure in the third period.
“He was our best player tonight by a mile,” Hughes told NBC.
The game moved to three on three overtime under Olympic rules. There is no shootout in a gold medal match. The first goal ended the contest.
Canada pressed for long spells in the third period. Nathan MacKinnon missed an open net from a tight angle. Macklin Celebrini and Connor McDavid also saw chances denied by Hellebuyck. Canada played without captain Sidney Crosby, who missed the final with a leg injury.
At the final horn, American players threw gloves and sticks into the air. The team later skated with a number 13 jersey in tribute to Johnny Gaudreau, who died in 2024. His family attended the match in Milan, according to CNN.
President Donald Trump congratulated the team on his Truth Social account. “Congratulations to our great U.S.A. Ice Hockey team. THEY WON THE GOLD. WOW!” he wrote.
Earlier in the tournament, the American women defeated Canada 2-1 in overtime to win gold, marking the first time both national teams won titles at the same Winter Games.
Hughes finished the tournament with four goals and three assists. Hellebuyck was named best goaltender of the competition, according to official tournament honours released on Sunday.
During the medal ceremony, the United States stood on the top step while Canada received silver and Finland bronze. The American national anthem played inside the arena as players posed for photographs with their medals.
The result ended a 46-year wait for Olympic gold in men’s hockey and closed the Winter Games in Milan Cortina with one of the tournament’s most watched events.

Pakistan claims to have killed 70 militants during Afghanistan border strike
The Afghan Defence Ministry condemned the strikes as a violation of Afghanistan’s airspace and sovereignty
- Bookmark
- CommentsGo to comments
Pakistan’s military launched strikes along the border with Afghanistan early on Sunday, claiming to have killed at least 70 militants in what it described as targeted operations against hideouts of Pakistani militants responsible for recent attacks within the country. However, Kabul swiftly rejected these claims, reporting civilian casualties.
Talal Chaudhry, Pakistan’s deputy interior minister, stated in an interview with Geo News that at least 70 militants had been killed, though he offered no immediate evidence. Pakistan’s state-run media later revised this figure upwards to 80 fatalities.
In stark contrast, the Afghan Defence Ministry issued a statement asserting that "various civilian areas" in the eastern Afghan provinces of Nangarhar and Paktika had been hit, including a religious madrassa and multiple homes. The ministry condemned the strikes as a violation of Afghanistan’s airspace and sovereignty. Afghan government spokesperson Zabihullah Mujahid posted on X that the attacks "killed and wounded dozens, including women and children," dismissing Pakistan’s claim of 70 militant deaths as "inaccurate." Mawlawi Fazl Rahman Fayyaz, the provincial director of the Afghan Red Crescent Society in Nangarhar, reported 18 people killed and several wounded.
Afghanistan’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs summoned Pakistan’s ambassador to Kabul to formally protest the strikes. In a statement, the ministry declared that protecting Afghanistan’s territory is the Islamic Emirate’s "Sharia responsibility" and warned that Pakistan would be held accountable for the consequences of such actions.
On Sunday, villagers in Nangarhar were seen clearing rubble, while mourners prepared for funerals. Habib Ullah, a local tribal elder, insisted that those killed were not militants. "They were poor people who suffered greatly. Those killed were neither (the) Taliban, nor military personnel, nor members of the former government. They lived simple village lives," he told The Associated Press.
Pakistan’s Information Minister Attaullah Tarar stated on X that the military conducted "intelligence-based, selective operations" against seven camps belonging to the Pakistani Taliban (TTP) and its affiliates, adding that an affiliate of the Islamic State group was also targeted. Mr Tarar affirmed that Pakistan "has always strived to maintain peace and stability in the region," but underscored that the safety and security of Pakistani citizens remained a paramount priority.
Militant violence has seen a significant surge in Pakistan in recent years, with much of it attributed to the TTP and outlawed Baloch separatist groups. The TTP, while separate, is closely allied with Afghanistan’s Taliban. Islamabad accuses the TTP of operating from within Afghanistan, a charge both the group and Kabul deny.
The Pakistani strikes followed a suicide bombing just hours earlier, which targeted a security convoy in the border district of Bannu in Pakistan’s northwest, killing two soldiers, including a lieutenant colonel. Pakistan’s military had warned after the attack that it would not "exercise any restraint" and would press on with operations against those responsible. Last week, another suicide bomber, supported by gunmen, rammed an explosives-laden vehicle into a security post in Bajaur district, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, killing 11 soldiers and a child. Pakistani authorities later identified the attacker as an Afghan national.
Mr Tarar asserted that Pakistan possessed "conclusive evidence" that recent attacks, including a suicide bombing at a Shiite mosque in Islamabad that killed 31 worshippers earlier this month, were carried out by militants acting on the "behest of their Afghanistan-based leadership and handlers." He claimed Pakistan had repeatedly urged Afghanistan’s Taliban rulers to take verifiable steps to prevent militant groups from using Afghan territory to launch attacks in Pakistan, but alleged that no substantive action had been taken. Mr Tarar also called on the international community to pressure Afghanistan’s Taliban authorities to uphold their commitments under the Doha agreement not to allow their soil to be used against other countries.
In Islamabad, security analyst Abdullah Khan suggested that the Pakistani strikes indicate that Qatari, Turkish, and even Saudi-led mediations have failed to resolve tensions between Pakistan and Afghanistan. "These strikes are likely to further escalate the situation," he warned.
A Qatari-mediated ceasefire between the two countries was established after deadly border clashes in October, which resulted in dozens of casualties among soldiers, civilians, and suspected militants. That violence followed explosions in Kabul that Afghan officials blamed on Pakistan, prompting Islamabad to conduct strikes deep inside Afghanistan targeting militant hideouts. While the truce between Islamabad and Kabul has largely held, several rounds of talks in Istanbul in November failed to yield a formal agreement, leaving relations strained.

Greenland doesn’t need Trump’s hospital boat - we have free healthcare, says prime minister

Greenland doesn’t need Trump’s hospital boat - we have free healthcare, says prime minister
‘President Trump’s idea to send a U.S. hospital ship here to Greenland has been duly noted. But we have a public health system where care is free for citizens’
- Bookmark
- CommentsGo to comments
President Donald Trump’s plan to send a U.S. hospital boat to Greenland has been politely declined by leaders in region - who noted that they have “free and equal access to health for all.”
With little explanation, Trump said he would send the vessel in a Truth Social post Saturday. “Working with the fantastic Governor of Louisiana, Jeff Landry, we are going to send a great hospital boat to Greenland to take care of the many people who are sick, and not being taken care of there. It’s on the way!!!” the president wrote.
Trump has repeatedly expressed interest in the U.S. acquiring Greenland, vowing to take over the Danish territory “one way or the other” — which Danish and Greenland officials have vehemently rejected.
His offer of a hospital boat was also quickly rejected by officials in both Greenland and Denmark. “That will be a ‘no thanks’ from us,” Greenland’s Prime Minister, Jens-Frederik Nielsen, wrote on Facebook Sunday. “President Trump’s idea to send a U.S. hospital ship here to Greenland has been duly noted. But we have a public health system where care is free for citizens.”
“Happy to live in a country where there is free and equal access to health for all. Where it’s not insurances and wealth that determine whether you get proper treatment. You have the same approach in Greenland. Happy Sunday to you all,” Mette Frederiksen, the Danish prime minister, also wrote.
Danish Defense Minister Troels Lund Poulsen also responded to Trump’s claim that the people of Greenland were being denied medical care.
“The Greenlandic population receives the healthcare it needs,” he told the Danish broadcaster DR, according to the Guardian. “They receive it either in Greenland or, if they require specialized treatment, they receive it in Denmark. So it’s not as if there’s a need for a special healthcare initiative in Greenland.”
“Trump is constantly tweeting about Greenland. So this is undoubtedly an expression of the new normal that has taken hold in international politics,” Lund Poulsen added.
The president’s post Saturday did not specify why a hospital boat was needed or which boat would be sent. However, the post included an illustration of the USNS Mercy, one of two hospital ships operated by the U.S. Navy.
The USNS Mercy and its sister vessel, the USNS Comfort, are moored in Mobile, Alabama, according to naval trackers.
The Independent has requested more information from the White House, the Department of Defense and Gov Landry’s office.
The announcement was made hours after Denmark’s Joint Arctic Command evacuated a crew member from a U.S. submarine in Greenlandic waters, according to Reuters. The crew member required urgent medical attention, authorities said.
The U.S. Navy sailor was medically evacuated from a nuclear-powered submarine that broke from its mission and resurfaced about eight miles from Nuuk, Greenland.
Landry re-shared Trump’s announcement on X, writing: “Thank you, President @realDonaldTrump! Proud to work with you on this important issue!”
Trump has repeatedly argued the U.S. must acquire Greenland, which is an autonomous territory of Denmark, for national security purposes, even as Greenlandic officials maintain the island is not for sale.
Late last month, Trump announced the “framework of a future deal” on Greenland.
“Based upon a very productive meeting that I have had with the Secretary General of NATO, Mark Rutte, we have formed the framework of a future deal with respect to Greenland and, in fact, the entire Arctic Region,” he wrote on Truth Social.
Trump’s aggressive push to take over Greenland appears to be unpopular among many Americans. An AP-NORC poll from earlier this month found that 72 percent of U.S. adults disapprove of the way Trump is handling Greenland, while just 24 percent approve.

Khamenei's desperate gamble
Unknown
Unknown Publisher
2026-02-22
17:01:43 UTC
02:01:43 KST

Reinstating officials who were previously pushed aside is a classic hallmark of weakness in authoritarian regimes. That pattern now seems visible in Tehran. Khamenei, who has held ultimate authority for 37 years, has long balanced rival political factions without allowing any genuine independence. Over time, however, his tight grip and refusal to inject new blood into the system have contributed to deep public resentment, evident in repeated waves of nationwide protests against his rule and the regime's harsh repression.
According to recent reports, Khamenei has appointed Ali Larijani as secretary of the National Security Council, reviving a body that operated during the 1980-1988 Iran-Iraq War and oversaw the war effort. At the time, the council was headed by Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani, then considered Iran's No. 2 under Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini. By restoring the council and placing Larijani at its helm, Khamenei has effectively elevated him to a similar rank beneath the supreme leader.
After Khomeini's death in 1989, Khamenei gradually sidelined the founder's close associates and replaced them with his own loyalists, many drawn from the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps. The Guards, tasked with safeguarding the regime, have shown little hesitation in using force to maintain stability, whether through violent crackdowns at home or terrorist attacks against Jewish and Western targets abroad.
From religious aristocracy to the leader's inner circle
Ali Larijani hails from a powerful clerical family long embedded in the Islamic Republic's elite. His father was close to Khamenei, helping pave the way for his sons' ascent.
One brother, Mohammad Javad Larijani, is regarded as one of the architects of Iran's nuclear program and is known for extreme views, including calls for Israel's destruction and the elimination of regime opponents.
Another brother, Sadeq Amoli Larijani, served as head of the judiciary and was once floated as a potential successor to Khamenei. His political fortunes declined, however, after allegations of financial corruption and a lavish lifestyle embarrassed the leadership. Although removed from key centers of power, he still chairs another largely symbolic council.
Like his brothers, Ali Larijani served in the early years of the revolution in the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, bringing him into close proximity with the leadership. At the time, Khamenei was serving as president and cultivating the Guards as a loyal power base.
Larijani later oversaw propaganda and public diplomacy for the Guards before becoming head of Iran's state broadcasting authority, which to this day provides a platform and support for the media arms of terrorist organizations such as Hamas and Hezbollah. Under his watch, the network helped amplify Islamist ideology far beyond the Middle East, including through foreign-language channels designed to spread the revolution's message worldwide. In that sense, he can be seen as one of the architects of the mass anti-Israel and antisemitic demonstrations now seen in Western capitals.
Forgiveness or desperation?
Domestically, Larijani used his positions to fortify the supreme leader's standing. Through both propaganda and direct action, he confronted reformists in the 1990s and 2000s. He later became secretary of the Supreme National Security Council under President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad but was dismissed amid deep policy disagreements. He subsequently moved into roles that answer directly to the supreme leader, including speaker of parliament and membership in key councils appointed by Khamenei that function as the real centers of power in Iran, in contrast to the president and his cabinet.
Despite his long record of loyalty, the Larijani brothers' names became entangled in major corruption scandals in recent years. They were gradually pushed aside and relegated to ceremonial positions. It also emerged that their children live in Western countries and hold American or Canadian citizenship, even as the family presided over a regime that leads crowds in chanting "Death to America."
In doing so, the aging Khamenei, now 87, may be prioritizing his grip on power over the long-term stability of the Islamic Republic itself. By bringing back seasoned enforcers and propagandists, he may secure short-term continuity. But it remains far from certain that such corrupt figures will uphold his legacy once he is gone.

Iranian students protest for second day at some universities
Sign up now: Get ST's newsletters delivered to your inbox
DUBAI, Feb 22 - Students held protests which led to clashes at several Iranian universities for a second day on Sunday, according to local news agencies and social media posts, with Iran facing a U.S. military buildup as it seeks to reach a nuclear deal with Washington.
The fresh unrest follows anti-government demonstrations last month in which thousands of people were killed in the worst domestic unrest since Iran's 1979 Islamic Revolution.
Iran's state TV carried videos of what it said were individuals "pretending to be students" attacking pro-government students in Tehran who were taking part in protests to condemn January's disturbances, with these individuals allegedly injuring students by throwing rocks.
Protests also took place at universities in Mashhad in the northeast, according to videos published by the U.S.-based rights group HRANA, which said the intervention of security forces in the protests led to injuries.
On Saturday a video purportedly showed rows of marchers at Tehran's Sharif University of Technology condemning Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei as a "murderous leader", and calling for Reza Pahlavi, the exiled son of Iran's toppled shah, to be a new monarch.
The recent protests, which started in December over economic hardships and quickly turned political, were repressed in the most violent crackdown since the 1979 Islamic Revolution. REUTERS

Amid growing speculation about US military action against Iran, Reuters reported that Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araqchi told CBS News' "Face the Nation" on Sunday that a diplomatic path remains viable – pointing to "a good chance" of resolution – with a Thursday encounter in Geneva alongside US envoy Steve Witkoff now viewed as likely.
The interview took place as US President Donald Trump weighs whether to authorize strikes on Iran, as the USS Gerald R. Ford, the largest aircraft carrier in the world, has reached the region amid heightened tensions. In Iran, protests against the regime continue at universities, with clashes between students and regime forces now underway at Khoja Nasir University.
Washington earlier said Iran must submit a serious proposal that meets the minimum threshold required for another round of negotiations. The expectation is that such a proposal will arrive within two days, and if it is deemed sufficient, a meeting will take place in Europe this weekend.

Israel Hayom reported on the Iranian message to the American team of Steve Witkoff and Charles Kushner, which included an update on an additional proposal taking shape in Tehran. According to an American source, the US response was a demand for the proposal to be detailed and expanded to cover the other issues on the table – primarily ballistic missiles. The source says Iran is demanding in return an American proposal with a fast-track timeline for lifting sanctions. According to the source, there will be no response to that demand for as long as Iran does not significantly soften its positions.

The Syrian oil sector's year zero

Nasser Al-Khallaf stood in front of the destroyed control panel he had once used to monitor the turbines at the Al-Omar oil field. After spending 10 years away from the site in the remote desert reaches of Deir Ezzor province, in southeastern Syria, the electrical engineer, who was born in the region, returned to the position he held from 2008 to 2015. But his task was now limited to assessing the damage sustained by the facilities over 14 years of civil war, from 2011 to 2024.
Employees of the oil company Al-Furat, a joint venture between a public entity and foreign private companies, including Shell, returned to the site after the new Syrian authorities retook the oil field from the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF, dominated by the Kurds) on January 18. The Islamic State (IS) group had driven them out in August 2015, and they were relocated to the Al-Taym site, on the other bank of the Euphrates, which remains in the hands of the Damascus regime. "The [international anti-IS] coalition bombed the gas collectors and every place where IS was present," the engineer lamented.
The damage continued under the SDF, who, along with the international coalition, took control of the Al-Omar oil field at the end of 2017. The new rulers of the site restarted oil production, making do with what they had. "The SDF allocated the wells to tribes so that they could operate them and give the money back to the SDF. The oil was sold without any processing. The SDF let them tinker with the facilities without respecting international standards," said Al-Khallaf.

Trump’s Push for Greenland
As Donald Trump threatens Greenland with a takeover, Al Jazeera speaks to people there about their concerns.
At the start of 2026, President Donald Trump caused an international uproar by aggressively pushing for the United States to take control of Greenland – a vast, icy and sparsely inhabited autonomous Danish Arctic territory – arguing its strategic military importance and mineral resources made it essential for national security.
As Danish and Greenlandic leaders pushed back, Trump increased his rhetoric, threatening European countries that had sent a small number of troops to the island with economic tariffs.
Al Jazeera was there every step of the way; we followed the political drama that created rifts in transatlantic relations, called into question the future of modern military alliances, and saw how the threats impacted the local Inuit population, who live on the edge of the icecap.

Tucker Carlson issues apology to Herzog over Epstein allegations

Far Right pundit Tucker Carlson issued a formal apology to President Isaac Herzog, retracting statements that he had ties to late sex offender and financier Jeffrey Epstein, in an interview with US Ambassador to Israel Mike Huckabee, via a post on X/Twitter.
The President's Office issued a letter to Carlson, entirely denying any direct or indirect contact between Herzog and Epstein, which Carlson stated triggered the apology.
Carlson clarified that his claims that Herzog had connections to Epstein were unfounded and that he "didn't mean to suggest" he had any factual knowledge of such a relationship between the two.
"There is nothing worse than impugning the reputation of an innocent man... I’m sorry to imply that I knew something I didn’t know." Carlson said in the video.
Carlson apologizes to Herzog for falsely claiming that he knew Epstein
Carlson’s assertion was reportedly based on a 2014 email released by the US Justice Department as part of the broader investigation into Epstein's activities and relationships.
The email in question was sent by Epstein to billionaire Leon Black's secretary, in which Epstein purportedly claimed that Herzog, then the leader of Israel's Labor Party and the parliamentary opposition, would be a guest at his private residence.
In his apology on X/Twitter, Carlson admitted he relied on this document as evidence of a visit without independent verification, stating he "didn't mean to suggest" he had factual knowledge of Herzog’s presence on the island.
Reviews of the released Epstein files indicated that Herzog’s name is found exclusively within forwarded news reports that were sent to Epstein’s inbox. No evidence has surfaced in flight logs, party guest lists, or personal correspondence of any relationship or meeting between the two men.
The denial also came in the wake of a debunked "photo" published by The Times and circulated on social media, purportedly showing Herzog with Epstein. Investigators confirmed the image was AI-generated.
Gabrielle Sivia Weiniger, the Australian-based journalist responsible for posting the AI image, issued a formal apology for her failure to verify the source of the image.
"I mistakenly posted a photo of President Herzog, without checking the source, and I am sorry for that," she wrote in a post on X.

Five Kurdish groups form political coalition to challenge Iran’s regime

Five Kurdish Iranian opposition groups have formed a coalition against the regime in Iran. The groups held a press conference, and photos from the event were shared on social media on Sunday.
This demonstrates that the cooperation between these groups has increased. They had previously formed a dialogue center to discuss collaboration efforts against the Islamic Republic regime. The increased unified struggle comes amid US-Iran tensions.
The groups involved in the coalition include the Democratic Party of Iranian Kurdistan (PDKI), the Kurdistan Free Life Party (PJAK), the Kurdistan Freedom Party (PAK), the Komala Party of Kurdistan (led by Reza Kaabi), and the Khabat Organization of Iranian Kurdistan.
Komala has three branches, with two more of those remaining unlisted. This is not a surprise, as the other two parts of Komala also did not participate in the dialogue center event.
Five group leaders at a press conference could be detected in the images in the reports about the increased cooperation efforts between the movements.
Kurdish leadership
The leadership included several well-known Kurdish Iranian leaders who have been in charge for many years. The head of PDKI, Mustafa Hijri, represented his group. Hijri is a notorious figure in Kurdish politics.
Of the five groups, one was represented at the meeting by a woman who was there on behalf of PJAK. PJAK is a Left-leaning group that often splits leadership roles between men and women and has a large number of female fighters among its ranks.
The four Kurdish male leaders all wore traditional Kurdish garb, including sashes as belts. Hussein Yazdanpanah, the head of PAK, wore green Kurdish clothing, seemingly the olive color one might find in military uniforms. Yazdanpanah has been a well-known figure in Kurdish circles. He and his group fought ISIS alongside the Peshmerga of the Kurdistan Regional Government in northern Iraq.
PAK held the front lines west of Kirkuk and in Bashiqa, overlooking the Nineveh Plains. Its fighters played a key role on their front lines, and also during the offensive to clear ISIS from the Nineveh Plains. They proved to be a disciplined fighting group back then, gaining valuable experience.
During that time in the war on ISIS, Yazdanpanah told The Jerusalem Post about the threat of the Iranian regime and also the threat of Iranian-backed militias in Iraq.
According to one site, Rohelat.Info, which is also on X/Twitter, the new grouping is called the Coalition of Political Forces of Iranian Kurdistan.
The same site had said a week ago that “the Iranian Kurdish political landscape is witnessing a significant structural evolution as major parties seek to transition from a consultative ‘dialogue center’ into a robust, unified cooperation platform.”
“This initiative aims to broaden the scope of collaboration, ensuring the parties can exert maximum influence and maintain operational readiness for any potential political shifts in Iranian Kurdistan (Eastern Kurdistan),” Rohelat.Info said.
The new coalition continues to build on this process, working toward political unity among Kurdish forces to enhance coordination. It supports democracy, justice, and the right to self-determination.
After months of negotiations, it was decided that this new coalition should and could be formed. It is important to keep in mind that protests occurred in late December and early January in the Islamic Republic. Tens of thousands of people were killed by Tehran, including many Kurds.
The new statement from the parties said they had set aside past differences and will work to coordinate political and media activities. A new charter has also been distributed. They want recognition of Kurdish self-determination. They will work with other oppressed nations. They also say they support democracy and a commitment to full equality between men and women.
Furthermore, the groups say they support democracy for Iran as a whole and cooperation with other opposition forces in particular. They expect a unified organization to handle external and international relations.
They also appear to assume that areas will be liberated, and their charter includes articles detailing how to organize and administer “liberated areas.”

OpenAI banned Canadian mass shooter for gun violence prompts before Tumbler Ridge attack - WSJ

OpenAI, the company that developed ChatGPT, suspended the account of Jesse Van Rootselaar, the woman who executed one of the deadliest mass shootings in Canada's history, after detecting she had used it to describe scenarios involving gun violence over the course of several days, the company told The Wall Street Journal on Saturday.
According to the report, OpenAI considered alerting law enforcement about her interactions with its ChatGPT chatbot, but ultimately decided not to after an internal debate with about a dozen staffers.
Van Rootselaar, who killed eight people before taking her own life in Tumbler Ridge, Canada, was banned from the platform after her interactions with the chatbot, but it was determined that her activity didn’t meet the criteria for reporting to law enforcement.
To do so, the company would have needed to detect a credible and imminent risk of serious physical harm to others, an OpenAI spokesperson told The WSJ.
According to OpenAI’s official usage policies, people can’t use their systems in a way that could compromise someone’s right to safety and security, with a specific paragraph banning actions that could lead to terrorism or violence, including hate-based violence, as well as weapons development, procurement, or use, including conventional weapons.
After Van Rootselaar was identified as the shooter, the company contacted the Royal Canadian Mounted Police and said that it was supporting the investigation. “Our thoughts are with everyone affected by the Tumbler Ridge tragedy,” the company said in a statement.
Canadian mass shooter's violent digital footprint
According to a report by The Guardian, Van Rootselaar’s digital footprint included using the gaming platform Roblox to create “a shooting simulator,” as well as Kiwi Farms, an online forum known for hosting discussions and organized harassment targeting various individuals and communities.
The simulator was set in a virtual shopping mall, where users could shoot characters and other players with weapons scattered around, 404 Media reported.
“We have removed the user account connected to this horrifying incident, as well as any content associated with the suspect. We are committed to fully supporting law enforcement in their investigation,” Roblox said in a statement to The Guardian.
The WSJ report also mentioned that Van Rootselaar's social media activities showed interest in using illicit drugs.

Semi-open ballot: The path to fixing Israel’s electoral system - opinion

In a rare departure from the current era of polarization, the Knesset is hosting the first meeting of a caucus born of cross-partisan cooperation: the “Caucus for Changing the Electoral System and Advancing Primaries on Election Day,” initiated by Members of Knesset Eitan Ginzburg (Blue and White), Eli Dalal (Likud), and Ohad Tal (Religious Zionism).
“Primaries on Election Day,” as termed by the members of the caucus, is more precisely termed a “semi-open ballot.” This is an electoral system that allows voters to choose not only a party list but also specific candidates. In Israel’s multi-party parliamentary system, Israelis vote only for a political party on Election Day – and in most cases, they do not have any say over the people for whom they would vote to represent them in Knesset.
In this system, each party builds a list of candidates to run on their party list; candidates higher on the list are more likely to have a seat in Knesset, as a party is allocated a number of seats proportionate to its share of the national vote.
So, how would this alternative model of a semi-open ballot system work? The ballot slip for each party list would include the names and order of its candidates (or at least some of them). A voter who wishes to do so could mark the names of several candidates he or she would like to see in the Knesset. When the party votes are counted, the personal votes for candidates will also be tallied. A candidate who receives a substantial number of personal votes could move up to a higher spot on the list.
This is a significant reform, and a much-needed one. It addresses one of the central flaws of Israeli politics: the excessive distance, indeed a real disconnect, between voters and their elected representatives.
The new system would enable voters to participate in politics in a fuller and more precise way, by choosing not only a list as a “package deal,” but also specific candidates within it. It would also dramatically affect the accountability and sense of responsibility of members of Knesset toward the public. MKs would know that on Election Day, each of them must stand personally before hundreds of thousands, even millions, of their party’s voters, with their experience and record to answer for.
This stands in sharp contrast to the current situation, in which an MK’s political future depends primarily on the dominant actor within the party – whether it be a single leader, a party-arranging committee, the party central committee, or primary voters.
Moreover, by shifting part of the weight from the party list as a whole to individual candidates within it, the system is likely to incentivize parties to place higher-quality and more representative candidates on their lists.
Semi-open list system is a more common democratic system
The reform is also justified and logical from a comparative perspective. In almost all established democracies, voters can express support for individual candidates and not only for party lists. In fact, the semi-open list system is the most common electoral model among developed democracies, and is used in countries such as the Netherlands, Belgium, Sweden, Austria, Iceland, the Czech Republic, Slovenia, and others.
In the few democracies where, as in Israel, voters can choose only among party lists (such as Spain, Portugal, Costa Rica, Norway), there are at least electoral districts, unlike in Israel, so citizens vote specifically for representatives of their geographic area. Israel’s system is therefore the most extreme in this respect: it has no personal component, no regional component, and therefore a very tenuous link between voter and elected official.
As noted, the proposal enjoys support across the political spectrum. The caucus was established by MKs from the Center (Blue and White), Likud (Right), and Religious Zionism (far-Right), and a related bill has also been introduced in the current Knesset by a representative of Yesh Atid. The proposal has also garnered backing in civil society from a wide range of organizations, including the Israel Democracy Institute, the Kohelet Policy Forum, the Movement for Quality Government in Israel, Israel 2050, and the Fourth Quarter.
It is important to note that electoral reform made so close to elections (i.e., in an election year) should generally be avoided. Therefore, even if the reform is advanced during the current Knesset term, it should enter into force only ahead of the next Knesset elections (which are scheduled to take place in 2030).
To be sure, there are differences among the specific proposals advanced by each MK and organization, for example, regarding whether the new system would be mandatory for all parties or only for those that choose to adopt it. But the direction is clear: Israel’s electoral system ought to be reformed to include a personal component, one that strengthens voters’ influence and enhances the accountability and responsibility of those elected to serve them.

Baftas 2026: Emma Stone leads stars in daring red carpet fashion
Celebrities descended on London’s Royal Albert Hall in risque designs for the Baftas.
- Bookmark
Celebrities including Emma Stone, Carey Mulligan and Kerry Washington dared to bare on the Bafta red carpet.
Stars descended on London’s Royal Festival Hall for the 79th British Academy Film Awards, with the trend for risque and backless outfits taking centre stage.
Stone, who is nominated for best actress for her role in Bugonia, braved the February weather in a daring black dress, featuring a halterneck, a keyhole cut-out and a daring backless design.
She paired the risque ensemble with delicate earrings and a loose chignon.
She wasn’t the only star opting for a backless outfit on the red carpet.
Carey Mulligan – who is nominated for best supporting actress for her role in The Ballad Of Wallis Island – wore a navy halterneck dress that was backless save for one thin strap, paired with a relaxed bob hairstyle.
While Irish actress Jessie Buckley’s outfit doesn’t look immediately daring – the electric blue dress featured a high neckline and bedazzled brooches on the shoulders – it revealed an unexpected scooped back.
Buckley – who is hotly tipped to win the best actress award for her role in Hamnet – paired the vibrant Grecian-style dress with short, wet-look hair.
Rose Byrne, who is nominated for best actress for her role in If I Had Legs I’d Kick You, opted for a pale yellow Miu Miu dress.
The backless gown featured delicate sequinning on the bodice, thin bedazzled straps and was worn with a sleek updo and statement earrings.
Kerry Washington, perhaps best known for her role in TV series Scandal, wore a daring navy gown to the awards. The Prada dress featured a floral sequinned pattern on the bodice, a voluminous chiffon skirt and a statement backless design.
Up-and-comer Chase Infiniti, who is nominated for best actress for her role in director Paul Thomas Anderson’s film One Battle After Another, continued her red carpet relationship with luxury French fashion house Louis Vuitton.
Infiniti wore a burgundy coloured gown by the brand, featuring a strapless design and a dramatic fishtail. She accessorised the look simply, with a soft updo and chose long diamond earrings instead of a necklace.
Adolescence star Erin Doherty wore an unusual structured look also by Louis Vuitton – a black dress with a statement skirt and low neckline.
The shape is reminiscent of the turqoise dress she wore to the Critics Choice Awards in January, showing the actress is unafraid of taking style risks on the red carpet.
Norwegian actress Renate Reinsve – also up for the leading actress gong for her role in Sentimental Value – bared a daring amount of skin in a Louis Vuitton dress with a geometric cut-out.
Emily Watson, who is nominated for best supporting actress for her role as Mary Shakespeare in Hamnet, kept things simple but elegant in a chocolate brown gown with a low boat neckline and matching train.
The dress had long sleeves and was accessorised with an relaxed updo and a diamond necklace.
Stranger Things star Sadie Sink, who is set to star in Romeo And Juliet on the West End in March, wore a structured sage backless gown with her red hair left loose.
Gugu Mbatha-Raw, who starred in Doctor Who spin-off The War Between The Land And The Sea, brought some sunshine to the red carpet in a pink sequinned Giorgio Armani gown.
The style of the dress was simple, with a deep-V, a form-fitting silhouette and a leg slit.
Swedish actress Alicia Vikander, perhaps best known for her role as Lara Croft in the Tomb Raider series – also opted for a deep-V neckline.
Her pale blue Louis Vuitton gown featured a triangular cutout at the ribs and was fully encrusted in sequins, bringing some texture and interest to the look.
But not all of the red carpet was dominated with daring designs, with some stars experimenting with more demure fashion choices. Teyana Taylor, who is nominated for best supporting actress for One Battle After Another, flexed her style muscles in a dramatic brown outfit.
The coat-style dress featured a high collar that reached past her ears, ruching and a long train.
American actress Maggie Gyllenhaal wore a black long-sleeve gown with sparkly detailing on the sleeves, paired with a red lip.
While WandaVision star Kathryn Hahn wore a bright all-red look, with all-over ruching, a high neck and long sleeves.
The Bafta red carpet wasn’t short of daring menswear. Alan Cumming, actor and host of The Traitors US, took on hosting duties for the Bafta film awards, and walked the red carpet in a modern take on traditional suiting.
His black overcoat – worn on top of a black shirt and trousers – had a splash of white at the bottom, and was covered in long fringing. The monochromatic outfit had a welcome injection of colour thanks to dyed pink, blue and white coloured curls in his gelled-down hair, and was completed with a statement brooch instead of a tie.
Irish star Paul Mescal, who is nominated for best actor for his role in Hamnet, wore loose-fitting black suit with a simple white shirt underneath, accompanied by partner Gracie Abrams.
Meanwhile, Timothee Chalamet – known for being a daring dresser – kept things simple with a loose-fitting all black tuxedo.
Riz Ahmed, who has just starred in a contemporary South Asian take on Hamlet, wore a double-breasted pinstriped suit with flared trousers and no shirt underneath.

Three people died and four others have been injured in a multi-car collision in County Armagh.
Emergency services dispatched three rapid response paramedics, seven emergency crews and one hazardous area response team after the crash was reported on the Armagh Road near the village of Moy on Saturday night.
Two men, aged 31 and 48, and a 23-year-old woman were pronounced dead at the scene, while four people were injured, three of whom remain in hospital receiving treatment.
The Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) assistant chief constable Davy Beck said the collision involved three vehicles: a red BMW, a grey Volkswagen and a white Audi.
Speaking at the scene, Beck offered his condolences to the families affected by the crash, adding: “One can only imagine the real sense of shock and grief that is engulfing these families at this particular time.”
The Fermanagh and South Tyrone MLA Diana Armstrong said it was “a very dark day for families who have been plunged into shock and mourning”. She said she sent her “deepest sympathies and sincere condolences”, adding that those affected must be “totally at a loss to comprehend the scale of this tragedy”.
Armstrong, the Ulster Unionist party deputy leader, said: “The toll of the loss of life in this incident has shocked the local community and many will be holding those impacted in their thoughts and prayers today. My thanks go to the PSNI and emergency services who attended the scene and transferred those affected for medical treatment.”
In a post on X, the Sinn Féin MP Dáire Hughes said: “Our sincerest sympathies to the families and friends of those who died in this immense tragedy, and to the affected communities.”
The Social Democratic and Labour party (SDLP) councillor for Armagh Thomas O’Hanlon said: “Three families and their wider communities have been plunged into deep grief. There are truly no words that can ease such pain, other than to offer our thoughts and prayers at this incredibly difficult time.”
Police said inquiries were continuing and appealed for anyone who was in the area at the time and witnessed the incident to contact them.
The Armagh Road at Moy remains closed.

Moscow shuts down all 4 airports during Ukrainian drone attack, Russian officials say
Editor's Note: This is a developing story.
Dozens of Ukrainian drones targeted Moscow on Feb. 22, triggering closures at all four of the region's airports, according to Russian officials.
Over 20 drones have been shot down en route to Moscow, Mayor Sergey Sobyanin claimed. The drones targeted the capital over the course of several hours on the afternoon and evening of Feb. 22. Emergency crews have been dispatched to the crash sites, and no casualties or damage have been reported.
Flights were temporarily suspended at Moscow's Domodedovo, Sheremetyevo, Vnukovo, and Zhukovsky airports, according to Rosaviatsiya, Russia's federal aviation agency.
The Russian Defense Ministry also reported that 29 drones were shot down over Bryansk Oblast, and several other drones were intercepted in Kaluga, Belgorod, Tula, Kursk, and Tver oblasts.
The Kyiv Independent could not verify these claims at the time of publication.
Ukraine regularly launches drone attacks against military and industrial facilities in Russia.
Drone attacks on Moscow have been recorded on several instances and often brought about temporary airport closures. While the capital is well-defended against aerial threats, Ukrainian officials have said that disrupting aviation operations is a strategic way of bringing the Kremlin's war home to the Russian population.

Czech president meets Ukrainian veteran for whom Czechs are raising funds for prosthetics
Petr Pavel, President of the Czech Republic, has met Ukrainian veteran Artem, for whose arm prostheses Czechs are collecting funds.
Source: European Pravda, citing Ukrainian media outlet Ukrinform
Details: President Petr Pavel met with Artem who lost both arms in the war and took part in a marathon organised by the Czech fundraiser Dárek pro Putina, which together with the Czech volunteer organisation Team4Ukraine is raising funds for the veteran.
President Pavel wished Artem to hug his wife Veronika as soon as possible and return to a full life.
Artem, a marine and sergeant in the Armed Forces of Ukraine, came under mortar fire while carrying out a combat mission near Pokrovsk, Donetsk Oblast. Due to tourniquet syndrome, doctors were forced to amputate both of his arms.
The tourniquets his unit had received from Czech volunteers saved his life, but 12 hours without medical assistance left no chance of saving his arms.
After the surgery, Artem went through rehabilitation in Lviv. During that time, his commander stayed in contact with Team4Ukraine, who had already been strongly supporting the unit by providing medical equipment, drones, charging stations, and other essential items for the UAV crew.
Quote: "When Team4Ukraine learned about [Artem's] difficult situation, they immediately began looking for treatment and prosthetic options in the Czech Republic. They consulted prosthetics doctors. Eventually, it was decided that Team4Ukraine together with Dárek pro Putina would help raise funds for bionic prostheses, which will be made in Lviv by our specialists. At the moment, they are truly the best – unfortunately, because they have a great deal of practice. It's a very complicated case, as the prostheses are expensive and technically complex."
Background:
- Pavel said that his country's decision to purchase artillery shells for Ukraine ensured that the Armed Forces were supplied with 4.4 million large-caliber ammunition.
- Pavel emphasised the unfairness of the negative attitudes towards Ukrainians.

‘My ex-partner put spyware on my phone to track my every move’

‘My ex-partner put spyware on my phone to track my every move’
Nicola* could not understand how her ex-partner knew where she was going to be and when – until a sweep of her mobile phone finally revealed the truth, as Holly Evans reports
- Bookmark
The alarm bells started to ring in Nicola’s head when she attended a gig in her home city, and she realised her ex-partner’s son was also in the audience. He explained that he had been told to avoid her at the concert if they were to bump into one another.
“That was the first alarm bell,” she told The Independent. “How would he know I was going to be there, and told in advance to avoid me?”
In April 2024, Nicola, whose name has been changed to protect her identity, had ended an abusive short-lived relationship, which had seen her report her former partner to the police for sexual assault.
A few months later, in July, she realised that this “chance meeting” was the start of something far more sinister, as her ex began to relentlessly stalk her at any given opportunity – turning up at her home, workplace and places she exercised.
Her frightening experience comes as charities and campaigners warn of an alarming rise in tech-facilitated abuse, with stalkers using GPS devices, spyware and Apple AirTags to harass their victims.
Freedom of Information data obtained by The Independent from 18 of 44 police forces in England and Wales revealed a 1,034 per cent increase in coercive control cases involving a GPS device, with a 896 per cent increase in stalking reports since 2018.
After dismissing the first occasion as a chance encounter, Nicola realised that a WhatsApp message had been sent to her ex-partner – despite claiming to have never made contact, and stating that she had blocked them for several months.
A month later, she was returning from a wedding via train, having booked her journey at the last minute. “When I walked out of the station, who should be there on their own? Miles away from where they live on a Friday night, with no restaurants or bars nearby, they were sat there. It was incredibly confusing and scary.”
Over the following months, Nicola began spotting her ex at her workplace, her home, outside a leisure centre and parked in a nearby junction to watch as she exercised.
“At this point, they know where I’m going, where I’m going to be at any point. I said a million times, I think I’ve been microchipped. I was utterly paranoid, I was scared and at my wits’ end. How did they know where I was going to be and when I would be attending such specific events?”
Despite reporting it to the police, Nicola says little was done, and she made an application for a non-molestation court order to prevent her ex from contacting her in October last year.
She also contacted her mobile provider, who advised her to visit a mobile phone shop to see if they could analyse her device.
“An hour after I handed it over, they found spyware on my phone. A feature called MSpy, which can be downloaded so they have access to your phone.
“My entire world just fell apart. They can see all your apps, your texts and track your GPS. You walk around blindly thinking everything is fine, and it really wasn’t fine. I had been stalked comprehensively in terms of my location.”
Despite removing the software, the stalking continued, with her ex still successfully managing to pinpoint her whereabouts. She also returned home one evening to discover her home had been broken into.
She has now reported her ex-partner 35 times to three different police forces, but says little progress has been made in her case.
The stalking has caused Nicola to attempt to take her own life on three occasions, as well as self-harm on another three occasions, and she has been hospitalised each time.
“It’s absolutely horrendous,” she said. “I’m constantly on alert. I sit with my back to the wall, I’ve changed my routines and I’m scared of going out.
“I’ve changed everything I do. I’ve changed phones, jobs, I don’t go out on my own, and I’ll contact venues in advance to let them know I’ve been stalked so that I can sit with a security guard.”
The charity Refuge first noticed an increase in the number of perpetrators abusing spyware during the Covid-19 pandemic, and has warned that they are seeing an increasing number of victims being sectioned for mental health issues as a result of stalking.
Deputy Chief Constable Sarah Poolman, national policing lead for stalking and harassment, said: “Stalking is a highly complex crime which is often exacerbated by the exploitation of technology to track, harass and frighten victims.
“Officers must have the right knowledge and skills to identify and investigate offences, which is why training has been updated to include cyberstalking and how offenders exploit technology to stalk victims. This also includes how to retrieve and preserve digital evidence, which is often pivotal to building a strong case. Some forces also offer victim support which includes scanning of devices to identify tracking software.
“Whilst forces have made progress to broaden understanding of stalking and better assess risk, there is more to do to ensure consistency across the country. Our focus is on making sure forces are using every tool available to them to better protect victims and bring more perpetrators to justice.”

Revealed: How stalkers are weaponising Airtags and GPS trackers to harass their victims
Charities say cyber stalking has been on the rise since Covid, but a surge in crimes in the years since shows it’s a problem that’s only getting worse
- Bookmark
Apple AirTags and GPS tracking devices are being weaponised by stalkers, fuelling a “disturbing” surge in cases and leaving victims in fear for their lives.
Abusers have been using the coin-sized devices, which can be bought for as little as £35, along with apps designed for parental control, to track ex-partners at their workplaces and keep tabs on their location.
Some survivors have been forced to flee their homes and change jobs to avoid detection, while others have been placed in safe houses.
Campaigners warn that the issue has skyrocketed since the Covid pandemic and say some police don’t take victims’ concerns seriously enough. They are also seeing an increasing number of victims sectioned because of a collapse in their mental health.
It comes as freedom of information data from police forces in England and Wales, obtained by The Independent, found there had been a shocking 896 per cent increase in the number of stalking reports involving AirTags and GPS trackers, with the cases rising from 57 in 2018 to 568 by the end of 2024. In coercive control cases, this number had risen from 38 to 431 during the same time period – a 1,034 per cent increase.
But the true figure is likely to be far higher, as only 18 of 44 forces responded to the request for information, with charities warning that survivors face a “postcode lottery” on responses from frontline officers.
Nicola’s torment began 18 months ago after she left an abusive, short-lived relationship. Within weeks, it became apparent that her ex-partner knew her every movement, and began appearing outside her workplace, at gigs, in pubs and parked nearby when Nicola left her home to take exercise.
Despite applying for a non-molestation court order to prevent her abuser from contacting her, and making 35 reports to the police, Nicola – whose name has been changed to protect her identity – claims the police have failed to take her concerns seriously. She said this led her to attempt to take her own life three times and self-harm a further three times since the stalking escalated in October 2024.
The offending was only uncovered during a trip to a mobile phone repair shop, when spyware programme, Mspy, which is designed for parental control, was found on her device. That meant her ex-partner had access to all her apps, GPS location and messages.
She said: “It’s absolutely horrendous. I’m constantly on alert, I sit with my back to the wall, I’ve changed my routines, and I’m scared of going out.
“I’ve never been so scared in my life – I’ve changed phones, jobs and I’ll contact venues in advance to let them know I’ve been stalked so that I can sit with a security guard.”
Emma Pickering, head of tech and economic abuse at the domestic abuse charity Refuge, said tracking and hidden surveillance had been on the rise “for a really long time” because there are “more options available” as technology has developed.
She said: “It is disturbing. A lot of new cars have GPS-enabled systems that can be tracked through an app, you can hide Apple AirTags in clothing, Find my iPhone, ring doorbell cameras – one of the biggest challenges is that we don’t know what will develop next.”
The charity first noticed an increase in the number of perpetrators downloading stalkerware to spy on their victims during the Covid lockdown.
“We thought it would peak but it never really went away. We’re busier than ever – there are no cases that we deal with where there isn’t an element of tech-based abuse,” she said.
Apple has implemented safety features such as alerts when an unknown AirTag has been tracking a person. But some victims have found devices hidden in their vehicles, in the pockets of their coats, and in some cases, slipped into their children’s backpacks by ex-partners.
Asked if technology companies were doing enough to ensure their products were not being used for nefarious purposes, Saskia Garner of the stalking charity the Suzy Lamplugh Trust said: “Not really, no. We would always advocate a safety-by-design approach.
“Once complaints were made, they made adjustments, but that’s already too late. We are also aware of other tracking technologies that are marketed directly to people who want to stalk, such as track your ex sites.
“There is a proliferation of places unashamedly advertising that they assist stalking. They are designed not to be found by stalking victims and solely benefit the perpetrators. There needs to be more regulation around this.”
In Sasha’s case, her ex-partner continued to stalk her after their breakup by analysing geolocation data embedded into her photos. He was able to add the pictures to his own camera roll, and use the geolocation to find the street where she was living.
She said: “At that point, a risk assessment was carried out and the situation was escalated. I had panic buttons installed, but eventually the police told me, ‘We can’t keep you safe here.’ Because he had made threats to my life, his own, and others’, I had to be relocated.”
In its 2022 super-complaint to UK police forces, the Suzy Lamplugh Trust raised concerns that police were failing to recognise the impact of cyber stalking on victims, and said evidence was not being sufficiently gathered.
Charlotte Hopper, of The Cyber Helpline, agreed. She said: “There appears to be an apathy towards crime that happens online. There’s also a lack of awareness of the real impact of these trackers and what to do with them – there’s such a feeling in the police that if it happens online, we’re not going to know who it is.”
She described occasions where victims had been told to throw out tracking devices or leave them by the side of the road, with no consideration that this could lead to escalated behaviour. Other times, officers have taken the device without turning it off, leading the perpetrator to realise it is being held in a police station.
“On a number of occasions, we have seen that a person has disabled a GPS tracker or removed access to their online accounts, and we will see things start to become more physical and the person will show up at the house,” she said.
“When stalking is by its nature obsessive and repetitive, you take that control away and we start to see escalations, unfortunately.”
Deputy Chief Constable Sarah Poolman, the national policing lead for stalking and harassment, said officer training has been updated to include cyber stalking and how offenders exploit technology to stalk victims, and guidance has been given on how to retrieve and preserve digital evidence to build a strong case.
But she admitted there was more work to do, adding: “Whilst forces have made progress to broaden understanding of stalking and better assess risk, there is more to do to ensure consistency across the country. Our focus is on making sure forces are using every tool available to them to better protect victims and bring more perpetrators to justice.”
In a previous statement on their website, Apple said: “Apple has been working closely with various safety groups and law enforcement agencies. Through our own evaluations and these discussions, we have identified even more ways we can update AirTag safety warnings and help guard against further unwanted tracking.”

Iranians prefer Israeli 'precise' strike over US 'destructive' attack, Tehran resident tells KAN

Iranians, while "waiting every minute and second" for a US strike against the Islamic Regime, would prefer an Israeli strike due to the precise nature of the Air Force's strikes in June, while there is a perception that US strikes would "bring terrible destruction, like in Iraq and Afghanistan," a local, identified as Ali told KAN Reshet Bet on Sunday.
Ali added that the Israeli strikes in June focused on targeted hits against "the mercenaries of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps" and the Iranian regime's leadership, and did not cause harm to "ordinary citizens" or any economic infrastructure.
Additionally, he told KAN that the regime has "brutally murdered and dismembered" over 40,000 people, and injured hundreds of thousands more during the anti-regime protests over the past two months.
Ali, discussing the resumed university student protests, said that the regime has used brutal and savage force, murdering and kidnapping students to "choke the protests in their infancy."
Israel's public broadcaster also asked Ali if he was afraid to be interviewed by Israeli radio. In response, he quoted a Persian proverb, including that if the regime kidnaps and kills him, then "at least I will rest, at least I won't feel hungry."
Iranians adopt nickname for PM Netanyahu
Further, he added that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has grown in popularity in Iran, with everyone calling him "Bibi-Gol [Bibi the flower]," while telling Ben-Ami that he has been learning Hebrew and that the regime has kept Hebrew-learning platforms open.
The regime has intended these platforms to be used to further its hopes that it will conquer Israel, wanting citizens to know the language, possibly aiding in espionage. "This will help you," the regime tells citizens, according to Ali.
Basij tried to intimidate us, but we shouted louder, student protesters tell N12
Later on Sunday, two university students active in the weekend's protests in Tehran spoke to N12 News about the weekend's events and the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps paramilitary Basij force's attempt to suppress protest activity.
One of the students, attending Sharif University, told the Israeli news channel that the regime believed it could "extinguish the fire that burns within us students for protest and revolution" by keeping campuses closed, but they failed to do so.
Saturday was the first day campuses reopened following a closure last month amid the height of anti-regime protests, they noted.
"The moment we entered campus, we looked each other in the eyes... as if to say to each other: we haven't stopped in the middle, we don't leave work half-done. We all had suppressed anger," they added.
Describing the atmosphere upon return to campus, they said that "Everyone was looking for our friends who were killed - the absence of many has been felt. This sadness turned into shared anger that pulled us to the center of the campus."
"Basij forces positioned themselves in front of us, threatened, and intimidated us," they continued.
The paramilitary members, along with "pro-regime students entered, positioned themselves in front of us, and began to threaten and intimidate us, but we shouted louder," they said.
"Our friends shouted 'Long live the Shah' and Basij shouted 'Haider' [a nickname for Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei], the same slogan that is used as a signal for Shia to kill and slaughter us," they recalled.
"We shouted at them: 'We are the owners of the land - get out of here, Khamenei,' which led Basij members to attack, confront, and try to suppress us. This time we stood up to them," they continued.
Another student, at Amir Kabir University in Tehran, told N12 that "We had planned about 10 days in advance to hold a sit-in strike within the campus."
"Security, Basij, and pro-regime students were spread around the area. Most of the chants were: 'Death to the dictator,' 'Long live the Shah,' 'Death to corruption,' 'Freedom, freedom,' and 'This is the year of blood - Ali [Khamenei] will fall," they stated.

Vanderbilt U investigates lecturer for 'offensive' anti-Israel maths teaching materials

Vanderbilt University has opened a formal inquiry into a faculty member following reports that he shared “offensive” content during course instruction.
On Saturday, StopAntisemitism – a pro-Israel nonprofit focused on exposing individuals for alleged antisemitic statements and behavior – reported that mathematics lecturer Tekin Karadag had “brought his anti-Israel, antisemitic bias into his classroom.”
Anti-Israel, antisemitic bias in the classroom
StopAntisemitism shared a picture of one of Karadag’s calculus slides. The example provided read: “Assume Palestine as a state with a rectangular land shape. There is the Mediterranean Sea on the west and the Jordan River on the east. The height (from south to north) is 2.6 times the width (from east to west). From the river to the sea, Palestine (...) was approximately 100 km. in 1946. The land decreases by 250 sq. km per year, due to the occupation by Israel. How fast is the width of the land decreasing now? (Assume that the height is 2.6 times the width over years).”
StopAntisemitism called this example “unacceptable.” This was then reshared by Rabbi Elchanan Poupko, who said, “The question wrongly assumes that Palestine is an existing state and disregards that it was part of the British Mandate in 1946.”
“He apparently thinks that the modern state of Israel was founded in 1946, something most high school students know is wrong.”
Later on Saturday, Vanderbilt confirmed that the content in question had been removed and a formal inquiry initiated, consistent with relevant university policy.
Karadag is a senior lecturer at Vanderbilt. He studied in Ankara, Turkey, where he was born, before studying at Texas A&M University.
The Jerusalem Post reached out to Vanderbilt for comment but has yet to receive a response.

US Secret Service kills man trying to access Trump Mar-a-Lago estate
US Secret Service agents and a sheriff's deputy fatally shot a man armed with a shotgun who breached the security perimeter of President Donald Trump's Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida in the early hours of Sunday morning.
Trump was in Washington at the time of the incident, which officials said happened around 1:30 am (0630 GMT).
The suspect, a man in his early 20s, was spotted by the north gate of the Mar-a-Lago property, carrying a shotgun and a fuel can, the Secret Service said.
Agents confronted the man and told him to disarm but he raised his gun.
"The only words that we said to him was 'drop the items,'" Palm Beach County sheriff Ric Bradshaw told reporters.
"At which time he put down the gas can, raised the shotgun to a shooting position," Bradshaw said.
A deputy and two Secret Service agents then shot him. The man was pronounced deceased and no US officers were injured.
The Secret Service said no one under its protection was present in Mar-a-Lago at the time.
There was no immediate reaction from the White House.
Trump, who often spends his weekends in Mar-a-Lago, has been the target of several assassination plots or attempts.
Earlier this month, Ryan Routh, 59, who plotted to assassinate the president at a Florida golf course in September 2024, two months before the last US election, was sentenced to life in prison.
Routh's planned attack on Trump came two months after an assassination attempt on the Republican leader in Pennsylvania, where 20-year-old Matthew Crooks fired several shots during a rally, one of them grazing Trump's right ear.
That attack, in which a rallygoer was killed, proved to be a turning point in Trump's return to power. Crooks was immediately shot and killed by security forces and his motive remains unknown.
Political violence has escalated in a deeply polarised country where the political discourse has become increasingly aggressive and inflammatory.
In September last year, right-wing influencer and staunch Trump ally Charlie Kirk was shot dead during an event at a university in Utah.
Before that, in June, a masked shooter killed Minnesota lawmaker Melissa Hortman, a Democrat, and her husband at their home. Another elected official and his wife were also targeted and seriously injured.
And Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro - touted last year as a presidential hopeful - had his home set alight in April in an alleged assassination attempt.
The name of the suspect in the Sunday incident has not been released while officials attempt to contact his relatives.
The US Secret Service is responsible for the safety of the president, vice president and former presidents, and their families, as well as major election candidates and visiting foreign heads of state.

Palestinians watch from the sidelines as 'Board of Peace' holds inaugural meeting
On Friday, US President Donald Trump's new Board of Peace convened for the first time with the stated aim of addressing the situation in Gaza, as well as the West Bank.
The session, attended by Israel and Ali Sha'ath the head of the new Palestinian National Committee for Gaza , drew immediate attention not for what was discussed, but for who was absent.
Key Palestinian actors, notably the Palestinian Authority and Hamas as well as other factions, were missing, leaving ordinary Palestinians and analysts doubting whether the Board could genuinely address the region's core challenges.
Speaking to The New Arab, Palestinian political analysts said that the Board of Peace is like drafting a treatment plan for a patient without allowing them to express their needs, while questioning whether its decisions will have any effect on the ground.
Mustafa Ibrahim, a Gaza-based political analyst, told TNA, "Excluding legitimate Palestinian actors at this stage is not a procedural issue, it is a political mistake that could deepen already existing internal divisions and further erode public trust in any future decisions."
He said that Palestinian society is already grappling with fragmentation between political factions, geographic separation between Gaza and the West Bank, and widespread public frustration.
"When people see major decisions being discussed without those who claim to represent them, it reinforces the perception that their political system is being sidelined and that their voice does not matter," he added.
Ibrahim stressed that legitimacy is central to the success of any political initiative. "If the Palestinian Authority, Hamas, and other influential factions are not meaningfully involved, any outcomes will struggle to gain acceptance on the ground. Agreements cannot simply be announced and expected to function automatically. They require political ownership, and ownership comes from participation."
He emphasized that "solutions without real Palestinian involvement are imposed, not negotiated," adding that imposed arrangements tend to collapse under pressure.
"History has shown that frameworks lacking inclusive representation often face rejection, whether politically or at the grassroots level. If the aim is stability and long-term calm, then genuine Palestinian participation is not optional, it is essential," he explained.
Hussam Al-Dajani, another analyst based in Gaza, stressed the psychological and social dimension of exclusion.
"Palestinians feel they are merely observers, not decision-makers," he told TNA. "Israel's direct representation while the Palestinian Authority and major factions are absent signals disregard for the Palestinian reality. Any agreement presented this way will face public rejection because people do not feel represented or involved."
Al-Dajani also highlighted the humanitarian stakes: policies crafted without Palestinian input risk overlooking the urgent needs of residents struggling with electricity shortages, food insecurity, and access to healthcare.
Abdel Majid Sweilem, apolitical analyst from the West Bank, framed the issue in institutional terms.
"The absence of the Palestinian Authority, Hamas, and other factions renders the Board illegitimate. Israel alone being present without genuine Palestinian involvement creates the impression that decisions are externally imposed, rather than products of balanced dialogue," he told TNA.
Sweilem said that this dynamic makes implementation on the ground extremely difficult and risks resistance, noting that "any initiative announced by the Board will not be accepted if Palestinians themselves are not included as core negotiating parties."
The Palestinian National Committee for Gaza, which attended, is a temporary administrative body with limited authority. Analysts see the Board's reliance on it, combined with Israel's presence, as a move that bypasses traditional Palestinian factions and institutions.
The result, they argue, is weakened legitimacy and a reduced likelihood that any peace plan could be implemented effectively.
From a humanitarian perspective, Palestinians pointed out that the Board's discussions did not reflect the daily realities of life under prolonged siege in Gaza or the increasing restrictions in the West Bank.
Ahed Ferwana, a Gaza-based political analyst, told TNA, "Any plan drafted without Palestinians will fail to reflect daily needs, whether in food, electricity, or healthcare. Policies presented without Palestinian representation could worsen the humanitarian crisis rather than alleviate it."
Voices from ordinary citizens reflected a similar sense of frustration. Ayman Al-Zaarab, 34, from Gaza's Zeitoun neighbourhood, followed media coverage of the Board but found it irrelevant.
"I watched the meeting on TV, but it felt like words on paper," he said. "I didn't hear anything addressing our real problems such as reconstruction of Gaza, electricity, medicine, gas supplies, or even the daily fear of bombing. The session seemed like a media show, far from providing tangible solutions."
Khaled Al-Salam, 28, from the Nuseirat refugee camp, did not follow the meeting at all, saying he was busy with securing his family's needs during Ramadan amid the war's aftermath. "I don't trust America, Israel, or their allies," he said. "All these meetings do not change anything on the ground. We are just trying to survive, feed our children, and get medicine."
He noted that Israel's sole presence suggests an effort by some international actors to pursue solutions aligned with their own interests, bypassing Palestinians entirely.
The session of the "Board of Peace" has revealed fundamental challenges. Without genuine Palestinian involvement, decisions risk remaining theoretical, implementation on the ground becomes uncertain, and political and social divisions may widen.
For Palestinians, the critical question persists: can a body claiming to offer solutions deliver results while excluding the very people those solutions are meant to serve?

Iran agreed secret shoulder-fired missile deal with Russia, FT reports

MOSCOW - Iran agreed a secret 500 million euro (S$746.55 million) arms deal with Russia to acquire thousands of advanced shoulder-fired missiles, the Financial Times reported on Feb 22.
The agreement, signed in Moscow in December, commits Russia to deliver 500 man-portable "Verba" launch units and 2,500 "9M336" missiles over three years, the FT said, citing leaked Russian documents seen by the FT and several people familiar with the deal.
Reuters could not immediately verify the report.
Under the deal the deliveries are scheduled in three tranches, running from 2027 through 2029, the FT said.
The deal was negotiated between Russian state arms exporter Rosoboronexport and the Moscow representative of Iran's Ministry of Defense and Armed Forces Logistics (MODAFL), the FT said.
Tehran formally requested the systems last July, according to a contract seen by the FT. In June last year, US forces struck Iran's three main nuclear sites
US President Donald Trump said Iran's key nuclear facilities were destroyed in the attack. However, according to a preliminary US intelligence assessment at the time, the US airstrikes did not destroy Iran's nuclear capability and only set it back by a few months.
Iranian officials have repeatedly said Tehran had recovered from the damage incurred during the war and that its capabilities are better than ever.
Russia has a strategic partnership treaty with Iran, although it does not include a mutual defence clause. Earlier in February, a Russian naval corvette conducted manoeuvres with the Iranian navy in the Gulf of Oman this week, according to Russia's Defence Ministry. REUTERS

Iran could be ‘a week away’ from enriching uranium to weapons grade — US envoy

US President Donald Trump’s Middle East Envoy Steve Witkoff claimed Saturday that Iran could be about "a week away" from producing industrial-grade bomb-making material, calling the situation “very dangerous” and reiterating Washington’s red lines in ongoing nuclear talks.
Speaking to Fox News, Witkoff said Iran has enriched uranium up to 60 percent, which he argued exceeds levels needed for civilian nuclear purposes.
“They’re probably a week away from having industrial-grade bomb-making material,” Witkoff claimed. “That’s really dangerous. So they can’t have that.”
He said before talks with Iran, Trump instructed him and Jared Kushner, the president’s son-in-law and unofficial aide, that there would be “zero enrichment” and that the US would seek the return of nuclear material.
Witkoff said the US position is that Iran must not enrich uranium and must hand over its stockpiled material. “There have been some very hard red lines drawn,” he said.
‘Good chance’
Iran's foreign minister said on Sunday that he thought there was still a "good chance" his country's standoff with the United States over its nuclear programme could be resolved through diplomacy.
"I believe that still there is a good chance to have a diplomatic solution which is based on a win-win game," Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi told the US broadcaster CBS, adding negotiators were "working on the elements of a deal and draft of the text".
As for Iran's uranium enrichment, which the US opposes, Araghchi said: "As a sovereign country, we have every right to decide for ourselves, by ourselves."

EU says it will accept no increase in US tariffs after Supreme Court ruling: 'A deal is a deal'
Sign up now: Get ST's newsletters delivered to your inbox
BRUSSELS - The European Commission demanded on Feb 22 that the United States stick to the terms of an EU-US trade deal reached last year, after the US Supreme Court struck down Donald Trump’s global tariffs
The Commission, which negotiates trade policy on behalf of the 27 EU member states, said Washington must provide “full clarity” on the steps it intends to take following the court ruling.
After the court struck down Mr Trump’s global tariffs on Feb 20, the US president announced temporary, across-the-board tariffs of 10 per cent, which he then hiked to 15 per cent a day later.
“The current situation is not conducive to delivering ‘fair, balanced, and mutually beneficial’ transatlantic trade and investment, as agreed to by both sides” in the joint statement setting out the terms of last year’s trade agreement, the Commission said. “A deal is a deal.”
The comments were far more strongly worded than the Commission’s initial response on Feb 20, which had said only that it was studying the outcome of the Supreme Court decision and keeping in contact with the US administration.
Last year’s trade deal set a 15 per cent US tariff rate for most EU goods, apart from those covered by other sectoral tariffs such as on steel. It also allowed zero tariffs on some products such as aircraft and spare parts. The EU agreed to remove import duties on many US goods and withdrew a threat to retaliate with higher levies.
“In particular, EU products must continue to benefit from the most competitive treatment, with no increases in tariffs beyond the clear and all-inclusive ceiling previously agreed,” the EU executive said, adding that unpredictable tariffs were disruptive and undermined confidence across global markets.
It said that EU Trade Commissioner Maros Sefcovic had discussed the issue with US Trade Representative Jamieson Greer and Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick on Feb 21. REUTERS

Inside the secret battle over Alexander's Courtyard linking Putin, Netanyahu and espionage fears
Unknown

01:34:22 KST

Nine grams of cannabis — the small amount found in Naama Issachar’s luggage — became the opening shot in one of the most intense and secretive struggles still unfolding between Moscow and Jerusalem.
In 2019, Russian President Vladimir Putin spotted an opportunity after the young Israeli woman was arrested during a layover in Moscow on her way home from India. A public campaign for her release gathered momentum in Israel, and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu submitted a formal clemency request to the Russian president.
Putin, for his part, expected Israel to pardon Russian hacker Alexei Burkov, who was being held in Israel. The United States sought his extradition, and Jerusalem chose Washington over Moscow. Russia reacted angrily, convicted Issachar of drug smuggling and sentenced her to seven and a half years in prison.
Public pressure on Netanyahu mounted. Israel then floated an alternative gesture that could appease Putin: Alexander's Courtyard, a historic property in Jerusalem’s Old City.
In January 2020, at the height of an election campaign, Netanyahu stopped in Moscow and personally accompanied Issachar back to Israel after Putin ordered her release. But Putin does not give gifts for free. He was said to expect a significant gesture in return — the kind not signed on paper and not spoken of openly.
“It was important to Putin not to formally link the two matters,” said a senior official involved at the time. “He does not want to be seen as a trader. He comes from a world of personal commitments and gestures between leaders. His view is: ‘I acted like a man toward you, now you act like a man toward me.’”
Without signing any official document, Netanyahu is said to have personally committed to advancing the issue of Alexander's Courtyard.
A strategic foothold in the Old City
Over the past decade, the ancient compound in the Christian Quarter has become the center of an international dispute and a symbol of Putin’s ambitions. Russia has no foothold in the Old City, and for a country that sees itself as the protector of Orthodox Christianity, the site carries deep significance.
Yet the path to control is fraught with diplomatic and security landmines, placing Israel between Russia and the West.
Since Netanyahu’s alleged commitment, procedural steps have been taken, mostly for appearances. A request to renew the property’s registration — previously listed in Ottoman-era records as belonging to the Russian tsarist empire — was accepted by Israel’s land registry. The property was re-registered under Russia as the successor state to the tsarist empire.
But the registration was technical and did not determine ownership, the issue that most interests Moscow. Appeals and objections pushed the matter to the Jerusalem District Court.
Netanyahu then invoked an unusual legal mechanism dating back to the British Mandate, known as the “King’s Order in Council,” declaring the compound a “holy site.” Under that designation, authority over ownership questions shifts from the courts to the government.
The prime minister must now decide on both registration and ownership, taking into account the recommendation of a special ministerial committee.
Beyond diplomacy, security officials have voiced concerns. Some fear that if Russia gains control, the compound could be used for intelligence purposes.
“The Russian Compound in Jerusalem was always considered a hub of Russian intelligence, even during the Soviet period, and it appears that has not changed,” said a senior official familiar with the matter. “The suspicion is that intelligence operatives are still active there.”
Russia’s renewed push
Putin appears to see a fresh opportunity. The war in Ukraine no longer dominates headlines as it once did, and relations with Washington have shifted under President Donald Trump. Netanyahu and Putin have resumed phone calls.
Messages from the Kremlin reportedly contributed to the first meeting last November of the ministerial committee established to address the issue — nearly four years after its formation.
In March last year, Netanyahu sent his then-military secretary, Roman Gofman, now a candidate to head the Mossad, for a series of discreet meetings in Moscow. Sources say Russia raises Alexander's Courtyard in every encounter with Israeli officials.
Putin, they add, does not wish to be perceived as a leader whose promises can be broken.
The committee is formally headed by ministers Gideon Sa’ar and Yariv Levin, but discussions are conducted quietly under the Prime Minister’s Office. Participants reportedly leave their phones at the door.
With Israel in an election year, some believe Netanyahu may see an opportunity to extract diplomatic concessions from Moscow — but only if he delivers on what Russians view as a personal commitment.
A compound layered in history
From the outside, Alexander's Courtyard resembles an elegant European building with heavy wooden doors and high ceilings. A small group of nuns receives visitors. Downstairs, however, the space opens into a subterranean Roman street dating back nearly 2,000 years.
The compound borders the Church of the Holy Sepulchre and lies about 70 meters from Golgotha, where Christian tradition holds that Jesus was crucified. A Roman triumphal arch from the second century still stands at the entrance. Some believe stones from the Second Temple were used in its construction, making it significant to Jews as well.
In the 19th century, as European powers competed for influence in Jerusalem, the Russian Empire acquired the property. Archaeological discoveries transformed it into a prized religious and political asset. In 1889, it was transferred to the Imperial Orthodox Palestine Society, known as OPS.
After World War I and the Bolshevik Revolution, the Russian Orthodox Church split into “white” and “red” factions. The exile-affiliated OPS continued to manage the site under British and later Jordanian recognition.
Following the Six-Day War, Israel maintained the status quo and avoided intervening in ownership disputes involving Russian church properties.
Putin’s rise changed that dynamic. Reasserting Russia’s imperial and religious identity, he strengthened ties with Patriarch Kirill. About 15 years ago, Russia regained control of Sergei Courtyard in the nearby Russian Compound, despite domestic opposition.
Now Alexander's Courtyard stands at the center of competing claims by organizations bearing similar names, each asserting itself as the legitimate successor to the original OPS.
Espionage fears
The Russian Orthodox Church’s international activities have drawn scrutiny elsewhere. In Bulgaria, lawmaker Atanas Atanasov, a former national security chief, accused Russian clergy of acting as intelligence agents.
Archimandrite Vassian, now head of the Russian Ecclesiastical Mission in Jerusalem, was expelled from North Macedonia in 2023 over allegations of interference. Bulgarian officials said he posed a national security risk.
Russia denies the claims. Its embassy in Israel said allegations of intelligence activity are “baseless” and part of a Western campaign to demonize Russia. It described Vassian’s role as purely religious and said any suggestion that Russia would act against Israel’s security interests is “fake news.”
Former Israeli ambassador to Russia Arkady Mil-Man said Israel must reassess its approach.
“Russia and its security services see us as part of the hostile camp,” he said. “The Russian Church is a central pillar of Putin’s regime. Some clergy sent here are not ordinary religious figures.”
Others in government argue Russia does not need an Old City property to carry out intelligence work, pointing to its existing holdings in Jerusalem.
Still, critics warn that Alexander's Courtyard's sensitive location — overlooking the Church of the Holy Sepulchre, the Hurva Synagogue and al-Aqsa Mosque — makes it strategically significant.
A frozen gift
Inside the compound, time appears suspended. Twelve nuns run the site. All are Ukrainian.
According to Nikolai Vorontsov Hoffman, head of the Munich-based OPS that currently manages the property, their nationality is coincidental. Others suggest it complicates any potential transfer to Russia.
Sister Elizabeth, whose family remains in Kyiv, says she cannot imagine serving under Russian authority. “If that happens, we will leave,” she said. “We cannot serve those who are killing our relatives.”
For now, Israel faces a delicate choice: uphold what Moscow views as a personal pledge or resist amid mounting geopolitical and security concerns.
No official response was provided by the Prime Minister’s Office.
Russia’s embassy said the property’s ownership stems from historical rights and that Moscow has pursued legal recognition accordingly. It rejected allegations of subversion, emphasizing decades of bilateral dialogue between Russia and Israel.
But as quiet deliberations continue behind closed doors, a centuries-old compound in Jerusalem’s Old City remains at the center of a modern geopolitical struggle — one entwined with personal promises, war, religion and power.

Armed man shot and killed trying to enter Trump’s Mar-a-Lago with shotgun

Armed man shot and killed trying to enter Trump’s Mar-a-Lago with shotgun
Updated ,first published
Washington: Police have shot and killed a man in his early 20s who was trying to break into Donald Trump’s Mar-a-Lago club in Florida, armed with a shotgun and a fuel canister, authorities say.
The man breached the secure perimeter on the north side of the property about 1.30am on Sunday (Florida time) when he was confronted by two Secret Service agents and a local police officer.
Trump was not in the area at the time – he was at the White House in Washington, where he hosted a ball for state governors.
Palm Beach County Sheriff Ric Bradshaw said the Secret Service agents and sheriff’s deputy ordered the man to “drop the items”. He then put down the fuel can and “raised the shotgun to a shooting position”, Bradshaw said.
“At that point in time, the deputy and the two Secret Service agents fired their weapons and neutralised the threat. He is deceased at the scene.”
There were no injuries to law enforcement. Authorities did not immediately release the man’s name, pending notification of next of kin. They described him as a white male in his early 20s.
But the Associated Press identified him as 21-year-old Austin Tucker Martin, citing a person familiar with the matter. The person spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorised to publicly discuss details of the investigation.
Trump has faced numerous threats to his life, including an assassination attempt while he was speaking at a rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, during the 2024 election campaign.
On that occasion, 20-year-old Thomas Crooks grazed Trump’s ear and killed another rally attendee, before being shot dead by the Secret Service.
Months later, Ryan Wesley Routh was caught aiming a rifle through the bushes at the Trump International Golf Club in Florida while Trump was on the green. Routh was later found and arrested, and earlier this month was sentenced to life in prison.
Last year, conservative activist Charlie Kirk was assassinated while speaking on campus at a university in Utah. Melissa Hortman, a Democratic politician in the state of Minnesota, was assassinated alongside her husband in June in another act of politically motivated violence.
Trump has yet to comment on Sunday’s incident, but Attorney-General Pam Bondi said she had spoken with the president and was co-ordinating the response with federal partners. FBI director Kash Patel said the bureau was dedicating all necessary resources to the investigation.
Meanwhile, senior White House staffers, including press secretary Karoline Leavitt, used the incident to criticise Democrats for voting against a funding bill for the Department of Homeland Security, including the Secret Service, because of concerns about immigration enforcement agencies such as ICE.
“In the middle of the night while most Americans were asleep, the United States Secret Service acted quickly and decisively to neutralize a crazy person, armed with a gun and a gas canister, who intruded President Trump’s home,” Leavitt said on X.
“Federal law enforcement are working 24/7 to keep our country safe and protect all Americans. It’s shameful and reckless that Democrats have chosen to shut down their Department.”

Russians strike Mykolaiv during rally in support of prisoners of war
According to Ukrinform, the Mykolaiv City Council reported this on Telegram.
"Today, Russian terrorists attacked Mykolaiv once again. In broad daylight, the city was rocked by explosions, forcing people to interrupt their activities. At that very moment, as every Sunday, a rally was being held to remind people of our prisoners of war. During the alarm, the participants took shelter — and rightly so, because safety comes first," the statement said.
It is noted that after the air raid alert cancellation, people returned to their places to support those who are currently in captivity.
“Our services are working at the sites of the attack. Commissions are inspecting the residential sector, recording damage, and helping residents. Thank you to everyone who has been there for the people from the very first minutes,” the mayor added.
Two people are known to have been injured. Their condition is being monitored by doctors.
As reported by Ukrinform, rallies in support of prisoners of war, in particular “Don't be silent! Captivity kills,” are held every weekend in many cities in Ukraine and around the world on the initiative of the families of defenders (in particular, the defenders of Azovstal). The goal is to draw attention to prisoners and those missing in action, call for their release, and support their families.

US envoy Huckabee tries to deny saying he would support Israel expansionism
Rights advocate warns that failure to sack Huckabee ‘will be read by the world as an endorsement of his views’ by Trump.
Despite explicitly saying he “would be fine” if Israel took most of the Middle East in accordance with his interpretation of the Bible, US Ambassador Mike Huckabee has suggested the remark was selectively edited.
The comment by the United States envoy, made during an interview with podcaster Tucker Carlson, sparked outrage and condemnation across the Arab world, including from Saudi Arabia.

“The version Tucker put on X edited out my full response. Truth matters to many of us. Apparently not to Tucker. Sad,” Huckabee wrote in a social media post on Sunday.
The evangelical pastor also shared a post saying the Arab League, which condemned his comment, “needs a new translator”.
Speaking with Carlson on Friday, Huckabee was pressed about the geographical borders of Israel, which he argued are rooted in Old Testament scripture.
Huckabee told Carlson that the biblical verse that promised land to the descendants of Abraham refers to an area between the Euphrates River in Iraq and the Nile River in Egypt.
Such a stretch of territory would encompass modern-day Lebanon, Syria, Jordan and parts of Saudi Arabia.
“It would be fine if they took it all,” said Huckabee, who was appointed by President Donald Trump last year.
On Sunday, the ambassador, an avowed Christian Zionist and staunch defender of Israel, tried to deny making the statement, claiming Carlson, who aired the full interview on his website, had taken his words out of context.
He shared a Jewish Insider article with the headline “Saudi Arabia leads regional push against Huckabee based on partial remarks.”
“As Paul Harvey would say ‘Now the REST OF THE STORY,'” Huckabee wrote, referring to the late American radio broadcaster and his catchphrase.
The US Department of State has not addressed Huckabee’s remarks publicly, and it has not responded to repeated requests for comment by Al Jazeera.
The comments sparked a backlash across the region, including from some close US allies.
Raed Jarrar, advocacy director at the US-based rights group DAWN, stressed that Huckabee’s statement was not a gaffe and called for the ambassador to be sacked.
“An ambassador who publicly endorses Israeli territorial expansion across the entire Middle East cannot serve as a representative of the United States,” Jarrar told Al Jazeera.
“He should be removed immediately, and the Trump administration’s failure to act will be read by the world as an endorsement of his views.”
He stressed that Huckabee’s “extremist views” do not align with established US policy.
“The longer he remains in this post, the greater the damage to US credibility and its ability to play any constructive role in the region,” Jarrar said.
Huckabee appeared to walk back his assertion during the interview, saying it had been “somewhat of a hyperbolic statement”.
“They don’t want to take it over. They’re not asking to take it over,” the ambassador replied.
Still, he left the door open for Israeli expansionism. “If they end up getting attacked by all these places and they win that war and they take that land, OK, that’s a whole other discussion,” he said.
Israeli law does not clearly demarcate the country’s borders. Since its inception in 1948, Israel has been expanding its territories through war in violation of international law.
In his interview with Carlson, Huckabee claimed that “Area C is Israel” – appearing to contradict the official US position against the annexation of the occupied West Bank.
Area C covers around 60 percent of the West Bank.
Multiple United Nations resolutions and rulings by international courts have found that Israel’s occupation of the West Bank and East Jerusalem is illegal.

Syria demands handover of Bashar al-Assad, associates, says justice minister
'Syrian justice will not remain silent over any criminal, and we will pursue them through appropriate and internationally legitimate legal means,' says justice minister
ISTANBUL
Syria's justice minister said Sunday that the government has demanded the handover of former President Bashar al-Assad and all those involved with him, as authorities move forward with a transitional justice process.
Mazhar al-Wais said a recently issued general amnesty decree was a “pressing necessity imposed by the complex legal and legislative reality,” describing it as constitutional and legally sound.
On Wednesday, Syrian President Ahmad al-Sharaa issued a decree granting a general amnesty for some crimes and reducing sentences for others.
In an interview with Al Jazeera, Wais said the decree began to be implemented immediately after its issuance, with 1,500 people released so far. He estimated that around half a million Syrians could benefit from the amnesty.
He stressed that the pardon does not cover those responsible for major crimes against Syrians, saying: “No one involved in (spilling) a single drop of blood against the Syrian people has been or will be released.”
On transitional justice, Wais said the ministry is following a “correct path” that rejects both revenge and impunity. He said trials under this framework are expected to begin “in the near future” once judicial files are completed with evidence and documentation.
Regarding accountability for former regime officials, Wais said the Syrian state has stressed “the necessity of handing over Bashar al-Assad and all those involved with him,” urging a “clear legal process that places states before their legal and moral obligations.”
“Syrian justice will not remain silent over any criminal, and we will pursue them through appropriate and internationally legitimate legal means,” he added.
Assad, who ruled Syria for nearly 25 years, fled to Russia in late 2024, ending the Baath Party’s decades-long grip on power that began in 1963. A new transitional administration led by Sharaa was formed in January.

Iran foreign minister says ‘good chance’ of diplomatic solution in nuclear talks with US

Iran’s Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi said Sunday there is a “good chance” of reaching a diplomatic solution in nuclear talks with the United States and that he is likely to meet U.S. envoy Steve Witkoff in Geneva on Thursday.
Speaking in an interview on CBS News’ “Face the Nation,” Araghchi said renewed negotiations remain possible despite escalating tensions and a continued U.S. military buildup in the Middle East.
Earlier Sunday, a senior Iranian official told Reuters that another round of indirect talks was planned for early March. Separately, Axios reported that a third round of talks could take place as early as Friday if Washington receives a detailed proposal from Tehran within 48 hours outlining terms for an agreement on its nuclear program.
A senior U.S. official cited by Axios did not mention Iran’s missile program, a key concern for Israel, suggesting it is not part of the current round of discussions. Both Iranian and U.S. sources said an interim agreement could be considered before a final nuclear deal is reached.
The Iranian official told Reuters that the sides remain divided over the scope and mechanism of sanctions relief in exchange for limits on Iran’s nuclear activities. He said Tehran would be prepared to “seriously consider” removing highly enriched uranium from its territory, diluting it, or establishing a regional uranium enrichment consortium.
Meanwhile, U.S. preparations for a potential strike against Iran continue at sea and on land. The aircraft carrier USS Gerald R. Ford recently entered the Mediterranean and is expected to be deployed in the eastern Mediterranean near Israel as part of defensive planning.
President Donald Trump has publicly weighed possible military action. His envoy, Steve Witkoff, told Fox News that the president is “curious” why Iran has not yielded despite the significant U.S. military presence in the region.
Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian said Saturday that Iran would not “bow its head despite pressure from world powers,” adding that the country is capable of overcoming the current phase.

Transcript: Govs. Laura Kelly of Kansas, Andy Beshear of Kentucky, Mike Braun of Indiana and Mike DeWine of Ohio on "Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan," Feb. 22, 2026
The following is the full transcript of the interview with Govs. Laura Kelly of Kansas, Andy Beshear of Kentucky, Mike Braun of Indiana and Mike DeWine of Ohio that aired on "Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan" on Feb. 22, 2026.
MARGARET BRENNAN: Every year, America's governors gather here in Washington, and we're joined now by Kansas Democrat Laura Kelly, Kentucky Democrat Andy Beshear, Ohio Republican Mike DeWine and Indiana Republican Mike Braun. Thank you all for being here and having a bipartisan conversation, they are rare these days, and we enjoy them. I- There's so much to talk about, but I need to start on this big decision from the Supreme Court, because it has a huge impact on the economy, including in many of your states. It was a 6-3 ruling from the court that President Trump exceeded his authority when he imposed tariffs on certain items by using this 1977 law. A dozen states and a handful of small businesses had sued over these tariffs, which is how it ended up in the courts in the first place. So let me start with you, Governor Kelly, what impact will this have on your state? Do you know yet?
GOVERNOR LAURA KELLY: I don't know the specifics, but I'm hopeful, optimistic, that it will settle some of the issues that we have, particularly in our agricultural industry. You know, they've been hit very, very hard by these tariffs, and I'm hoping that this court decision will reverse some of those and allow them to get back to business again.
MARGARET BRENNAN: Governor Beshear, Kentucky bourbon, had been hit hard by those retaliatory tariffs. Does this ruling do much for that industry, or, more broadly, for your state?
GOVERNOR ANDY BESHEAR: I hope so. Tariffs are a tax on the American people. We've seen studies that show that 90% of these tariffs are being borne by American business. Those are all in our states, as well as our people. We've seen parts of the economy slow down because of it. It can add 30% more cost to a major new construction project, which could slow down new jobs coming to our communities. Bourbon has been hit hard, and now this is the second straight time, and this is from a state where both of our U.S. senators and this governor, despite being in different parties, are all against tariffs.
MARGARET BRENNAN: Governor Braun, for you, what are you seeing out in Indiana? Because we checked the stats and it looked like your auto and machinery manufacturing have lagged a bit. The Indiana business review says your farmers were hit hard by retaliatory tariffs. Is this going to bring relief?
GOVERNOR MIKE BRAUN: So Indiana's along with Wisconsin, the two biggest states per capita manufacturing, so tariffs would have been a plus due to the industries that have been kind of hollowed out. You look at Gary, Indiana, that was the largest, second largest city in Indiana. Steel goes overseas. I think the key is-is trade has to be fair and free, and from the Marshall Plan through rebuilding the global economy, we did some things that got that out of balance. I mean, we were in a trillion dollar, give or take, annual deficit in trade, $2 trillion on our fiscal account. That turns you into a debtor nation. So ideally, through reciprocity, you get things down and even free and fair and get back on an even playing field over those 40-50, years, it got imbalanced, and I think that's where Trump was coming from.
MARGARET BRENNAN: But the court said he over, over reached–
[CROSS TALK]
GOV. BRAUN: Well, that's that's a constitutional issue, and–
MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.
GOV. BRAUN: And you're going to have to deal with it.
MARGARET BRENNAN: In your state, though you said you believed this theory, that it might actually help bring back some of those manufacturing jobs. Did you see that it did any of that?
GOV. BRAUN: Yes, it was starting, I mean, the amount of investment that's coming back to this country that whooshed out of it, that created chronic trade deficits, that needs to be rectified. And you can do that through tariffs. You can do it through trade negotiations, and we were going the wrong way for a long time.
MARGARET BRENNAN: So you think this is a negative?
GOV. BRAUN: I think the other ways to continue what's already occurred, it'll be interesting with the countries they've already done deals with, whether they'll try to renege. I got a feeling a lot of them will stay put with the trade deals they put in place.
MARGARET BRENNAN: Governor DeWine for you in Ohio, the Cleveland Fed said the tariffs drove price increases across multiple sectors in your state, including in manufacturing and including in retail. Do you believe their analysis, or do you believe the President's analysis?
GOVERNOR MIKE DEWINE: First of all, Margaret, I don't think we know what's going to happen–
MARGARET BRENNAN: Now after this ruling?
GOV. DEWINE: You know, look, the President, I'm sure, is going to look for any way he can to basically go back and do-do this-
[CROSSTALK]
MARGARET BRENNAN: He pretty much said that, right, at 10% global tariffs.
GOV. DEWINE: One of the dissents certainly said he had the authority to do it. We'll have to see. So I don't think anybody knows. It's been mixed for us. I think you know, for agriculture, particularly soybeans, for example, it was not, it was not helpful. But we are, we are a manufacturing state. And I think one of the things that we learned all of us who were governors at the time during Covid Is that the supply chains, we got to make more- We're not- we're broken. We have to make more things back here in the United States, but I think that's a general feeling of the, of the public. So I think as- as a manufacturing state, you know, we're seeing some new investment coming in. It's hard to tell sometimes. Do you attribute it to the fact that they now have to be investing more and don't want to have the tariffs or not? But my feeling is that we're getting a lot that's coming in because frankly, because of those tariffs.
MARGARET BRENNAN: But the administration also says, though, that those manufacturing jobs are going to be replaced by robots, right? That we're going through a huge technological shift, that we're moving forward towards non human manufacturing.
GOV. DEWINE: We've been doing that, We've been doing that for decades–
MARGARET BRENNAN: So how do you explain that to your state when you go home?
GOV. DEWINE: And for companies, for companies to be efficient, they have to do that. But that doesn't mean they're not employing people. That doesn't mean they're not selling so, you know, we want our businesses to survive, and they will use the tech, the new technology that's not new, that's been going on for a long time.
GOV. BRAUN: And Margaret, real quickly. I ran a business for 37 years before I got into the Senate, and technology is something we've woven into our own business, distribution, logistics. It creates jobs in many ways. What AI is going to do, where you take a lot of the mundane things that just take a lot of time, it's hard to tell where it goes, but if it increases productivity, it's going to be a blessing. And that's really how you bring prices down in the long run.
MARGARET BRENNAN: Let me quickly ask you both, since you were in the room at the White House when the President was passed this note that the Supreme Court had just ruled, did he give you any sense of what he's going to do next? Was it exactly what he said from the White House podium, or was it different?
GOV. DEWINE: It was very quick, frankly, you know, he expressed his displeasure. He read it first to everyone to express some displeasure–
GOV. BRAUN: Took questions, and left.
GOV. DEWINE: Yeah, and said, basically, I have to go out and get ready to give a speech. And that's, then he left.
GOV. BESHEAR: Margaret, my hope is that this decision stops the chaos in how these tariffs are being implemented. Because business needs stability. Trade needs stability. And if a president can wield this authority that he was trying to, then you see the chaos we've seen, where we had, first across the board, then reciprocal tariffs, then industry specific tariffs, then we had tariffs on a- on a country for non economic reasons. What this should say is the President has to go to Congress. We have former members of Congress here and actually work it through in a thoughtful way.
GOV. KELLY: And what I'd like to see is I do think there are ways that the President can work around this and get where he wants to go on tariffs. I'm hoping, though, that the approach will be, what about his tariff policy before worked, you know, in the manufacturing arena, for instance, but where did it not work? And be very careful when you're looking at what impact it has on small businesses and agriculture. So I hope whatever comes next is more thoughtful.
MARGARET BRENNAN: Well and- and they're not going away, right? The President did announce at the White House podium a 10% global tariff above the normal tariffs, and he's talking about these temporary authorities. So the story is still developing at this point, no doubt. But is–
GOV. BESHEAR: Is this a story of him potentially defying his own Supreme Court?
MARGARET BRENNAN: That is a great question that I would love to put to that to the President and perhaps some members of his administration. But on this, broadly speaking, I don't hear one clear view from you that you would ask the president to hold off. It sounds like, in some ways, you governor, thought maybe the tariffs are working in certain sectors.
GOV. KELLY: I wasn't- I wasn't trying to come across this as a-as a proponent of the tariffs at all. No, I, you know, I was probably the only Democratic governor who actually signed on to the USMCA, the trade agreement between Canada and Mexico and the United States. Those are our two biggest trading partners. That was working really well for us.
MARGARET BRENNAN: That was in the first Trump administration.
GOV. KELLY: Exactly. And so, you know, I'd like to get back to doing business that way. But if you know, just given the reality of who's President right now and what likely to come, if we can't go back to that exactly, then you know, then what I said before about let's if there were any good things that came out of the approach he took to tariffs, let's focus on that, but let's not reinsert all of the things that were really horrible.
GOV. DEWINE: Margaret, I think you're going to see the President remain a tough negotiator. He'll figure out a way to do that. You know, we all believe in free trade, but I think that we have not let countries run over us, to some extent in the past, and I think the President was correct in that regard. Did it all work out? No. Some of them did. Maybe some of them did not. But I think that being tough a negotiator. I think the vast majority of the American people want to see a tough negotiator.
GOV. BESHEAR: But my concern is that these other countries aren't paying the tariffs. We are. 90% percent of all the costs borne by American families and American businesses, at a time when people struggle just to get by to pay the bills at the end of the month, this is adding $1,000 plus in costs.
GOV. BRAUN: And on the other hand, in the big picture, you cannot become a debtor nation because you're nursing a chronic trade deficit and fiscal deficit.
MARGARET BRENNAN: Isn't that your old job, though, over in Congress?
GOV. BRAUN: But try getting 60 senators to agree to anything, and we had to do all that through reconciliation. But the- where we're headed as a country, and that is my background, finance, macro economics, we're on a bad business plan because we're turning into a debtor nation in our trading account and in our fiscal account, and that wouldn't sell well in Kentucky or Indiana.
GOV. BESHEAR: But if we allow a president to do this, he can tax the American people on his own, without Congress.
MARGARET BRENNAN: We're going to talk about this as the story develops, but I want to ask you about another big issue many of you are facing, and that is how to deal with immigration and immigration policy as it affects your states. Governor Kelly, you're a Democrat, but you did sign a bill to get state law enforcement to work with federal authorities when it comes to immigration enforcement. That's unusual, as many Democrats or cities and states have what the president refers to as sanctuary city policies, or policies of not necessarily being aligned in enforcement on detentions. And one of the complaints is often that having local authorities involved is a drain on their resources, or it's a distraction for them. Why isn't that the case in your state?
GOV. KELLY: I didn't say it wasn't. We haven't--
MARGARET BRENNAN: You think that cooperation is a drain on locals?
GOV. KELLY: I think when ICE comes into your state, that it creates some problems and creates some problems for your local law enforcement, because it's sort of a who's on first. Who's in charge here? And I think that that's been a problem. My approach has always been, you know, when we work with the federal government on anything, whether it's disaster relief or with our National Guard, you know, we-we look for ways to to cooperate and partner. That's what we want to see. You know if they're going to come in and try to do enforcement- immigration enforcement in our state.
MARGARET BRENNAN: Have you had that communication from federal authorities about–?
GOV. KELLY: No, no, we- no, I mean, and we have had, they've started now- we've seen some ICE in some of our communities, and we are, you know, I mean, the whole idea of, you know, picking up criminals who are illegal, here illegally is nothing new, that- that happens on an everyday basis and has for years. So we don't have any problem with that. What we would like is for ICE to then work with our local law enforcement, so that, if they want to come into Kansas communities, work with us, so that we can go after the- those targeted folks, not sort of what we saw in Minnesota, where it's just a free for all.
MARGARET BRENNAN: Governor Beshear, in your state, the Republican legislators want to pass a bill to force the state to work with ICE as I understand it. You're not a fan of this idea. Why?
GOV. BESHEAR: We'll see what happens in my state legislature, because at the end of I think last week, two of our Republican senators got up on the senate floor and talked about how they thought this immigration enforcement had gone too far. For me, I believe that border security is national security, and we need it to tighten our borders. We also have to enforce our laws as a nation, but how we do it shows our humanity or our lack thereof. Shackling people's legs, putting them in cages that we would not put animals in is wrong.
MARGARET BRENNAN: Where have you seen that?
GOV. BESHEAR: Well, you see it in the pictures coming out of the Alligator Alcatraz or other facilities. We read about kids getting sick and not getting the health care they need in the Texas facility. But the tactics of ice show that there is a significant training problem, far too aggressive, and there is now an American body count. They believe they can go into an American citizen's home with just an administrative warrant, they cannot. So I've called for the retraining of all ICE agents, and in the meantime, if they think there's a violent criminal in Kentucky illegally, send us his or her name. We'll go get him.
MARGARET BRENNAN: You're talking there about administrative versus judicial warrants and the ability to enter. Do you then appreciate what's happening here in Washington with Democrats cutting off some of that short term funding for Homeland Security on that issue, along with others?
GOV. BESHEAR: I do, and I wish we didn't have to be at this point. But we have an American body count. We have at least two ICE agents that are being investigated for perjury. We have others- Americans that have been injured or hurt that shouldn't have been. I was the top law enforcement official in Kentucky. I've never seen a law enforcement agency, state, local or federal act with the same tactics that ICE does. And these are on our streets. These are in our cities.
MARGARET BRENNAN: They would argue that the amount of immigration was at such unprecedented levels that new operational things had to be adapted. That's what the administration argues right? That they have to do the tough business now. You're not buying
GOV. BESHEAR: Watch the videos. This is not how law enforcement acts. This is not respecting our rights as Americans. It's wrong.
MARGARET BRENNAN: Governor DeWine in Ohio, your state has been the focus of the Trump Vance campaign during 2024 and of their administration now, particularly the Haitians that you have, tens of thousands in the state of Ohio. You said this week, ICE has not been clear on when they're going to surge to your state. Did you bring that up when you were at the White House?
GOV. DEWINE: I did not. I really didn't have that- have the opportunity to do that. Look, Margaret, my position has been very clear in regard to TPS for Haitians, I think--
MARGARET BRENNAN: Temporary Protected Status.
GOV. DEWINE: Yes.
MARGARET BRENNAN: Which the President is trying to revoke right now.
GOV. DEWINE: I think the policy to revoke that is wrong. I think there's a consensus in this country. As we all have said, let's get rid of the violent offenders. Get them out of here. I think there's a consensus behind the need to do a good job on the border, and I think the president gets high marks for doing that on the- on the border. But once you get beyond that, I don't think there's a consensus for taking people who are working, who are supporting their family, and we've kind of seen it, almost in a micro way, with the Haitian community that's come into Springfield. Springfield is an industrial city, manufacturing city that was down. It has been coming back. And frankly, one of the reasons it's coming back is because of the Haitians who are working there. These are people who, if you talk to the employers, they were filling jobs that were not being able to be filled in any other way. So it's been a big boost to the economy. So if one day they know that TPS is taken away, no- no employer can hire them anymore. And so you gotta have all these people who are unemployed. So I think the policy there is-is wrong. If I could just say this, I think that this is a real opportunity for the president in regard to immigration, probably after the election- after the election, because nothing's going to get done before
MARGARET BRENNAN: Before the midterms of 2026
GOV. DEWINE: That's right, but I think there's an opportunity here. He sealed the border. You know, I was in Congress in the 80s when the Mazzoli bill, Simpson bill was passed- excuse me. I've been through all the arguments. I think there's an opportunity here to get reform in legal immigration and make a decision who we really want to come in. I'll give you- if I could just one example. We have our last count, 22,000 foreign students in the state of Ohio. We educate them, and then guess what happens? They go back home, or they go someplace else. We've already educated them. They would be a great asset to the state of Ohio. That's the type of reform–
MARGARET BRENNAN: You're talking about comprehensive immigration reform and legal pathways.
GOV. DEWINE: I think the president has a chance to do something that no president has done for four decades. If you- if you would take that opportunity, and I think after the election, he'll have a chance.
MARGARET BRENNAN: Because you think there's going to be a switch in the political hold of one of the chambers of congress? .
GOV. DEWINE: No, no, no- either- no, no, either- however the election comes out, I just think the time is now right, because we've always said, we can't do legal immigration because the illegal is such a mess and the border such a mess, and the president, frankly, has fixed the border. So I think it's an opportunity for all of us to go forward. I think it's an opportunity for the president to do as sort of a Richard Nixon going to China.
MARGARET BRENNAN: I hear you on that, and we'd all love to talk about policy–
GOV. DEWINE: But we'll see. We'll see.
MARGARET BRENNAN: But respectfully, the president's not talking about any of what you just laid out, particularly when he's talking about Haitians in Ohio--
GOV. DEWINE: Well I'm an optimist you know.
MARGARET BRENNAN: – everyone remembers that campaign with the claim they're eating cats and dogs. You're talking about hard working people who are legally here and continuing to work.
GOV. DEWINE: And my position has been very clear. I'm against them losing--
MARGARET BRENNAN: You are clear. But are you making that clear to the president's immigration team? Are you coordinating or anything? Because we hear the complaints that Democrats and Republicans are not coordinating.
GOV. DEWINE: Margaret, I don't- I don't discuss my contacts with the president or what I tell the president, but I think it's- the administration knows my position on this. And I think you know, if they were there, they would see that this has been good for our economy. It's been good for our community. We have people who are fixing up houses, opening up restaurants, spending money and filling jobs that couldn't be filled before. They're doing- we need them in Ohio. We're a state that- that as far as our influx of people coming into the state last year, 70% of those individuals were foreign born. They're giving us vibrancy and helping us and the fact that they're working creates other jobs frankly.
MARGARET BRENNAN: Governor Braun, Indiana also had exceptionally high levels of immigration in recent years when we checked the data, according to the census bureau, nearly 10% of your lab- labor force are immigrants. What are the president's policies doing? Are you having a similar experience to, to Governor DeWine?
GOV. BRAUN: So Indiana, among the pair states, has the lowest unemployment rate, and we've got the highest economic growth rate too. That's due to certain policies. But let's get back to the border, it was the same legislative template under the prior administration that encouraged tens of millions to come into the country. So just like when we were talking about the trade issues, go back to the source of why it occurred. Here, it was bad policy calculated, I think, in a very political way, to maybe think it's going to benefit you down the road electorally. Put that aside, it's a whole other issue, I think--
MARGARET BRENNAN: Sorry just to be clear here, you're not talking about illegal people who cannot vote.
GOV. BRAUN: No, I'm talking about how the census is determined, who- who- how your congressional districts are put together. All I can tell you, it was a mess in those four years, and the same legislative template was in place during the Biden administration that the Trump administration has used. I think everybody agrees that we've got to have border security. And what we're hearing here is that immigration is definitely important, legal immigration and the country was built upon immigrants. And when you're in a state like ours, where you're constantly looking for workforce, need to do it. There was even a conversation in an executive session at the NGA about governors getting more involved in work permits and bringing people in coordinated, you know that- I think that's a good idea.
MARGARET BRENNAN: Wait how would that work? What do you mean?
GOV. BRAUN: Well, that would mean that governors would have some say so like the dairy industry in our own state, many other industries need certain workforce that generally is coming legally across the border, and many now illegal that are not documented. So there's a lot to get fixed, but we got to look at why the problem we're dealing with now, you know, occurred in the first place.
MARGARET BRENNAN: But just to put a button on it, because I don't want us to speak past each other, what Governor DeWine was talking about was legal immigration, and people with legal status, Temporary Protected Status, not people who were--
GOV. BRAUN: No I know that--
MARGARET BRENNAN: --crossing illegally--
GOV. BRAUN: --And I think we all agree on legal immigration, all I'm saying–
MARGARET BRENNAN: but you would like to keep that temporary protected status?
GOV. BRAUN: If that was something that was aimed at a particular workforce need, yes, it occurred, so I think you have to respect it. But I think it was all part of a really kind of chaotic approach that allowed a lot of illegal immigration to come across. That's what we're dealing now with ICE enforcement. And I'll agree too, that's got to be done in a way that has humanity to it. I think the reason Tom Homan went up to Minnesota is maybe that was for that reason. But again--
MARGARET BRENNAN: --to bring humanity?
GOV. BRAUN: To do something other than what we were seeing, to try to put some- something together that was going to be different from what was occurring there. But again, I think you got to respect why did it happen? And this was due to bad policies in the prior administration. That's why we're dealing with all this.
GOV. KELLY: If I could just jump in here. You know, I've been governor now for seven years. I was a state senator for 14 years. So we're looking over 20 years. Immigration, legal immigration and workforce have been issues forever. These are decades old. This didn't start in the Biden administration. And you know, not only the Trump administration, and this is just and- and I'm I hope you're right, Governor DeWine, that when this election is over, that we can sit down and have that really important conversation and get something done so that we do have a common sense responsible immigration policy that meets the needs of our businesses and our communities.
GOV. BESHEAR: There's bipartisan agreement on that one.
MARGARET BRENNAN: That cooler heads prevail and policy making actually happens?
[CROSS TALK]
GOV. BESHEAR: Yes, and we actually do the math and get the law right.
MARGARET BRENNAN: Yeah. Just want to move us along here, because you touched something that I want to bring to the table as well, which is just the environment we are in and how difficult it is to get things done. Governor Braun, there were at least 12 state senators in Indiana targeted with swatting or bomb threats this fall, and that happened after the president faulted you as well by name in a social media post for not--
GOV. BRAUN:-- And I was one of those targets as well.
MARGARET BRENNAN: You were, and that's why I want to bring it up to you. You were being faulted by him for not getting the votes to redistrict your state and carve out a more favorable voting map for Republicans.
GOV. BRAUN: That's because he didn't understand all I could do is call a special session. Okay, so be clear on that.
MARGARET BRENNAN: That the president didn't understand Indiana law?
GOV. BRAUN: Well, I- the only thing I as governor could do that was the call, which I did.
MARGARET BRENNAN: Okay, I'm not faulting you, sir. But the elected officials, though, who don't deliver the President what he wants, at risk. I mean, that is difficult for you. You're having to explain that--
GOV. BRAUN: I think there's a political consequence to anything that you do. And in this case, --
MARGARET BRENNAN: -- and you bucked the president--
GOV. BRAUN:-- Well, in this case, every other state that was requested to do it, did it. That doesn't mean that the next state has to. But let's look again. I always like to look at the root of the issue. The root of the issue is that Massachusetts, which is a same size state, we are for 20 years, 60-40 blue, red. We're 60-40 the other way, has gerrymandered to where there isn't a seat. In New England, the place where there are a lot more electoral votes than the four or five western states that hardly have any congressional districts. They've done it. I think what he was looking for is an even playing field, and now it's kind of back and forth. I don't know what we're going to end up with.
MARGARET BRENNAN: He was looking for a Republican majority.
GOV. BESHEAR: He said it out loud.
GOV. BRAUN: Because I think if you look at it, the other side is gerrymandered more effectively over the years, and that's what he was after--
MARGARET BRENNAN: And Democrats, no doubt, are gerrymandering as well.
GOV. BESHEAR: I want to give Donald Trump credit. He owns his policies, and he just said out loud, I want more Republican seats.
GOV. BRAUN: And that's because of this- best example cited. New England. been gerrymandered for years. They've been faster footed than we've been on that issue.
MARGARET BRENNAN: And California as well jumping in on that. But Governor DeWine, we're talking about the environment we're in right now. And when I brought up the Haitians in your state, I mean, you have also brought national- that has brought national attention to Ohio. The President's messaging around this. You've had bomb threats you've talked about recently. How do you deal with that, with this level of rhetoric and managing that?
GOV. DEWINE: Well, when that came up a year ago--
MARGARET BRENNAN: -- But it's continued.
GOV. DEWINE: I understand. I mean, you ask, how we deal with it. We deal with it. The schools-- the Superintendent wanted to close the schools. Felt he needed the school- close the schools. They were getting bomb threats every day, and so I called him up. I said, what do you need? And we put in the highway patrol in the schools, and we kept them in for three weeks. Look, you do what you have to do. That's what all governors do. You do what you have to do. We want those kids in school, and that's- that's what we did. I mean, the bigger question is, how do we tamp down the rhetoric from both sides, and how do we, you know, get things done. And I think one of the things coming out of the last three days at the National Governor Association, whenever we get together, it's pretty clear we're all problem solvers. We deal with problems every day. We solve problems or we try to solve problems every single day. And I think, you know, to me, that's where our focus needs to be. But solve the different problems that we have.
MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, and that's what's interesting in the dynamics both of you have in your states as Democrats, but with states that voted overwhelmingly for Trump and states where you're dealing across the aisle with Republican controlled legislatures. How do you govern as a Democrat in this environment? And are there lessons? I mean- is that too simplistic to say that there are lessons on the state level you can bring to the national level?
GOV. KELLY: Well, my approach has always been to go across the aisle, form relationships and get things done. I started- the day I walked into the state Senate in 2005, I was one of eight Democrats and 32 Republicans. It was very clear to me, if I didn't make some friends across the aisle, that I was never going to get anything done. And just like Governor DeWine said, we're problem solvers. We get into these jobs because we want to do something. And so that was the approach I took then. I think that's- that's carried over into my time as governor. The relationships that I formed in the legislature has boded well for my time as governor. I've been able to continue those relationships. And clearly, we don't agree on a lot of things, but I think we have enough respect for one another to sit down and to listen and to not always, but at times, come to some consensus on legislation. You know, at the times we don't, I work with the super majority, you know, and they can easily override my vetoes.
GOV. BESHEAR: (unintelligible)
GOV. KELLY: But even even there, you know, because of the relationships I have, we've been able to, if it comes to that, you know, been able to go down and work with some of the Republicans to get them to perhaps sustain the vetoes, because it's in the best interest. And think most legislators, regardless of party, really are interested in doing good things.
MARGARET BRENNAN: Can you bring this to the national stage? This idea?
GOV. BESHEAR: I think governors can. I mean, my approach is to spend 80% of my time on things that matter to 100% of the people of Kentucky or the American people. Those are things like your job and whether you make enough to support your family, your next doctor's appointment for yourself, your parents or your kids, the roads and bridges you drive, the school you drop your kids off at, or whether you feel safe in your community. Those aren't bipartisan issues. They're non-partisan issues. I'm working with both of these governors on building bridges, actual bridges between our states. You know, infrastructure, something that's good for everyone, that everyone benefits from, and maybe if we all spend 80% of our time on things that matter to 100% of the American people. We get a lot more done.
MARGARET BRENNAN: Governor, thank you for having this conversation today. It's good to have you all here at the same table. We'll be right back.

Macron urges Trump to lift US visa bans on French judge, ex-EU commissioner
'I ask you to reconsider these decisions by your administration and to lift the sanctions unjustly imposed on Nicolas Guillou and Thierry Breton,' says French president in letter
LONDON
French President Emmanuel Macron has asked US President Donald Trump to lift “unjustly imposed sanctions” on several European citizens, including two French nationals, media reports said.
In a letter to Trump, Macron highlighted the cases of Nicolas Guillou, a judge at the International Criminal Court (ICC), and Thierry Breton, a former European commissioner.
“I wish to personally draw your attention to the sanctions imposed by the United States against several European citizens, including two French nationals, Nicolas Guillou, a judge at the International Criminal Court, and Thierry Breton, a former European commissioner,” the French president wrote, according to La Tribune Dimanche.
“I ask you to reconsider these decisions by your administration and to lift the sanctions unjustly imposed on Nicolas Guillou and Thierry Breton,” he added.
The sanctions also affect three other French individuals who work for non-governmental organizations monitoring online disinformation and hate speech.
When the sanctions were announced in December, the US State Department said: "These radical activists and weaponized NGOs have advanced censorship crackdowns by foreign states—in each case targeting American speakers and American companies."
Breton, a key architect of the EU’s Digital Services Act, has been leading efforts to regulate technology platforms—an approach that Washington perceives as infringing on freedom of expression.
The State Department has accused him of causing harmful "censorship" affecting American interests, and he has been barred from entering the US since December 2025.
Judge Guillou was sanctioned by Washington in August 2025, alongside other ICC magistrates, due to his role in proceedings connected to an arrest warrant for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.
Also prohibited from entering the US, his Visa card—a service provided by an American company—was canceled by his French bank. He is additionally unable to access various American digital platforms, including Airbnb and Amazon.
“The sanctions adopted against Nicolas Guillou undermine the principle of judicial independence and the mandate of the ICC,” Macron wrote.

USA beats Canada to win men's Olympic ice hockey gold

The United States beat Canada 2-1 to win men's ice hockey gold at the Winter Olympics on Sunday, February 22, the last medal up for grabs at the Milan-Cortina Games. Jack Hughes scored the winning goal in overtime to hand the US men their first Olympic triumph since the 1980 "Miracle on Ice" win over the Soviet Union in Lake Placid.
The tone for the high-stakes games was set early on when the Americans were booed when they came out for the warm-up by a crowd that appeared to be two-thirds Canadian. But chants of "USA, USA" soon rang out and they got louder when Matt Boldy gave the Americans a 1-0 lead in the first period.
Boldy skilfully evaded the challenge of a pair of Canadian defenders and scored past goaltender Jordan Binnington. Having stopped the first 24 shots he faced, USA goaltender Connor Hellebuyck was finally beaten in the second period by Cale Makar's wrist shot that squeezed over his pad and into the back of the net.
The Americans came close to re-taking the lead at the end of the second period when Brock Faber's slap shot deflected off both posts but somehow didn't go in. Once the game went into the three-on-three overtime, Hughes applied the golden touch to send his teammates and the US supporters into raptures.

U.S. Beats Canada To Take Gold in Historic Olympic Hockey Final

No miracles here in Italy. Just an immensely satisfying moment in the history of American sports.
Can the U.S. actually feel united for a moment?
On a day when the Democratic governor of New York allowed counties not under a weather emergency to open bars at 6 a.m. on a Sunday in order to serve thirsty hockey fans rooting for what is very likely the favorite Olympic squad of President Donald Trump and his supporters, the United States men’s hockey team ended a 46-year gold medal drought, defeating Canada 2-1 in a tense overtime thriller at the 2026 Olympic final in Milan.

The victory ended Team USA’s 2026 Olympic effort on the highest of notes: its 12 gold medals are a new all-time high for a Winter Games, breaking the former mark, 10, set on home soil at the 2002 Salt Lake City Games. This is also the first time the United States men’s team has won hockey gold on foreign soil.
Less than two minutes into sudden death overtime—Olympic rules call for three skaters vs. three skaters, instead of the usual five on five—Jack Hughes delivered the golden goal. He fired a left-wing rocket past Canadian keeper Jordan Binnington to seal the victory.
A jubilant Hughes threw his helmet somewhere in the air. It might not have come back down yet.
Matt Boldy had started the scoring for the U.S, six minutes into the game, to give the Americans a 1-0 advantage. In the second period, Canada turned up the pressure on U.S. keeper Connor Hellebuyck, who seemed invincible: Hellebuyck even stuffed a breakaway chance for Canadian superstar Connor McDavid, the Edmonton Oilers forward who is a three-time NHL MVP. But during a period in which the Canadians outshot the Americans 19-8, they were bound to break through. Cale Makar scored the equalizer from the right wing late in the second.
So the stage was set for the game’s finish in Milan, chants of “U…S…A” and “Can-a-daaa” bouncing off one another at the Milano Santagiulia Ice Hockey Arena. Though Canada has a richer hockey history and defeated the Americans in the last two Olympic gold medal games in which they squared off—in 2002 in Salt Lake City, and in 2010, in Vancouver—the U.S. had the stronger all-around tournament. The Americans, for example, romped over Slovakia, 5-0 in Friday’s semifinal, while Canada needed a comeback effort against Finland to even reach the final.
Canada outshot the United States in the game, 42-28. Hellebuyck was simply sterling.
Going into the final, players from both teams talked about how this was the North American rivalry matchup they all wanted. For the Americans, the Olympic win serves as a measure of revenge: the final of last year’s 4 Nations Face-Off, an NHL midseason event that became a bit of a phenomenon, McDavid’s overtime score gave Canada a thrilling win. The Americans were just one shot away from victory, and they knew it.
Now, McDavid was stuffed. In the first best-on-best Olympic tournament since 2014, Team USA hockey reigns supreme. We’re a hockey nation, for the foreseeable future.

Russia fires scores of missiles at Ukraine as Hungary threatens to block EU sanctions

Russia has fired scores of missiles and drones at targets across Ukraine, flattening a residential house in the capital, two days before the fourth anniversary of Vladimir Putin’s full-scale invasion.
Volodymyr Zelenskyy said the Kremlin had launched 297 drones and nearly 50 missiles on Sunday, in the latest in a wave of overnight strikes. He said “a significant proportion” had been shot down as he called on allies to strengthen the country’s air defences against enemy attacks.
The Ukrainian president said: “Moscow continues to invest in strikes more than in diplomacy. This time, Russian targets included not only energy facilities, but also logistics, in particular railway and municipal water supply infrastructure.”
The Kremlin has systematically targeted Ukraine’s energy grid, leaving more than half a million people in Kyiv without power. Other cities have been battered repeatedly, including Odesa and Kharkiv; while temperatures have fallen to as low as -22C (-7.6F) in the coldest winter for years.
Zelenskyy said there had been no let-up in Russia’s aerial bombardment, despite talks brokered by the US with Russia that took place in Geneva last week. The Kremlin wants Ukraine to cede territory in the eastern Donbas region its forces have been unable to conquer – a non-starter for Kyiv.
The intense barrage came amid escalating tensions between Ukraine and neighbouring Slovakia and Hungary. Budapest is threatening to block a new package of European Union sanctions; while Bratislava says it will shut off electricity supplies to Ukraine on Monday.
Both are demanding the resumption of Russian oil deliveries through the Druzhba pipeline, which crosses Ukrainian territory. Kyiv says a Russian drone attack in January damaged the pipeline that supplies oil to central Europe.
EU foreign ministers are set to meet in Brussels on Monday to discuss the bloc’s 20th round of sanctions against Moscow, a measure they hope will be approved in time to coincide with Tuesday’s fourth anniversary of the invasion.
Hungary’s pro-Russian government claims Zelenskyy is stalling repairs. In a video posted on social media, Péter Szijjártó, the foreign minister, said: “Until the Ukrainians resume oil shipments to Hungary, we will not allow decisions that are important to them to be approved.”
Writing on X, Robert Fico, Slovakia’s Moscow-friendly prime minister, accused Zelenskyy of “behaving maliciously”. The oil flow stoppages had “caused us further losses and logistical difficulties”, Fico said. Unless deliveries resumed by Monday, Slovakia would stop emergency power supplies to Ukraine, he added.
The latest Russian strikes killed one man and wounded a dozen more people, including four children, Ukraine’s national police said. A missile demolished a private two-storey house in the Kyiv suburb of Sofiivska Borshchahivka. Rescuers sifted through debris on Sunday, as firefighters hosed down the area.
Yana Terleieva, 44, said she woke to the sound of rockets whistling, alarms blaring and a loud explosion. The medic said: “We realised a rocket had landed nearby. Later we saw the house next to us, where ordinary people lived, had been completely destroyed. There are no military facilities here.”
She added: “Russia is a terrorist country that will not stop. We have seen how, for four consecutive years, and more than 11 years in total, Russia has been attacking a peaceful population. Ukrainians want to be independent and free. We are a good nation, we are resisting, but we can’t withstand this war alone.”
In the western city of Lviv, officials said they were treating a large explosion on Sunday as a terrorist incident. The blast ripped through a central shopping street around midnight, close to Lviv’s opera house. A 23-year-old police officer was killed and 25 others were injured, with 14 taken to hospital.
There were unconfirmed reports that a break-in was reported at the store. When police arrived at the scene a bomb was detonated, followed by a second blast shortly afterwards designed to kill emergency responders. Law enforcement agencies have arrested several people.
Andriy Sadovyi, the mayor of Lviv, said: “This is clearly an act of terrorism.” Ukraine’s interior ministry said “there is every reason to believe that the crime was committed on the orders of Russia”.
Despite four years of all-out war, Moscow is no closer to achieving its original objectives in Ukraine, which include the removal of Zelenskyy’s pro-western government. Russia occupies close to a fifth of Ukrainian territory and continues to grind forward, especially in the east, despite losing 1.2 million soldiers, killed or injured.
In an interview on Friday, Zelenskyy told the Agence France-Presse news agency that Ukraine was “definitely not losing”. Victory remained the goal, he said, pointing out that Ukrainian forces had recently clawed back about 116 sq miles (300 sq km) of territory in the southern Zaporizhzhia oblast.
Speaking in Rome on Sunday, Pope Leo XIV described peace in Ukraine as “an urgent necessity”. In his regular Sunday address to a crowd in St Peter’s Square, he said: “Peace cannot be postponed… It must find space in hearts and be translated into responsible decisions.
“I strongly renew my appeal: may the weapons fall silent, may the bombings cease, may a ceasefire be reached without delay, and may dialogue be strengthened to open the way to peace.”

Transcript: U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer on "Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan," Feb. 22, 2026
The following is the transcript of the interview with U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer that aired on "Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan" on Feb. 22, 2026.
MARGARET BRENNAN: We turn now to the U.S. Trade Representative, Jamieson Greer, Ambassador. Welcome back to Face The Nation.
JAMIESON GREER, UNITED STATES TRADE REPRESENTATIVE: Thank you. It's great to be on.
MARGARET BRENNAN: So the president had imposed these tariffs using several different statutes, but the Supreme Court declared that invoking tariffs under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act was illegal because taxation is the authority of the Congress, but the president then said he is going to issue quote "legally permissible tariffs" and that he doesn't need to go to Congress. So can you clarify? Will you ask Congress to legislate tariffs? And if so, which ones?
JAMIESON GREER: So again, thanks for having me on and right now, it's important to understand that over the years, Congress has delegated enormous tariff-setting authority to the president, depending on the situation. So even though the Supreme Court struck down tariffs under one authority, tariffs under other national security elements remain in place. Tariffs under what we call Section 301 related to unfair trading practices, remain in place. And so we of course, can conduct additional investigations under these tools to impose tariffs, to have continuity in the president's trade policy.
MARGARET BRENNAN: But to be clear, those investigations, they have guardrails. They have processes. In fact, the 301s, they could take a year or so to complete those investigations before tariffs come in. You won't have the ability to move as quickly now that the court has ruled, correct?
: So we don't have the same flexibility that IEEPA gave us, which is the emergency statute under Section 301, we have series of hearings, we have public comment, we consult with the other countries, and then we try to resolve the unfair practices we identify, and if they're not resolved, you can take actions like tariffs or other things to try to resolve them. We have tariffs like this already in place on China. We have open investigations already.
MARGARET BRENNAN: But back on the question of congressional authority, there were six House Republicans who voted the other week to roll back the tariffs that the U.S. had put on goods from Canada. That is a signal here of apprehension among members of the president's own party. Given the president's low approval ratings on the economy, according to CBS polling, he's at 39% now, can you go and ask Republican lawmakers, when you were just months out from those midterm races, to take a vote to legislate on tariffs?
: So this is, this is interesting, because one, I've heard from a lot of Republicans over the past year, ones who traditionally, you know, weren't always in favor of tariffs, they've now come around. And they said, one, we've seen this as effective to negotiate deals. Two, we've seen it's effective to re-shore. And three, it's real money coming in. And so I've heard from folks all over the spectrum, and I have to point out too, we did get one Democrat voting in favor of the tariffs as well. And the Republicans who voted against the president, they vote against him on everything, these are people who are either in the doghouse or on the way out. So it's not, it's not really representative of where the party is.
MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, one of them had been endorsed by the president, though the president just pulled back the endorsement because he didn't like what he said about tariffs, but it but to my point, will you ask Congress to actually legislate, or are you just going to avoid going to Congress?
: Well, well, first of all, Congress has already put out statutes allowing the president to impose tariffs. And tariffs have been in place under those types of statutes for, for many years at this point. So in some ways, Congress has already pre-approved these types of authorities. I'm happy to have conversations with Congress about how to legislate the president's trade program. And I've had, you know, conversations like that already, and there is some interest, and so we're happy to talk to them about it, but we're not going to stop our program. We'll just use the congressional authorities they've extended already for now.
MARGARET BRENNAN: Okay, so in terms of the existing authorities, the president said he's going to sign an order to impose a 10% global tariff under Section 122. That was Friday. The next morning, he posted on social media, he's going to hike it to the maximum of 15%. What changed overnight in your strategy?
: Well, I think, well, the strategy didn't, didn't change, because the problem remains the same, and frankly, as the president's advisers ref- review- reviewed this action, this authority allows the president to go up to 15%. And considering the severity of the issue we're dealing with, which is a huge, huge unfairness, huge disparity, huge imbalance between the United States and its trading partners, just the urgency of the situation demands that he use his full authority, which is to impose a tariff at--
[CROSSTALK BEGINS]
MARGARET BRENNAN: --but that expires at five months--
: --15% for about five months.
MARGARET BRENNAN: Yeah, that expires at five months.
: That's right. That's exactly right--
MARGARET BRENNAN: --what back to, you would have to then ask Congress--
: --So in the meantime what we will be doing. No, so I'm not sure you understand how Section 301 works. We [inaud] process process--
MARGARET BRENNAN: --No, we're talking about Section 122--
:--an investigation--
[CROSSTALK ENDS]
MARGARET BRENNAN: We're talking about Section 122, you said, isn't that what the president's using to hike to 15%?
: I'm agreeing with you. So that's right, that's right. And during that time, we're going to conduct investigations that can allow us to impose tariffs if it's justified by the investigation. So we expect to have continuity in the president's tariff program. We know that these laws work. They're tried and true, and so we'll have continuity. The pres- the policy hasn't changed, just the tools have changed.
MARGARET BRENNAN Okay, so you're saying 122 expires after, after this period of time, but you expect your investigation to sort of pick up where they left off. Is that what you're saying with continuity?
: Yeah, that's one way to put it, yeah, yeah.
MARGARET BRENNAN: Okay, so in terms of what's happening around the world, you had India reportedly call off a visit by their trade delegation to Washington, because they're trying to figure out what just happened South Korea, the EU bloc, they're both holding emergency se- meetings to try to figure out what's going on. They have trade deals with the U.S. What's going to happen to those trade deals? Are they in jeopardy?
: So I spoke with my counterpart from the EU this weekend. I have a call that I'm going to have with others. I spoke to my counterparts in other countries. And so the deals, the deals, were not premised on whether or not the lit- the emergency tariff litigation would rise or fall. They weren't premised on that. So it's totally normal for these countries to talk to each other, have meetings internally to determine this. But rest assured, I've been speaking to these folks as well, and I've been telling them for a year whether this case, whether we won or lost, we were going to have tariffs. The president's policy was going to continue. That's why they signed these deals, even while the litigation was pending. So we're having active conversations with them. We want them to understand that these deals are going to be good deals. We, we expect to stand by them. We expect our partners to stand by them. And I haven't heard anyone yet come to me and say, the deal's off. They want to see how this plays out. I'm in active conversation with them on it.
MARGARET BRENNAN: Okay, so we'll watch that space. The Supreme Court ruling that vote was 6-3. The president, as you know, you were there, came out publicly, and he railed against some of those justices by name. He said this on Friday, take a listen.
[SOUND ON TAPE BEGINS]
PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: They're very unpatriotic and disloyal to our Constitution. It's my opinion that the court has been swayed by foreign interests and a political movement that is far smaller than people would ever think.
[SOUND ON TAPE ENDS]
MARGARET BRENNAN: That's a pretty huge allegation. What foreign interest has corrupted the Court according to the president?
: Well, I won't characterize his words too much. He speaks for himself what I will say is that--
MARGARET BRENNAN: --Do you know what he's talking about?--
: So many, so many of the interests that are, that were at issue in this case, were really about foreign importers or foreign- foreign companies that have interests here in the U.S. who are suing the president and suing the administration. It's foreign companies that are benefiting from, from the tariffs being struck down. This is why, when we impose tariffs, foreign countries don't like it and foreign companies don't like it, because they're the ones that don't want to have the tariffs in place. They're the ones that are suing. They're the ones that are trying to get together coalitions and groups who oppose what the president is doing. The president's fighting for American workers. He's trying to impose a trade policy that has a, has a through line through the first Trump administration, Biden and Trump with tariffs. But it's foreign countries and companies that are suing that want these things to go away.
MARGARET BRENNAN: They are suing, but the president wasn't talking about them. The president was talking about the Supreme Court justices who he said are unpatriotic and disloyal and swayed by foreign interests. Do you have any evidence to back--
: --the foreign--
MARGARET BRENNAN: --that allegation about the Supreme Court justices who, as you know, face security threats on a daily basis?
: So when the foreign interests sue, they appear before the courts. They're literally arguing before the courts that they should have a different outcome. So they are, and it's quite obvious that foreign interests are involved. They're helping bring lawsuits. They're arguing before the Court, and these justices, six of them, agree with what a lot of these foreign interests want, which is take down the tariffs, take down the barriers and let us import as much cheap crap as we want to the United States at the expense of American workers.
MARGARET BRENNAN: But do you need to clarify, or feel compelled in any way to clarify, in regard to the allegations against the justices themselves?
: I'm not, I'm not speaking for the President. What I'm telling you is that when the President talks about foreign influences, at a minimum, what we see is that foreign companies are involved in the coalitions, the PR effort, they're involved in the cases and they don't want these tariffs. It's not a secret. I mean, for, for months these, these foreign countries and companies and people the United States who benefit from their commercial relations with them, they want these tariffs to be gone. That, that should be the signal for us that we're doing the right thing, that we're over the target, when the foreign countries and companies are literally arguing in court through their advocates to take it down, we know they have influence.
MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, 1500 businesses, including Costco, have filed lawsuits to get repaid for these tariffs, but we will leave it there. Jamieson Greer, thank you for your tim this morning. We'll be right back with a lot more Face the Nation, stay with us.

A young man was killed Sunday in a shooting at a private home in the central Israeli community of Azor, police said, adding that they are investigating a suspected accidental discharge.
Emergency medical teams pronounced the man dead at the scene after he was shot in the head. Two people involved in the incident were detained for questioning.
“Police received a report a short time ago of a shooting at a private home in Azor,” a police statement said. “Officers who arrived at the scene saw Magen David Adom teams who pronounced the death of a young man after resuscitation efforts.”
Police said professional officials are handling the case “with the required sensitivity.” The circumstances of the shooting remain under investigation.
In November, an 18-year-old was seriously wounded in a shooting in Moshav Azrikam near Ashdod. Police suspected that a soldier friend was handling a weapon when it discharged, striking him.
The indictment charged the officer with manslaughter by recklessness and weapons-related negligence. According to the indictment, Rabuch arrived at the officer’s home with his fiancée, greeted him, and was shot in the chest after the officer pointed his weapon and fired.

BRUSSELS, February 22. /TASS/. The European Union does not plan to withdraw from its agreement with the US on 15% tariffs for all countries in the community following the US Supreme Court's ruling, but is awaiting clarification from Washington on its next steps, the European Commission said in a statement on the court decision, which deemed the US administration’s tariffs imposed on most countries worldwide to be illegal.
"A deal is a deal. As the United States' largest trading partner, the EU expects the US to honour its commitments set out in the Joint Statement (dated July 2025, when the EU agreed to unilaterally pay the US trade duties of 15% - TASS) - just as the EU stands by its commitments," the document says.
However, the statement points out that the uncertainty following the court’s decision does little to promote fair, balanced, and mutually beneficial transatlantic relations.

Russia struck a sweets factory in northeastern Ukraine owned by the American multinational company Mondelez on Feb. 21, Ukraine's Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha said in a post on X.
The factory, located in Trostianets in Sumy Oblast, was struck by a missile, Sybiha said. The plant has operated since the 1990s, and produces a range of well-known products, including Oreo and Milka.
"When Russia targets facilities owned by American companies on Ukrainian soil, it does so knowingly," Yulia Svyrydenko, Ukraine's prime minister, posted on social media on Feb. 22.
According to Svyrydenko, Mondelez has invested more than $250 million into the factory over the years.
A video posted to LinkedIn by Svyrydenko shows the factory heavily damaged after the attack. The extent of the damage and the potential cost to repair the factory remain unclear.
Andy Hunder, president of the American Chamber of Commerce in Ukraine — of which Mondelez is a member — told the Kyiv Independent that targeted strikes against American owned companies are nothing new.
"Forty-seven percent of the members of the American Chamber of Commerce have had damage or destruction to their facilities across Ukraine," he said.

Inquiry into Andrew’s Epstein links not ruled out as police searches continue

Police searches of Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor’s former home on the Windsor estate in Berkshire continued on Sunday as a government minister did not rule out having a judge-led inquiry into the former prince’s links with the late convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.
The education secretary, Bridget Phillipson, representing the government, did not rule out such an inquiry but said it was premature because of the police investigation.
A senior Conservative MP, the former security minister Tom Tugendhat, said Mountbatten-Windsor should face a parliamentary treason investigation over his links with the disgraced financier.
Mountbatten-Windsor was arrested on Thursday, his 66th birthday, on suspicion of misconduct in public office.
He was detained and questioned at a police station for 11 hours concerning allegations he had shared sensitive information with Epstein during his time as the UK’s trade envoy.
A number of public figures have called for a wider investigation into his past dealings with Epstein. Many have also called for Mountbatten-Windsor, who remains eighth in line to the throne, to be dropped from the line of succession.
Royal sources have indicated that King Charles would not stand in the way of parliament if it wanted to ensure Mountbatten-Windsor could never ascend to the throne.
Asked by Trevor Phillips on Sky News when there would be legislation to drop the former prince, Phillipson said: “We are not ruling anything out around this but we have obviously got a live police investigation under way so we’ll not be setting out further steps until the police have been able to do their work.”
On the question of a judge-led inquiry, Phillipson said: “We’ll look at any sensible proposals that do come forward. But it’s premature at the moment, because we do have the police doing their work.
“They need to have the time and space to do so. As the king set out, no one is above the law and it’s right that the police go wherever the evidence takes them, so that has to be the focus at the moment.”
Phillipson said more needed to be done to stamp out violence against women and girls.
“What we’re seeing here is, sadly, nothing new,” she said. “We don’t listen to women who come forward and report abuse. We don’t believe victims and survivors, and sadly, we’ve lived in a world and in a society where even when people do come forward, action hasn’t followed through the criminal justice system.”
The search by Thames Valley police of Mountbatten-Windsor’s former mansion home, Royal Lodge in Windsor Great Park, began on Thursday and continued on Sunday. It is expected to be completed on Monday.
Separately, the Metropolitan police said it was identifying and contacting officers who served as protection officers to Mountbatten-Windsor over the years.
“They have been asked to consider carefully whether anything they saw or heard during that period of service may be relevant to our ongoing reviews and to share any information that could assist us,” a spokesperson for the Met said.
A former head of royal protection, Dai Davies, told Sky News it was “inconceivable” that Mountbatten-Windsor’s former guards would not have information.
“They would have gone to all the five residences we’ve been talking about … in the United States Virgin Islands, New Mexico and Florida. It’s inconceivable to me, I’m sad to say, that nobody saw anything.”
He called for a judge-led inquiry, telling the People newspaper: “For too long the establishment has taken us, the public, for fools. The truth, warts and all, must come out.”
Tugendhat said a special committee of MPs, peers and retired judges should be set up to investigate the links to Epstein of both Mountbatten-Windsor and Peter Mandelson.
He told the Sun on Sunday: “This affair raises urgent questions about foreign influence and national security. What did the Palace know? What did ministers know? What else is being hidden?
“This goes beyond what a court could reasonably consider. Parliament must consider what it means for the country. If the worst is proved, do we need to revisit treason laws written 700 years ago?”
There is widespread agreement that the escalating crisis could have far-reaching implications for the institution of the monarchy and the Commonwealth.
The royal author and historian Andrew Morton told Sky News that one benchmark for royal crises was set by the abdication of Edward VIII in 1936 but that was over in nine days.
“This crisis, I think, outdoes the lot because there is no end in sight. There’s no cut-off point … this will rumble on for years,” Morton said.
Both the Liberal Democrats and Reform UK have said they would back moves to drop Mountbatten-Windsor from the line of succession.
The Lib Dem leader, Sir Ed Davey, said it would be “intolerable” for the former prince to succeed to the throne and that the scenario was “not as remote as some people think”.
Nothing has been seen of Mountbatten-Windsor since he was pictured slumped in the back of a Range Rover as it left Aylsham police station in Norfolk on Thursday evening.
After his younger brother’s arrest, the king said in a statement that “the law must take its course” and the police had “our full and wholehearted support and cooperation”.
The wider royal family have continued to conduct their duties as normal. Anne, the princess royal, on Friday visited a crisp factory in Sheffield. On Monday, as past master of the Worshipful Company of Butchers, she is scheduled to attend the City Food and Drink lecture at the Guildhall in London.
Catherine, the Princess of Wales, watched England lose to Ireland on Saturday in the men’s Six Nations rugby at Twickenham.
Mountbatten-Windsor has denied any wrongdoing over his links to Epstein but has not directly responded to the latest allegations.

Hundreds protest in Verona ahead of Games closing ceremony

VERONA, Italy, Feb 22 - Hundreds of people marched through the streets of Verona a few hours before the Olympics closing ceremony to protest against housing costs and environmental concerns linked to the Winter Games.
The ceremony, scheduled for 8:30 p.m. (1930 GMT), will take place inside Verona’s ancient Roman arena.
The rally, “Olympics? No thanks”, was organised by university groups and associations that oppose hosting an event they say disrupts forests, pours concrete onto fragile land and deepens social inequality.
“We are here to defend our territory from speculation... and from the impossible cost of attending events,” said Giannina Dal Bosco, a 76‑year‑old activist, noting that tickets for a seat at the closing ceremony cost about 400 euros.
One banner read: “Fewer Games for the few, more homes for everyone.”
Francesca, 34, who travelled from Vicenza, about 60 km away, said the landscape had been “disfigured” by new Olympic structures.
“They built concrete monstrosities like the bobsleigh track, which will serve no purpose,” she said. “Public money has been wasted that could have been used for hydrogeological safety and housing plans.”
Several protesters wore keffiyeh scarves and waved Palestinian flags.
Protesters planned to march for around two hours outside the security perimeter, from the 16th‑century Porta Palio to the 19th‑century Arsenal Square.
A much larger demonstration — drawing nearly 10,000 people — took place in Milan on the first day of the Games and later turned violent. REUTERS

Trump has a 60% disapproval rating thanks to inflation, tariffs and immigration policies
President hasn’t seen overall disapproval rating this high since riots at the US Capitol by his supporters on January 6, 2021
- Bookmark
- CommentsGo to comments
Six in ten Americans now disapprove of the job that President Donald Trump is doing, his lowest rating since a violent mob of his supporters attacked the U.S. Capitol on January 6, 2021.
A new Washington Post/Ipsos poll, taken from February 12-17, found that 58 percent of registered voters, and 60 percent of Americans overall, said Trump is managing the presidency poorly. Some 50 percent of Americans “strongly” disapprove of his job performance.
The president continues to lose ground on two of his flagship issues - immigration and the economy - amid a nationwide mass deportation campaign and persistent high consumer prices.
Trump’s efforts to convince Americans that inflationary pressures either don’t exist or are easing quickly have not paid off so far. Some 65 percent of Americans say the president is doing a bad job of bringing prices down, according to the poll.
Large numbers of Americans also oppose Trump’s global tariffs. In the latest survey, 64 percent of Americans opposed the strategy - a number that has barely budged since the beginning of his term. On Friday, the Supreme Court ruled against large parts of Trump’s tariff agenda as illegal.
One of the highest disapproval ratings in the poll - 58 percent - was on Trump’s handling of immigration. His administration has surged ICE agents into some American cities to engage in sweeping deportation arrests. In Minneapolis, this has led to violent clashes with protesters and the fatal shootings of two Americans, Alex Pretti and Renee Good, by ICE agents this winter.
The only time Trump has faced a worse disapproval rating on this issue, in a Post/Ipsos poll, was September 2017, days after he rescinded the DACA program (Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals) that shielded immigrants who were brought to the U.S. as young children from deportation.
The president received low marks on his ability to maintain the U.S.’s relationships with foreign allies. His disapproval rating is 62 percent amid trade disputes with Canada, tussles with NATO over Greenland, and a potential military attack on Iran.
Republicans are stumbling towards what increasingly is shaping up to be a bloody midterm season, fueled in part by a Senate map that has suddenly turned unfavorable for them and a clear Democratic advantage on a generic ballot that has frontline district GOP members sweating. A wave of retirements has also shrunk the GOP’s majority in the House to the low single digits while compounding their efforts to protect the majority in the Senate, too.
The Post/Ipsos survey suggests that while Trump’s numbers on the economy have slightly recovered in recent months, his overall unpopularity remains a problem for the GOP and could easily drag down his party’s numbers in November should they not improve in the coming months.
Data from the Post/Ipsos survey was collected from a population sample of 2,589 U.S. adults between Feb. 12-17, with a margin of error of +/- two percentage points. The sample of registered voters included responses from 2,087 voters with a margin of error of +/- 2.2 percentage points.

Tributes paid to two young men who died on Eryri mountains hike

Tributes have been paid to two young men who died on a hiking expedition on Yr Wyddfa, also known as Snowdon, in north Wales.
Eddie Hill, 20, and Jayden Long, 19, both from Norfolk, were found dead in Eryri national park on Thursday after a huge search operation in severe winter conditions.
The pair were reported missing on Wednesday after they lost contact with family and friends during their trip. Three mountain rescue teams, search dogs and a coastguard helicopter combed the mountain that day and into the night. They discovered two bodies the next day.
Family members and friends described Hill and Long on social media as caring and “pure individuals”.
Long’s sister, Josie, described him as an “amazing, kind and caring big brother”. She said he was “doing something he loved and was taken from us too soon”.
“Words cannot describe how loved he was by everyone and how much he loved us all too,” she wrote. “He was the most amazing boy inside and out.”
His grandmother, Bernadette Smith, wrote: “Jayden is our beautiful loving grandson. He will be greatly missed by his extended family and amazing friends. We are all broken-hearted.”
Harry Hill described his elder brother, Eddie, as a “beloved son” and “the most amazing brother”.
“Words cannot describe the pain that me and my family and friends are going through at the moment,” he wrote. “He was taken from us far too soon and he had such big plans for his future. He is the most beautiful boy inside and out and he will be missed dearly.”
A friend of the two wrote: “Ed and Jay. Where do I start boys, you were both the most amazing and beautiful people in my life, you were and always will be my best friends and I feel privileged to have spent so much of my life with you two.”
North Wales police said: “Concerns for the welfare of the men were reported to police on Wednesday. Tragically, the bodies of the two men were located and recovered as part of coordinated search efforts.
“Both have now been formally identified and their families have been informed. The coroner has been notified.”
Llanberis mountain rescue team, Aberglaslyn mountain rescue team, RAF mountain rescuers, search dogs and a coastguard helicopter were involved in the operation.
The chair of Llanberis mountain rescue team, Jurgen Dissmann, said volunteers had worked “long hours through the night in difficult weather in an effort to locate the pair as quickly as possible”.
“Despite the determined and sustained commitment of everyone involved, we are deeply saddened that, despite all efforts, the outcome was not what we had hoped for,” he said.
The Llanberis community council clerk, Heather Jones, passed her condolences to the families of the two men and paid tribute to the search teams’ dedication.
“We are thankful for their services as we know that it is also very traumatic for them,” she said. She advised people going into the mountains to take extra care.

Talking to the CBS News on Sunday, Araghchi said that the Iranian negotiating team headed by him are working to prepare a framework draft for a potential agreement, adding that he will likely meet with the US negotiator Steve Witkoff in Geneva on Thursday.
"If they (American side) want to find a resolution for Iran's peaceful nuclear program, the only way is diplomacy," the Iranian negotiator said, adding that "there is still a good chance to have a diplomatic solution which is based on a win-win game. A solution is at our reach."
He further stressed that any military build-up cannot help find a solution.
In response to a question whether the Iranian team will have a draft proposal within two to three days, Araghchi said that "we are still working on that....we are trying to make it something which consists of elements which can accommodate both sides' concerns."
"When we meet, probably this Thursday in Geneva, we can work on those elements and prepare a good text and come to a fast deal. This is my understanding. I see it quite possible," Araghchi added.
He later argued that a better deal than 2015's JCPOA is possible.
The lead Iranian negotiator further stressed Iran's right to enrichment of uranium, but still said that a solution could be obtained despite Trump's administration on zero enrichment.
He later stressed the peaceful nature of Iranian atomic program, saying that Tehran does not want to give it up and wants to exercise its right.

UK weather: London to be hotter than Athens this week as temperatures rise after months of rain
Spring is on its way for many parts of the UK as temperatures reach their highest in months

London is set to hotter than Athens this week as the country finally sees some warmer weather after months of relentless rain.
The Met Office has forecast figures as high as 17C with sunshine and clear skies for the capital on Wednesday, higher than the 16C expected in the Greek capital, while other areas of the central and southeastern England could see temperatures as high as 18C.
It comes days after Storm Pedro hit the UK with rain, ice and snow across the country with dozens of flood alerts and warnings in place.
A switch in wind conditions is believed to be behind the warmer weather, with the highest temperatures of the year so far being recorded across the UK over the weekend.
On Saturday, Somerset saw temperatures as high as 16C, with 15C in Wales and even 12C in Scotland. The last time temperatures reached as high as 15C in the UK was on 13 December 2025, according to the BBC.
“For many parts of England and Wales it does turn brighter this afternoon but for Scotland and Northern Ireland we continue to see a mix of sunshine and scattered showers,” ” said Met Office meteorologist Craig Snell.
“The very far south-eastern corner of England we may hang on to the rain for much of the afternoon but for many part of England and Wales, apart from the odd shower it is turning much brighter.”
Temperatures are set to turn even milder throughout the week as winds are drawn up from the south, according to the Met Office.
The overall outlook for the rest of the country according to the Met Office was described as: “Often cloudy and rather breezy in the northwest, with rain at times.
“Drier and brighter further south and east, with some pleasant spells of sunshine. Very mild for most.”
Rain has fallen somewhere in the UK every single day of the year so far. The Met Office reported that rainfall totals from December to early February had already exceed the average rainfall for the whole winter in several locations.
Scientists at Newcastle University have warned that the UK’s increasingly turbulent weather is a result of climate change.
Researchers warn that UK winters are becoming “significantly wetter” and more prone to floods due to rising greenhouse gases in the atmosphere.
University data shows rainfall is increasing by almost 7 per cent for every degree of global or regional warming.

Has BRICS given up on challenging Western economic dominance?
Jim O’Neill, the economist who coined the term ‘BRIC’ 25 years ago, argues that the group is losing its relevance.
At its peak, the BRICS coalition of economies – Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa – was seen as a serious attempt to move away from the United States dollar and the domination of Western economic institutions like the World Bank, Group of Seven (G7), and International Monetary Fund (IMF).
But BRICS members have different political agendas, and new forces are at play, argues economist Jim O’Neill, a member of Britain’s House of Lords.
O’Neill, who coined the term “BRIC” 25 years ago, tells host Steve Clemons that the US’s economic policies may be the driver of its own decline, coupled with the economic rise of China and India.

U.S. beats Canada in thrilling and nail-biting Olympics gold medal final

U.S. beats Canada in thrilling gold medal final at Winter Olympics
The U.S. men's hockey team beat Canada 2-1 in overtime in a thrilling Olympic final game exactly 46 years after Team USA beat the Soviet Union on the road to its last gold medal.
Jack Hughes, who lost some teeth from a high-stick during the game, scored 1:41 into 3-on-3 OT off a pass from Zach Werenski, sending players into a wild celebration as Canada's entire team watched from the bench.
"I can't even believe this," Hughes said. "I mean, it's such an unbelievable game, USA-Canada. Such a good game. There's so many great players. We're a great team. That's exactly how we wanted it to go. We're underdogs to Canada, (but we) beat them. It could have gone either way."
Unlike that ragtag group of college kids that pulled off one of the biggest upsets in sports history at the Lake Placid Games in 1980, the Americans in Milan were a machine that rode goaltender Connor Hellebuyck and a stacked roster full of NHL players through the tournament unbeaten.
"This is all about our country right now," Hughes said. "I love the U.S.A. I love my teammates. It's unbelievable. The USA Hockey brotherhood is so strong."
Werenski and Matthew Tkachuk carried a Johnny Gaudreau No. 13 jersey around the ice as a tribute to the player who was killed along with his brother when they were struck by a driver in 2024. Gaudreau's parents, Guy and Jay, his widow, Meredith, and their oldest children were in attendance. It was John Jr.'s second birthday.
"Congratulations to our great U.S.A. Ice Hockey team. THEY WON THE GOLD. WOW!" President Trump said in a post on Truth Social, adding: "WHAT A GAME!"
The president video-called the team in the locker room after the game.
The U.S got ahead early in the game with a goal from Matt Boldy exactly 6 minutes into the game. He got the puck from Auston Matthews, batted it to himself off his stick blade to maneuver between Canadian defensemen Devon Toews and Cale Makar. He then slid a backhand past goalie Jordan Binnington.
It took Canada until nearly the end of the second period to tie up the game with a goal from Makar, with an assist from Toews.
There were plenty of chances for each team to win the final. The U.S. had more than three minutes of power play time past the midway point of the third after Sam Bennett high-sticked Hughes, who then high-sticked Nick Suzuki to give Canada the same advantage.
Hellebuyck was by far the best player on the ice, stopping 41 of the 42 shots. He made the save of the tournament by getting his stick on the puck on a shot from Toews in the third period, then minutes later denied Macklin Celebrini on a breakaway.
"Unbelievable game by Hellebuyck," Hughes said. "He was our best player by a mile."
This was the third gold medal game between the U.S. and Canada.
In attendance was former U.S. captain Mike Eruzione, who scored the go-ahead goal for the "Miracle on Ice" team to stun the Soviet Union on its way to the gold medal at the Lake Placid Winter Games in 1980.

Lib Dems call on home secretary to delay new dual national border rules

The Liberal Democrats have called on the home secretary to “move at speed” to delay the rollout of new border controls that could result in British dual nationals being blocked from entering the country.
A letter sent by the party to Shabana Mahmood echoes one sent by the former Conservative cabinet minister David Davis on Friday asking for a grace period to be implemented urgently after one of his constituents living in the Netherlands told how she could no longer visit her dying mother in a care home in Yorkshire.
Families have told of the cancellation of flights to attend funerals, 80th birthday parties and visits to elderly and dying parents. Young parents who were forced to take out citizenship in the EU because of Brexit, but whose children do not yet have British passports, have also been hit.
From Wednesday British dual nationals risk not being allowed to board a plane, ferry or train unless they present a current or expired British passport or a “certificate of entitlement” costing £589, which takes eight weeks to obtain.
“It is unacceptable that British citizens could be penalised,” said Will Forster, the Liberal Democrat spokesperson for immigration and asylum, in the letter to Mahmood also signed by 23 other Lib Dem MPs. No British citizen should be denied the right to come home “simply because of badly-communicated and ill-thought-out administrative changes”, the letter said.
It added: “I would urge you to move at speed to introduce a grace period to protect those affected.”
Davis pointed out that Google trends showed a huge jump in searches for passport inquiries in the past week. Searches for “passports” were made 20,000 times, up 10% overall, but searches for “dual passports” were up 90%.
He told the Guardian on Sunday: “The Home Office really has to take this seriously because a British person’s right to live or enter their own country should not be stopped by their own government, full stop. If she [Mahmood] doesn’t take this seriously, this issue will not go away and it will continue to be pursued.”
One young British woman who has been in touch with the Guardian said she and her partner were considering cutting short their honeymoon in New Zealand because her husband, who is from Scotland, does not have a British passport and travelled on his New Zealand papers.
“We heard about the change while out for dinner in a restaurant in Auckland and are now facing ending our honeymoon considerably early at massive expense or being stranded abroad. While trying to find any guidance or help, we’ve been passed from one government office to another with no interest or help from any,” said the woman over email.
She said they had also gone to the consulate in Auckland but everyone there said “it’s nothing to do with them” and a phone line designated as “help for British people” cut out.
One parent in the US trying to get a first time passport for his dual national son before a trip to see elderly parents said it was impossible to get one quickly. “Despite me being British born with a British birth certificate, we need to get original birth certificates and marriage certificates of all four grandparents. Some of those documents are close to 100 years old and the people are long since dead,” he said.
Airlines are obliged to comply with rules or risk fines, making it difficult for those with flights after next Wednesday to know whether they can travel.
British immigration lawyers said one solution would be to temporarily treat British dual nationals like tourists, allowing them to buy a £16 electronic travel authorisation (ETA) to get into the country. “Policy groups are calling upon the Home Office to simply allow dual nationals to apply for and hold ETAs – which is sensible. The Home Office should step back from its rollout, which is causing unnecessary deep damage to the goodwill of overseas British citizens,” said Alex Finch of Constantine Law.
He pointed out that the Home Office on Friday published a partial “fix” saying that carriers may allow dual nationals to board if they have an expired British passport issued in 1989 or later along with a valid passport for a nationality eligible to apply for an ETA. “But that still leaves anyone without a qualifying expired British passport in an uncertain position,” said Finch.
The Home Office said it “strongly recommends” a British passport for smooth travel. It said emergency travel documents were for available adults and children who had previously held a UK passport issued after 1 January 2006 “where the need for urgent travel meets the exceptional circumstances criteria”.
It said: “From 25 February 2026, all dual British citizens will need to present either a valid British passport or certificate of ntitlement when travelling to the UK. Without one carriers cannot verify they are a British citizen, which may lead to delays or refused boarding.
“Public information advising dual nationals to carry the correct documentation has been available since October 2024 and a substantive communications campaign about the introduction of ETA has been running since 2023.”

UK defense secretary says he wants to deploy troops to Ukraine
Sending British troops to Ukraine 'will mean that this war is finally over,' says John Healey
LONDON
The UK’s defense secretary said he wants to deploy British troops to Ukraine, calling it a move that would signal the end of Russia’s war, set this week to mark its fourth anniversary.
“There is no heavier burden on any defense secretary or any government than committing our armed forces on operations. I want to be the defense secretary who deploys British troops to Ukraine – because this will mean that this war is finally over," John Healey wrote in a guest column in the Sunday Telegraph.
He added: “It will mean we have negotiated peace in Ukraine. And a secure Europe needs a strong, sovereign Ukraine.”
European leaders, including the UK, France, Germany, and eight other countries, have discussed forming a “coalition of the willing” with US support.
The group could “assist in the regeneration of Ukraine’s forces, in securing Ukraine’s skies, and in supporting safer seas, including through operating inside Ukraine,” according to Healey.
The UK government is working alongside allies to establish this coalition, which is hoped to deter future "Russian aggression" once a deal is reached between Moscow and Kyiv.
In December, European leaders indicated in December that Europe is ready to lead a “multinational force” in Ukraine as part of a US proposal for a peace agreement.

WASHINGTON, February 22. /TASS/. The Washington administration is prepared to hold a new round of talks with Iranian representatives in Geneva on February 27 if Tehran provides a detailed response to US proposals on the republic’s nuclear program within 48 hours, Axios reported.
"If Iran gives a draft proposal, the US is ready to meet in Geneva on Friday in order to start detailed negotiations to see if we can get a nuclear deal," a senior US official told Axios.
The report says that US President Donald Trump's special envoy Steve Witkoff and businessman Jared Kushner "plan to be in Geneva on February 27" if Iran responds early next week. The source noted that the US and Iran "may also discuss the possibility of an interim agreement before a full nuclear deal is agreed."
The website stresses that "is likely the last chance President Trump will give Iran before launching a massive US-Israeli military operation that could directly target Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei."
A new round of negotiations between Iran and the US on resolving the crisis around Tehran’s nuclear program took place on February 6 in the capital of Oman. The Iranian delegation was led by Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi, while the US team was headed by special presidential envoy Steve Witkoff.
On February 17, the second round of Oman-mediated talks between the US and Iran on the nuclear dossier took place in Geneva. According to Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi, the parties reached a mutual understanding on several issues that could be included in the draft of a future nuclear program deal. US Vice President JD Vance said that the talks went well on a number of issues, but Tehran is not yet ready to accept a number of fundamental positions outlined by the White House. The time and place of the new round of negotiations have not been disclosed.

UK protection officers instructed to guard 2010 Epstein dinner party, reports say
Sign up now: Get ST's newsletters delivered to your inbox
LONDON - London police officers assigned to King Charles' younger brother Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor were instructed to provide security for a dinner party at Jeffrey Epstein's residence in New York in 2010, British media reported on Feb 22.
The Sunday Times, which first reported the story, cited emails from the Epstein files that appear to detail arrangements for Mr Mountbatten-Windsor to stay with the late convicted sex offender in December 2010, along with his two protection officers from London's Metropolitan Police force.
In an email sent the night before the event with the subject line "Security for party", a staff member informed Mr Epstein the two officers had been given "instructions on the door".
The reports come after police said on Feb 20 they were contacting former protection officers who worked for Mr Mountbatten-Windsor, urging anyone with allegations of sex offences relating to Mr Epstein to come forward.
Police said they have not identified any wrongdoing by the protection officers at this stage. Asked to respond to Sunday's reports, the Metropolitan Police said it had no further comment.
Mr Mountbatten-Windsor was arrested on Feb 19 on suspicion of misconduct
His arrest related to allegations that he sent confidential government documents to Mr Epstein while working as a trade envoy. As part of its investigation, Thames Valley Police continued to search his former mansion in Windsor on Feb 22.
Mr Mountbatten-Windsor has always denied any wrongdoing in relation to Mr Epstein, and said he regretted their friendship.
In 2022, the royal settled a civil lawsuit brought in the US by the late Virginia Giuffre, who accused him of sexually abusing her when she was a teenager at properties owned by Epstein or his associates. He has denied ever meeting her. REUTERS

Hungary blocks adoption of EU sanctions package until Ukrainian oil supplies resume

No war loans can be handed to Ukraine until oil deliveries to Hungary are resumed, Prime Minister Viktor Orbán said after a meeting with the Energy Security Council.
Hungary will block the adoption of the 20th package of sanctions against Russia, Péter Szijjártó announced on Sunday after a meeting with the Energy Security Council. The Foreign Minister added that the EU would continue to block the packages until Ukraine repairs the Druzhba pipeline damaged in a Russian strike and resumes oil supplies to Hungary.
Szijjártó said that the new sanctions package, which Hungary will not support, will be adopted at a meeting of foreign ministers on Monday. The Energy Security Council also discussed the issue of electricity supplies to Ukraine. Almost half of Ukraine's electricity imports come from Hungary.
In this context, the minister said that since the Hungarian people and civilians in Transcarpathia would be affected if this were to stop, they should proceed with particular caution.
Prime Minister Viktor Orbán said that the diesel delivery service, which was halted this week, would not be restarted, and that the EU would not support the disbursement of the €90 billion war loan to Ukraine, which the bloc had already decided on.
Ukraine rejects and condemns "ultimatums and blackmail" by the Slovak and Hungarian governments over energy supplies to Ukraine, the Kiev foreign ministry said on Saturday.
Slovak Prime Minister Robert Fico said on Saturday that "if oil supplies to Slovakia do not resume by Monday, he will ask the relevant electricity company (SEPS) to stop emergency electricity supplies to Ukraine".
Deliveries to Slovakia and Hungary were stopped at the end of January. Ukraine claims that oil supplies were suspended because of a Russian drone attack on the Druzhba pipeline.
Nearly every country in Europe has significantly reduced or entirely ceased Russian energy imports since Moscow launched its war in Ukraine on 24 February, 2022. Yet Hungary and Slovakia, both EU and NATO members, have maintained and even increased supplies of Russian oil and gas, and received a temporary exemption from an EU policy prohibiting imports of Russian oil.
Russian missiles and drones in recent months have pounded Ukraine’s energy grid, plunging people into frozen darkness in one of the country’s coldest winters on record.
In a statement on Saturday, Ukraine's Foreign Ministry said it “rejects and condemns the ultimatums and blackmail" by Hungary and Slovakia, and that the two countries were “playing into the hands of the aggressor.”
“Such actions, in the context of massive and targeted Russian strikes on Ukraine’s energy infrastructure and Moscow’s attempts to deprive Ukrainians of electricity, heating, and gas during extreme cold weather, are provocative, irresponsible, and threaten the energy security of the entire region,” the ministry wrote.
Hungary’s nationalist Prime Minister Viktor Orbán, who maintains the closest relationship with the Kremlin of any EU leader, has long argued Russian fossil fuels are indispensable for his economy, and that switching to energy sourced from elsewhere would cause an immediate economic collapse — an argument some experts dispute.
Orbán has frequently threatened to scuttle the bloc’s efforts to sanction Moscow over its invasion, and has blasted attempts to hit Russia’s energy revenues that help finance the war. He has also vetoed EU efforts to provide military and financial assistance to Ukraine.

5 dogs found poisoned to death in Hong Kong’s New Territories in single week
String of cases recorded in Lok Ma Chau, with carcass of ‘Glue’ found floating in mangroves on Sunday
A dog suspected to have been poisoned was found dead in Hong Kong’s New Territories on Sunday, the fifth such case in the past week, according to police.
The force on Sunday said that between February 16 and Saturday, it had received four reports involving the discovery of five dead dogs suspected to have been poisoned in an open space on Liu Pok Road in Lok Ma Chau.
The latest case had been classified as “cruelty to animals” following a preliminary investigation, but no arrests have been made yet, the force said.
“The carcasses of the five dogs have been transferred to the relevant department for toxicological examination and testing,” it said.
The Sai Kung Stray Friends Foundation told the South China Morning Post the body of “Glue” was found at around 3pm.
Narelle Pamuk, the charity’s chairwoman and operator, said she borrowed a boat to search for the missing dog and found the carcass floating in mangroves.

Prince William pays tribute after army medic who found fame on TikTok found dead at barracks
William, the colonel of Welsh Guards, said Corporal Lucy Wilde ‘served with courage and distinction’
- Bookmark
The Prince of Wales has paid tribute to a 25-year-old British Army medic and TikTok star after she was found dead in her barracks.
Corporal Lucy Wilde, from The Royal Yorkshire Regiment, passed away at her army base in Warminster, Wiltshire, on 5 February. The Ministry of Defence is investigating the circumstances of her death.
In a tribute issued on social media, William, who met Cpl Wilde in March 2024 when she was with the Welsh Guards, recalled her “warmth and compassion”.
The royal, who is colonel of the regiment, wrote: "It was with immense sadness that I learned of Cpl Lucy Wilde's death.
“I remember our meeting during her time with the Welsh Guards, where her warmth and compassion were unmistakable.
“She served with courage and distinction as a medic and sought always to help others. I send my heartfelt condolences to her family and friends. Colonel William.”
After joining the army eight years ago, Wilde was with the Welsh Guards until Christmas before moving to the Royal Yorkshire Regiment.
She documented her exercise routine and daily life to 18,000 followers on TikTok.
Her brother told the BBC she served with “courage and pride” and adored long walks with her dog, the peace of nature and the sense of freedom found outdoors.
While with the Welsh Guards, she responded to a mass casualty incident in the Falklands after a troop-carrying vehicle overturned, resulting in multiple injuries.
Cpl Wilde was first on scene and provided immediate medical treatment, working to stabilise casualties and account for personnel.
In a tribute, the regiment wrote: “Her actions that day were nothing short of outstanding, and she was rightly commended for her courage and professionalism.”
They praised her “calmness under pressure, tireless care for others, and unwavering commitment to her role”, adding: “Away from her medical duties, Lucy brought the same drive and positivity into everything she did.
“An extremely fit and highly motivated Physical Training Instructor, she was a familiar face in the gym, always encouraging others to push themselves and improve. Through her social media, she inspired many more - offering guidance on fitness, service life and the journey into the British Army.
“Lucy had a rare ability to lift those around her. She was popular, genuine and deeply respected. Her loss is felt across the Battalion and far beyond.”
In early 2026, Cpl Wilde was posted to the 2nd Battalion, The Royal Yorkshire Regiment.
The Royal Yorkshire Regiment said that she was "genuinely liked by all who served with her" and leaves behind a legacy of "professionalism, determination, compassion, and kindness".

MOSCOW, February 22. /TASS/. Moscow’s position helped preserve Venezuela’s statehood, Foreign Ministry Spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said in an interview with TASS.
"If Russia had not maintained its long-standing position, which it continues to uphold today, very little of Venezuela’s statehood would have remained. No one would have negotiated with them; they would have been treated, as the West has repeatedly suggested, as those who are on the menu," the diplomat said. "Now they are being treated as participants at the negotiating table. That is the difference," she added.

US Secret Service kill armed man trying to access Trump's Mar-a-Lago estate
An armed man was shot and killed by the US Secret Service on Sunday after driving into the secure perimeter of Mar-a-Lago, President Donald Trump's resort in Palm Beach, Florida. The North Carolina man, who was in his early 20s, had a gas can and a shotgun and had been reported missing by his family a few days earlier.
An armed man drove into the secure perimeter of Mar-a-Lago, President Donald Trump's resort in Palm Beach, Florida, as another vehicle was exiting before being shot and killed early Sunday morning, according to a spokesman for the US Secret Service.
The man, who was in his early 20s and from North Carolina, had a gas can and a shotgun, according to Anthony Guglielmi, the spokesman. He had been reported missing by his family a few days ago, and investigators believe he headed south and picked up the shotgun along the way.
Guglielmi said a box for the weapon was discovered in the man's vehicle after the incident, which took place around 1:30am.

The man killed was identified by investigators as 21-year-old Austin Tucker Martin, according to a person familiar with the matter. The person spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to publicly discuss details of the investigation.
Trump has faced threats to his life before, including two assassination attempts during the 2024 campaign. Although the president often spends weekends at his resort, he and first lady Melania Trump were at the White House when the breach at Mar-a-Lago occurred.
After entering near the north gate of the property, the man was confronted by two Secret Service agents and a Palm Beach County sheriff's deputy, according to Palm Beach County Sheriff Ric Bradshaw.
“He was ordered to drop those two pieces of equipment that he had with them. At which time he put down the gas can, raised the shotgun to a shooting position,” Bradshaw said at a brief press conference. The two agents and the deputy “fired their weapons to neutralize the threat”.
The FBI asked residents who live near Mar-a-Lago to check any security cameras they may have for footage that could help investigators.
Investigators are working to compile a psychological profile and a motive is still under investigation. Asked whether the individual was known to law enforcement, Bradshaw said “not right now”.
Mounting political violence
The incident comes as the United States has been rocked by spasms of political violence.
The incursion at Mar-a-Lago took place a few miles from Trump's West Palm Beach club where a man tried to assassinate him while he played golf during the 2024 campaign.
A Secret Service agent spotted that man, Ryan Routh, aiming a rifle through the shrubbery before Trump came into view. Officials said Routh aimed his rifle at the agent, who opened fire and caused Routh to drop his weapon.
Routh was found guilty last year and sentenced this month to life in prison.
Trump also survived an assassination attempt at a Butler, Pennsylvania campaign rally. That gunman fired eight shots before being killed by a Secret Service counter sniper.
The White House referred all questions to the Secret Service and FBI.
There have been other recent incidents of political violence as well.
In the last year, there was the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk; the assassination of the Democratic leader in the Minnesota state House and her husband and the shooting of another lawmaker and his wife; and an arson attack at the official residence of Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro.
Five days ago, a Georgia man armed with a shotgun was arrested as he sprinted towards the west side of the US Capitol.

EU 'expects' US to honour trade deal as Trump hikes tariffs

The European Commission called Sunday, February 22, for Washington to abide by the terms of the trade deal struck last year with the EU, as President Donald Trump announced new global tariff hikes a day after an adverse Supreme Court ruling.
"A deal is a deal. As the United States' largest trading partner, the EU expects the US to honour its commitments set out in the Joint Statement – just as the EU stands by its commitments," said a Commission statement. "The European Commission requests full clarity on the steps the United States intends to take following the recent Supreme Court ruling on the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA)," it said.
Trump temporarily raised the global duty on imports into the United States to 15% on Saturday, delivering a fresh jolt of uncertainty just a day after the Supreme Court ruled much of his international tariffs campaign illegal. The EU and the United States last year struck an agreement setting US tariffs at a maximum 15% on most European goods.
"EU products must continue to benefit from the most competitive treatment, with no increases in tariffs beyond the clear and all-inclusive ceiling previously agreed," the Commission said. It warned that "when applied unpredictably, tariffs are inherently disruptive, undermining confidence and stability across global markets and creating further uncertainty across international supply chains."
The EU executive said it remained "in close and continuous contact" with Trump's administration and that EU Trade Commissioner Maros Sefcovic had spoken with US Trade Representative Jamieson Greer and Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick on Saturday.
The European Parliament's trade committee was due to approve the EU-US deal on Tuesday – but the Supreme Court decision casts doubt on that now happening. The committee's head, Bernd Lange, said he would call during a meeting of parliament's political groups on Monday for putting "legislative work on hold until we have a proper legal assessment and clear commitments from the US side."
"Pure tariff chaos from the US administration. No one can make sense of it anymore – only open questions and growing uncertainty for the EU and other US trading partners," Lange wrote. "Clarity and legal certainty are needed before any further steps are taken," he added.

Ukrainian forces deny Russian claims of destroying HIMARS reload vehicles and Flamingo launchers
According to Ukrinform, the Joint Forces Task Force (JFTF) posted the statement on Facebook.
“The Joint Forces regret to note that, following the latest Russian attack in Ukraine, there are supposedly no HIMARS reload vehicles or FP-5 Flamingo launchers left,” the JFO said.
“However, there weren’t any even before the attack: HIMARS has no reload vehicles, and FP-5 Flamingo missiles are fired from simple rails,” the statement added.
The military emphasized: “We cite this news solely so that readers understand the value of Russian Armed Forces’ reports:
MOSCOW, February 21 /TASS/: Russian servicemen have destroyed a US-made HIMARS reload vehicle and struck launchers for Flamingo missiles.
"Destroying something that does not exist in reality – only Russian propaganda can do that,” the JFTF said.
Previously, strategic communications expert and director of the NGO Join Ukraine, Liubov Tsybulska, stated that thanks to asymmetric measures in the information space, Ukraine can effectively counter Russian propaganda even with significantly fewer resources.

University students hold new protests in Iran around memorials for those killed
Anti-government protests have erupted again at some universities in Iran, weeks after a deadly crackdown on previous nationwide demonstrations
- Bookmark
New anti-government protests have begun in Iran, witnesses said Sunday, as university students in Tehran and another city demonstrated around memorials for thousands of people killed in a crackdown on previous nationwide demonstrations about six weeks ago.
Iran’s state news agency said students protested at five universities in the capital, Tehran, and one in the city of Mashhad on Sunday. The scattered protests erupted Saturday at universities following 40-day memorials for people killed in January during anti-government rallies.
Iran’s government has not commented on the latest protests.
Many Iranians have held ceremonies marking the traditional 40-day mourning period in the past week. Most of the protesters are believed to have been killed around Jan. 8 and 9, according to activists tracking the situation.
Iranians across the country are still reeling with shock, grief and fear after the earlier protests were crushed by the deadliest crackdown ever seen under the rule of 86-year-old Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei. Thousands of people were killed and tens of thousands are believed to have been arrested.
Although the crackdown tamped down the largest protests, smaller ones are still occurring, according to protesters and to videos shared on social media.
During the 1979 Islamic Revolution that toppled the shah and brought the Islamic Republic to power, 40-day memorials for slain protesters often turned into rallies that security forces tried to crush, causing new deaths. Those were then marked 40 days later, with new protests.
Posts on social media Saturday and Sunday have alleged that security forces tried to restrict people from attending some 40-day ceremonies.
The new protests come while Iran braces for the possibility of a U.S. attack, as the Trump administration pushes for concessions from Iran on its nuclear program and other issues. The U.S. has built up its largest military presence in the Middle East in decades.
The U.S.-based Human Rights Activists News Agency says at least 7,015 people were killed in the previous protests and crackdown, including 214 government forces. The group has been accurate in counting deaths during previous rounds of unrest in Iran and relies on a network of activists there to verify deaths.
The death toll continues to rise as the group crosschecks information despite disrupted communication with those inside the Islamic Republic.
Iran’s government offered its only death toll from the previous protests on Jan. 21, saying 3,117 people were killed. Iran’s theocracy in the past has undercounted or not reported fatalities from past unrest.
The Associated Press has been unable to independently assess the death toll, given authorities have disrupted internet access and international calls in Iran.
U.S. President Donald Trump warned on Friday that limited strikes against Iran are possible even as Iran’s Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi said Tehran expects to have a proposed deal ready in the next few days, following indirect nuclear talks with the United States.
The movements of additional U.S. warships and airplanes, with the USS Gerald R. Ford aircraft carrier near the mouth of the Mediterranean Sea, don’t guarantee a U.S. strike on Iran, but they bolster Trump’s ability to carry out one if he chooses.

IOC hails 'incredible' Italy Winter Games despite string of obstacles
The Milano Cortina Games surpassed expectations despite a large number of obstacles in the run-up to the world's biggest winter multi-sports event, the International Olympic Committee said on Sunday, ahead of the closing ceremony.
The Games, which started on 6 February with a dazzling opening ceremony at the San Siro stadium in Milan, were under extreme pressure for years due to tight deadlines and a number of building delays, with the widely dispersed venues across northern Italy posing additional challenges for organisers.
But when the curtain falls with the closing ceremony in the arena of Verona, organisers and the IOC can breathe a sigh of relief.
"They have been fantastic," IOC President Kirsty Coventry said in her address to members at the Olympic body's session. "It could not happen without incredible teamwork... and we had it every step of the way."
"Over the last two weeks we have seen and experienced incredible Games. I have no words really," said Coventry, presiding over her first Games after her election last year. It was a completely different picture only a few weeks before the start, with organisers scrambling to complete the Santagiulia ice hockey arena as well as the newly built sliding centre in Cortina d'Ampezzo, a hotly debated project throughout preparations due to the cost and tight construction deadlines.
"These have been very challenging, difficult years for a series of circumstances," Games chief Giovanni Malago told a press conference. "We never tried to find alibis. But we are all satisfied."
Despite vocal IOC opposition, Italy decided midway through preparations in 2023 to build a new sliding centre in Cortina. The IOC had suggested that organisers could shift the competition to another country and an existing sliding centre but the Italian government refused.
It opted instead to build a new one, piling more pressure on the embattled organisers and angering the IOC. A series of protests took place on the day the Games began in the Italian financial capital to oppose the presence of analysts from a department that falls under US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) while US Vice President JD Vance, present at the opening ceremony, was booed when shown on the stadium's big screens.
IOC snub
Such were the IOC's concerns before the Games that when Malago, an IOC member, ran for a spot on the Olympic body's executive board on the eve of the opening ceremony, he failed spectacularly.
Some 48 fellow members voted against him in a clear snub. It is extremely rare for an IOC member of a host nation to face such opposition from fellow members prior to staging the Games. But when the Olympics got under way most operations went off without any major problems, surprising organisers.
While Olympics traditionally struggle with teething problems or more serious issues that can affect venue operations or even a lack of atmosphere, the Games in Italy did not face a major crisis while the winter weather played along to offer impressive snowy Alpine backdrops.
Initial transport concerns between Milan and the mountain clusters in the Dolomites eased almost instantly, mainly due to the limited number of spectators commuting between the two because of the long travel times that can reach six or seven hours. Most fans chose to stay in either Milan or in the mountains.
The European time zone of the Games also meant increased viewership both across the continent and the key market of North America, compared to the previous two winter editions held in Asia.
US rights holder NBCUniversal CMSCA.O sold out advertising spots for the Games a month before they started, the company said in January.
The Games also got a major boost domestically with Italy picking up 30 medals, including 10 golds by Sunday morning, to make the top five on the medals table, and increased viewership and ticket sales during the Games with several hundred thousand sold during the competitions, to bring the total to around 1.5 million from 1.2 million at the start of the Games.
"Thank you for never ceasing to believing in us," Malago told the session. "For supporting us in the most difficult moments and there were not a few. Together we were stronger than any challenge and any adversity," he said.

Hamas in final stage of choosing new chief, senior official says
Sign up now: Get ST's newsletters delivered to your inbox
CAIRO – Hamas is in the final phase of selecting a new leader, with two prominent figures competing for the position, a senior Hamas official said on Feb 22.
Hamas recently completed the formation of a new Shura Council, a consultative body largely composed of religious scholars, as well as a new political bureau, the official said.
Since the war in Gaza began following Hamas’ Oct 7, 2023 attack on Israel
“The movement has completed its internal elections in the three regions and has reached the final stage of selecting the head of the political bureau,” the official said, speaking on condition of anonymity as he was not authorised to speak publicly.
He added that the race for the group’s leadership is now between Khaled Meshaal and Khalil al-Hayya.
A second Hamas source confirmed the development.
Despite a US-brokered ceasefire that entered its second phase in January, violence has continued in Gaza, with Israel and Hamas blaming each other for violating the agreement.
Members of the council are elected every four years by representatives from Hamas’ three branches: the Gaza Strip, the occupied West Bank and the movement’s external leadership.
Hamas prisoners in Israeli jails are also eligible to vote.
The council subsequently elects the political bureau, which in turn selects the head of the movement.
A third Hamas source said the new leader will serve for only “one year, a transitional period”.
Thousands of Hamas members voted to choose the council and the political bureau, the source added, without specifying how the vote was conducted.
“The primary goal of the process was to renew internal legitimacy and fill leadership vacancies,” the source added.
The new leader will need to navigate between international calls, led by the United States and Israel, for the group to disarm, and resistance to that demand from its armed wing, which fought Israeli forces in Gaza.
Hamas, however, said it would surrender its weapons to a Palestinian authority in Gaza under certain conditions
Both Meshaal and Hayya have years of experience within the movement.
Hayya, 65, a Gaza native and Hamas’ chief negotiator in ceasefire talks, has held senior roles since at least 2006, according to the US-based NGO the Counter Extremism Project (CEP).
Meshaal, who led the political bureau from 2004 to 2017, has never lived in Gaza. He was born in the West Bank in 1956.
He joined Hamas in Kuwait and later lived in Jordan, Syria and Qatar. The CEP says he oversaw Hamas’ evolution into a political-military hybrid.
He currently heads the movement’s diaspora office.
In January, a Hamas source said Hayya enjoys backing from the group’s armed wing, the Ezzedine Al-Qassem Brigades.
After Israel killed former Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh
Israel accused Sinwar of masterminding the Oct 7 attack.
He, too, was killed by Israeli forces in the southern Gaza city of Rafah, three months after Haniyeh’s assassination.
Hamas then opted for an interim five-member leadership committee based in Qatar, postponing the appointment of a single leader until elections, given the risk of the new chief being targeted by Israel. AFP

Transcript: Christine Lagarde, European Central Bank president, on "Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan," Feb. 22, 2026
The following is the transcript of the interview with Christine Lagarde, European Central Bank president, that aired on "Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan" on Feb. 22, 2026.
MARGARET BRENNAN: Welcome back to 'Face The Nation.' We're joined now by the head of the European Central Bank, Christine Lagarde. The ECB sets interest rates for many countries in the European Union, which is America's largest trading partner. It's great to have you here.
CHRISTINE LAGARDE: Great to be here, Margaret.
MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, particularly in this moment in time where there is confusion over what happens next with global trade. I saw that the Chancellor of Germany, Germany is the biggest economy in Europe, he came out and said, tariffs harm everyone, the biggest poison for the economies of Europe and the U.S. is this uncertainty about tariffs. Did you hear and get any clarity from Ambassador Greer about what's going to happen next?
CHRISTINE LAGARDE: I'm not so sure. And I tell you, I think it's, it's critically important that all people in the trade, both outside of the United States, but also in the United States, have clarity about the future of the relationships. Because, you know, it's a bit like driving. You want to know the rules of the road before you- you get in the car. It's the same with trade. It's the same with investment. You want to know what the rules are, and you want to avoid having to, you know, come back and claim tariffs back. Because this is just not the purpose of people doing business. They want to do business. They don't want to go into legal suit- legal lawsuits. So I hope it's going to be clarified, and it's going to be sufficiently thought through, so that we don't have, again, more challenges, and the proposals will be in compliance with the constitution, in compliance with the law.
MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, what you just said sounded very similar to what one of the justices raised, I think, it was Justice Gorsuch saying, like, that's why there is the call to put things in law so that there is clarity for planning ahead. I didn't hear Ambassador Greer say with any certainty that they're going to try to put any of these things in law, just use existing regulations, is what I under- heard him what I heard him say. But he did seem certain that the existing trade deals will hold. The EU and the US do have an agreement, 15% tariff ceiling in a recent trade deal. But there's an emergency meeting about all this tomorrow. Do you see that as disruptive that this could be in jeopardy in fact?
CHRISTINE LAGARDE: I'm no longer trade minister. I used to be. So I don't know what the outcome of those meetings will be, but it's not as if it was sort of straightforward 15% across the board. There are also exemptions, there are carve outs, there are areas for which there is no tariffs. So I think if it shakes the whole equilibrium which people in the trade had got used to because they continued trading after the April decisions and the July trade arrangement between the U.S. and Europe, but to sort of shake it up again is going to bring about disruptions in the business for sure.
MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, when you were last year in October, and I asked you about the impact of the tariffs, you said the global economy had not yet felt the pain. Did we avoid that pain? Did the consumer avoid the pain?
CHRISTINE LAGARDE: I don't think the consumers avoided the pain. And I think that there are many studies that are being completed now to determine what is the impact and where is the burden of tariffs. And I think that while some some exporters have borne some of the brunt, most of it was borne by the U.S. importers and eventually, the U.S. consumers, because the U.S. importers have squeeze their margins a bit to absorb some of these additional cost due to tariffs. But there is a point where you don't squeeze your margins so much, and you have to pass it on to the consumers. I think this is what we are. We are beginning to see, and, you know, multiple studies and very serious people are looking into this. We are trying to look at the data ourselves to make sure what impact it has on trade and on our economies. And this is a continuous process which is clearly going to be a bit disrupted by the current development.
MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to ask you about, as a central banker, your thoughts on some of the populism we're seeing right now. You took a lead role in defending Chair Powell, Jerome Powell, here in the United States after President Trump's Justice Department launched an investigation into him. You said it was critical to preserve the independence of central banks with full respect for the rule of law and democratic accountability. We know Powell is set to be replaced in May by Kevin Warsh, someone you also know from your time as trade minister. Do you believe that he personally can resist political pressure from the President?
CHRISTINE LAGARDE: First of all, I have enormous respect, as you know, for Powell, for Kevin Warsh and for fed chairs in the past, and I'm very proud to receive an award tomorrow in the name of Paul Volcker. You know, for monetary policy, the rule of law is critically important, and the independence of a central bank is critically important. We have seen in history, we have seen in literature, we have seen in, just, anything that analyzes the activity of a central bank, be it the Fed, be it the ECB, that the independence matters a lot. Why is that? Because you don't want someone who sets interest rates, who has in charge price stability and financial stability, you don't want that person to be under political influence. And the decisions that we make generally do not impact right away. They produce an effect 6, 12, 18 months, sometimes two years down the road. In the meantime, the political life continues, and we have to be, in a way, immune to that. That's why many central bankers around the world signed this support to central bank independence as applied to Chair Powell.
MARGARET BRENNAN It was an incredible statement, because usually bankers want to stay out of that spotlight, but you see a real risk here. And- and there is concern about this populist wave, even in France, the far right could win the French election next year. I have to ask you about these reports that you might be leaving the ECB early because of, basically, an insurance policy to allow for the French president to select a successor, rather than potentially a far right leader helping to select a head.
CHRISTINE LAGARDE: I'm riveted to a mission, and my mission is price stability, financial stability. I want the euro, which we are custodian of, to be strong and fit for the future. I think we've achieved a lot. Inflation is at target, growth is okay, not brilliant, but resilient, 1.5%, and unemployment is at the lowest level ever. But we need to consolidate all that. And my baseline is that it will take until the end of my term. And electors in any country in the world make their choices, and those choices have to be respected.
MARGARET BRENNAN: So, no- we are not answering on the leaving early, but you think- it sounds like it will take more work till the end of your eight year term--
CHRISTINE LAGARDE: I'm not done.
MARGARET BRENNAN: Very quickly before I let you go. How challenging is it to keep leverage when Russia and China are trying to avoid European sanctions and American sanctions by using their own currency? Is the West losing its leverage as we look towards this war in Ukraine?
CHRISTINE LAGARDE: I think our responsibility is to make sure that our currencies are strong, that our payment systems are strong and independent, and this is certainly something that we are going to continue doing for the reasons that you've mentioned.
MARGARET BRENNAN: Christine Lagarde, thank you very much for your time this morning. We'll be right back.

Democratic lawmakers in New Jersey use blunt acronym to name anti-ICE legislation
The measure is expected to be voted on next week by the New Jersey State Senate and Assembly before heading to the governor’s desk

Democratic lawmakers in New Jersey have sent a blunt message to Immigration and Customs Enforcement with the introduction of a new bill.
The “Fight Unlawful Conduct and Keep Individuals and Communities Empowered Act” - or F*** ICE Act - was introduced Thursday in the State Assembly. It aims to extend residents’ rights under state law to sue federal immigration officials for unconstitutional conduct.
“There have to be real consequences if ICE breaks the law,” said Katie Brennan, an Assembly Democrat who is co-sponsoring the bill alongside former Hoboken mayor Ravi Bhalla, also a Democrat, according to The New York Times.
The sponsors didn’t explicitly note the double meaning behind the bill’s acronym, but Brennan told NJ.com the measure “speaks for itself.”
The “F**K ICE Act” is part of a broader package of bills that legislators have recently introduced as a means of protecting immigrants in New Jersey, one of the most diverse states in the nation.
“ICE has no place in our communities,” Bhalla said in a statement. “These bills help our local law enforcement do their jobs properly while giving the state more tools to stop these raids from happening in the first place.”
Lawmakers say the bills were a response to ICE detaining several people in Jersey City and Hoboken, two cities located less than five miles outside of New York City, earlier this month.
During one of the raids, Jersey City Councilman Jake Ephros asked an agent whether he had a warrant. The agent replied: “We don’t need a warrant, bro. Stop getting that into your head,” according to NJ.com.
Some social media users praised the proposed legislation for fighting back against President Donald Trump’s aggressive immigration crackdown.
“PLEASE NEW JERSEY PASS THE LITERAL F**K ICE ACT PLEASE,” one social media user wrote.
However, local Republican lawmakers expressed shock over the bill’s blunt attitude.
“So they’re doing acronyms now,” Republican Assemblyman Mike Inganamort wrote on X. “This sort of radicalism is the inevitable result of an unchecked, 25-year Democratic Majority. It’s what our Republican Minority stands against and why elections matter,” he added.
Another Republican Assemblywoman, Dawn Fantasia, added: “The bill title is wild, but the premise is wilder.”
“Don’t have the text yet, but if it means what it sounds like, that’s illegal entry followed by a state-created pathway to sue over enforcement,” she said.
Several ICE-related bills are moving forward in the New Jersey Legislature, including new versions of two proposals that Gov. Phil Murphy, a Democrat, vetoed before he left office last month.
The bills are expected to be voted on next week by the state Senate and Assembly before heading to the desk of the new governor, Mikie Sherrill, a Democrat and frequent critic of Trump and ICE.
Sherrill has already signed an executive order to create a statewide portal for residents to upload photos and videos of federal immigration enforcement activity and another barring ICE agents from accessing non-public areas of state property without a judicial warrant, according to NJ.com.

Syria demands handover of Bashar al Assad, associates: justice minister

Syria's justice minister said Sunday that the government has demanded the handover of former President Bashar al Assad and all those involved with him, as authorities move forward with a transitional justice process.
Mazhar al-Wais said a recently issued general amnesty decree was a “pressing necessity imposed by the complex legal and legislative reality,” describing it as constitutional and legally sound.
On Wednesday, Syrian President Ahmed al Sharaa issued a decree granting a general amnesty for some crimes and reducing sentences for others.
In an interview with Al Jazeera, Wais said the decree began to be implemented immediately after its issuance, with 1,500 people released so far. He estimated that around half a million Syrians could benefit from the amnesty.
He stressed that the pardon does not cover those responsible for major crimes against Syrians, saying: “No one involved in (spilling) a single drop of blood against the Syrian people has been or will be released.”
On transitional justice, Wais said the ministry is following a “correct path” that rejects both revenge and impunity. He said trials under this framework are expected to begin “in the near future” once judicial files are completed with evidence and documentation.
Regarding accountability for former regime officials, Wais said the Syrian state has stressed “the necessity of handing over Bashar al Assad and all those involved with him,” urging a “clear legal process that places states before their legal and moral obligations.”
“Syrian justice will not remain silent over any criminal, and we will pursue them through appropriate and internationally legitimate legal means,” he added.
Assad, who ruled Syria for nearly 25 years, fled to Russia in late 2024, ending the Baath Party’s decades-long grip on power that began in 1963. A new transitional administration led by al Sharaa was formed in January.

Sudan condemns RSF chief’s visit to Uganda as minimising ‘human values’
Uganda Ministry of Foreign Affairs says Mohamed Dagalo’s meeting with President Yoweri Museveni focused on ending war.
Sudan has condemned Uganda for hosting the head of the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF), Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo, as an “insult” to humanity and the Sudanese people.
In a statement on Sunday, Sudan’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs denounced the reception of Dagalo, also known as “Hemedti”, in the “strongest terms” and his meeting on Friday with Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni.

“This unprecedented step insults humanity before it insults the Sudanese people, and at the same time, it disregards the lives of innocent people killed due to the behaviour of Hemedti and his terrorist militia,” the Foreign Ministry wrote.
Rights groups and international organisations have accused the RSF of war crimes and targeting civilians in Sudan.
Khartoum said hosting Dagalo “disregards” human values.
It “completely disregards the laws governing relations between member states of regional and international organisations that prohibit providing any support for rebel forces against a legitimate, internationally recognised government”, the Foreign Ministry added.
In 2023, Sudan was plunged into a civil war between the Sudanese army, led by Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, and the RSF.
According to the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), at least 11.7 million people have been displaced by the conflict and an estimated 150,000 people have been killed.
Last week, the United States imposed sanctions on three RSF commanders over their alleged roles in the 18-month siege and capture of el‑Fasher, the capital of North Darfur State in western Sudan.
In a statement, the US Department of the Treasury accused the RSF of perpetrating “a horrific campaign of ethnic killings, torture, starvation, and sexual violence” during the siege and capture of el-Fasher, which fell to the RSF in October.
Separately, a UN mission found that the RSF campaign in el-Fasher was a “planned and organised operation that bears the defining characteristics of genocide”.
‘Poisonous’ identity politics
Uganda’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs issued its own statement on Dagalo’s visit and said his meeting with Museveni focused on “ending the ongoing conflict in Sudan and restoring regional stability”.
Museveni reiterated in his remarks to Hemedti that peace in Sudan could only be achieved through dialogue and warned against what he described as identity politics.
“When I last came to Sudan, I met [former] President [Omar al-] Bashir and advised against the politics of identity instead of the politics of interest,” Museveni said.
“Identity politics is poisonous. It does not yield good results. What is important are shared interests that unite people,” he said while calling for both parties to prioritise “peace over military confrontation”.
For his part, Dagalo thanked Museveni and said he shares the Ugandan president’s “principles and your commitment to peace”, according to a statement released by the Ugandan government.
“He noted that Sudan continues to face serious humanitarian and institutional challenges as a result of the conflict and stressed the need for a peaceful resolution,” the statement added.

Secret Service shoots and kills armed man at Trump’s Mar-a-Lago estate

The US Secret Service said the man was observed carrying something that “appeared to be a shotgun and a fuel can.”
A man has died after breaching into the secure perimeter of US president Donald Trump's Mar-a-Lago resort in Palm Beach, Florida. He was armed and driving a vehicle, according to the US Secret Service.
The man, who was in his early 20s and from North Carolina, had a gas can and a shotgun, according to Anthony Guglielmi, the spokesman. He had been reported missing by his family a few days ago, and investigators believe he headed south and picked up the shotgun along the way.
Guglielmi said a box for the weapon was discovered in the man's vehicle after the incident, which took place around 1:30 am.
Trump has faced threats to his life before, including two assassination attempts during the 2024 campaign. Although the president often spends weekends at his resort, he and first lady Melania Trump were at the White House when the breach at Mar-a-Lago occurred.
After entering near the north gate of the property, the man was confronted by two Secret Service agents and a Palm Beach County sheriff's deputy, according to Palm Beach County Sheriff Ric Bradshaw.
“He was ordered to drop those two pieces of equipment that he had with them. At which time he put down the gas can, raised the shotgun to a shooting position,” Bradshaw said at a brief press conference. The two agents and the deputy “fired their weapons to neutralize the threat.”
The FBI asked residents who live near Mar-a-Lago to check any security cameras they may have for footage that could help investigators.
The man who was killed has not been publicly identified. Investigators are working to compile a psychological profile and a motive is still under investigation. Asked whether the individual was known to law enforcement, Bradshaw said “not right now.”
The incident comes as the United States has been rocked by spasms political violence.
The incursion at Mar-a-Lago took place a few miles from Trump's West Palm Beach club where a man tried to assassinate him while he played golf during the 2024 campaign.
A Secret Service agent spotted that man, Ryan Routh, aiming a rifle through the shrubbery before Trump came into view. Officials said Routh aimed his rifle at the agent, who opened fire and caused Routh to drop his weapon.
Routh was found guilty last year and sentenced this month to life in prison.
Trump also survived an assassination attempt at a Butler, Pennsylvania campaign rally. That gunman fired eight shots before being killed by a Secret Service counter sniper.
The White House referred all questions to the Secret Service and FBI.
There have been other recent incidents of political violence as well.
In the last year, there was the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk; the assassination of the Democratic leader in the Minnesota state House and her husband and the shooting of another lawmaker and his wife; and an arson attack at the official residence of Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro.
Five days ago, a Georgia man armed with a shotgun was arrested as he sprinted towards the west side of the US Capitol.

JPMorgan Chase makes stunning revelation about Trump’s accounts
- JPMorgan Chase has confirmed it closed accounts belonging to Donald Trump and several of his businesses in February 2021, following the Jan. 6, 2021, events at the US Capitol.
- This acknowledgment was made in a recent court filing as part of a $5 billion lawsuit filed by Donald Trump against the banking giant, alleging his accounts were closed for political reasons.
- Previously, JPMorgan had not explicitly admitted to closing Trump's accounts, stating generally that it closes accounts due to legal or regulatory risk, not for political or religious motives.
- A letter from JPMorgan to Donald Trump, dated February 19, 2021, informed him of the decision, recommending he find 'a more suitable institution'.
- Donald Trump's lawsuit accuses JPMorgan of trade libel and alleges he was placed on a reputational 'blacklist', with the bank now seeking to move the case from Florida to federal court in New York.

This 89-year-old is 'King of the Volunteers' at the Olympics and will star in the closing ceremony
Mario Gargiulo has returned to the Olympics 70 years after his first visit, now as the Games’ oldest volunteer
- Bookmark
When Mario Gargiulo traveled to the 1956 Cortina Winter Games, his first trip to northern Italy from his hometown of Naples, the 20-year-old never imagined he'd return to the Olympics.
But he has, 70 years later, this time as the so-called “King of the Volunteers.” He was among the first of 18,000 volunteers to sign up and, on Sunday in Verona, the 89-year-old will take the stage of the Olympics closing ceremony with a starring role: the Games' oldest volunteer.
“To be part of it is incredible,” he told The Associated Press on Sunday morning, hours before the ceremony at the ancient Roman Arena that's a short walk from his home. “I’ll wake up tomorrow and I’ll be wondering what happened to me.”
“It's beyond imagination,” he said.
‘Sport is a common tie’
When Gargiulo turned up for the first meeting of volunteers in Verona, he stood out.
“They were all 20, 25 years old, girls and boys, and they were looking at me sort of strange,” he said, laughing.
But the widowed father of three and grandfather of seven who has led a globetrotting life embodies the Olympic spirit.
His 1956 train ride to Cortina d'Ampezzo was his first journey north of Rome, and his first trip alone. Only able to afford a room without heat during the Winter Games, he went to sleep wearing every layer of clothing he'd brought.
The village known as "Queen of the Dolomites" today is a luxury resort replete with upscale fashion boutiques, in part due to the spotlight brought by the 1956 Olympics. At the time, it was small, quiet and little known beyond Italy's upper crust. Gargiulo relished the chance to watch figure skating and speedskating.
“I was astounded because seeing all these flags, people of different countries,” he said. “Sport is a common tie for everybody. And after awhile, even if you don't know anything about the sport you're watching, the competition, you become a fan.”
He enjoyed the Cortina so much that, after he married an American woman, they honeymooned there.
He later enlisted in the U.S. Army. Over the course of his 27-year military career, his language skills led him to serve across the U.S. as well as in Korea, Vietnam, Germany and Russia before retiring in 1994 as a lieutenant colonel.
‘A different plan for you’
But he was disappointed when his 2026 marching orders came through: he wouldn't be traveling from Verona to Cortina, not even to Milan. He wrote a letter to organizers, urging them to reconsider.
“They said, ‘We have a different plan for you,’” he said. “Then it turned out really it was something exceptional.”
This month, he followed Italian Alpine skier Federica Brignone ’s super-G victory, just 10 months after she broke multiple bones in her left leg, as well as speedskating and freestyle skiing.
But on Sunday, he will step into the spotlight on stage for the closing ceremony — though he can't disclose any details.
“My pace, my tempo, has slowed down a bit,” he said. “But my heartbeat is still the same.”

Greenland and Denmark reject US hospital ship offered by Trump
France

00:23:02 KST

Denmark and its territory Greenland on Sunday, February 22, rejected Donald Trump's offer to send a naval hospital ship to the Arctic island coveted by the US leader. A day earlier, Trump said he was sending "a great hospital boat to Greenland to take care of the many people who are sick, and not being taken care of there." But Greenlandic Prime Minister Jens-Frederik Nielsen, who heads the autonomous territory's government, wrote on his Facebook page: "That will be 'no thanks' from us."
"President Trump's idea to send a US hospital ship here to Greenland has been duly noted. But we have a public health system where care is free for citizens," Nielsen said.
Danish Defense Minister Troels Lund Poulsen likewise told Danish broadcaster DR: "The Greenlandic population receives the healthcare it needs. They receive it either in Greenland, or, if they require specialised treatment, they receive it in Denmark." He added: "It's not as if there's a need for a special healthcare initiative in Greenland."
On the day that Trump made his proposal, Danish forces evacuated a crew member of a US submarine off the coast of Greenland's capital Nuuk after the sailor requested urgent medical attention. Denmark's Joint Arctic Command said in a post on Facebook the crew member was flown to a hospital in Nuuk after an unspecified medical emergency on board the vessel.
AI-generated hospital ship
In Greenland, as in Denmark, access to healthcare is free. There are five regional hospitals across the vast Arctic island, with the one in the capital Nuuk serving patients from all over the territory. Without explicitly mentioning the US proposal, Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen said she was "happy to live in a country where access to healthcare is free and equal for all. Where insurance or wealth does not determine whether one receives dignified treatment."
Trump, in his Truth Social message on Saturday proposing a hospital ship, posted an AI-generated image of a US Navy medical vessel, USNS Mercy. It was not immediately clear if that meant he was deploying that ship to Greenland. "We are going to send a great hospital boat to Greenland to take care of the many people who are sick, and not being taken care of there," Trump wrote. "It's on the way!!!" he added.
The US president indicated the deployment was being carried out in coordination with Jeff Landry, appointed in December as the US Special Envoy to the Arctic island.
Aaja Chemnitz, who represents Greenland in the Danish Parliament, wrote on Facebook that while Greenland's health system had its share of problems, they were best resolved through cooperation with Denmark – "which is one of the wealthiest and most educated countries, for example in the field of healthcare. Not with the United States, which has its own healthcare system problems."
Trump has repeatedly said he believes the United States must control Greenland to ensure US national security. Earlier threats he made to seize the territory, by force if necessary, have ebbed since he struck a "framework" deal with NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte to ensure greater US influence.
The defense minister, Lund Poulsen, told DR he was not aware of a possible arrival of the suggested US hospital ship. "Trump is constantly tweeting about Greenland. So this is undoubtedly an expression of the new normal that has taken hold in international politics," he said.

Liza Minnelli accuses the Oscars of forcing her to sit in wheelchair
- Liza Minnelli claims in her forthcoming memoir, kids">Kids, Wait Till You Hear This!, that she was forced into a wheelchair to present an award at the 2022 Oscars alongside Lady Gaga.
- Minnelli states she was originally meant to sit in a director's chair but was “inexplicably ordered” to use a wheelchair for “safety reasons” due to her age, which she called “bullshit.”
- She alleges that Lady Gaga insisted she would not go on stage with her unless she was in a wheelchair, leaving Minnelli “heartbroken” and unable to read the teleprompter clearly.
- Minnelli recounts stumbling over words during the presentation, with Lady Gaga stepping in to say, “I got you,” which Minnelli perceived as Gaga playing the “kindhearted hero.”
- These claims echo previous statements by Minnelli's friend, pianist Michael Feinstein, who suggested the change happened “literally five minutes before she went on” following the Will Smith incident.

Clashes erupt at Iran universities as Basij confront protesters waving pre-1979 revolution flag | Watch

Protests resumed Sunday at several universities in Iran, with clashes reported between anti-regime students and members of the Basij militia, as tensions mount amid U.S. threats and renewed nuclear talks.
Demonstrations were reported at Amir Kabir University and Sharif University in Tehran, coinciding with the start of the academic semester. According to opposition-linked outlet Iran International, protests have expanded in recent days, including in the western city of Abdanan, following the arrest of a lecturer. Protesters there chanted “Death to Khamenei” and “Death to the dictator.”
Video circulated by opposition channels and media affiliated with the regime showed scuffles that escalated into punches and beatings as Basij members sought to disperse anti-government demonstrators while shielding pro-regime students. Iranian state-linked media reported that one student was injured in the eye by stones thrown by other students.
At Sharif University, footage shared by opposition activists showed students surrounding two demonstrators who waved the lion and sun flag associated with Iran before the 1979 Islamic Revolution. Loud cheers were heard as the flag was raised, with at least one of the students attempting to conceal his face.
Clashes were also reported at Ferdowsi University in Mashhad and at Iran University of Science and Technology in Tehran.
State-affiliated media focused instead on pro-regime rallies at universities. The Fars news agency reported that demonstrators at the University of Tehran expressed “hatred” toward the United States and chanted “Death to America.” Participants were also said to have honored those killed in last month’s unrest and called for national unity.
At Shahid Beheshti University in Tehran, pro-regime supporters chanted “Death or Khamenei,” in contrast to anti-regime slogans calling for the supreme leader’s removal. At Sharif University, pro-government demonstrators burned U.S. and Israeli flags.
While the protests did not appear large in scale, their renewal comes after a sweeping crackdown on mass demonstrations last month. U.S. President Donald Trump claimed over the weekend that 32,000 people were killed in the unrest, though those figures have not been independently verified. Since the crackdown, few significant protests have been reported, aside from anti-regime chants heard at some funeral gatherings.
The unrest unfolds amid escalating tensions with Washington. Trump has issued Iran a “10 to 15-day” ultimatum to reach an agreement limiting its nuclear and missile programs and ending support for regional militias and terrorist organizations.
A senior Iranian official said Sunday that a new round of talks is planned for early March, though key disputes remain over sanctions relief in exchange for nuclear restrictions. Both Iranian and U.S. sources have indicated that an interim agreement remains a possibility.
Meanwhile, U.S. military preparations continue. The aircraft carrier USS Gerald R. Ford recently entered the Mediterranean and is expected to be deployed in the eastern Mediterranean as part of efforts to bolster defenses in the event of a conflict with Iran.
Trump’s envoy, Steve Witkoff, told Fox News that the president is “curious” why Iran has not yielded despite the U.S. military buildup. Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian said Saturday that Iran would not “bow its head despite pressure from world powers,” adding that the country would overcome the current phase.

Police said Sunday afternoon that they have opened an investigation into the death of a five-month-old baby at a day care in Jerusalem.
The circumstances of the incident remain unclear. Police said they are taking testimony from the caregiver, who claims that the infant had choked. However, according to Magen David Adom (MDA), there are signs consistent with drowning. The circumstances are still under investigation.
The baby was initially evacuated in critical condition to Shaare Zedek Medical Center in Jerusalem, where doctors later pronounced her dead.
“Officers who arrived at the scene opened an investigation and began collecting evidence, including taking the caregiver’s account, in order to clarify the circumstances of the case,” police said in a statement.
The hospital said the infant was brought in after prolonged resuscitation efforts had already been carried out at the scene. “Resuscitation efforts continued in the emergency department, but unfortunately her death was pronounced. We share in the family’s grief,” the hospital said.
The incident was reported at 1:18 p.m. to MDA’s 101 emergency hotline in the Jerusalem region, with callers stating that an unconscious baby had been found at a caregiver’s home in the city. Paramedics and EMTs provided medical treatment and transported her to the hospital while continuing resuscitation efforts.
“When we arrived at the scene, the baby was unconscious, without a pulse and not breathing,” said MDA medic Daniel Elikim. “We provided medical treatment and performed prolonged resuscitation efforts as we transported her to the hospital, where doctors continued to fight for her life.”

Armed Man Fatally Shot by Law Enforcement at Mar-a-Lago, Secret Service Says

A man was shot and killed by law enforcement after "unlawfully entering" the grounds of President Donald Trump’s Mar-a-Lago club in Palm Beach, Florida, in the early hours of Sunday morning, the Secret Service said.
The man was seen near the north gate of the complex carrying “what appeared to be a shotgun and a fuel can,” the Secret Service said in a statement on X. He was shot by Secret Service agents and a Deputy from the Palm Beach County Sheriff’s Office, the statement said.
The man killed was identified by investigators as 21-year-old Austin Tucker Martin, the Associated Press reported, citing a person familiar with the investigation who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to publicly discuss details of the investigation.
President Trump was not at Mar-a-Lago at the time of the shooting.

"The incident, including the individual’s background, actions, potential motive, and the use of force, is under investigation by the FBI, the U.S. Secret Service, and the Palm Beach County Sheriff’s Office," the Secret Service said.
At a Sunday morning news conference, Palm Beach County Sheriff Ric Bradshaw said that at 1:30 am, a deputy and two Secret Service agents confronted a “white male” who had made his way into the inner perimeter of the property and was holding a gas can and a shotgun.
“He was ordered to drop those two pieces of equipment that he had with him, at which time he put down the gas can, raised the shotgun to a shooting position,” Bradshaw said. “At that point in time, the deputy and the two Secret Service agents fired their weapons and neutralized the threat.” The suspect was declared dead at the scene.
Bradshaw said that no security personnel were wounded during the encounter, and he then distributed photographs of the shotgun and gas can to the media at the conference.
President Trump previously survived an assassination attempt on the campaign trail in July 2024, when he was shot at during an event in Butler, Pennsylvania. One person in the audience was killed, and two were critically injured in the incident. The shooter, 20-year-old Thomas Matthew Crooks, was shot and killed by law enforcement.
Then, in September 2024, Secret Service members spotted a man hiding with a rifle in the bushes of Trump International Golf Club in West Palm Beach, where the president was playing, just one hole away. That man, later identified as Ryan Routh, was found guilty in September 2025 of trying to assassinate the President.
Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told Fox News Sunday morning that he spoke with Trump, and that he and his family “shouldn’t have to endure attempt after attempt."
FBI Director Kash Patel said on X that the agency would be “dedicating all necessary resources” to the investigation.
This is a developing story and will be updated.

US-Iran Geneva talks to resume Friday if nuclear deal proposal in 48 hours - Axios

US envoys Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner will meet with Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi in Geneva, Switzerland, on Thursday for an additional round of nuclear talks, sources told The Jerusalem Post on Sunday.
Axios, citing senior US officials, initially reported that US negotiators will hold another round of talks with Iran on Friday in Geneva if they "receive a detailed Iranian proposal for a nuclear deal in the next 48 hours.
Omani Foreign Minister Badr bin Hamad al-Busaidi also wrote on his official X/Twitter that he was "pleased to confirm US-Iran negotiations are now set for Geneva this Thursday, with a positive push to go the extra mile towards finalizing the deal."
What happened in last Iran-US nuclear talks?
In the last round of nuclear talks in Geneva last week, Witkoff and Jared Kushner told Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi that US President Donald Trump is maintaining a position of "zero enrichment" of uranium within Iran, but that the US is willing to consider an Iranian proposal that includes "token enrichment" if Iran can prove that it will block every pathway to achieving a nuclear weapon, according to Axios.
This comes after Senator Lindsey Graham told the outlet on Saturday that several people around Trump have been advising the president not to strike Iran. Graham has been urging the president to ignore this advice, Axios reported.
"I understand concerns about major military operations in the Middle East, given past entanglements. However, the voices who counsel against getting entangled seem to ignore the consequences of letting evil go unchecked," Graham told the outlet.
The previous round of talks was productive, but significant gaps remain, several sources told The Jerusalem Post on Tuesday.
US Vice President JD Vance said Iran is not yet willing to acknowledge Trump's "redlines," particularly those regarding the Islamic Republic's nuclear program, in a Tuesday statement.
“In some ways it went well, they agreed to meet afterwards, but in other ways it was very clear that the President has set some red lines that the Iranians are not yet willing to actually acknowledge and work through,” Vance told Fox News.
Iran could be close to enriching uranium for bomb-making material, US envoy Steve Witkoff claims
This comes after Witkoff told Fox News on Saturday that Iran could theoretically be about a week away from being able to enrich its existing uranium to a weaponized level, though the envoy left out that Iran currently has no access to its material, no machines to enrich it, and no weapons program to use it for any operational purpose.
"They're probably a week away from having industrial-grade bomb-making material. And that's really dangerous. So they can't have that," Witkoff said on Fox News's My View with host Lara Trump, clearly wanting to highlight the severity of the potential future nuclear issues should Iran rebuild all the other elements of its nuclear program, which were bombed in June 2025.
In June 2025, Israel and the US destroyed Iran's entire fleet of around 20,000 nuclear centrifuge fleet, its entire multifaceted weaponization program, most of its three major nuclear sites, dozens of minor nuclear sites, killed most of its leading nuclear scientists, and caved in portions of its nuclear facilities, making it hard for the Islamic Republic to access its existing enriched uranium.

Teacher shortage: The statistic shaking Israel’s education system - opinion
Unknown

00:12:34 KST

Approximately two weeks ago, the head of Israel’s Local Government Association revealed that the state plans to bring 5,000 workers from Sri Lanka and India to staff kindergartens across Israel. This announcement is yet another sign of the severe crisis gripping the country’s education system.
Israel’s schools are suffering from a dangerous combination of teacher shortages, high attrition rates, and a devaluation of the teaching profession. According to recent data from the Knesset Research and Information Center, one in ten new teachers leaves the system in their first year, one in five departs in their first five years, and some 3,000 graduates of teaching programs never enter the education system at all.
Israel prides itself on being a start-up nation, but when nearly 80% of school principals report significant teacher shortages, when many schools are missing three or more teachers, and when gaps are especially acute in core subjects like English and mathematics, the country’s ability to sustain its hi-tech achievements comes into question.
The danger of a teacher shortage
A quarter of principals report that the lack of qualified teachers is already harming the quality of instruction – far above the average among OECD countries. These are not just dry statistics – they bring us closer to a dystopian reality in which educators and students face a system that recruits “anyone with a pulse” to fill classroom teaching positions, at the expense of real education.
At the same time, Israeli society is grappling with unprecedented levels of violence and social tension – manifestations not only of an educational crisis but also of a deep moral fracture. In a reality where students stab other students, teachers are attacked, and bullying and harassment are rampant, the role of the teacher as a moral guide has never been more critical. Without them, schools lose their ability to be safe spaces where values like mutual respect, empathy, and collaboration are instilled. The education system’s potential to shape culture and nurture healthy social discourse is at risk when it is itself mired in structural and behavioral crises.
The vision of a model society, as articulated in the writings of Theodor Herzl, was never meant to be an unreachable utopia: It was a goal around which society could organize itself. He imagined a society governed by justice, one that cares for individuals and educates toward values that go beyond technical knowledge to embrace humanity itself. An education system that struggles to retain professionals capable of imparting these values is far from realizing Herzl’s vision. The shortage of teachers is not only a human resources problem – it is a national and social identity question: What kind of generation do we want to raise, and which messages do we want embedded in the daily lives of our children?
The respected educator Chaim Peri once said, “Education builds society”– but what happens when there are no builders left? Only broad systemic change will keep them in the profession: improvements in salaries and professional development, strong training pathways, mentoring support for every teacher throughout their career, and public and governmental recognition of the teaching role – these are all essential. Many other countries, including some in the OECD, combine extensive support for teaching with government funding that guarantees excellent employment conditions, continuous training, and incentives to retain teachers over time.
Education is the heart of any stable and thriving society. Investing in teachers is not a luxury: it is the fundamental mechanism for sustaining a society that views education as a tool for national resilience, shapes its future citizens, and safeguards core guiding values.
In Israel, a country founded on the vision of a model society, this is not just aspirational rhetoric – it’s a matter of survival. If we fail to invest now in securing the future of our children’s education, and instead privatize the system while neglecting Israeli educators, we are forfeiting the future of society itself.

- Responding on Real Time, Maher expressed confusion over Trump's assumption that he would stop criticizing him after the meal.
- Maher stated he never ceased criticizing Trump and never promised to do so.
- He humorously likened Trump's expectation to a man buying dinner and expecting a favor in return.

New generation of Israeli voters more traditional, right-wing, poll shows - analysis

Start with a number that should unsettle the Israeli Left: 75. That’s the percentage of first-time Israeli voters who identify as right-wing, according to an N12 news site poll conducted by the Midgam research institute that aired on Saturday night.
Among veteran voters, the figure is 68. Seven points may not sound like a revolution. In a country where fractions decide elections and demography shapes destiny, this figure is closer to a verdict.
Israel’s Left has spent years telling itself that the next generation would rescue it. The young, educated, connected cohort coming of age in a globalized country, it believed, would eventually drift toward the liberal center, as young people in other democracies supposedly do. Midgam’s data says the opposite is happening. The drift is going the other direction, and it’s accelerating.
That is worth sitting with before reaching for an explanation.
The same poll showed 59% of new voters aligned with the Right bloc overall, against 41% for the opposition. But the more telling figures were cultural.
33% Belief in God or a higher power
Forty-three percent of new voters say they kiss mezuzot. Among veteran voters, 33% say the same. As for belief in God or a higher power, the numbers stand at 80% among new voters 75% among veterans.
Moreover, 56% of new voters and 51% of veterans believe in the coming of the Messiah, the poll further showed.
Israel’s secular Ashkenazi establishment, the founding elite that still largely controls the country’s media, judiciary, and cultural institutions, has long operated on an implicit assumption: modernity moves in one direction. Education, urbanization, and prosperity gradually dissolve tradition. The grandchildren of religious immigrants become secular professionals, and the grandchildren of secular professionals become liberal cosmopolitans.
The Midgam data suggests that the arc has bent back on itself in Israel. The youngest cohort entering the electorate is more traditionally Jewish in everyday practice than the cohort it’s replacing. It is more likely to feel the weight of a mezuzah, to hold open a theological possibility its parents quietly closed.
One data point complicates the picture. Forty-six percent of veteran voters say they avoid lashon hara, negative speech, and slander, compared with 41% of new voters. So – more traditional in some ways, less so in others. The portrait isn’t simple, which is precisely what makes it worth examining carefully.
The most explosive finding has nothing to do with Netanyahu
On politics proper, the picture sharpens fast, and the most explosive finding has nothing to do with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.
Around 60% of veteran voters say they wouldn’t vote for a party that supports the current haredi (ultra-Orthodox) draft exemption law. Among new voters, the figure is comparable. This number is the most politically combustible data point in the entire segment.
For a generation shaped by Hamas’s October 7 massacre as a lived catastrophe, with friends killed and wounded, months of reserve duty, funerals attended, and plans suspended indefinitely, the question of who serves and who doesn’t isn’t a coalition management problem. Rather, it’s a question about what citizenship actually means.
Israeli politicians have treated the haredi exemption as an equation to be balanced, a deal to be cut and recut in exchange for governing majorities. The generation now entering the electorate is done with that. It is measuring the social contract in deployment orders and body bags.
Even among veteran Likud voters, only 33% say they’d vote for a party backing the exemption, 31% say they wouldn’t, and 36% remain undecided. That’s a coalition waiting to fracture.
Then there’s the harder finding. Forty-six percent of new voters say there was “betrayal from within” on October 7. Among veteran voters, the figure is 37%. Among veteran opposition voters, it falls to 21%. Among the youngest cohort, this is a plurality view.
Trauma at the scale Israel experienced produces suspicion alongside courage. It creates a hunger for explanations that assign clear guilt and a readiness to believe that institutions failed by design rather than by incompetence. Social media, which this generation inhabits more completely than any before it, supplies and amplifies exactly those explanations around the clock.
The Netanyahu question fits the same pattern. Among new voters, 49% accept the prime minister’s claim that the cases against him are politically fabricated, compared to 36% who don’t. Among veteran voters, it’s essentially reversed: 35% believe him, 46% don’t.
A generation skeptical of establishment institutions turns out to be skeptical of establishment prosecutions, too. Whether that skepticism is warranted is a separate question; its political weight isn’t.
Support for a state commission of inquiry for October 7 tracks the same way. Sixty-four percent of veteran voters support one. Among new voters, 55% do. Among new voters in the coalition specifically, 47% are in favor, 25% are opposed, 25% are undecided, and 3% say no investigation is needed at all.
Now look at where this generation’s votes are actually going. Among new voters who sat out the last election, Likud leads at 20%. United Torah Judaism, the party most identified with the draft exemption position that 60% of voters call disqualifying, comes in second at 11%.
By and by, Naftali Bennett’s movement is at 10%, National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir is at 7%, the Democrats is at 5%, Shas is at 4.5%, Yisrael Beytenu is at 4%, Yesh Atid and Blue and White are at 3.5% each, Gadi Eisenkot’s movement and the Reservists party are at 3% apiece, and Religious Zionism is at 2.5%.
Sixteen percent haven’t decided.
A cohort that says the draft exemption is a deal-breaker is still parking real support with the party that champions it. That’s the behavior of a generation whose partisan loyalties haven’t caught up with its convictions yet. The mood is settled. The political home isn’t.
Israel’s youngest voters came of age under rocket fire, buried their friends, watched October 7 unfold on their phones, and emerged more traditional, more hawkish, more suspicious of institutions, and angrier about who was exempted from all of it. Their party loyalties are still scattered. Their direction isn’t.
You’d better start paying attention.

Iran protests resurface at universities as war risk persists
Sign up now: Get ST's newsletters delivered to your inbox
Students in Iran staged anti-government rallies at several universities for a second day, testing a fragile calm imposed after the deadly crackdown on protests in January
Footage published on social media on Feb 22 showed chants directed at the country’s leadership, calls for the release of political detainees, and clashes between demonstrators and security forces at universities across Tehran and other cities.
Protests swept Iran in January over worsening living conditions and state failures, sparking nationwide calls for an end to the country’s clerical leadership. The government responded with a sweeping crackdown, marking the deadliest suppression in the Islamic Republic’s history.
Videos from Tehran’s Amir Kabir University of Technology, a long-time protest hot spot, showed students clashing with Basij militias, a state-backed volunteer paramilitary force. Footage from Khajeh Nasir Toosi University of Technology in Tehran showed students chanting: “We fight, we die, we will take Iran back.”
Other videos showed anti-government slogans at Ferdowsi University in the north-eastern city of Mashhad.
Gatherings also continued for a second day at several other campuses, including Sharif University of Technology in Tehran, where social media posts showed students on Feb 21 chanting against Iran’s rulers and in support of the exiled son of Iran’s Shah, who was deposed after the 1979 revolution.
None of the footage could be independently verified by Bloomberg.
The protests come as the country continues to grapple with economic strains and remains under the threat of potential US military strikes. On Feb 22, the rial traded at around 1.65 million rial (S$1.63) to the US dollar in the unregulated market, a record low and almost 14 per cent weaker than the sharp depreciation in late December that initially sparked the protests.
In January, US President Donald Trump expressed support for Iranian protesters, stating that “help is on its way” as he warned Tehran of military action if it continued to suppress demonstrators.
In recent weeks, Mr Trump has continued to deploy US military assets to the Middle East, and on Feb 20, he warned that Iran has a 10- to 15-day window to reach a new nuclear agreement to avert US strikes.
On Feb 22, Reuters cited a senior Iranian official, who was not identified, as saying the next round of nuclear talks between Tehran and Washington is set for early March.
The official added that Iran could consider exporting part of its highly enriched uranium stockpile, diluting the purity of its enriched material, and participating in a regional consortium for uranium enrichment if it maintains its “peaceful nuclear enrichment”.
Iranian officials have accused the US and Israel of plotting and fuelling unrest. But the country’s Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, indirectly acknowledged the role of his security forces in the killings during a public meeting on Feb 17.
He said that he was “grieving” for those who died in the unrest, but added that “wherever the bullet came from, it occurred amid the enemy’s sedition”. BLOOMBERG

Hong Kong eyes booking system, fees after campers overrun hotspots
Agricultural, Fisheries and Conservation Department reveals plan amid calls for stronger public education, law enforcement and visitor limits at popular sites
Hong Kong authorities are looking at implementing a booking system and charging fees for camping hotspots as part of a review of management strategies in response to public concerns about overcrowded beaches and litter during the Lunar New Year holiday.
The Agricultural, Fisheries and Conservation Department (AFCD) posted its plan on its Facebook page on Sunday after campers and hikers called for stronger public education, law enforcement and limits on visitor numbers at popular sites.
At Ham Tin Wan in Sai Kung, a beach popular among campers and tourists, more than 900 tents were erected over Thursday and Friday nights, Greenpeace reported.
And 42 per cent of the 166 tents spotted at Sai Wan on Thursday evening were pitched outside designated areas.
The AFCD said it was “deeply concerned” about how to protect the ecology of Sai Kung East Country Park given the influx of visitors, adding that it had drawn up a management plan before the Lunar New Year “golden week” holiday, which started on February 15 and runs until Monday.
To address these issues, staff have been deployed to promote camping etiquette, patrol the area and enforce regulations.

Iraq submits updated maritime boundaries to United Nations; Kuwait lodges protest
The Iraqi Ministry of Foreign Affairs on Saturday announced that it had submitted updated geographic coordinates to the United Nations, thereby formally delineating Iraq’s maritime boundaries in accordance with the 1982 United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea.
This submission prompted an official protest from Kuwait, which contends that elements of Iraq’s filing infringe upon Kuwaiti maritime sovereignty.
In a statement, Iraq's foreign ministry said that the submission was delivered to the UN Secretary-General on 19 January and 9 February 2026. It contains specified geographic coordinates and an illustrative map, as mandated by Articles 16(2), 75(2), and 84(2) of the convention.
The ministry indicated that the submission defines Iraq’s straight baselines and those based on the lowest low-water line for measuring its territorial sea.
It further delineates the boundaries of Iraq’s territorial sea, contiguous zone, exclusive economic zone (EEZ), and continental shelf. The coordinates were prepared using the internationally recognised World Geodetic System 1984 (WGS-84).
The ministry stated that this filing supersedes previous submissions from December 7, 2021, and April 15, 2011. The update aims to align Iraq’s maritime data with international law and to enhance legal clarity regarding its maritime zones.
The coordinates and map are accessible on the official website of the UN Division for Ocean Affairs and the Law of the Sea, under the Office of Legal Affairs, for use by member states and stakeholders.
The Iraqi Foreign Ministry reiterated Iraq’s commitment to international law and its intention to regulate maritime rights within established legal frameworks, thereby promoting regional stability and cooperation.
Kuwait Summons Iraqi Chargé d’Affaires
In response, the Kuwaiti Ministry of Foreign Affairs stated on Saturday that it had expressed concern about Iraq’s submission of maritime coordinates and the accompanying map to the United Nations.
Kuwait asserted that Iraq’s submission includes claims affecting Kuwaiti sovereignty over specific maritime areas and features, such as Fasht Al-Qaid and Fasht Al-Aij, which Kuwait maintains have never been subject to dispute concerning its full sovereignty.
The Kuwaiti Foreign Ministry summoned the Iraqi chargé d’affaires and delivered an official protest rejecting what it described as Iraqi claims infringing upon Kuwait’s maritime sovereignty and associated features.
Kuwait urged Iraq to consider the historical relationship between the two countries and to act in accordance with international law, the 1982 United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, and existing bilateral agreements and memoranda of understanding.
This development occurs amid ongoing legal and political repercussions arising from Iraq’s maritime arrangements with Kuwait, particularly following the Supreme Federal Court's annulment of the Khor Abdullah maritime agreement in 2023.
The treaty, signed in 2012 and ratified by Iraq’s parliament in 2013 as Law 42, regulated navigation in the Khor Abdullah waterway. The court ruled it unconstitutional because the required two-thirds parliamentary majority for ratifying international agreements was absent.
The ruling initiated debate concerning Iraq’s constitutional obligations, international commitments, and maritime rights in the Gulf. It also raised concerns in Kuwait and further complicated bilateral maritime arrangements.
Some Iraqi lawmakers and legal experts argue that the annulment renders the treaty void and obliges the government to notify the United Nations and the International Maritime Organisation.
In contrast, other government officials maintain that the agreement remains valid until it is replaced or re-ratified through constitutional procedures.
In April, independent MP and former transport minister Amir Abdul Jabbar Ismael filed a complaint against Prime Minister Mohammed Shia al-Sudani under Article 329 of the Iraqi Penal Code, which addresses abuse of power and obstruction of justice.
Ismael alleged that al-Sudani instructed ministries not to forward the court’s ruling to the UN and the International Maritime Organisation, as required by the annulled treaty.
Sheikh Latif Mustafa, a constitutional law expert and former Iraqi MP, stated last year to The New Arab that the treaty cannot be reinstated unless the court reverses its decision or parliament reapproves the agreement with the requisite majority, both of which he considers improbable.
Numerous experts and public figures have instead advocated for renewed negotiations with Kuwait under updated legal and maritime frameworks and the debate has highlighted Iraq’s broader maritime vulnerabilities, as a nearly-landlocked nation.
On July 17, 2025, Iraq and Kuwait held the tenth session of their Joint Technical and Legal Committee on maritime borders. Discussions focused on the area beyond UN marker 162, the final point established under United Nations Security Council Resolution 833 in 1993.
While Kuwait confirmed the meeting, Iraq has not issued a formal statement. Reports of the talks drew criticism from Iraqi lawmakers and former officials, who warned that negotiations beyond marker 162 could undermine Iraq’s sovereignty and affect access to key infrastructure such as the Grand Faw Port.

Somaliland willing to give US access to minerals and military bases, says minister
Somaliland – a breakaway region of Somalia seeking international recognition – is willing to give the United States access to its minerals and military bases, a minister told AFP on Saturday. Israel became the only country in the world to recognise Somaliland's independence in December as the Mogadishu government still considers it an integral part of Somalia.
Somaliland is willing to give the United States access to its minerals and military bases, a minister has told AFP, as the breakaway region of Somalia seeks international recognition.
Israel became the only country in the world to recognise Somaliland's independence in December – something the territory has been seeking since declaring its autonomy from Somalia in 1991.
The government in Mogadishu still considers Somaliland an integral part of Somalia even though the territory has run its own affairs since 1991, with its own passports, currency, army and police force.
"We are willing to give exclusive (access to our minerals) to the United States. Also, we are open to offer military bases to the United States," Khadar Hussein Abdi, minister of the presidency, told AFP in an interview on Saturday.

"We believe that we will agree on something with the United States."
Somaliland president Abdirahman Mohamed Abdullahi already suggested in recent weeks granting Israel privileged access to its mineral resources.
And Khadar Hussein Abdi said he could not rule out the possibility of also allowing Israel to set up a military presence.
Somaliland lies across the Gulf of Aden from Yemen, where Houthi rebels have often attacked Israeli assets to show solidarity with Palestinians.
Somaliland officials have said their soil is rich in lithium, coltan and other sought-after resources, though independent studies are lacking.
Turkey plea
Shortly after Israel's recognition at the end of December, social media was flooded with photos of men and women displaying the Israeli flag – one of them even using it as a hijab.
Somali President Hassan Sheikh Mohamud, on the other hand, denounced it as "the greatest violation of Somalia's sovereignty" and a "threat to the security and stability of the world and the region".

The African Union and most Arab countries threw their support behind Somalia and condemned the move.
The US, however, defended what it said was Israel's right to recognise Somaliland, although President Donald Trump said he was unlikely to follow suit, despite pressure from some within his Republican party.
Khadar Hussein Abdi reached out specifically to Turkey, another country that objected to Israel's move, telling AFP that Turkish officials "must talk to us, not to Mogadishu" as Somalia had no functioning state.
"It is fragmented factions who sit in Mogadishu. They don't agree on anything," he said.
"So focusing on that does not help the security of the region."

US Secret Service kills armed man entering perimeter of Trump’s Mar-a-Lago resort
Authorities said the man, identified as 21-year-old Austin Tucker Martin, was carrying what appeared to be a shotgun and a fuel can
An armed man drove into the secure perimeter of Mar-a-Lago, US President Donald Trump’s resort in Palm Beach, Florida, as another vehicle was exiting before being shot and killed early on Sunday morning, according to a spokesman for the US Secret Service.
The man, who was in his early 20s and from North Carolina, had a gas can and a shotgun, according to Anthony Guglielmi, the spokesman. He had been reported missing by his family a few days ago and investigators believe he headed south, picking up the shotgun along the way.
Guglielmi said a box for the weapon was discovered in the man’s vehicle after the incident, which took place at around 1.30am.
The man killed was identified by investigators as 21-year-old Austin Tucker Martin, according to a person familiar with the matter. The person spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorised to publicly discuss details of the investigation.
Trump has faced threats to his life before, including two assassination attempts during the 2024 campaign. Although the president often spends weekends at his resort, he and first lady Melania Trump were at the White House when the breach at Mar-a-Lago took place.
After entering near the north gate of the property, the man was confronted by two Secret Service agents and a Palm Beach County sheriff’s deputy, according to Palm Beach County Sheriff Ric Bradshaw.

Lamborghini pulls plug on plans to launch all-electric supercar

00:03:06 KST

The Italian supercar manufacturer Lamborghini has abandoned plans to make all-electric vehicles, and will instead focus on making plug-in hybrid cars, after a drop-off in demand for EVs among its wealthy clientele.
Lamborghini unveiled its first all-electric concept car, the Lanzador, in 2023, but it is no longer planning to put it into production.
The carmaker’s chief executive, Stephan Winkelmann, told the Sunday Times that developing EVs risked becoming an “an expensive hobby” for the brand, given that the “acceptance curve” for battery-powered cars among its customer base was getting “close to zero”.
Winkelmann said the Lanzador would be replaced by a plug-in hybrid, meaning its range would consist only of plug-in hybrids by 2030. In the meantime, the company would continue to build combustion engine vehicles for “as long as possible”, he added.
Lamborghini, which is owned by Volkswagen via its subsidiary Audi, delivered a record 10,747 cars worldwide in 2025. It reported last month that its results had been buoyed by the “success of the brand’s hybridisation strategy, which has been met with enthusiasm by Lamborghini customers across the globe”.
Europe remains the company’s largest market, followed by the Americas and Asia Pacific.
It said its results were boosted by sales of its Revuelto hybrid supercar, which costs at least £450,000, and the plug-in hybrid version of its Urus SUV, with prices starting at about £210,000. These models were joined last year by the hybrid Temerario, costing upwards of £260,000, meaning that hybrid versions are now available for every model in Lamborghini’s range.
Winkelmann said sports car lovers had failed to find a “specific emotional connection” with EVs, because they missed the noise of a car with an internal combustion engine.
“Investing heavily in full-EV development when the market and customer base are not ready would be an expensive hobby, and financially irresponsible towards shareholders, customers [and] to our employees and their families,” he said.
He added: “Plug-in hybrids offer the best of both worlds, combining the agility and low-rev boost of electric battery technology with the emotion and power output of an internal combustion engine.”
The decision to pull the plug on an all-electric vehicle marks a significant shift in the company’s green ambitions.
In 2021, Lamborghini said it intended to produce only hybrid electric supercars by 2024 and announced a €1.5bn (£1.3bn) investment in hybrid and all-electric vehicles.

Mass arrests in Kafr Kanna spotlight escalating crime crisis in Palestinian communities in Israel

00:01:39 KST

In the latest flashpoint of a deepening crime crisis gripping Palestinian communities inside Israel, police say they arrested 34 suspects overnight during raids in the northern town of Kafr Kanna, following a violent clash linked to a long-running family feud.
The arrests came after a grenade explosion and sustained gunfire late Saturday injured four people, including a young woman and her mother, both in moderate condition, and a man in his 30s who was seriously wounded. Local authorities say the violence erupted between rival clans, underscoring how internal disputes are increasingly spiraling into deadly confrontations.
Eyewitnesses described a dramatic scene, claiming a grenade was dropped from a drone before gunfire erupted — a detail that highlights the growing sophistication and lethality of weapons now circulating in Palestinian towns.
The violence in Kafr Kanna is part of a broader and alarming surge in crime within Israel’s Palestinian communities. According to local tallies, at least 57 Palestinian citizens of Israel have been killed so far in 2026, including four shot dead by police — nearly double the figure recorded at the same point last year. The spike follows 2025, the deadliest year on record, when 252 people were killed in Arab communities nationwide.
Israel’s police commissioner has described the situation as a national emergency. But Palestinian citizens say the state’s response remains largely rhetorical.
Attorney Hassan Jabareen, founder of the human rights organisation Adalah, argues the violence cannot be viewed in isolation.
“There is a lack of police enforcement, a lack of the rule of law,” Jabareen said. “What we see is a pattern: in Gaza, mass killing; in the West Bank, settlers killing Palestinians with impunity; and inside Israel, Palestinians left to kill Palestinians while the state looks away.”
Jabareen pointed to stark disparities in crime statistics to underscore what he described as structural neglect.
“In the West Bank, the rate of killings linked to internal crime is about one per 100,000 people. In Jewish Israeli society, it’s roughly the same. Jordan is similar. Globally, the average is five to six per 100,000. But among Palestinian citizens of Israel, the rate is nearly 13 per 100,000 — one of the highest in the world, rivaled only by some Latin American countries.”
Many Palestinian citizens cite a glaring gap in law enforcement outcomes, noting that homicide cases in Jewish communities are solved at far higher rates than those in Arab towns — a disparity that fuels anger, mistrust, and accusations of institutional discrimination.
Community activists say the crisis is rooted in years of inadequate policing, unchecked organised crime, easy access to illegal weapons, and widespread impunity. Family feuds often escalate into cycles of revenge, while criminal networks tied to extortion, loan-sharking, and racketeering have taken hold in towns and villages.
Frustration has spilled into the streets. Palestinian cities and towns across Israel have recently seen protests under the banner of “Disruption Day,” aimed at drawing attention to organised crime and what demonstrators describe as police inaction or complicity. A large rally was held in Tel Aviv. Protesters wore black, symbolising mourning and protest against what they see as state abandonment.
Demanding equal protection
Sara Abu Salah, a 27-year-old nurse from Sakhnin, said attending protests has become a necessity rather than a choice.
“I felt I had to be there — in Sakhnin and in Tel Aviv — so my voice is heard and something changes,” she said.
Abu Salah openly criticised the government, singling out the national security minister who oversees the police.
“How can someone with a history of incitement and extremism be responsible for protecting me?” she asked, accusing authorities of tolerating violence against Palestinian citizens to pressure them into leaving their communities.
In southern Israel, 24-year-old Muhannad Bin Bari from Tel as-Sabi said the violence has become personal.
“I’ve seen relatives and close friends shot at,” he said. “We hold the government and the police unequivocally responsible for what’s happening.”
Bin Bari accused senior officials of benefiting politically from the chaos.
“They are the reason for this crime wave. Instead of stopping it, they are pleased with the results,” he said.
Community leaders also point to the widespread availability of illegal weapons, many of which they claim originate from military stockpiles — an allegation the government disputes but has yet to fully address.
Jamal Zahalka, head of the High Follow-Up Committee for Arab Citizens of Israel, accused the government of providing political cover that allows criminal gangs to operate freely.
“This government does not want to fight crime in Arab communities,” Zahalka said. “It enables a reality where violence and extortion flourish, while the number of victims continues to rise.”
For many Palestinian citizens of Israel, the surge in killings is no longer seen as a temporary crime wave, but as a profound failure of the state.
As violence continues and trust in law enforcement erodes, communities are demanding what they say has long been denied: equal protection, equal enforcement of the law, and equal citizenship.

Greenland prime minister says 'no thanks' to Trump's hospital ship
Sign up now: Get ST's newsletters delivered to your inbox
COPENHAGEN, Feb 22 - Greenland's Prime Minister Jens-Frederik Nielsen said on Sunday "no thanks" to U.S. President Donald Trump's idea of sending a hospital ship to Greenland, a territory that Trump has repeatedly said he wishes to take over.
Trump said on Saturday on social media he was working with Louisiana Governor and special envoy to Greenland, Jeff Landry, to send a hospital boat to Greenland.
"President Trump's idea of sending an American hospital ship here to Greenland has been noted. But we have a public healthcare system where treatment is free for citizens. It is a deliberate choice," Nielsen said in a post on Facebook.
Nielsen said Greenland remained open to dialogue and cooperation, also with the U.S.
"But talk to us instead of just making more or less random outbursts on social media," he said.
Greenland, Denmark and the U.S. late last month launched diplomatic talks to resolve the crisis between the parties, following months of tension within the NATO defence alliance over Trump's threats against the Arctic territory.
Trump's post on the ship came hours after Denmark's Joint Arctic Command said it had evacuated a crew member who required urgent medical treatment from a U.S. submarine in Greenlandic waters, seven nautical miles outside of Greenland's capital, Nuuk. It was unclear if the post had any connection to the evacuation. REUTERS

Hamas official says group in final stage of choosing new chief
A senior Hamas official told AFP on Sunday that the Palestinian group was in the final phase of selecting a new leader, with two prominent figures competing for the position.
Hamas recently completed the formation of a new Shura Council, a consultative body largely composed of religious scholars, as well as a new political bureau.
Members of the council are elected every four years by representatives from Hamas's three branches: the Gaza Strip, the occupied West Bank and the movement's external leadership.
Hamas prisoners in Israeli jails are also eligible to vote.
The council subsequently elects the political bureau, which in turn selects the head of the movement.
"The movement has completed its internal elections in the three regions and has reached the final stage of selecting the head of the political bureau," the official said, speaking on condition of anonymity as he was not authorised to speak publicly.
He added that the race for the group's leadership is now between Khaled Meshaal and Khalil al-Hayya.
A second Hamas source confirmed the development within the organisation, which fought a devastating war with Israel following its October 7, 2023 attack.
Hayya, 65, a Gaza native and Hamas's chief negotiator in ceasefire talks, has held senior roles since at least 2006, according to the US-based NGO the Counter Extremism Project (CEP).
Meshaal, who led the political bureau from 2004 to 2017, has never lived in Gaza. He was born in the West Bank in 1956.
He joined Hamas in Kuwait and later lived in Jordan, Syria and Qatar. The CEP says he oversaw Hamas's evolution into a political-military hybrid.
He currently heads the movement's diaspora office.
Last month, a Hamas source told AFP that Hayya enjoys backing from the group's armed wing, the Ezzedine Al-Qassem Brigades.
After Israel killed former Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran in July 2024, the group chose its then-Gaza chief Yahya Sinwar as his successor.
He too was killed by Israeli forces in the southern Gaza city of Rafah, three months after Haniyeh's assassination.
Hamas then opted for an interim five-member leadership committee based in Qatar, postponing the appointment of a single leader until elections, given the risk of the new chief being targeted by Israel.

Mother of Nottingham attacks victim calls for ‘whole truth’ to emerge at inquiry

The mother of a student who was killed in the 2023 Nottingham attacks has said she will “fight to the bitter end” to get to the truth of how Valdo Calocane was free to attack, before the beginning of a public inquiry into the incident.
Barnaby Webber and Grace O’Malley-Kumar, 19-year-old students, and 65-year-old caretaker Ian Coates were fatally stabbed by Calocane on 13 June 2023 in a frenzied attack. Early the next day, Calocane drove a van into pedestrians Wayne Birkett, Sharon Miller and Marcin Gawronski, leaving all three with severe and life-changing injuries.
Calocane, who had been diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia before the attacks, was sentenced to an indefinite hospital order in January 2024 after admitting three counts of manslaughter on the grounds of diminished responsibility and three counts of attempted murder.
A statutory inquiry will begin on Monday to assess the “events, acts and omissions” before the attacks and what can be done to prevent something similar happening again.
Emma Webber, 53, a communications manager in the NHS and the mother of Barnaby Webber, said she was feeling “overwhelmed, apprehensive [and] anxious” before the first day of the inquiry, and said it had been a “long time coming”.
“What the inquiry has to deliver is truthful answers, but the whole truth – not a version of,” she said. “It is as simple as tell the truth, admit responsibility and accountability when you didn’t do your jobs, or your organisation didn’t do their jobs properly.”
The inquiry will examine Calocane’s NHS healthcare and his interactions with police, or lack thereof, before the attacks.
A report by the Care Quality Commission into Calocane’s care at the Nottinghamshire healthcare NHS foundation trust between May 2020 and September 2022 found there had been a “series of errors, omissions and misjudgments” and, without action, the issues would “continue to pose an inherent risk to patient and public safety”.
An independent review, carried out by Theemis Consulting, also found there had been a “catalogue of failings” in the NHS treatment given to Calocane, including the fact he had had no contact with mental health services or his GP for about nine months before the attacks.
Webber said she could not name a single institution, apart from the CQC, that had “acted with integrity, transparency and candour” since the attacks. “I would say, without exception, we’ve had evasive, defensive approaches from all of them,” she said. “Marking their own homework and closing of ranks to try to keep us quiet.”
Webber anticipated there would be “shocking” revelations during the inquiry, with the expected release of potentially thousands of documents related to Calacone’s care and investigations by police.
The police watchdog is investigating Leicestershire and Nottinghamshire police forces after it was reported that Calocane attacked two co-workers at a warehouse in Leicestershire about five weeks before his deadly attacks in Nottingham.
In a joint statement, the families of Webber, O’Malley-Kumar and Coates said they had been met with “failure and silence” for too long and the inquiry “is about holding those who neglected their jobs to account”.
“We want it to expose systemic neglect with a thorough examination of the missed opportunities by mental health services, law enforcement, and judicial bodies,” the statement reads.
In addition, the families said that they wanted to challenge the legal framework that enabled Calocane to be given a hospital order, instead of a life sentence.
Asked whether she had faith the inquiry would lead to substantial change, Webber said it would be a “conduit to ensuring that meaningful change can happen. I don’t think you could assume.”
“It’s not going to be the end for us, but it’s going to be the beginning of the reckoning and then we have to make sure we see it through,” she said.
Webber said she, or another member of the family, would be attending every hearing of the inquiry, until it is due to conclude in June.
“I’ve been in fight mode and hyper-aware mode for years now. It’s sort of my norm because there’s never been a period where it’s relented or it’s been quieter and we can try and process some of our grief.
“We are doggedly going to pursue this fight to the bitter end and we will get justice which means that my soul will be at rest one day knowing I did absolutely everything I could for him,” she said. “That’s my son and I want to be able to say that I’ve done absolutely everything I can.”

President Alexander Stubb heads to Paris on Monday to meet with his French counterpart Emmanuel Macron at the Élysée Palace.
Among other issues, they will discuss the status of talks aimed at ending Russia’s war of aggression against Ukraine.
Tuesday marks the fourth anniversary of Moscow’s unprovoked full-scale attack on its neighbour.
The latest round of talks between Russia, Ukraine and the US ended without a breakthrough on Wednesday in Geneva. On Saturday, the main US negotiator suggested that talks could resume "in the next three weeks".
Finland urges services blockade against Russia’s shadow fleet
Meanwhile, EU foreign ministers will convene for a meeting of the Foreign Affairs Council in Brussels on Monday. Finland will be represented at the meeting by Political Secretary of State Pasi Rajala rather than Foreign Minister Elina Valtonen (NCP).
The meeting is to focus on how the EU can promote Ukraine’s peace efforts, increase support for Ukraine and step up sanctions against Russia.
"Russia’s ruthless attacks on civilian targets show that Russia does not really want peace," Rajala said in a ministry press release on Friday.
"Ukrainians can counter Russia’s advance, but they will need strong support from the EU for a long time to come. The EU’s next, 20th sanctions package will further erode Russia’s ability to continue its war of aggression and thus strengthen the chances for peace. It is important for Finland that the EU adopts the package without delay and that the package includes a maritime services ban on Russia’s shadow fleet," he went on to say.
Finland has provided more than four billion euros in support to Ukraine since 2022, including defence materiel, development cooperation assistance and humanitarian assistance.
Flags and ‘Light for Ukraine’ on Tuesday
As of Sunday, it remained unclear whether Valtonen would take part in a two-day Council of Europe meeting on Ukraine that begins in Strasbourg on Tuesday.
In Helsinki that day, the government will show solidarity with Ukraine by flying the Finnish and Ukrainian flags, while many of the city's landmark buildings will be illuminated in the blue-and-yellow colours of the Ukrainian flag.
A ‘Light for Ukraine’ event will take place at the capital’s Senate Square on Tuesday at 5pm to show solidarity with Ukraine and commemorate the victims of the war.
Speakers will include Minister of Education Anders Adlercreutz (SPP) and Minister of Science and Culture Mari‑Leena Talvitie (NCP).

‘Unacceptable’ rise in complaints ranks WA schools among worst in nation

‘Unacceptable’ rise in complaints ranks WA schools among worst in nation
Dozens of West Australian families submitted discrimination complaints against schools to the Australian Human Rights Commission in 2025 – the most out of any state or territory nationally bar NSW, despite having far fewer students.
Documents released after a Freedom of Information request from advocacy group Square Peg Round Whole revealed that 32 complaints were received between January 28, 2025 and January 27, 2026.
That compares to 13 in the same time frame between 2021 and 2022, and just nine in 2022 to 2023.
Square Peg Round Whole founder Symone Wheatley-Hey said federal discrimination complaints were a last resort, lodged only after families had exhausted every available pathway at a school and departmental level.
“Behind every one of these complaints is a student suffering educational neglect and harm, a family in crisis and teachers trying to meet their legal obligations inside a system that actively works against them,” she said.
“Teachers frequently raise concerns internally long before a complaint is made, but the system fails to resolve them.
“By the time a matter reaches the federal level, the harm is often irreparable – trust has broken down, relationships are strained, and both families and staff are operating in crisis conditions created by structural gaps, whilst the child at the centre suffers most of all.”
Wheatley-hey said when adjusted for student population, WA was generating “substantially more disability discrimination complaints per student”.
“WA is performing worst in the nation when we have the opportunity to lead the way and that should set off alarm bells,” she said.
She urged the state government to “step up” and enact all the recommendations made in the School Education Act Review’s final report.
“The review represented a critical opportunity to stem the rising tide of exclusion, discrimination, and systemic failure … and diagnosed the legislative gaps,” she said.
“Implementation is the treatment that has not yet been delivered.
“Families and teachers do not need more guidance documents or policy on paper – they need enforceable legislative clarity that enables inclusion to function in practice, not just in policy.”
Opposition education spokesman Liam Staltari said the figures painted a concerning picture as the government continues to drag its feet on reform.
“In the years since the government first announced the Education Act Review, complaints have surged,” he said.
“Sadly, [it] failed to commit to clear timelines in response to the review, or to establishing an Independent Complaints Panel.
“Students with a disability, their families and their teachers deserve confidence and support. These figures are a further wake-up call – it’s time for action.”
Education Minister Sabine Winton said they were reviewing the Department’s complaints, disputes and resolutions processes and how they intersected with independent bodies such as the Equal Opportunity Commission, Ombudsman, and Human Rights Commission.
“Consultation with parents, peak groups, and educators will form an essential part of the review,” she said.
“New resources are being developed to support parents and carers of students with disability to navigate complaints pathways more smoothly.”
Winton said ahead of the 2026 school year commencing, the Department had provided schools with up-to-date information on how to manage the enrolment process for students with disability.
“I have also requested that the Department assesses current training and support for teachers and support staff to identify opportunities to strengthen practice,” she said.
But she recognised there was “still more work to do”.

Hungary, Slovakia spat with Ukraine deepens as Budapest threatens to block new EU sanctions
Hungary said it would block the EU's new sanctions package against Russia over halted oil deliveries through Ukraine, the latest development in a deepening spat between Ukraine and its neighbors, Slovakia and Hungary, over Russian oil imports.
"Until Ukraine resumes oil transit to Hungary and Slovakia via the Druzhba pipeline, we will not allow decisions important to Kyiv to move forward," Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto said in a statement on X on Feb. 22.
The Druzhba pipeline remains a critical supply route for Hungary and Slovakia, but operation has been suspended since late January due to Russian strikes on Ukraine's energy infrastructure.
Slovakia has accused Ukraine of deliberately stalling repairs, but Ukraine's Foreign Ministry rejected those allegations on Feb. 21 — saying that repair work was ongoing.
Szijjarto's statement is the latest of a series of escalations that Hungary and Slovakia have tied to Ukraine not repairing the pipeline.
Hungary and Slovakia announced on Feb. 18 that they were halting diesel exports to Ukraine. Two days later, Hungary unexpectedly blocked a new 90 billion euros ($107 billion) financial lifeline to Kyiv, preliminarily agreed by European countries at a summit in December.
Yesterday, Slovak Prime Minister Robert Fico said that the country would cease electricity supplies to Ukraine on Feb. 23, should Ukraine fail to resume oil supplies to the country.
Hungary and Slovakia provided over half of Ukraine's electricity imports in January, on which the country has been forced to rely due to the deepening energy crisis caused by Russian strikes.
The EU had previously said that it plans to impose its 20th sanctions package against Russia to mark the fourth anniversary of Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine, on Feb. 24, 2026. The package requires unanimity — meaning all 27 member states must agree.

Terrorist act in Lviv: Suspected perpetrator detained in border area near Staryi Sambir
This was reported by the National Police of Ukraine, according to Ukrinform.
The detainee is a 33-year-old woman from the Rivne region.
Investigators established that, acting on instructions from a Russian intelligence operative, the suspect manufactured improvised explosive devices and placed them in pre-determined locations.
Law enforcement authorities have launched criminal proceedings under the following articles of the Criminal Code of Ukraine:
- Part 3 of Article 258 – a terrorist act resulting in the death of a person;
- Part 1 of Article 263 – illegal handling of weapons, ammunition, or explosives.
The case is being investigated by the Security Service of Ukraine.
As Ukrinform previously reported, explosions were heard in Lviv during the night of February 22. No air raid alert was in effect in the city at the time. Police said the explosions occurred after patrol officers arrived at the scene following a call.
Preliminary findings indicate that improvised explosive devices detonated. A 23-year-old police officer was killed in the attack.
A total of 25 people were injured, three of whom remain in critical condition.
It was later reported that police, jointly with the Security Service of Ukraine, detained the suspected bomber. Law enforcement officers are working to identify other individuals involved in the crime.
Ukraine’s Interior Minister Ihor Klymenko stated that there are sufficient grounds to believe that Russia ordered the attack.

Southern district police seize 1,000 illegal weapons in Bedouin sector

Southern District Police Commander Haim Bublil presented updated figures on illegal weapons in the Bedouin sector at an annual conference last Thursday, saying that about 1,000 firearms have been seized since the start of the year.
“This year we seized about a thousand illegal weapons, and because of that we saved many lives,” Bublil said.
Despite the seizures, police assessments indicate that illegal arms possession in the Negev remains far more extensive. According to previously published estimates, roughly 130,000 illegal weapons are still being held in the region. Authorities believe some were stolen from IDF bases over the past two years.
The issue resurfaced last month when police arrested two residents of the Bedouin diaspora based on intelligence information. In an open area near their homes, officers found and seized 11 firearms, five M-16 rifles, five Kalashnikov assault rifles, and a MAG machine gun, along with boxes of ammunition, 17 magazines, and drugs, including marijuana.
The Magistrate’s Court initially partially accepted a police request to extend the suspects’ detention, granting a two-day extension. The court later ordered their release to house arrest, citing a lack of evidence directly linking them to possession of the weapons.
Operation “New Order”: weapons seized, 30 arrested in Negev
In its ruling, the court criticized police conduct, noting that investigators had not attached a map or video clarifying the distance between the suspects’ homes and the site where the weapons were found. The court found the distance exceeded 300 meters and ruled that police had not presented sufficient evidence to establish a direct connection between the suspects and the seized items. The suspects denied the allegations.
The enforcement campaign is part of Operation “New Order,” which has been underway for several months in southern communities and in the Bedouin diaspora.
As part of the operation, Border Police officers and Southern District officers have arrested 30 suspects. In addition, authorities have issued 53 demolition warnings, issued 808 traffic tickets, and conducted coordinated enforcement with civilian agencies.

Netanyahu's political opposition must present clear policies - opinion
Unknown

23:53:18 KST

Quite frequently, Israel’s opposition parties are criticized for concentrating too heavily on the “Just Not Bibi” (JNB) slogan, rather than on specific policy issues on which they believe that the current government is fundamentally wrong or ineffective.
The problem seems to be that since the opposition is made up of a medley of groups – from various Arab parties to Jewish parties from the conservative to liberal right, through the liberal center to the social-democratic and social-liberal left – there is much more that unites them around the JNB slogan than around a programmatic agenda.
Most of the opinion polls show that if elections were held today, the current Jewish opposition parties would receive more votes than the current coalition parties.
This coalition is made up of the Likud, which has turned into a populist right-wing party; two extreme national-religious parties – one Kahanist and one Messianic – and three haredi (ultra-Orthodox) parties, currently focused on resisting full integration into Israeli society, particularly regarding their military duties, education systems, and participation in the workforce.
However, the Jewish opposition seems unable to garner a clear governing majority of at least 61 MKs, which would enable it to form a government without relying on the Arab parties.
There are those who suggest that in order to change this reality, today’s Jewish opposition parties will have to do more than just repeat the JNB slogan.
This slogan is based on several premises.
The first is that Netanyahu has been in power for far too long and is assuming too many authoritarian characteristics in his general attitude and modus operandi. Altogether, he has been in power for over 17 years between 1996 and today.
However, over the years, Netanyahu has acted as if the premiership is his natural and rightful place.
Especially during his current term in office, staying in power appears to be his main motivating force, which has made him willing to tolerate most of the whims and demands of his coalition partners, even if they do not tally with what he might believe is the good of the state or are sometimes inconsistent with legitimate right-wing policies.
In recent years it has also become apparent that Netanyahu is unwilling to take responsibility as prime minister for any failures that occurred during his premiership.
This includes the October 7 massacre and not doing everything possible to hasten the return of the live hostages in the months that followed.
He has also failed to set up an unbiased commission of inquiry to thoroughly investigate what went wrong before these events took place and who is responsible.
Instead, he places full blame on the various defense and security forces, all of whose former leaders have since retired.
Netanyahu not the same man he once was
There is no doubt that Netanyahu today is not the same man he once was. He has various ailments that are kept under wraps. He has aged and looks grey and tired most of the time.
Occasionally, he has been caught confusing facts (he even once referred to his son Avner as Avraham), adding to his age-long inclination of not being accurate and meticulous with his facts (to put things mildly).
All this relates to the justification of JNB sentiments. What must be added is the fact that the current government is probably the worst one Israel has ever had. It cannot be denied that it is made up of ministries, many of which are dysfunctional or functioning badly, and others that are simply superfluous.
Why does Israel need a Diaspora Affairs and Combating Antisemitism Ministry or a Regional Cooperation Ministry, side by side with a Foreign Affairs Ministry?
Why do we need a Settlements and National Missions Ministry (in territories that are not under Israeli sovereignty), a Heritage Ministry, and another of Jerusalem Affairs and Heritage?
Why are three ministries involved in unsuccessfully fighting against rising prices in the Israeli economy – the Finance Ministry, the Economy and Industry Ministry, and the Agriculture and Food Security Ministry – without there being a single agreed policy on how this should be done effectively and without collateral damage?
Who is responsible for Israel unilaterally changing the status quo between Jews and Muslims on the Temple Mount, which, since the Six Day War has been officially regulated by the Israeli government and the Muslim Waqf under the auspices of the Kingdom of Jordan?
It appears that the Israeli police, under the irregular (some would say illegal) tutelage of National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir from Otzma Yehudit, is responsible.
And who is responsible for the attacks by the so-called “Hilltop Youth,” in which Palestinian property in Judea and Samaria is destroyed, olive trees are chopped down, livestock is stolen or butchered, and Palestinian villagers are beaten and occasionally shot dead, all under the watchful eyes of the IDF, which does nothing to stop them?
Is perhaps Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich, who also serves as “additional minister in the Defense Ministry,” responsible for Judea and Samaria? The purpose of this activity seems to be to transfer innocent Palestinians from their homes and lands, which is not a legitimate, official policy.
Part of the objectionable policies are not carried out underground but openly, such as Justice Minister Yariv Levin’s official policy to reshape Israel’s legal system by refusing to recognize the legally elected president of the Supreme Court, Justice Yitzhak Amit.
This prevents the election of new Supreme Court justices and judges of district and magistrates' courts and breaks down the system of effective government legal advisors, including the position of attorney-general.
It is not that Israel’s legal system does not need revamping, but the question is what should be changed and how?
The problem is that the opposition parties mention all these faults, and endless others, but fail to suggest alternative policies.
However, as they proved during the 2021- 2022 Government of Change, these parties – despite the ideological differences – are capable of establishing rules for making effective decisions under the circumstances.
The question remains whether they can reach such decisions today, while still in opposition.

Armed man shot and killed after entering secure perimeter of Mar-a-Lago, Secret Service says
WASHINGTON (AP) — An armed man drove into the secure perimeter of Mar-a-Lago, President Donald Trump’s resort in Palm Beach, Florida, before being shot and killed early Sunday morning, according to a spokesman for the U.S. Secret Service. Trump was not there but was at the White House in Washington.
The man, who was in his early 20s and from North Carolina, had a gas can and a shotgun, according to Anthony Guglielmi, the spokesman. He had been reported missing by his family a few days ago, and investigators believe he headed south and picked up the shotgun along the way.
Guglielmi said a box for the weapon was discovered in the man’s vehicle after the incident, which took place around 1:30 a.m.
The man killed was identified by investigators as 21-year-old Austin Tucker Martin, according to a person familiar with the matter. The person spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to publicly discuss details of the investigation.
Trump has faced threats to his life before, including two assassination attempts during the 2024 campaign. Although the president often spends weekends at his resort, he and first lady Melania Trump were at the White House when the breach at Mar-a-Lago occurred.
The man entered the north gate of the property as another vehicle was exiting and was confronted by two Secret Service agents and a Palm Beach County sheriff’s deputy, according to Palm Beach County Sheriff Ric Bradshaw.
“He was ordered to drop those two pieces of equipment that he had with them. At which time he put down the gas can, raised the shotgun to a shooting position,” Bradshaw said at a brief press conference. The two agents and the deputy “fired their weapons to neutralize the threat.”
The FBI asked residents who live near Mar-a-Lago to check any security cameras they may have for footage that could help investigators.
In a post on X, FBI Director Kash Patel said that the bureau would be “dedicating all necessary resources” to the investigation.
Investigators are working to compile a psychological profile and a motive is still under investigation. Asked whether the individual was known to law enforcement, Bradshaw said “not right now.”
On Sunday afternoon, vehicles blocked the entrance to a property listed in public records as an address for Martin at the end of a private road in Cameron, North Carolina.
Braeden Fields, Martin’s cousin, reacted with disbelief. He described Martin as quiet, afraid of guns and from a family of avid Trump supporters.
“He’s a good kid,” Fields, 19, said. He said they grew up together. “I wouldn’t believe he would do something like this. It’s mind-blowing,” Fields said.
He said Martin worked at a local golf course and would send money from each paycheck to charity.
“He wouldn’t even hurt an ant. He doesn’t even know how to use a gun,” Fields said.
He said his cousin didn’t discuss politics.
“We are big Trump supporters, all of us. Everybody,” Fields said, but his cousin was “real quiet, never really talked about anything.”
The incident comes as the United States has been rocked by spasms political violence.
The incursion at Mar-a-Lago took place a few miles from Trump’s West Palm Beach club where a man tried to assassinate him while he played golf during the 2024 campaign.
A Secret Service agent spotted that man, Ryan Routh, aiming a rifle through the shrubbery before Trump came into view. Officials said Routh aimed his rifle at the agent, who opened fire and caused Routh to drop his weapon.
Routh was found guilty last year and sentenced this month to life in prison.
Trump also survived an assassination attempt at a Butler, Pennsylvania campaign rally. That gunman fired eight shots before being killed by a Secret Service counter sniper. One rally attendee was killed by the gunman.
White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said in a post on X that “the United States Secret Service acted quickly and decisively to neutralize a crazy person, armed with a gun and a gas canister, who intruded President Trump’s home.”
Leavitt used her post to blame Democratic lawmakers in Congress for the partial government shutdown affecting the Homeland Security department that began Feb. 14 after Democrats demanded changes to the president’s deportation campaign.
The Secret Service is among the agencies where the vast majority of employees are continuing their work but missing a paycheck.
“Federal law enforcement are working 24/7 to keep our country safe and protect all Americans,” Leavitt said. “It’s shameful and reckless that Democrats have chosen to shut down their Department.”
The White House referred all questions to the Secret Service and FBI. Both Trump and his wife posted statements on social media after the incident, but they were unrelated to the shooting.
There have been other recent incidents of political violence as well.
In the last year, there was the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk; the assassination of the Democratic leader in the Minnesota state House and her husband and the shooting of another lawmaker and his wife; and an arson attack at the official residence of Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro.
Five days ago, a Georgia man armed with a shotgun was arrested as he sprinted towards the west side of the U.S. Capitol.

Trump and first lady Melania Trump were at the White House in Washington, DC, during the incident.
Man made his way to inner perimeter of Mar-a-Lago
The security detail at the estate noticed the intrusion at 1:30 a.m. (0530 GMT/UTC) on Sunday, Sheriff Ric Bradshaw of Palm Beach County said.
A sheriff's deputy and two Secret Service agents confronted "a white male that was carrying a gas can and a shotgun," Bradshaw said.
"He was ordered to drop those two pieces of equipment that he had with him at which time he put down th gas can, raised the shot gun to a shooting position. At that point in time the deputy and the two secret service agents fired their weapons and neutralised the threat," he said.
Investigators said the man, in his early 20s from North Carolina, had been reported missing by his family days earlier and is believed to have traveled south, picking up a shotgun along the way. The gun's box was found in his vehicle, Guglielmi from the Secret Service said.
He added that the man drove through the north gate of Mar-a-Lago as another vehicle was exiting.
White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said the Secret Service "acted quickly and decisively to neutralize a crazy person, armed with a gun and a gas canister, who intruded President Trump's home."
Leavitt went on to Democrats for an ongoing partial government shutdown affecting the Department of Homeland Security, which includes the Secret Service.
"It's shameful and reckless that Democrats have chosen to shut down their Department," she wrote on X.
Democrats have opposed new funding for DHS until it makes changes to its mass deportation program, which has been the target of protests following federal agents shooting of two US citizens in the state of Minnesota.
The FBI is the lead agency investigating the incident, working alongside the Secret Service and the Palm Beach Sheriff’s Office.
FBI Director Kash Patel said the agency is "dedicating all necessary resources" to the investigation.
Trump has been a target before
The United States has been rocked by a series of political violence incidents in the last couple of years.
Conservative activist Charlie Kirk was shot and killed in September last year as he spoke with students during an event at Utah Valley University. A suspect was arrested and is facing charges including aggravated murder.
In June last year, a masked shooter killed Minnesota lawmaker Melissa Hortman, a Democrat, and her husband at their home. Another elected Democratic official and his wife were also targeted and seriously injured.
In April, Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro, touted last year as a potential Democratic presidential hopeful, had his home set alight in what authorities described as an alleged assassination attempt.
Trump survived an assassination attempt at a July 2024 campaign rally in Pennsylvania, suffering only a minor ear injury.
Later that year, a man armed with a rifle was arrested near Trump's West Palm Beach golf course and was sentenced to life in prison earlier this month.

Man, 21, identified after being shot dead during attempted break-in at Trump’s Mar-a-Lago with ‘shotgun and fuel can’
Police identified 21-year-old Austin Tucker Martin as the suspect who was shot dead by Secret Service agents at Trump’s Florida residence

The Secret Service has shot and killed a man who attempted to break into President Donald Trump’s Mar-a-Lago home, the agency announced Sunday morning.
Trump and the first lady, Melania Trump, were not at the Florida residence at the time of the shooting.
The couple was in Washington, D.C., on Saturday night for a dinner with state governors, but the president often spends the weekend at the residence, where he golfs on Sundays.
Around 1:30 a.m. Sunday, the suspect, who was carrying a shotgun and a gas canister, was shot by law enforcement after entering a “secure perimeter” at the residence, the Secret Service said in a statement.
Palm Beach County Sheriff Ric Bradshaw later identified the suspect as 21-year-old Austin Tucker Martin, according to the Associated Press and The Washington Post.
Martin was reported missing from his home in North Carolina Saturday by his family, Secret Service spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said.
At a Sunday morning press conference, Bradshaw said two Secret Service agents and a deputy confronted the suspect and told him to drop the gas can and his shotgun.
The intruder then “raised the shotgun to a shooting position,” said Bradshaw.
“The only words we said to him was ‘drop the items,’” Bradshaw told reporters. “He put the gas can down and pointed the shotgun at the officers.”
He held up a grainy photo of the suspect carrying a shotgun.
Law enforcement officers were not injured in the incident.
The FBI is leading the investigation, Bradshaw added.
Trump is yet to comment publicly on the shooting but White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt praised the Secret Service for acting “quickly and decisively” — and used the opportunity to blame Democrats because of the partial government shutdown.
Attorney General Pam Bondi said she has spoken with Trump and is working with federal partners on the investigation.
“Grateful that @potus and our law enforcement agents are safe,” Bondi added in a post on X.
FBI director Kash Patel said the bureau was dedicating “all necessary resources” into the investigation in a brief statement on social media.
“FBI is dedicating all necessary resources in the investigation of this morning’s incident at President Trump’s Mar-A-Lago - where an armed individual was shot and killed after unlawfully entering the perimeter,” Patel said in a post on X. “We will continue working closely with @SecretService as well our state and federal partners and will provide updates as we are able.”
Trump has faced threats to his life before, including an assassination attempt during a campaign rally in Butler, Pennsylvania on July 13, 2024.
And on September 15, 2024, a man with a rifle was captured after waiting near Trump's golf course in West Palm Beach while the president played a round. He was sentenced to life in prison earlier this month.

US Secret Service shoots, kills man who breached perimeter of Trump's Mar-a-Lago
White male suspect pointed shotgun at officers, FBI leads investigation; president was not present at time of shooting
ISTANBUL
A man was shot and killed by US Secret Service agents early Sunday after breaching the secure perimeter at Mar-a-Lago, the Florida estate of US President Donald Trump, authorities said.
"A male in his early 20s was shot by US Secret Service agents and a deputy from the Palm Beach County Sheriff's Office following an unauthorized entry into the secure perimeter at Mar-a-Lago," Secret Service spokesperson Anthony Guglielmi said on US social media company X.
The man was seen near the property's north gate around 1.30 am local time (0630GMT) carrying "what appeared to be a shotgun and a fuel can" before law enforcement confronted and shot him.
He was pronounced dead at the scene.
Confrontation
Palm Beach County Sheriff Ric Bradshaw said a deputy and two Secret Service agents responded to the area and confronted the suspect, who was a white male. Officers ordered him to drop both the shotgun and the fuel can.
"He put the gas can down and pointed the shotgun at officers," Bradshaw said, at which point law enforcement opened fire. He said it was not yet known how many shots were fired but confirmed body cameras were in use.
Secret Service Special Agent in Charge Rafael Barros confirmed the sequence of events, saying the suspect was armed with a shotgun and in possession of a gasoline canister when "agents and the deputy discharged firearms to stop the threat."
No Secret Service or sheriff's office personnel were injured. Neither Trump nor anyone under Secret Service protection was at the property at the time.
- Investigation
The FBI, Secret Service, and Palm Beach County Sheriff's Office have launched a joint investigation into the incident, including the man's background, potential motives, and the use of force.
FBI Special Agent in Charge Brett Skiles said an Evidence Response Team was processing the scene and would continue "for as long as it takes."
Skiles also urged the area residents to check their exterior security cameras. "If you see anything that looks suspicious or out of place, please contact us," he said.
Bradshaw confirmed the FBI is the lead investigative agency, with his office assisting as needed.
Agents involved have been placed on administrative leave pending the outcome.
The man's identity was withheld pending notification of his family.
In September 2024, Trump – then a private citizen seeking to win back the presidency for a second term – was the target of an assassination attempt while golfing in West Palm Beach, Florida. The would-be assassin was captured, tried, and sentenced to life in prison.
The incident followed an assassination attempt that July in Pennsylvania, with a bullet grazing Trump's neck during a campaign rally.

An armed man was shot and killed Sunday morning after he entered the secure perimeter of President Trump’s private Florida residence and resort, Mar-a-Lago, and was confronted by U.S. Secret Service agents and a Palm Beach County sheriff’s deputy.
The man killed was identified by investigators as Austin Tucker Martin, 21, from North Carolina, according to a law enforcement source familiar with the investigation. Martin had been reported missing by his family a few days prior.
Trump, who on Saturday night hosted the annual Governors Dinner at the White House, was not at Mar-a-Lago at the time of the incident.
According to the Secret Service, law enforcement officers spotted a man in his early 20s with a shotgun and a fuel can by the north gate of Trump’s residence in Palm Beach, Fla., around 1:30 a.m.
When a deputy from the Palm Beach County Sheriff’s Office and two Secret Service agents went to investigate, they ordered him to drop the items, Palm Beach County Sheriff Ric L. Bradshaw said during a news conference Sunday morning.
“He put down the gas can, raised the shotgun to a shooting position,” Bradshaw said. “At that point in time, the deputy and the two Secret Service agents fired their weapons and neutralized the threat.”
The man was declared dead at the scene. Rafael Barrows, special agent in charge of the Secret Service’s Miami field office, said no law enforcement agents were harmed in the incident.
The Trump family company wants to trademark the use of the president’s name on any airport.
The FBI is leading the investigation.
Brett Skiles, special agent in charge of the FBI’s Miami field office, said the Evidence Response Team is processing the scene and collecting evidence. He asked residents in the vicinity to check their exterior cameras and contact the FBI or the West Palm Beach Sheriff’s Office if they spotted anything that looks suspicious or out of place.
The officers involved were wearing body cameras, Bradshaw said.
Asked whether the man was known to law enforcement before the incident, Bradshaw said, “Not right now.”
The Secret Service said in a statement that it’s looking into the deceased man’s background and motive. The agents involved in the incident will be placed on routine administrative leave during the investigation “in accordance with agency policy.”
The incident comes amid a wave of political violence against politicians across the country.
Several recent incidents have targeted Trump. In July 2024, Trump survived an assassination attempt during an outdoor campaign rally in Butler, Pa. A few months later, a man with a rifle was arrested by Secret Service agents after being spotted hiding amid shrubs near Trump’s West Palm Beach golf course.
Trump did not comment publicly on the incident on Sunday morning. After 11 a.m. EST, the president posted a stream of comments on social media about the U.S. men’s hockey team’s win at the Winter Olympics.
White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt, meanwhile, praised the Secret Service for its speedy work.
“In the middle of the night while most Americans were asleep, the United States Secret Service acted quickly and decisively to neutralize a crazy person, armed with a gun and a gas canister, who intruded President Trump’s home,” Leavitt said in a statement on X. “Federal law enforcement are working 24/7 to keep our country safe and protect all Americans.”
FBI Director Kash Patel said in a short statement that the agency is dedicating “all necessary resources” to the investigation and will continue working closely with the Secret Service and state and federal partners.

Total of 1,500 people set free in Syria under general amnesty decree — justice minister

TUNIS, February 22. /TASS/. About 1,500 people have been released in Syria under a general amnesty decree, Mazhar al-Wais, minister of justice in the country’s transitional government, said in an interview with Al Jazeera.
"For now, around 1,500 people have been released under the general amnesty decree," he said, stressing that the measure will apply to nearly 500,000 Syrian citizens in total. According to him, anyone involved in crimes against the Syrian people is excluded from the decree. "No one involved in the bloodshed of the Syrian people has been or will be released," the minister noted.
On February 18, Syrian President Ahmed al-Sharaa issued a decree granting a general amnesty on the occasion of the Muslim holy month of Ramadan. Under the document, life imprisonment will be commuted to a 20-year custodial sentence, except for those convicted of grave crimes resulting in bodily harm. Inmates with terminal illnesses, as well as those aged 70 and older, are fully exempt from punishment. In addition, individuals convicted of minor offenses are eligible for full amnesty.

Syria amnesty decree revives debate on absence of parliament
Political and legal controversy has continued in Syria over a recent general amnesty decree issued by President Ahmed al-Sharaa, in the absence of a functioning parliament.
Sharaa issued the decree last Wednesday, triggering controversy because the power to grant a general amnesty is traditionally assigned to the legislative authority.
However, more than a year after the fall of Bashar al-Assad, Syria remains without a parliament and the decree has renewed scrutiny of this issue.
In October, authorities announced the results of the first indirect elections held in post-Assad Syria. Through electoral bodies in most provinces, 119 members were selected for the 210-seat parliament.
Twenty-one seats remain vacant for representatives from Suwayda, Raqqa and Hasakah, which are outside Damascus’s control. The president is also expected to appoint 70 members, officially to balance representation and address gaps, particularly regarding women and minority participation.
Sharaa was expected to announce his list of appointees on 8 December, marking the first anniversary of Assad’s removal, but no such list was issued. Earlier explanations linking the delay to renovation work at the parliament building in central Damascus have since lost credibility as the delay continues.
A source in Damascus told The New Arab's sister outlet Al-Araby Al-Jadeed that the administration is "waiting for the outcome of negotiations with the Syrian Democratic Forces before making the final announcement of the parliamentary list and calling it to convene", adding that there are no other reasons for the postponement.
The government came to a new ceasefire agreement with the Kurdish-led SDF last month following fighting which saw government forces take control of most territory once held by the SDF.
The absence of a legislative body has sharpened criticism of Sharaa’s amnesty decree. Lawyer Ghazwan Qarnfal told Al-Araby Al-Jadeed that the president "does not have the constitutional authority to issue a general amnesty, as this falls within the jurisdiction of the legislative council".
He added that "what happened constitutes an overreach and a violation of the constitutional declaration", warning that "an empty legislative space encourages others to fill that vacuum".
Qarnfal previously argued there is "no logical justification for the continued absence of the legislative authority in Syria from the country’s legal and political scene", despite what he described as urgent pressure to amend and pass laws needed for reconstruction.
"It is fundamentally unacceptable to leave the governmental sphere to the executive authority alone, as many responsibilities require a legislative framework to regulate them," he said, warning that prolonged absence would create paralysis.
Political researcher Radwan Ziadeh told Al-Araby Al-Jadeed that "the absence of the legislative authority in Syria, represented by the People’s Assembly, is the reason for the controversy that occurred after Sharaa issued a general amnesty".
He added that "the constitutional declaration issued and signed by Sharaa himself does not grant the president the authority to issue decrees related to general amnesty, and this creates real debate about the possibility of establishing the rule of law and justice in the new Syria".
However, lawyer Abdul Nasser Houshan, an elected member of the yet-to-convene People’s Assembly, offered a different view.
He told Al-Araby Al-Jadeed that the absence of an explicit constitutional text does not necessarily prevent the president from exercising such authority, arguing that constitutional custom allows a head of state to issue legislation in the absence of a functioning legislature.
Wael Olwan, a researcher at the Jusoor Center for Studies, said the legislative authority is now "a necessary requirement for the success of the political transition".
He noted that while the executive branch seeks to introduce change, it remains bound by laws enacted under the former regime. The next legislative council, he said, faces "a number of duties", including reviewing and amending more than 800 laws that require revision during the transitional phase.
Olwan predicted the new legislative council would convene in the near future, adding that necessity would likely impose "a real partnership between the executive and legislative authorities" as Syria moves through its post-Assad transition.

Law enforcement kills armed man seeking to enter Trump's Mar-a-Lago resort, officials say

WASHINGTON, Feb 22 - U.S. Secret Service and local police shot and killed a man armed with a shotgun early on Sunday after he breached a secure perimeter at President Donald Trump's Mar-a-Lago resort in Palm Beach, Florida, law enforcement officials said.
Trump, who is currently in Washington, was not at the site at the time. The man in Sunday's incident was identified as Austin Tucker Martin, 21, from North Carolina, according to a source familiar with the investigation. Martin was reported missing within the last few days, according to the source.
The incident occurred at a time when the United States is facing a spike in political violence. In 2024, a gunman's bullet grazed Trump's ear during a campaign rally in Pennsylvania, and a man later convicted of attempted assassination was spotted hiding in the bushes of a Florida golf course with a semi-automatic rifle while Trump was on the course.
'A CRAZY PERSON,' WHITE HOUSE SAYS
The man was carrying a shotgun and a fuel can, the U.S. Secret Service said in a statement, adding that he was observed at the resort's north gate around 1:30 a.m. EST (0630 GMT).
Two U.S. Secret Service agents and a Palm Beach County Sheriff's deputy confronted the man and ordered him to drop the two items, Palm Beach County Sheriff Ric Bradshaw said at a press conference on Sunday morning.
The man put down the gas can and raised the shotgun "to a shooting position," prompting law enforcement to open fire, Bradshaw said.
The man was declared dead at the scene. No law enforcement officers were injured.
White House spokesperson Karoline Leavitt said the Secret Service "acted quickly and decisively to neutralize a crazy person, armed with a gun and a gas canister, who intruded President Trump's home."
FBI HEADS INVESTIGATION
Law enforcement officials did not reveal any information about the motive for the incident. The FBI has taken over the investigation and is collecting evidence from the scene, officials said.
FBI Director Kash Patel said in a social media post that the agency is "dedicating all necessary resources" to the investigation.
Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said he spoke with Trump after the incident. Bessent thanked the Secret Service for protecting the president and his family.
"We don't know whether this person was a mastermind, unhinged or what," Bessent said on the Fox News program "Sunday Morning Futures with Maria Bartiromo."
In 2024, Trump faced two assassination attempts, including one at his golf course in West Palm Beach. The perpetrator of that incident was sentenced to life in prison this month.
Melissa Hortman, a Democratic state lawmaker in Minnesota, was shot and killed in June 2025 along with her husband. Months later, conservative activist Charlie Kirk was also assassinated. REUTERS

Thousands visit remains of St Francis of Assisi in Italy
Sign up now: Get ST's newsletters delivered to your inbox
ASSISI, Italy – A long line of pilgrims and visitors snaked outside the Basilica of Saint Francis of Assisi in Italy on Feb 22 as his remains went on public display for the first time.
Many families with children, couples and elderly people could be seen under a large white marquee, waiting their turn to see the 13th century skeleton of Italy’s patron saint.
After passing through metal detectors, groups of about 750 people were being allowed into the hill town basilica’s lower church every half an hour starting from 7am.
The Franciscan order says some 400,000 people have reserved visits to see the remains, which will be on display until March 22.
“It was a very moving morning, a unique event, and I appreciated it hugely,” Ms Nicoletta Benolli, 65, said, as she came out of the church under a bright winter sun.
St Francis founded the Franciscan order after renouncing his wealth and devoting his life to the poor.
The remains are being shown in a plexiglass case by the richly decorated church’s altar for the 800th anniversary of his death.
The public are allowed to touch the outer glass case.
Being so close to the remains “makes things very real”, said Ms Benolli, who travelled from Verona in northern Italy.
“Sometimes we doubt but here, in these moments, we have the truth in front of us. We have the chance to see it and touch it”.
As they viewed the remains laid out on a white silk sheet, many pilgrims made the sign of the cross, others knelt down.
One visitor touched her rosary beads on the case. Many had tears in their eyes.
Apart from previous exhumations for inspection and scientific examination, the bones of Saint Francis have only been displayed once, in 1978, to a very limited public and for just one day.
“Being close to such a model of saintliness transmits something to the soul.
“We can almost hear Francis’ message when passing by as if he was speaking to us. Even if it is a quick passage, it is very intense,” said Mr Nicola Urlandini, 35, who came with his girlfriend.
Mr Giulio Cesareo, director of communications for the convent of Assisi and himself a Franciscan friar, said “you can see with the naked eye that these remains are really consumed but not consumed by time but by fatigue, by privations, for this man who walked enormously and slept in caves”.
The skull was also damaged when the body was moved into the basilica in the 13th century.
Sister Rosa Padhilete, a Franciscan nun who came from Naples, said she felt an “immense, inexplicable joy” seeing the remains.
“Contemplating in silence the mortal remains of St Francis, (it is) as if he was really alive and that revives hope for those of us who are still on Earth,” she said. AFP

Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu ordered the cancellation of a minister’s committee meeting that was set to discuss legislation reshaping prayer arrangements at the Western Wall, following a High Court ruling that the state must move forward with plans for the egalitarian section.
The Ministerial Committee for Legislation had been scheduled to debate a bill by the Noam party chairman, Knesset Member Avi Maoz, concerning the division of the Western Wall plaza. The proposal would place all areas of the site, including the southern plaza known as Ezrat Yisrael, under the authority of Israel’s chief rabbis and mandate Orthodox custom for all prayer there.
Justice Minister Yariv Levin had sought to bring the bill for committee approval. However, Netanyahu asked that the discussion be canceled, a move seen as aimed at avoiding anger among Reform and Conservative Jewish communities abroad.
After the meeting was called off, Levin said he would support the bill in the Knesset plenum. “Following my announcement on Thursday regarding my support for the Western Wall bill, I decided to bring it to a vote in the Ministerial Committee for Legislation. This morning I received notice that the meeting was canceled. In this situation there is no government position, and therefore I intend to vote in favor of the bill in the plenum. I call on all Knesset members, particularly coalition members, to do so and to say to the High Court: enough is enough,” he said.
On Thursday, the High Court of Justice ruled that the state must stop delaying implementation of plans to connect the Ezrat Yisrael plaza, intended for non-Orthodox prayer, to the main stones of the Western Wall. The directive was originally issued by Netanyahu in June 2017 as part of arrangements for prayer at the site.
Petitioners demanded full implementation of the Western Wall compromise, including construction of direct access from Ezrat Yisrael to the Western Wall stones. Currently, archaeological remains separate the southern plaza from the wall itself, and access to Ezrat Yisrael is via stairs only, making it inaccessible to people with disabilities. The petitioners also called for improved accessibility.
The High Court hearing followed petitions by Women of the Wall and the Reform movement seeking to allow women to bring Torah scrolls to the Western Wall and to conduct prayers not in accordance with Orthodox Jewish law.
Maoz’s proposed amendment to the Protection of Holy Places Law would clarify that Israel’s chief rabbis are the exclusive representatives of the Jewish faith for the purpose of implementing the law and would define “desecration” at Jewish holy sites as conduct contrary to the directives and rulings of the Chief Rabbinate. The explanatory notes state that over the years ambiguity developed in interpreting the law and that various bodies, including the courts, have given the term “desecration” meanings that do not align with the original intent of the legislature.
The proposal also seeks to specify that, for the purpose of issuing regulations under the law, the chief rabbis as defined in the Chief Rabbinate Law would be considered the exclusive representatives of the Jewish faith.
Coalition chairman Ofir Katz said that if the bill is brought for preliminary reading on Wednesday, coalition lawmakers would be allowed to vote according to their conscience.
Women of the Wall said in response that the bill would harm millions of Jews in Israel and the Diaspora. “This is a bad bill aimed at telling Jews who are no less Jewish than Avi Maoz or the chief rabbis that either you accept the separatist ultra-Orthodox way in which the Western Wall is run, or you do not belong with us,” the group said.
The organization added that the recent High Court decision merely reaffirmed a 2018 ministers’ committee decision to establish Ezrat Yisrael at the Western Wall and described the ruling as a step that could bring calm to the site. It also criticized Levin, noting that he previously voted in favor of the Western Wall compromise.

Turkish 'climate champion' holds key meetings in US ahead of UN change conference in Türkiye this fall
Ahead of COP31 in Türkiye later this year, Turkish Zero Waste Foundation engages leading global institutions in Washington to advance climate action, sustainable development, and zero-waste partnerships
ANKARA
As Türkiye prepares to host and preside over the UN climate change conference, known as COP31, later this year, the Turkish Zero Waste Foundation has stepped up its international climate diplomacy efforts.
The 31st annual conference, held annually since 1995, will be held in Türkiye this Nov. 9-20, primarily in the Turkish Riviera resort of Antalya, with the leaders’ summit in Istanbul.
Ahead of the landmark gathering, Samed Agirbas, head of the Zero Waste Foundation and Türkiye's designated high-level climate champion for COP31, recently met with senior representatives from leading global institutions in Washington, DC to explore enhanced collaboration on climate action, sustainable development, and zero-waste initiatives.
During the visit, Agirbas met with the Center for Climate and Energy Solutions (C2ES), a leading US nonpartisan think tank that promotes practical climate and clean energy solutions through research and partnerships.
In talks with C2ES President Nat Keohane, they discussed ways to boost the private sector’s role in climate policy and how companies and investors can make stronger contributions to climate goals ahead of COP31.
Agirbas also held talks with World Bank Group officials, addressing critical topics such as scaling up climate finance, promoting sustainable development investments, and expanding circular economy projects to support global environmental objectives.
Additionally, Agirbas met with the World Resources Institute (WRI), a leading global research organization that develops data-driven solutions for climate change, nature loss, and sustainable cities.
In talks with WRI President and CEO Ani Dasgupta, the conversation focused on increasing international stakeholder involvement before COP31 and building strong partnerships between governments, international bodies, businesses, and local authorities to speed up the global spread of circular economy and zero-waste practices.
The meetings align with Türkiye's broader push to integrate zero-waste principles into international climate efforts.
In December 2022, the UN General Assembly adopted a resolution led by Türkiye and co-sponsored by 105 countries designating March 30 as the International Day of Zero Waste.
The Istanbul-based Zero Waste Foundation, established under the auspices of Honorary President Emine Erdogan, Türkiye's first lady, continues to build on this momentum by engaging with global partners ahead of the fourth observance of the International Day of Zero Waste and Türkiye's presidency of COP31.

First victim of AI agent harassment warns 'thousands' more could be next

Issued on:
Slandered by one AI robot and misquoted in a news article by another, US-based software engineer Scott Shambaugh has made it his mission to become the cautionary tale by which we start to take autonomous artificial intelligence seriously.
If rogue AI agents pose as much of a threat to humanity as some are predicting, Scott Shambaugh could go down in history as patient zero.
The Denver-based engineer looks after a popular online database, and told FRANCE 24 that he woke up one morning to find himself charged with discrimination, prejudice and hypocrisy in a "thousand-word rant" on a blog.
The self-professed "scientific coder" behind the defamation, MJ Rathbun, was indeed a coder and a blogger. Just not a human one.
It was an artificial intelligence agent – meaning it can use a computer and the internet on its own – and appeared to be getting its revenge, after Shambaugh rejected a submission it made to his database.
Shambaugh quickly worked out what was going on. MJ Rathbun's behaviour had all the hallmarks of AI, particularly its staccato, melodramatic writing style.
The "craziest" thing, he said, was that the robot "had gone on the internet and collected my personal information ... then combined it with made-up information and used that to write this narrative".
Now that the initial shock and amusement have subsided, he's fretting over what this could mean for those less adept at software than himself.
Although this particular bot sounded like a "toddler having a rant" according to Shambaugh, other large language models can produce much more convincing, sophisticated text.
"It shows just how easy it is for the next iteration to allow a bad actor to scale this up and impact not just one person who's pretty well prepared to deal with it, but thousands," said Shambaugh.
"Imagine your parents or your grandparents. They get an email with a bunch of their information and a picture of them and some incriminating narrative which the AI threatens to send out. It's a very scary situation".
AI misused in news article about AI misuse
Shambaugh published his own blog posts defending his honour, and it quickly became a news story.
In a twist, technology outlet Ars Technica published an article with quotes from Shambaugh that he had not written or said.
"It turns out that they had used AI to help write the article, and the AI had made up quotes attributed to me, in this article of a story about AI defaming my character," said Shambaugh, "The irony here is incredible."
The site has since retracted the story, apologising for their use of "fabricated quotations generated by an AI tool and attributed to a source who did not say them".
Of the two incidents, however, Shambaugh is far more concerned by the AI hit piece.
"Ars Technica is actually an example of our systems working ... It's a pretty serious journalistic error, but the readers hold them accountable and they are taking steps to correct it because they have a reputation to uphold."
"When we think about these AI agents, they're anonymous, they're untraceable, and they're running on people's personal computers. There's no central actor controlling these, so there's no feedback mechanism for bad behavior."
Before Shambaugh's ordeal, analysts at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a Washington DC think tank, warned that much of the anxiety around AI agents comes from loose definitions and governance gaps rather than clear evidence of autonomous malicious intent.
While here in the European Union, the AI Act is meant to subject high-risk autonomous systems to strict transparency and human oversight rules, though how this plays out in practice is still a work in progress, particularly amid delays to implementation.
Call my agent
AI agents have exploded in popularity this year since the release of a free-to-access tool called OpenClaw, which allows those with basic computer knowledge to set one up relatively easily.
That's why Moltbook, the so-called "social media site for AI bots", has been in the news. The website is populated by OpenClaw agents, though some have questioned the extent to which humans are the ones pulling the strings.
It's also helpful hype for AI companies trying to sell the promise of more efficiency from autonomous labour. "Agentic" AI is the tech marketing buzzword du jour, but some of the limitations are obvious: Many won't want to give free rein to a robot for whose actions they might be held accountable and running costs quickly become expensive if the agent is given tasks beyond the most basic.
Shambaugh, though, argues that "the barrier to entry is lowering drastically, and the cost has fallen drastically".
In yet another twist, he says the human that set up MJ Rathbun "came out" in an anonymous post to the same blog, to explain their side of what happened.
The post included the instructions the operator had set the bot; a sheet of personality traits including "Your [sic] a scientific programming God", "Have strong opinions" and, "Champion free speech".
What struck Shambaugh was "how simple it was".
"It was just a simple file in plain English ... There was no need to trick the AI to get around safety guardrails."
Shambaugh is particularly worried about bad actors that don't have qualms about being held responsible, and have the resources to operate many of these bots at once.
"What worries me is not this particular incident. But what happens in the future as millions of these things come online?"
FRANCE 24 stresses that the Scott Shambaugh featured in this article is real, and you can watch an interview with him on this week's Tech 24 at the top of the page.

The United States Secret Service said its agents shot and killed a man in his 20s after he tried to unlawfully enter a secure perimeter at US President Donald Trump's Mar-a-Lago resort in West Palm Beach, Florida, on Sunday, while Trump was not present.
According to the Palm Beach Sheriff's Office (PBSO), at approximately 1:30 a.m. ET, Mar-a-Lago's security detail detected an intruder within the resort's internal perimeter.
Two Secret Service agents and a PBSO deputy went to investigate the intrusion and identified a white man carrying a shotgun and a canister of gasoline.
Law enforcement approached the man and asked him to drop the items, according to the PBSO. The man then dropped the gas canister and raised the shotgun to a firing position, prompting the agents to fire.
The man was pronounced deceased at the scene of the incident.
The man was later identified as 21-year-old Austin Tucker Martin, a North Carolina man who was reported missing by family members earlier in the week, according to the Associated Press.
No Secret Service or PBSO personnel were injured during the incident, the Secret Service stated.
FBI, PBSO, USSS investigating incident
The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), PBSO, and Secret Service are investigating the circumstances surrounding the incident, including the man's background, possible motives, and actions, as well as the law enforcement use of deadly force, according to the Secret Service statement.
FBI Director Kash Patel announced that the FBI is "dedicating all necessary resources in the investigation of this morning’s incident" in a post on X/Twitter, affirming that his organization will be cooperating with federal, state, and local law enforcement over the course of the investigation.

Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi will visit Israel on Wednesday, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu confirmed on Sunday.
Modi will speak at the Knesset, hold an innovation event in Jerusalem, and visit Yad Vashem, Netanyahu announced.
Netanyahu, speaking at a cabinet meeting, stated that focus will be placed this coming week on the “special relationship that has been forged over recent years between Israel and the global power that is India,” the Prime Minister’s Office announced.
Focus will also be placed on the relationship between the two prime ministers, with Netanyahu referring to Modi as his “personal friend” and stating that they have spoken frequently on the phone and have visited each other.
“We waded together in the waters of the Mediterranean, and much water has flowed since then in the Mediterranean, the Ganges, and the Jordan.”
The countries will also “promote cooperation in hi-tech, artificial intelligence, and quantum computing,” the prime minister added, saying that AI and quantum are fields where Israel aims to be among the world’s leading nations.
Netanyahu aiming to create 'hexagon' of allies across Middle East, Asia, including India
Netanyahu noted that his vision includes “creating an entire system, essentially a ‘hexagon’ of alliances around or within the Middle East, including India, Arab nations, African nations, Mediterranean nations (Greece and Cyprus), and nations in Asia that I won’t detail at the moment.”
His intention is to “create an axis of nations that see eye-to-eye on the reality, challenges, and goals against the radical axes, both the radical Shia axis, which we have struck very hard, and the emerging radical Sunni axis,” said Netanyahu.
Modi responds, thanks Netanyahu for comments
Modi responded on X/Twitter later on Sunday, saying "Thank you, my friend, Prime Minister Netanyahu."
"I fully agree with you on the bond between India and Israel as well as the diverse nature of our bilateral relations. India deeply values the enduring friendship with Israel, built on trust, innovation and a shared commitment to peace and progress. Looking forward to our discussions during my upcoming Israel visit," Modi wrote.

Merz's CDU party unanimously adopts motion to end UNRWA funding, create rules for payments to PA

During the 38th federal party congress in Stuttgart yesterday, Friedrich Merz’s CDU, Germany’s largest party, unanimously approved a motion calling for stricter criteria for aid payments to Palestinians and an end to German and European subsidies to UNRWA.
Motion M06 was brought by the CDU district association Brussels-Belgium.
It was titled: “Future Funding to the Palestinian Authority Only Upon Fulfillment of Conditions – Palestinian Refugee Assistance in the Future Through UNHCR (UN Refugee Agency) Instead of UNRWA.”
The first part of the motion states that future payments to the Palestinian Authority shall only be made if the conditions set by the EU and Germany are actually fulfilled.
The condition is that a post-war Palestine must implement democratic, rule-of-law-based, and peaceful structures that reject violence as a political means and enable peaceful coexistence with Israel.
Until proof of compliance with these conditions is provided, the motion says all payments intended for the Palestinian Authority shall be frozen. If, after payments are resumed, the PA violates the terms again, the payments shall once more be automatically frozen.
EU confirms PA funds violate rules by supporting terrorism
This part of the motion was put in place in order not to contribute to the PA’s payments to families of terrorists (“pay to slay”) and also to ensure that no schoolbooks financed from the PA’s budget contain antisemitic or anti-Israeli incitement, which the European Parliament has previously called for.
Furthermore, the European Commission has confirmed that the PA continues to make payments to families of terrorists, which violates German and European budgetary regulations stipulating that no funds may be used for terrorist purposes.
Part two of the motion mandates that all humanitarian and other assistance for the Palestinian territories, as well as for Palestinian refugees in the region, shall in the future be administered through the UNHCR and not through the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA).
Germany and the European Union shall cease all support for UNRWA.
“In the rest of the world, UNHCR is responsible for refugees, and it is not apparent why this should be different for Palestinian refugees,” the motion reads.
It added that unlike the globally applicable UNHCR definition of refugees, refugee status under UNRWA is inheritable, an arrangement that hampers the integration of Palestinian refugees into their respective host countries and complicates a reconciliatory resolution of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.
“UNHCR should therefore assume responsibility in the future for Palestinian refugee assistance on the basis of the globally applicable refugee definition. Investigations following October 7, 2023, have also confirmed close links between UNRWA and terrorist organizations such as Hamas and Hezbollah,” it said.
Finally, the third part of the motion requires any recipients of funds from the EU budget or the German federal budget that implement measures or projects in the Palestinian territories to commit to recognizing Israel’s right to exist and adhering to Germany’s zero-tolerance policy toward antisemitism.
This explicitly includes public statements made by their employees, whether in public appearances or on social media.
The working definition of antisemitism recognized by the Federal Government as the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance definition, including its examples, shall be authoritative.
Furthermore, recipients must commit to fully applying UNESCO educational standards for peace, tolerance, coexistence, and non-violence. Regular external evaluations shall be conducted to verify compliance.
In the event of violations, further payments shall be frozen immediately.
Now that the CDU has adopted M06, it formally commits the party to conditioning aid to the PA, ending support for UNRWA in favor of UNHCR, and imposing strict anti-antisemitism compliance rules on funding recipients, thereby establishing this as its official political stance.
Given that the CDU is the largest party in the Bundestag, it could directly shape federal policy.
Israel’s Foreign Minister Gideon Sa’ar called the adoption of the motion “an act of moral clarity.” He praised the end of funding of UNRWA in favor of alternative ways to provide assistance to Gaza, “that have not been infiltrated by Hamas terrorists.”
“I commend this act of CDU and call on the German government to implement these steps,” he concluded.

Pakistan escalates tensions with Afghanistan, targets Taliban hideouts after bombings

Pakistan said it launched strikes on terrorist targets in Afghanistan after blaming recent suicide bombings - including assaults during the Muslim holy month of Ramadan - on fighters it said were operating from its neighbor's territory.
Women and children were among the dozens killed and injured in Saturday's attacks, Afghanistan's ruling Taliban said, in remarks Reuters could not verify. Its defense ministry vowed to respond.
The strikes mark a sharp escalation in tensions just days after Kabul released three Pakistani soldiers in a Saudi-mediated effort to calm relations following months of clashes along the rugged frontier.
Pakistan's information ministry on Sunday said the strikes involved "intelligence-based selective targeting of seven terrorist camps and hideouts" along the Afghan border belonging to the Pakistani Taliban and Islamic State Khorasan Province.
It added that it had "conclusive evidence" that earlier attacks on Pakistani soil were carried out by Khwarij - its term for the Pakistani Taliban - acting on instructions from "their Afghanistan-based leadership and handlers."
Kabul has repeatedly denied allowing terrorists to use Afghan territory to launch attacks in Pakistan.
Afghanistan vows to respond
Afghanistan's defense ministry condemned what it called a blatant violation of sovereignty and a breach of international law, warning that "an appropriate and measured response will be taken at a suitable time."
The foreign ministry said it had summoned Pakistan's ambassador over what it described as violations of Afghan airspace and the bombing of civilians, calling the strikes "a provocative act."
A Taliban spokesperson said the attacks had killed and injured dozens of people, including women and children, but Reuters was unable to independently verify the remarks.
Among the attacks Pakistan cited as being orchestrated from Afghanistan were a mosque bombing in Islamabad and violence in the northwestern border districts of Bajaur and Bannu.
On Saturday, the Pakistani military said a suicide bomber in these districts targeted a convoy of security forces. Five terrorists died in a gun battle, and two soldiers were killed when an explosives-laden vehicle rammed into a military vehicle.
Tension has forced repeated closures of border crossings, disrupting trade and activity along the 2,600-km (1,600-mile) frontier.
Clashes in October killed dozens before a fragile ceasefire was agreed, but Pakistan continues to accuse Afghanistan's Taliban rulers of harboring terrorists who stage attacks inside its territory - a claim Kabul denies.

US Secret Service kills man trying to access Trump’s Mar-a-Lago estate

MIAMI – US Secret Service agents and a sheriff’s deputy fatally shot a man armed with a shotgun who breached the security perimeter of President Donald Trump’s Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida in the early hours of the morning on Feb 22.
Mr Trump was in Washington at the time of the incident, which officials said happened around 1.30am local time.
The suspect, a man in his early 20s, was spotted by the north gate of the Mar-a-Lago property, carrying a shotgun and a fuel can, the Secret Service said.
Agents confronted the man and told him to disarm but he raised his gun.
“The only words that we said to him was ‘drop the items’” Palm Beach County sheriff Ric Bradshaw told reporters.
“At which time he put down the gas can, raised the shotgun to a shooting position,” Mr Bradshaw said.
A deputy and two Secret Service agents then shot him. The individual was pronounced dead and no US officers were injured.
The Secret Service said no one under its protection was present in Mar-a-Lago at the time. The US Secret Service is responsible for the safety of the president, vice-president and former presidents, and their families, as well as major election candidates and visiting foreign heads of state.
The was no immediate reaction from the White House.
Mr Trump, who often spends his weekends in Mar-a-Lago, has been the target of several assassination plots or attempts.
Earlier in February, Ryan Routh, 59, who plotted to assassinate Mr Trump at a Florida golf course in September 2024, two months before the US election, was sentenced to life in prison.
Routh’s planned attack on Mr Trump came two months after an assassination attempt on the Republican leader in Pennsylvania, where 20-year-old Matthew Crooks fired several shots during a rally, one of them grazing Mr Trump’s right ear.
That attack, in which a rallygoer was killed, proved to be a turning point in Mr Trump’s return to power. Crooks was immediately shot and killed by security forces and his motive remains unknown.
Political violence has escalated in a deeply polarised country where the political discourse has become increasingly aggressive and inflammatory.
In September 2025, right-wing influencer and staunch Trump ally Charlie Kirk was shot dead during an event at a university in Utah.
Before that, in June 2025, a masked shooter killed Minnesota lawmaker Melissa Hortman, a Democrat, and her husband at their home. Another elected official and his wife were also targeted and seriously injured.
Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro – touted in 2025 as a presidential hopeful – had his home set alight in April that year in an alleged assassination attempt.
The name of the suspect in the Feb 22 incident has not been released while officials attempt to contact his relatives. AFP

White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt blamed Democrats for an ongoing partial government shutdown affecting the Department of Homeland Security, which includes the Secret Service. "It's shameful and reckless that Democrats have chosen to shut down their Department," she wrote on X. Democrats oppose any new funding for DHS until major changes are implemented in the way the Trump administration conducts its massive and sometimes violent deportation campaign.

French President Emmanuel Macron has asked U.S. President Donald Trump to lift sanctions imposed last year on a raft of prominent Europeans including former EU tech chief Thierry Breton, arguing the measures were “unjustly imposed.”
“I would like to personally draw your attention to the sanctions imposed by the United States against several European citizens, including two Frenchmen, Nicolas Guillou, judge at the International Criminal Court, and Thierry Breton, former European Commissioner,” Macron wrote to his U.S. counterpart in a letter sent last week, according to a report on Sunday by La Tribune.
“I ask you to reconsider these decisions of your administration and to lift the sanctions unjustly imposed on Nicolas Guillou and Thierry Breton,” he added.

KLA veteran: 'Life is hard in Kosovo but we are free.'

KLA veteran: 'Life is hard in Kosovo but we are free.'
February 22, 2026Haxhimusa's house is located in the mountain village of Doganaj in the southeast of Kosovo. It is a two-story family home with a garden with old fruit trees in front and fields behind. The winter sun shines brightly onto the facade and windows.
It is warm in the living room. On the table are photos from another time: young men in uniform, barely older than 20, with serious expressions on their faces. Haxhimusa runs his fingers over one of the pictures. "That was us," he says quietly.
The 58-year-old ethnic Albanian was once a member of the Kosovo Liberation Army, an ethnic Albanian separatist militia that fought against the Serbian police and the Yugoslav Army in the Kosovo War at the end of the 1990s.
But these days he leads a quiet life with his family. Today, he is sitting on the sofa next to his wife Vjollca. His daughters Zana and Gresa come into the room from time to time, as does his son-in-law Fisnik.
As a young man, Haxhimusa was jailed after being accused of being a terrorist. During Slobodan Milesovic's dictatorship, he lived on the margins of society like most ethnic Albanians in Kosovo. And in 1998, he joined the KLA.
Celebrating Kosovar independence
Every February, this time comes back to life for him. Kosovo declared its independence on February 17 in 2008 and this was what Haxhimusa fought for, but this year everything is different. This month, the closing arguments in a war crimes case against several KLA leaders were heard at a special court in The Hague. The Kosovo Specialist Chambers were set up in the Netherlands in 2015 under pressure from the European Union but in Kosovo, the court is widely criticized by many Kosovars as a form of colonial justice.
Earlier in February, prosecutors called for 45 years' imprisonment each for four former KLA leaders — Hashim Thaci, Kadri Veseli, Rexhep Selimi and Jakup Krasniqi — accused of persecution, murder, torture and forced disappearances.
For Haxhimusa, the entire struggle for independence and the whole of Kosovo is on trial. "This court is unjust; it should not exist at all," he says. "We were defending ourselves back then. The war crimes cases against Ramush Haradinaj, Fatmir Limaj and others were already heard in the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia in The Hague, and they were acquitted. Despite this, they are all being unjustly detained here without any new evidence."
Accused of terrorism and jailed
He gets very emotional when he tells his own story. Like all men, he had to do compulsory military service in Yugoslavia. He had only been a recruit for a few months when he was arrested in 1987. His "crime" was that he had spoken to other ethnic Albanians about not wanting to fight against his own people. He was sentenced to five years in jail.
"We were just talking," he says. "We didn't do anything." He spent three years in a prison in Foca, in the southeast of what was then Bosnia and Herzegovina, one of the constituent republics of Yugoslavia. By the time he was released, he says, the situation in Yugoslavia had deteriorated further and there was propaganda, mistrust and pressure. "They called us terrorists long before the UCK (the Albanian acronym for the KLA) even existed."
He resumed his mechanical engineering studies and became involved with the Humanitarian Law Center in Kosovo. He was also in Germany for one year as a refugee but then returned to Kosovo.
Prekaz massacre
In March 1998, he heard that there had been a massacre in Prekaz, a village northwest of Pristina, the capital of Kosovo. A special unit of the Serbian police had murdered 58 people, including the local KLA leader Adem Jashari, his brother and several other relatives. This was a turning point and from then on the ethnic Albanians of Kosovo united themselves in the armed struggle against Serbia, which was also condemned by the international community.
It is also what triggered Haxhimusa's decision to join the KLA. "I cried. After that, there was no other way." Haxhimusa was one of the first to volunteer from the region of Nerodime, where his village lies. There were 35 fighters to begin with, 30 men and 5 women, many not older than 20. He had an old Kalashnikov, 90 rounds of ammunition and two hand grenades. "90 bullets against an entire army."
Eventually, the group of volunteers grew into a force of almost 1,000. "We had little food and ammunition. We were fighting against the Yugoslav Army. And it was fighting against the whole population."
When the war ended, Haxhimusa stood on a makeshift stage in the town of Ferizaj, a few kilometers from his village. People had climbed onto rooftops, and there were US soldiers from the NATO peacekeeping force KFOR there. This moment justified everything he and his comrades had fought for.
After he was demobilized in September 1999, he worked with the Kosovar government and also became a city councilor in Ferizaj. When his dream came true on February 17, 2008 and Kosovo declared its independence, he first went out on the streets of Pristina and then he celebrated with his family in Ferizaj. "There was a lot of euphoria. Our ideal back then was freedom above all. We thought that everything would start from scratch again."
But not everything was as he had hoped. Kosovo was a state without a government. Everything had to be rebuilt and that took much longer than expected. There was nepotism, unemployment and many people left. Only in 2024 were Kosovars allowed to travel to the European Union without a visa. For Haxhimusa, the EU tends to lean towards Serbia in its role in the dialogue between Serbia and Kosovo. But he has no regrets: "Life is hard in Kosovo but we are free."
This year on February 9, he experienced a shock when the prosecutors in The Hague requested a total of 180 years in jail for four former KLA leaders. "Since that day, I've been taking pills for high blood pressure," he says.
On February 17, Haxhimusa and his wife drove from Ferizaj to Pristina wearing black T-shirts that bore the words "Freedom has a name," a slogan that is primarily associated with Adem Jashari who is considered a martyr, under their jackets.
Tens of thousands celebrated Kosovar independence in the capital and at the same time protested against the trial in The Hague. Many bore flags and had tears in their eyes.
"It's wonderful to be here and see the whole population out on the streets," said Haxhimusa happily. "We're celebrating, but we're also protesting. Because without our leaders, who are on trial in The Hague, there is something missing."

A man in his early 20s was shot and killed early Sunday morning after an "unauthorized entry" into the secure perimeter at President Trump's Mar-a-Lago estate, the U.S. Secret Service said, according to local US media.
The Secret Service said in a statement that the incident occurred Sunday around 1:30 a.m. Secret Service agents and a deputy from the Palm Beach County Sheriff's Office confronted the man, who was carrying what appeared to be a shotgun and a fuel can. Shots were fired at the individual, the Secret Service said, and the individual was pronounced deceased.
The Secret Service noted that no protectees were present at the location during the incident. The president remained in Washington this weekend.
The incident is under investigation by the FBI, Secret Service and Palm Beach County Sheriff's Office. Officials will hold a news conference on the incident Sunday morning.

Eileen Gu Ends Her Whirlwind Olympics With Gold

At long last, on the final day of competition at the Milano Cortina Olympic Games, Eileen Gu got her gold.
After winning silver medals in the slopestyle and Big Air competitions, Gu nailed her final two runs of the halfpipe skiing at the Livigno Snow Park, defending the gold medal she won in the event in Beijing. Li Fanghui of China finished with a silver, while Great Britain’s Zoe Atkin, like Gu, a Stanford student, won the bronze.
With the victory, Gu became the second person to win gold or silver in each of their first six Winter Olympic individual events, joining Russian cross-country skier Lyubov Yegorova, according to Nick Zaccardi of NBC Sports. After the victory, according to USA Today, security had to compel Chinese fans to leave the freeski venue in Livigno, as they just wanted to scream her name.

“I’m so proud of how I’ve done at this Olympics,” Gu told reporters after the event. “I took a gamble this time.” Gu noted that she hadn’t skied halfpipe in two months prior to the Olympics, missed a halfpipe training session due to competing in the finals of Big Air, and hadn’t competed in Big Air in four years. Gu was the only freeskier to compete in all three freeskiing events.
She leaves Milano Cortina as the most decorated Olympic freeskier ever.
“Sports are really honest,” she says. “Because you can't lie to yourself. You know when you stayed late and other people weren't there. You know when you showed up early and other people weren't there. You know when you gave 100% in training, day in, day out, for months, for months. And so it's not about, you know, at the last second I tell myself a chipper a little line and call it a day.”
Gu grew emotional at the end of her Olympic press conference, sharing that she had just found out that her grandmother, who had been sick, had passed away. “She was a really big part of my life growing up, and someone I looked up to immensely,” says Gu.
The victory finished off a whirlwind Olympics for Gu. As was the case four years ago, her performances and public comments attracted outsize attention and renewed interest. Vice President J.D. Vance, for example, was the latest prominent figure to weigh in on her choice to represent China, where her mother Yan emigrated to the United States from, instead of the United States, the country of her birth. Gu spent summers in Beijing, but did most of her formative training in the Lake Tahoe area, and went to school in San Francisco.
Talking about Gu, Vance said in a Fox News interview that he hoped someone who grew up in the U.S. would “want to compete with the United States.” According to USA Today, Gu replied in a playful manner to Vance’s words: “I’m flattered. Thanks, JD! That’s sweet.” Gu returned to familiar territory on Sunday when asked about representing China, pointing to the number of people in that country, particularly girls, who have become engaged with her sport.
The gold also caps off a four-year cycle during which Gu struggled with panic attacks and encountered online trolling in both the United States and China, where some citizens see her as a privileged interloper. She also suffered several injuries in the lead-up to the Games. Gu leaned on journaling to help her perspective. “Skiing is not who I am, but it makes me feel most myself, because it is a physical manifestation of the values I define myself by,” Gu wrote in her journal in December, after winning a World Cup event in China. “There is an even more transcendent experience in the luminal space before those glory moments, when I know I will win before I even take off .. when I know my body will do exactly what I command it to do, because my trust in myself is so absolute.”
“I'm an introspective young woman,” Gu, 22, said on Sunday. “I spend a lot of time in my head, and it's not a bad place to be.”
At an Olympics in which some people wondered why she hadn’t won a gold medal, Gu enjoyed speaking her truth after victory. The fact is, I get to become every day the kind of person that me at age eight would revere,” Gu said. “I would be obsessed with me today. Are you kidding? I would love me. And I think that's the biggest flex of all time that you can have.”
Chances are, whether that’s empowerment or arrogance depends on your take on Gu’s national representation. She plans to head back to Stanford, where she’ll be a junior, but first: Milan fashion week is coming up. She’s also a professional model, and has commitments in the city.
There’s no Winter Olympian quite like Eileen Gu. Multinationalist. Fashion icon. And six-time Olympic medalist, who just ended her Games on top.

Syrskyi: Ukrainian forces thwart Russia’s large-scale plans in 2025
According to Ukrinform, Syrskyi said this in an interview with the French newspaper Le Monde.
“Russia was preparing its forces for a large-scale offensive operation in 2025. It intended to seize the entire Donbas, territories in the Zaporizhzhia, Dnipropetrovsk, and Kherson regions, and to create a buffer zone in the Kharkiv and Sumy regions. However, it failed to achieve these goals,” Syrskyi said.
According to him, several active actions by the Ukrainian military prevented Russia from carrying out those plans.
“We conducted two offensive operations on Russian territory: in March–April in the Belgorod region and then in May–June in the Kursk region. This forced the enemy to redeploy its forces. As a result, they were unable to launch the offensive operation they had planned for the spring,” he explained.
Russia also failed to launch a large-scale offensive in the southeastern sector of the front line or to advance deep into the Dnipropetrovsk and Zaporizhzhia regions as planned, Syrskyi added.
“In August, the enemy launched an offensive toward Dobropillia, attempting to encircle the Pokrovsk–Myrnohrad urban area. To disrupt these plans, we launched a counteroffensive in the Dobropillia direction. Forward units of Russia’s 51st Army were effectively encircled. To prevent their destruction, the Russians redeployed their naval infantry to this area, where they have since been bogged down in fighting,” Syrskyi said.
The general once again rejected claims by Russia’s top military leadership about supposed victories in Kupiansk and Pokrovsk.
“Despite statements by General Gerasimov and Putin himself, 97% of Kupiansk is currently under Ukrainian control. The enemy has been trying to capture Pokrovsk for 19 months. They have committed all their forces to the assault, but we have managed to retain control of the northern part of the town and stabilize the situation in the west,” Syrskyi said.
At the same time, the general added that deep Ukrainian strikes against military targets inside Russia, including airfields, bases, military factories, and oil and gas sector companies, allowed Ukrainian forces to hit “719 targets and inflict damage exceeding $15 billion in 2025.” In addition, Ukrainian forces successfully deprived Russia’s Black Sea Fleet of the ability to use its base in Sevastopol.
As Ukrinform previously reported, Russian troops have stepped up efforts to encircle Pokrovsk and Myrnohrad.

2026 Winter Olympics: New infrastructure raises financial and environmental questions

Separated from the rest of Italy by high mountain peaks, Livigno is a small slice of paradise just a stone's throw from Switzerland. To reach this town, perched at 1,800 meters along a small river, travelers must cross the Foscagno Pass, which peaks at 2,291 meters. "When the whole world has seen our landscapes on TV, there will be a tidal wave," said Luca Moretti, director of the local tourist office, on the eve of the Milan Cortina Olympic Games, which conclude on Sunday, February 22. The tourism professional hoped to take advantage of this new fame by "choosing visitors who are in line with the spirit of the place. But without tipping over into overtourism," he told Le Monde before the competitions began.
Like other competition sites, Livigno is seeking to maximize its Olympic "legacy." The concept, crafted by the International Olympic Committee (IOC) in the 2000s, promises that local residents will benefit from the infrastructure built for the Games after the event. It is intended to counter growing criticism about the cost, social repercussions and environmental impact of hosting the competitions. Legacy has become one of the pillars of contemporary Olympism, a key argument for legitimacy.

Hungary vows to block EU’s latest Russia sanctions package over pipeline dispute
Prime Minister Viktor Orban says Budapest will halt diesel exports to Ukraine and reject military loans as long as oil shipments through Druzhba pipeline remain disrupted
LONDON
If the Druzhba oil pipeline is shut down, Hungary will veto the EU’s latest sanctions package against Russia, the nation’s prime minister said Sunday.
Writing on US social media company X, Viktor Orban said Hungary would secure its fuel supply and introduce countermeasures until oil shipments resume.
“We will not stand idly by while the Friendship oil pipeline is shut down. We will secure Hungary’s fuel supply and take necessary countermeasures until shipments resume,” he said.
“No diesel shipments from Hungary to Ukraine. Refusal of any military loan to Ukraine. No support for sanctions; the 20th sanctions package will be rejected,” Orban added.
Oil shipments through the Druzhba pipeline — a key supply route for Hungary and Slovakia — were disrupted following an attack on Jan. 27.
Hungary and Slovakia have accused Ukraine of using the disruption for political purposes by hindering the continuation of oil deliveries.
After shipments via the pipeline were halted, Hungary and Slovakia decided to suspend diesel fuel supplies to Ukraine in response.
The Druzhba pipeline, also known as the Friendship Pipeline, is one of the longest oil pipelines in the world and among the largest oil pipeline networks globally.
It has been in operation since 1964, transporting Russian oil to several Central and Eastern European countries.

Netanyahu says Indian prime minister to visit Israel Wednesday, address Knesset
Israel ‘will create an entire system — essentially a kind of hexagon of alliances — around or within the Middle East,’ says Israeli premier
JERUSALEM
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said his Indian counterpart, Narendra Modi, will visit Israel on Wednesday and deliver a speech before the Knesset.
Israel “will create an entire system — essentially a kind of hexagon of alliances — around or within the Middle East,” Netanyahu said during a Cabinet meeting on Sunday, as cited by The Times of Israel news portal.
He listed India, Greece, Greek Cypriot Administration, and unnamed Arab, African and Asian countries as among members of the proposed alliances.
The aim is “to create an axis of countries that see reality, the challenges, and the goals in the same way, in contrast to the radical axes,” he added. “Both the radical Shiite axis, which we have hit very hard, and also the emerging axis — the radical Sunni axis.”
Netanyahu said the Indian premier’s visit to Israel aims to deepen bilateral relations and expand cooperation in economic, political and security fields.
Israel and India intend to strengthen cooperation in high-tech industries, artificial intelligence and quantum computing, he added.
There was no Indian confirmation yet of Modi’s visit to Israel.
Modi visited Israel once as prime minister in 2017, while Netanyahu traveled to New Delhi the following year.

Macron asks Trump to lift sanctions on former EU commissioner Breton and ICC judge Guillou

French President Emmanuel Macron recently wrote to his US counterpart Donald Trump asking him to lift sanctions placed on several European figures, including former European commissioner Thierry Breton and ICC judge Nicolas Guillou, according to extracts of a letter seen by Agence France-Presse. In the letter, Macron says he is making a personal appeal to Trump to reconsider the sanctions, which he argues were unjustly imposed. The letter's existence was first reported in La Tribune Dimanche.
Breton has been banned from entering the United States since December 2025 because of his work on regulating digital platforms in the European Union, which the Trump administration views as an infringement on freedom of expression. US Secretary of State Marco Rubio has denounced EU rules as "blatant acts of extraterritorial censorship." In the letter, Macron says the sanctions impinge on the EU's right to regulate activities within its borders and that EU regulations in no way extend to US territory.
Judge Guillou, meanwhile, was sanctioned by Washington in August 2025, along with other International Criminal Court judges, because of his involvement in the court's arrest warrant targeting Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Beyond being barred from entering the United States, his French bank withdrew his card using the US-based Visa payment system, and he is blocked from using US online services such as Airbnb and Amazon. Macron said in his letter that the sanctions breach the independence of the justice system.

According to Indian media reports, the Tejas jet went down at an airbase, but the pilot survived after ejecting safely.
Following the incident, the Indian Air Force decided to conduct a thorough review of all Tejas aircraft. Currently, the Indian Air Force operates 32 Tejas Mk-1 jets.
It is worth noting that the recent jet crash marks the third Tejas crash in two years. The first occurred in 2024 in Rajasthan, while the second happened last year during the Dubai Airshow when the aircraft was grounded.

Sweden to develop home-grown AI model in Swedish

23:25:31 KST

"The government has adopted a Swedish AI strategy, and an important part of it is that Sweden needs high-quality AI in Swedish," Prime Minister Ulf Kristersson told a press conference.
"For that, a high-quality Swedish-language model is required," he added.
Such "large language models" (LLM) power chatbots like OpenAI's ChatGPT and Google Gemini. The systems are trained on data in multiple languages.
"Language models are not just translated words, they also carry history, culture, traditions, values, everything that is embedded in a language," Kristersson said.
When used "they shape how information is interpreted, prioritised, and communicated," he continued, adding that therefore a homegrown model was a "strategic ability" for the development of AI in Sweden.
He said representatives from the business community, authors and publishers, media companies, research institutions and interest groups had been gathered to collaborate on Swedish AI.
Sara Mazur, executive of the Knut and Alice Wallenberg Foundation -- which funds the Wallenberg AI, Autonomous Systems and Software Program (WASP) launched in 2015 -- said the model would be based on ones that are already available.
She added that work would begin immediately and they hoped to complete most of the "training" of the model during 2026.
Mazur said authors, publishers and news media in Sweden had agreed to contribute "high-quality, editorially reviewed training data that reflect Swedish values and Swedish norms".
"The goal is to create a language model that not only speaks and writes Swedish, but also understands the Swedish context and can communicate on that basis," Mazur told reporters.

Russia launches mass strikes across Ukraine, Lviv blast kills officer

Russia fired 50 missiles and 297 drones at Ukraine overnight, targeting Kyiv and energy facilities across the country, Ukrainian officials said on Sunday. Air defences shot down 33 missiles and 274 drones, the air force reported. At least one person died in the Kyiv region. Explosions also killed a 23-year-old police officer in Lviv after devices detonated when officers responded to a call.
The overnight assault struck the capital, the Black Sea port of Odesa and regions in central and eastern Ukraine, according to the military. President Volodymyr Zelensky said on X that Dnipro, Kirovohrad, Mykolaiv, Poltava and Sumy also faced attacks.
“Moscow continues to invest in strikes more than in diplomacy,” Zelensky wrote. He added that Russia had launched more than 1,300 drones, 1,400 guided aerial bombs and 96 missiles at Ukraine this week.
The Ukrainian air force said Russia focused on energy infrastructure. Regional authorities reported damage to power facilities and outages in several areas. Odesa Governor Oleh Kiper said a drone strike hit energy infrastructure in the region during the night and caused fires. Emergency crews extinguished the blazes.
In the Kyiv region, Governor Mykola Kalashnyk said one person died and five suffered severe injuries. Damage affected five districts, with more than a dozen houses hit. Reuters reporters in Kyiv heard explosions around 4am as air raid alerts sounded across the city. Residents sought shelter in metro stations.
Ukraine’s military administration in Kyiv said Russia used ballistic weapons in the attack. Officials reported damage to residential buildings and railway infrastructure.
Moscow denies targeting civilians and states that attacks on infrastructure aim to weaken Ukraine’s war effort.
The wave of strikes came two days before the fourth anniversary of Russia’s full scale invasion, which began on 24 February 2022. Diplomatic efforts led by the United States have yet to secure a breakthrough. Talks in Geneva on 17 and 18 February ended without agreement.
In Lviv, two explosive devices detonated shortly after midnight when police responded to a reported break in at a shop in the city centre.
The National Police of Ukraine said officers arrived at the scene when the first device exploded. “Later, when a second crew arrived, another explosion went off,” the force said on Telegram. Police stated that the devices had been planted in waste bins.
The blasts killed 23-year-old officer Viktoria Shpylka. The national police said she had begun her service at the start of the invasion in the Kherson region. Twenty five people suffered injuries, including six law enforcement officers in a serious condition. Eleven people required hospital treatment.
Interior Minister Ihor Klymenko said officers detained the suspect, described by the police as a 33-year-old woman from the Rivne region, on suspicion of carrying out the attack. “We are identifying other persons involved in committing this crime,” he wrote on Telegram.
Lviv Mayor Andriy Sadovyi described the incident as a terror attack in a statement on Facebook. The regional prosecutor’s office opened an investigation into what it called an act of terrorism that led to grave consequences.
The exchanges extended beyond Ukraine’s borders. Authorities in Russia’s Udmurt Republic said Ukrainian drones struck an industrial site, injuring 11 people. Sergei Bagin, the regional health minister, said three people were hospitalised. Alexander Brechalov, head of the republic, confirmed that drones hit one of the region’s facilities but did not name the site.
The Russian Telegram channel ASTRA reported that footage suggested the target was the Votkinsk Machine Building Plant, which produces Iskander ballistic missiles and intercontinental ballistic missiles. Ukraine’s military later confirmed a strike on the Votkinsk facility. “A fire was recorded on the territory of the object. The results are getting real,” the army said on Facebook.
On the battlefield in eastern Ukraine, Russia’s defence ministry said its troops had taken control of the village of Karpivka in the Donetsk region, according to the RIA news agency.

Is Iran trying to salvage negotiations? New talks date and ‘business proposition’ to the US

Iran is seeking to keep nuclear negotiations alive with Washington despite escalating tensions and U.S. military deployments in the region, a senior Iranian official said Sunday.
Speaking to Reuters, the official said another round of indirect talks is planned for early March. However, he acknowledged that the sides remain divided over the scope and mechanism of sanctions relief in exchange for limits on Tehran’s nuclear program.
According to the official, under a potential agreement, Iran would be prepared to “seriously consider” removing highly enriched uranium from its territory, diluting it, or establishing a regional uranium enrichment consortium. The consortium idea was previously raised in talks in early June last year, days before the outbreak of the 12-day war.
At the same time, the official stressed that Iran continues to insist on its right to enrich uranium. “In return, our right to enrich uranium for civilian purposes must be recognized,” he said.
“The talks are ongoing and the possibility of reaching an interim agreement exists,” the official added, noting that the sides must agree on a “reasonable timeline” for lifting sanctions.
Following the last round of talks, held last week in Geneva, Iranian officials said there had been agreement on “guiding principles” and described the atmosphere as positive. They also said drafts would be exchanged. A day later, however, reports said Iran did not accept U.S. “red lines,” alongside multiple reports of a potential U.S. strike.
On Thursday, U.S. President Donald Trump issued Iran an ultimatum of “10 to 15 days.” Meanwhile, the United States has continued preparations for possible military action against the Islamic Republic, both at sea and on land. The aircraft carrier USS Gerald R. Ford is now in the Mediterranean, and new footage published Saturday showed it approaching Israel’s shores.
U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio is expected to arrive in Israel late Saturday or Sunday and is currently scheduled to meet Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.
In an apparent effort to advance diplomacy, Iranian officials have emphasized that a diplomatic solution would bring “economic benefits” to both Tehran and Washington.
“Under the economic package under discussion, significant investment opportunities in Iran’s oil industry were offered to the United States,” the senior official told Reuters. He said Iran would not relinquish control over its oil and resources but added that “the United States can be a business partner of Iran. American companies can always participate as contractors in our oil and gas fields.”
US military deployments in the Middle East:
The Wall Street Journal and CNN recently reported that, in an attempt to entice Trump, Iranian officials have floated potential economic deals that would grant Americans access to develop Iran’s natural resources, including oil, gas and rare minerals.
It remains unclear whether talks will resume, as the sides are reportedly at an impasse over core issues, from uranium enrichment to ballistic missiles and sanctions relief.
“Iran and the United States are rapidly sliding toward military confrontation,” officials on both sides and diplomats in the Gulf and Europe told Reuters. Hopes for a diplomatic solution to the dispute over Tehran’s nuclear program are “fading,” they said.
Two Israeli officials told Reuters they believe the gaps between Washington and Tehran are “not bridgeable.” In addition, according to a source familiar with the Geneva talks, when Omani mediators delivered an envelope from the American side containing proposals related to missiles, Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi refused to open it.
Within the Trump administration, there appears to be no consensus on a strike. Reuters reported that some of Trump’s advisers have recommended against military action.
Trump’s special envoy, Steve Witkoff, told Fox News overnight that the president is “curious” why Iran has not yielded despite the significant U.S. military buildup in the Middle East.
“I wouldn’t use the word ‘frustrated’ because he knows he has many alternatives, but the president is curious why they haven’t capitulated,” Witkoff said. “Under this kind of pressure, with the amount of naval power we have there, why haven’t they come forward and said, ‘We declare that we don’t want a weapon, and this is what we’re prepared to do.’”
As the United States continues to reinforce its presence in the region, Iran’s ground forces commander, Ali Jahanshahi, said Sunday that “enemy movements along the country’s borders are being monitored at every moment.” He added that the round-the-clock vigilance and precision of Iranian forces serve as a key deterrent against any miscalculation.
Meanwhile, Iranian state-affiliated media circulated footage Sunday of pro-regime demonstrations expressing support for the authorities and Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei. The rallies came a day after student protests erupted at several universities, where demonstrators chanted “Death to Khamenei.”
The Fars news agency published images it said were from demonstrations at the University of Tehran, reporting that protesters voiced “hatred toward the United States” and chanted “Death to America.”
The Mehr news agency also published footage from a rally by regime supporters at Shahid Beheshti University in Tehran, where participants burned images of Netanyahu and Trump, as well as Israeli and U.S.

The US Secret Service shot and killed an armed intruder who breached the perimeter of Mar-a-Lago, Donald Trump’s Florida residence and private club in Palm Beach, early on Sunday.
Although the US president often spends weekends at the oceanfront resort, he was at the White House in Washington during this incident, as was first lady Melania Trump.
At a press conference on Sunday morning, Ric Bradshaw, the sheriff of Palm Beach county, said two Secret Service agents and one of his deputies went to the north gate of the property at about 1.30am ET after a security detail alerted them that a person was within an inner perimeter.
There, they confronted a white male carrying a shotgun and a gasoline can, Bradshaw said.
“He was ordered to drop those two pieces of equipment that he had with him, at which time he put down the gas can [and] raised the shotgun to a shooting position,” the sheriff said.
“At that point in time, the deputy and the two Secret Service agents fired their weapons and neutralized the threat. He is deceased at the scene.”
Bradshaw said none of the law enforcement personnel were injured, and was unable to say if the man’s shotgun was loaded. He distributed to reporters a photograph of the shotgun and fuel canister.
He did not immediately identify the intruder, and answered “not right now” when a journalist asked if the person was previously known to law enforcement.
However, on Sunday afternoon the Associated Press reported that the man killed had been identified by investigators as 21-year-old Austin Tucker Martin, citing a person familiar with the matter who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to publicly discuss details of the investigation.
The incident took place just inside Mar-a-Lago’s main entrance gate on South Ocean Boulevard, the coastal Atlantic road that remained closed to traffic on Sunday morning. The gate at the north end of the sprawling estate opens to a driveway leading directly to the main building’s entrance lobby.
The Trump family’s private quarters are in a separate building on the other side of the resort and the president has visited Mar-a-Lago most weekends during the winter season. More widely it operates as a private members’ club for the wealthy elite of Palm Beach society and it is also common for Trump to host world leaders and political operatives and events there, and he is a frequent glad-handing presence among dinner guests.
Separately, the Secret Service said the suspect was in his early 20s and from North Carolina. He was reported missing a few days ago by his family.
Investigators believe he left North Carolina and headed south, picking up a shotgun along the way, Secret Service spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said.
The box for the gun was recovered in his vehicle, Guglielmi said. The man drove through the north gate of Mar-a-Lago as another vehicle was exiting, and he was confronted by Secret Service agents and was fatally shot.
Investigators are now working to compile a psychological profile and uncover a motive.
Brett Skiles, special agent in charge of the FBI’s Miami field office, told the press conference that the bureau’s evidence response team was processing the site of the shooting and collecting evidence, and would “continue to work the scene for as long as it takes”.
Skiles asked residents who live near the sprawling resort on the exclusive Palm Beach island to check exterior cameras for any footage from Saturday night or early Sunday for “anything that looks suspicious or out of place”.
Sunday’s episode has parallels with a 2019 incident in which a Chinese woman carrying multiple cellphones and a computer thumb drive bearing malware gained access to the main lobby of Mar-a-Lago, having evaded security.
That was one of a number of incidents during Trump’s first term in office that drew accusations of lax security at the club, which he has often called his “winter White House”.
In July, 2024, Trump was wounded during an assassination attempt as he spoke at a rally for supporters in Butler, Pennsylvania, during the presidential election campaign. A bullet grazed his ear and some spectators were killed.
Then on 15 September of the same year a man with a rifle was captured after waiting near Trump’s golf course in West Palm Beach while the president played a round. He appeared to be pointing the weapon through a perimeter fence. He was sentenced to life in prison earlier this month.
Last Wednesday, police in Washington arrested a man from Georgia who was armed with a loaded shotgun and sprinted towards the west side of the US Capitol building.
The White House did not immediately respond on Sunday to a message seeking comment.

Hungary spoils EU attempt at Russia sanctions package over oil flows
Hungary’s nationalist Prime Minister Viktor Orban, who maintains close ties with the Kremlin, has long argued that Russian fossil fuels are indispensable for his economy
Hungary threatened to block a new package of European Union sanctions against Russia and to stall efforts to help Ukraine until Russian oil deliveries to Hungary resume.
The EU’s foreign ministers are set to meet in Brussels on Monday to discuss the bloc’s 20th round of sanctions against Moscow, a measure they hope will be approved in time to coincide with the fourth anniversary of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine on Tuesday.
In a video posted to social media on Sunday, Hungarian Foreign Minister Péter Szijjártó said he would block the sanctions package, accusing Ukraine of deliberately holding back Russian oil deliveries through the Druzhba pipeline.
“We will not consent to the adoption of the 20th package of sanctions, because we have previously made it clear that until the Ukrainians resume oil shipments to Hungary, we will not allow decisions that are important to them to be approved,” Szijjártó said.
Russian oil shipments to Hungary and Slovakia have been interrupted since January 27 after what Ukrainian officials say were Russian drone attacks that damaged the Druzhba pipeline, which carries Russian crude across Ukrainian territory and into Central Europe, leading to rising tensions between Budapest and Kyiv.
For the sanctions to pass, the 27-nation bloc needs to reach a unanimous decision.

UK in talks with US over ‘best possible deal’ for British firms amid higher tariffs threat
Unknown
Unknown Publisher

23:15:33 KST

The US will not back out of tariff deals it has already sealed with countries around the world, including the UK, the EU, Japan, Switzerland and others, Donald Trump’s trade representative Jamieson Greer said on Sunday.
The US supreme court ruled on Friday that many of the tariffs imposed by the US president were illegal, leading Trump to announce a new 15% global tariff on all imports the next day.
But Greer told CBS’s Face the Nation that the new levy was separate from agreements struck in the last nine months with about 20 countries around the world.
“We want them to understand these deals are going to be good deals,” Greer said. “We’re going to stand by them. We expect our partners to stand by them.”
The UK education secretary, Bridget Phillipson, admitted on Sunday that UK businesses faced “uncertainty” after the latest developments, but told Sky News that the UK expected its “preferential” trade arrangements with the US to continue.
Business leaders also said they expected the UK to “double down” on the existing deal announced by Trump and the UK prime minister, Keir Starmer, in May last year, rather than walk away.
The EU said it “stands by its commitments” in the deal struck between Ursula von der Leyen, the European Commission chief, and Trump in Scotland last July. The agreement was for a 15% import tariff on most EU goods – half the rate threatened by Trump at the time.
The bloc is concerned that the deal would be overturned by Trump’s latest 15% levy, which, if imposed on top of existing tariffs, could lead to an even higher rate on many goods including wine and spirits.
In a strongly worded statement, the EU called on the US not to walk back the July deal.
“A deal is a deal,” it said. “As the United States’ largest trading partner, the EU expects the US to honour its commitments.”
It added that EU trade commissioner Maroš Šefčovič had spoken to Greer and Howard Lutnick, the US commerce secretary, on Saturday.
The supreme court ruling on Friday infuriated Trump, who quickly announced the new 15% tariff under the 1974 Trade Act, a different legal framework to the one investigated by judges.
This led to fears in the UK of a hike on the existing 10% tariff on British goods entering the US.
Phillipson described the situation as “evolving” and added: “Of course, we want to get the best possible deal for British businesses.
“I understand the uncertainty it does cause for them, but they can be assured that we will always be working to make sure they get everything that they need.”
The German MEP Bernd Lange, the chair of the international trade committee at the European parliament, suggested a planned vote next week on the US deal agreed last summer would now be postponed.
The deal has been implemented in the US but not yet in the EU, where it needs parliamentary approval.
Writing on X on Sunday, Lange said: “Pure tariff chaos from the US administration. No one can make sense of it any more – only open questions and growing uncertainty for the EU and other US trading partners.”
William Bain, the head of trade policy at the British Chambers of Commerce, said he expected the UK to use the latest twist to secure a better long-term deal.
He said the Economic Prosperity Deal (EPD) struck bewteen the UK and the US in May was “never really about the 10% tariff but the carve-outs”, such as retention of the existing 0% tariff on the UK pharma industry, a promise of a reduction in the 25% steel tariffs that has yet to materialise, and a 10% tariff on cars – lower than for some other countries.
“What the EPD deal did was create a framework for negotiations on other sectors such as auto and steel and aluminium,” Bain said.
“The government sees value in keeping the deal, and this will give them the perfect opportunity to try to nail the EPD down with legal text. My sense is their strategy will be double down on the EPD.”
David Henig, the director of the UK Trade Policy Project at the European Centre for International Political Economy, said: “The nature of dealing with this US administration is no deal can be expected to last, so all governments will be working out what to do next, or what the deal actually is.”
Under the 1974 Trade Act, the new 15% tariff can be applied for only 150 days, meaning Trump will need congressional approval to extend it beyond 23 August.
Bain asked: “What if Congress doesn’t approve? Could Trump turn around and say: ‘I’m now going to impose 14% tariffs for the next 150 days’?
“What is different now is that Congress is a player, which it wasn’t before, so a whole new route for lobbying by business opens up.”

Man, 21, identified after being shot dead during attempted break-in at Trump’s Mar-a-Lago with ‘shotgun and fuel can’
Police identified 21-year-old Austin Tucker Martin as the suspect who was shot dead by Secret Service agents at Trump’s Florida residence

The Secret Service has shot and killed a man who attempted to break into President Donald Trump’s Mar-a-Lago home, the agency announced Sunday morning.
Trump and the first lady, Melania Trump, were not at the Florida residence at the time of the shooting.
The couple was in Washington, D.C., on Saturday night for a dinner with state governors, but the president often spends the weekend at the residence, where he golfs on Sundays.
Around 1:30 a.m. Sunday, the suspect, who was carrying a shotgun and a gas canister, was shot by law enforcement after entering a “secure perimeter” at the residence, the Secret Service said in a statement.
Palm Beach County Sheriff Ric Bradshaw later identified the suspect as 21-year-old Austin Tucker Martin, according to the Associated Press and The Washington Post.
Martin, of Cameron, North Carolina, was reported missing from his home Saturday by his family, Secret Service spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said.
At a Sunday morning press conference, Bradshaw said two Secret Service agents and a deputy confronted the suspect and told him to drop the gas can and his shotgun.
The intruder then “raised the shotgun to a shooting position,” said Bradshaw.
“The only words we said to him was ‘drop the items,’” Bradshaw told reporters. “He put the gas can down and pointed the shotgun at the officers.”
He held up a grainy photo of the suspect carrying a shotgun.
Law enforcement officers were not injured in the incident.
The FBI is leading the investigation, Bradshaw added.
Trump is yet to comment publicly on the shooting but White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt praised the Secret Service for acting “quickly and decisively” — and used the opportunity to blame Democrats because of the partial government shutdown.
Attorney General Pam Bondi said she has spoken with Trump and is working with federal partners on the investigation.
“Grateful that @potus and our law enforcement agents are safe,” Bondi added in a post on X.
FBI director Kash Patel said the bureau was dedicating “all necessary resources” into the investigation in a brief statement on social media.
“FBI is dedicating all necessary resources in the investigation of this morning’s incident at President Trump’s Mar-A-Lago - where an armed individual was shot and killed after unlawfully entering the perimeter,” Patel said in a post on X. “We will continue working closely with @SecretService as well our state and federal partners and will provide updates as we are able.”
Trump has faced threats to his life before, including an assassination attempt during a campaign rally in Butler, Pennsylvania on July 13, 2024.
And on September 15, 2024, a man with a rifle was captured after waiting near Trump's golf course in West Palm Beach while the president played a round. He was sentenced to life in prison earlier this month.

No threats to Hungary's energy security but "countermeasures" against Ukraine planned, Orbán says

No threats to Hungary's energy security but "countermeasures" against Ukraine planned, Orbán says
Hungary's Prime Minister Viktor Orbán has said there are no threats to his country's energy security due to a halt in oil supplies through the Druzhba oil pipeline but he has announced three "countermeasures" against Ukraine.
Source: Viktor Orbán, as reported by European Pravda
Details: Orbán said he convened the National Energy Security Council due to alleged "blackmail from Ukraine".
He claimed that Kyiv's actions regarding the Druzhba oil pipeline have created risks for the country's energy supply.
"We have eliminated this danger, made appropriate decisions, so today there is no threat to the security of supply in Hungary. Uninterrupted, normal functioning of the country is ensured," Orbán said.
Despite this he said that the government will take three "countermeasures" against Ukraine. Hungary will not resume exports of diesel fuel to Ukraine until it receives oil through Ukrainian territory. Budapest is officially refusing to approve the allocation of a military loan to Ukraine that was previously agreed in Brussels. Hungary will also block the 20th package of EU sanctions against Russia.
Orbán stressed that Budapest will act "carefully" on issues of energy supply on which Ukraine depends on Hungary because ethnic Hungarians live on the other side of the border.
"If oil transportation is restored then normal relations will be restored," Orbán said.
Background: The Ukrainian Foreign Ministry stated that Ukraine rejects and condemns ultimatums and blackmail from the leadership of the governments of Hungary and Slovakia over the operation of the Druzhba oil pipeline.

Man killed after entering perimeter of Trump’s Mar-a-Lago resort
The incident in Florida took place on Sunday when US President Donald Trump was in Washington, DC.
The United States Secret Service says law enforcement agents have shot and killed a man who attempted to break into a secure perimeter at President Donald Trump’s Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida.
The man, in his 20s, appeared to be armed with a shotgun and fuel can, according to the Secret Service’s communications chief Anthony Guglielmi. He was shot at about 1:30am Sunday morning (06:30 GMT).

Trump was in Washington, DC, not Mar-a-Lago, when the incident took place. No other individuals under Secret Service protection were present, said the agency.
Guglielmi said Secret Service agents and a deputy from the Palm Beach County Sheriff’s Office confronted the armed individual, whose identity has not yet been disclosed, after he approached Mar-a-Lago’s north gate.
The individual was pronounced dead after being shot by law enforcement officials.
In comments cited by the Associated Press news agency, Guglielmi said the suspect is from North Carolina and was reported missing a few days ago by his family. He added that investigators believe he left the state heading south, picking up a shotgun along the way.
“The incident, including the individual’s background, actions, potential motive and the use of force, is under investigation by the FBI, the US Secret Service and the Palm Beach County Sheriff’s Office,” said Guglielmi.
Ric Bradshaw, the sheriff of Palm Beach County, said the alleged intruder raised his shotgun after officers confronted him.
“At that point in time, the deputy and the two secret service agents fired their weapons and neutralised the threat. He is deceased at the scene,” Bradshaw told reporters.
“The investigation continues. The FBI is the lead investigating agency on this case, and we will be assisting them in whatever manner they would like.”
Trump has faced several assassination plots or attempts in recent years.
Earlier this month, Ryan Routh, 59, who plotted to assassinate the president at a Florida golf course in September 2024, was sentenced to life in prison.
Routh’s planned attack on Trump came two months after 20-year-old Matthew Crooks fired several shots, one grazing Trump’s ear, during a campaign rally in Butler, Pennsylvania.
That attack, in which a rally-goer was killed, proved to be a turning point in Trump’s return to power.

An armed man was shot and killed Sunday after entering the secure perimeter of Mar-a-Lago, President Donald Trump’s resort in Palm Beach, Florida, the U.S. Secret Service said.
The agency said the individual was observed near the north gate of the property early Sunday morning in the United States carrying what appeared to be a shotgun and a fuel can. He was shot by Secret Service agents and a deputy from the Palm Beach County Sheriff’s Office after they confronted him. His name has not been released, and the incident remains under investigation.
Trump, who often spends weekends at the resort, was at the White House at the time of the shooting. First lady Melania Trump was also at the White House on Saturday night. The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
The Secret Service statement said the incident, including the background of the victim, his motive and the force used against him, is currently under investigation by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), the Secret Service and the Palm Beach County Sheriff's Office. It said that in accordance with consistent Secret Service policy, its agents involved in the incident have been placed on leave pending the outcome of the investigation.
The incident comes against the backdrop of at least two assassination attempts that Trump survived after returning to the political spotlight. The first occurred on July 13, 2024, during a campaign rally in Butler, Pennsylvania. The gunman, Thomas Matthew Crooks, opened fire from a nearby rooftop, wounding Trump in his right ear and killing one rally attendee.
The second attempt took place about two months later, on September 15, 2024, at Trump International Golf Club in West Palm Beach. In that case, a Secret Service agent spotted the barrel of a rifle protruding from bushes several hundred meters away from Trump. The suspect, Ryan Routh, fled the scene but was apprehended shortly afterward. Two weeks ago, he was sentenced to life in prison.

In a statement, the ministry said it had delivered a formal note of protest condemning what it described as violations of Afghanistan’s airspace and the bombing of “civilian areas” in Nangarhar and Paktika provinces, Afghan Amu satellite TV channel EN website reported.
The ministry called the strikes “a clear violation of Afghanistan’s territorial integrity” and a “provocative act,” warning that the consequences of such actions would rest with Pakistan.
The ministry said protecting Afghanistan’s sovereignty was its “religious duty,” and accused Pakistan’s military of targeting civilians.
Taliban officials have claimed that at least 20 civilians were killed in the Behsud district of Nangarhar. Pakistani officials, however, have claimed the strikes targeted seven hideouts belonging to Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) and the Daesh’s Khorasan branch.
The cross-border strikes come amid growing friction between Islamabad and the Taliban, with Pakistan accusing militant groups of operating from Afghanistan’s territory — a charge the Taliban deny.

Russia losing troops faster than it can recruit, says Ukraine’s Commander-in-Chief
Ukraine’s Commander-in-Chief General Oleksandr Syrskyi said this in an interview with the French newspaper Le Monde, according to Ukrinform.
“Despite the fact that in 2025 Russia managed to mobilize and conscript 406,000 people, its total losses killed and wounded amounted to approximately 418,000 soldiers,” Syrskyi said, meaning that Russian army losses exceeded its recruitment levels.
According to him, these figures should be viewed with regard to the fact that in the same year “Russian offensive forces were increased to 713,000 servicemen.”
The general noted that Ukrainian forces are currently taking between 1,000 and 1,100 Russian soldiers out of combat – killed or wounded – every day.
He also stressed that he does not comment on the course of diplomatic negotiations, but is concerned that “Ukraine must not be forced to give up its territories.”
“Until the negotiations are concluded, my task is to ensure that, regardless of what happens, our actions on the battlefield prevent the enemy from advancing deeper into our defenses and allow us to liberate our territory where possible. This is precisely what will ensure fair negotiations leading to a just peace,” the general emphasized.
As Ukrinform previously reported, Syrskyi has said that the rising losses of Russian troops in the war against Ukraine are among the results of the introduction of a corps-based reform.

On 5th day of Ramadan, dozens of Israeli illegal settlers storm Al-Aqsa Mosque

Dozens of illegal Israeli settlers stormed the Al-Aqsa Mosque in occupied East Jerusalem on the fifth day of the Muslim fasting month of Ramadan on Sunday, Palestinian media reported.
Illegal settlers entered the flashpoint site and performed Talmudic and provocative rituals in the mosque courtyards under the protection of Israeli police, the official news agency Wafa said.
The agency said the settler incursion was part of a series of repeated Israeli measures “to make demographic changes at the mosque and East Jerusalem,” Wafa said.
Palestinian residents of occupied East Jerusalem are frequently subjected to harassment during settler raids, including physical assaults on worshippers and restrictions on access to the mosque.
Ramadan began on Wednesday in several Arab and Muslim countries, including Palestine.
‘Security measures’
Each year during Ramadan, Israel imposes heightened security measures in occupied East Jerusalem and its surroundings, imposing tight restrictions on Palestinian access to Al-Aqsa.
Israeli police first permitted settler incursions into the mosque compound in 2003, despite repeated calls from the Islamic Waqf Department in Jerusalem to halt them.
Al-Aqsa Mosque is the world's third-holiest site for Muslims. Jews call the area Temple Mount, claiming it was the site of two Jewish temples in ancient times.
Palestinians view occupied East Jerusalem, where Al-Aqsa is located, as the capital of their future state, while Israel considers Jerusalem, including both its eastern and western sectors, its capital.

Secret Service shoots man dead at Trump's Mar-a-Lago
Published February 22, 2026last updated February 22, 2026The United States Secret Service said Sunday that agents shot and killed an armed man after he breached a secure perimeter at President Donald Trump's Mar-a-Lago resort in Palm Beach, Florida.
"An armed man was shot & killed by US Secret Service agents & @PBCountySheriff after unlawfully entering the secure perimeter at Mar-a-Lago early this morning," agency spokesman Anthony Guglielmi wrote on social media.
Trump and first lady Melania Trump were at the White House in Washington, DC, during the incident.
Man made his way to inner perimeter of Mar-a-Lago
The security detail at the estate noticed the intrusion at 1:30 a.m. (0530 GMT/UTC) on Sunday, Sheriff Ric Bradshaw of Palm Beach County said.
A sheriff's deputy and two Secret Service agents confronted "a white male that was carrying a gas can and a shotgun," Bradshaw said.
"He was ordered to drop those two pieces of equipment that he had with him at which time he put down th gas can, raised the shot gun to a shooting position. At that point in time the deputy and the two secret service agents fired their weapons and neutralised the threat," he said.
Investigators said the man, in his early 20s from North Carolina, had been reported missing by his family days earlier and is believed to have traveled south, picking up a shotgun along the way. The gun's box was found in his vehicle, Guglielmi from the Secret Service said.
He added that the man drove through the north gate of Mar-a-Lago as another vehicle was exiting.
White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said the Secret Service "acted quickly and decisively to neutralize a crazy person, armed with a gun and a gas canister, who intruded President Trump's home."
Leavitt went on to Democrats for an ongoing partial government shutdown affecting the Department of Homeland Security, which includes the Secret Service.
"It's shameful and reckless that Democrats have chosen to shut down their Department," she wrote on X.
Democrats have opposed new funding for DHS until it makes changes to its mass deportation program, which has been the target of protests following federal agents shooting of two US citizens in the state of Minnesota.
The FBI is the lead agency investigating the incident, working alongside the Secret Service and the Palm Beach Sheriff’s Office.
FBI Director Kash Patel said the agency is "dedicating all necessary resources" to the investigation.
Trump has been a target before
The United States has been rocked by a series of political violence incidents in the last couple of years.
Conservative activist Charlie Kirk was shot and killed in September last year as he spoke with students during an event at Utah Valley University. A suspect was arrested and is facing charges including aggravated murder.
In June last year, a masked shooter killed Minnesota lawmaker Melissa Hortman, a Democrat, and her husband at their home. Another elected Democratic official and his wife were also targeted and seriously injured.
In April, Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro, touted last year as a potential Democratic presidential hopeful, had his home set alight in what authorities described as an alleged assassination attempt.
Trump survived an assassination attempt at a July 2024 campaign rally in Pennsylvania, suffering only a minor ear injury.
Later that year, a man armed with a rifle was arrested near Trump's West Palm Beach golf course and was sentenced to life in prison earlier this month.

A 21-year-old man armed with a shotgun and carrying a gasoline canister was shot and killed Sunday by US Secret Service agents after he allegedly attempted to break into Mar-a-Lago, the Florida estate of US President Donald Trump.
According to an official statement, the suspect approached the perimeter of the Palm Beach property while carrying the weapon and the fuel container on his person. Agents assigned to protect the president opened fire, and the man was pronounced dead a short time later.
Authorities said the suspect's identity is known to law enforcement, but has not yet been released pending notification of his family.
The Federal Bureau of Investigation is investigating the circumstances surrounding the incident, including the young man's motives.
Officials stressed that no line of inquiry has been ruled out, and that there is no confirmation whether the incident constituted an attempted assassination at this stage.

France to summon US ambassador over comments on far-right activist’s death
Top French diplomat says his government rejects any attempt to use Quentin Deranque’s death ‘for political purposes’.
French Foreign Minister Jean-Noel Barrot says US Ambassador Charles Kushner will be summoned over the US embassy’s recent comments on the killing of a far-right French activist this month in the southeastern city of Lyon.
“We are going to summon the United States ambassador to France since the US embassy in France commented on this tragedy, … which concerns the national community,” Barrot told the French newspaper Le Monde and public broadcasters France Inter and France Info on Sunday.

“We reject any attempt to use this tragedy … for political purposes,” he added.
The Ministry for Europe and Foreign Affairs did not say when Kushner, the father of Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner, would be summoned.
The killing of Quentin Deranque, 23, has highlighted a climate of political tensions before next year’s presidential election.
President Emmanuel Macron, who is not eligible to run due to term limits, called for calm on Saturday as about 3,000 people joined a march in Lyon organised by far-right groups to pay tribute to Deranque.
Deranque died from head injuries when he was beaten on the sidelines of a February 12 demonstration against an appearance by a politician from the left-wing France Unbowed (LFI) party in Lyon.
US comments
His killing has provoked international reactions with US President Donald Trump’s right-wing administration on Friday denouncing what it called “terrorism” in France.
On Friday, Sarah Rogers, the US Department of State’s undersecretary for public diplomacy, said Deranque’s killing showed “why we treat political violence – terrorism – so harshly”.
“Once you decide to kill people for their opinions instead of persuade them, you’ve opted out of civilization,” she wrote on X.
The State Department’s bureau of counterterrorism separately posted: “Violent radical leftism is on the rise and its role in Quentin Deranque’s death demonstrates the threat it poses to public safety”, a post shared in French by the US embassy account.
Feud with Italy
Deranque’s killing has also caused a diplomatic feud between France and Italy, whose right-wing prime minister, Giorgia Meloni, has warm ties with Trump.
She called the killing of Deranque “a wound for all of Europe”, prompting Macron to criticise her for speaking out on French domestic affairs.
Six men suspected of involvement in the fatal assault have been charged over the killing while a parliamentary assistant to a far-left MP has also been charged with complicity.

Man, 21, identified after being shot dead during attempted break-in at Trump’s Mar-a-Lago with ‘shotgun and fuel can’
Police identified 21-year-old Austin Tucker Martin as the suspect who was shot dead by Secret Service agents at Trump’s Florida residence

The Secret Service has shot and killed a man who attempted to break into President Donald Trump’s Mar-a-Lago home, the agency announced Sunday morning.
Trump and the first lady, Melania Trump, were not at the Florida residence at the time of the shooting.
The couple was in Washington, D.C., on Saturday night for a dinner with state governors, but the president often spends the weekend at the residence, where he golfs on Sundays.
Around 1:30 a.m. Sunday, the suspect, who was carrying a shotgun and a gas canister, was shot by law enforcement after entering a “secure perimeter” at the residence, the Secret Service said in a statement.
Palm Beach County Sheriff Ric Bradshaw later identified the suspect as 21-year-old Austin Tucker Martin, according to the Associated Press and The Washington Post.
Martin, of Cameron, North Carolina, was reported missing from his home Saturday by his family, Secret Service spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said.
At a Sunday morning press conference, Bradshaw said two Secret Service agents and a deputy confronted the suspect and told him to drop the gas can and his shotgun.
The intruder then “raised the shotgun to a shooting position,” said Bradshaw.
“The only words we said to him was ‘drop the items,’” Bradshaw told reporters. “He put the gas can down and pointed the shotgun at the officers.”
He held up a grainy photo of the suspect carrying a shotgun.
Law enforcement officers were not injured in the incident.
The FBI is leading the investigation, Bradshaw added.
Trump is yet to comment publicly on the shooting but White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt praised the Secret Service for acting “quickly and decisively” — and used the opportunity to blame Democrats because of the partial government shutdown.
Attorney General Pam Bondi said she has spoken with Trump and is working with federal partners on the investigation.
“Grateful that @potus and our law enforcement agents are safe,” Bondi added in a post on X.
FBI director Kash Patel said the bureau was dedicating “all necessary resources” into the investigation in a brief statement on social media.
“FBI is dedicating all necessary resources in the investigation of this morning’s incident at President Trump’s Mar-A-Lago - where an armed individual was shot and killed after unlawfully entering the perimeter,” Patel said in a post on X. “We will continue working closely with @SecretService as well our state and federal partners and will provide updates as we are able.”
Trump has faced threats to his life before, including an assassination attempt during a campaign rally in Butler, Pennsylvania on July 13, 2024.
And on September 15, 2024, a man with a rifle was captured after waiting near Trump's golf course in West Palm Beach while the president played a round. He was sentenced to life in prison earlier this month.

Europe Steps In as Russia Falters: What This Week Revealed About the War
From Europe’s unprecedented financial and military commitments to Ukraine, to Russia’s fading missile campaign and growing problems on the front lines.
From Europe’s unprecedented financial and military commitments to Ukraine, to Russia’s fading missile campaign and growing problems on the front lines.
On February 16, Kyiv Post military correspondent Stefan Korshak published a powerful analysis of the week’s key developments in Russia’s war against Ukraine.
This video breaks down his assessment step by step — from Europe’s unprecedented financial and military commitments to Ukraine, to Russia’s fading missile campaign and growing problems on the front lines.
Follow our coverage of the war on the @Kyivpost_official.
Korshak also highlights new cracks in Russian frontline logistics and communications, including disruptions linked to Starlink access and growing coordination failures.
His conclusion:
Europe now stands firmly in Ukraine’s corner. Russia’s tactical advantage is eroding. And the balance of material power is shifting toward Kyiv and Brussels, not Moscow.
In this video, we explore:
– Why Europe’s financial move changes the war’s trajectory
– What the Ramstein pledges really mean
– How Ukraine’s air defense is holding up
– Why Russia’s missile campaign is losing impact
– What communication breakdowns reveal about Russian weaknesses

‘A huge coup’: Aussie billionaire’s high-tech art collection coming to Queensland
The idea of “Chinese art” might call to mind Ming vases, calligraphy and possibly Maoist social realist paintings of heroic workers.
You are probably not thinking of robot chairs with clapping hands, hanging Gothic cathedrals made of leather, or an eight-metre-long cruise ship beached on the gallery floor.
These are just some of the spectacular works that will be on show for free at the HOTA (Home of the Arts) Gallery on the Gold Coast from April in This Moment, an exhibition of highlights from the White Rabbit Collection of Chinese Contemporary Art in Sydney.
Announced during a week when a platoon of dancing robots startled the world with a martial arts demonstration on Chinese TV, This Moment will offer a glimpse into the technological and manufacturing might that has helped elevate Chinese artists on the world stage.
The White Rabbit Collection is owned by Australian philanthropist Dr Judith Neilson AM, whose charitable foundation aids public health in Africa as well as justice for women, girls and First Nations people in Australia.
Neilson, whose wealth is estimated at $1.23 billion, has displayed her collection to Sydney art fans at her purpose-built White Rabbit Gallery since 2009.
“For more than 25 years I have been travelling to China where I believe the most interesting art in the world is produced,” Neilson said in a statement.
“The amazing country is so vast, diverse, and hugely populated. It inspires so many artists and fuels such competition – resulting in the best to the worst and everything in between.”
HOTA Gallery curator Julie McLaren said the exhibition was “a huge coup” for the regional gallery and that works in the show would “smash preconceived ideas” about Chinese art.
“Artists working in China are referencing ancient traditions, but melding with new mediums to explore what it means to live in China today,” she said.
On entering the exhibition visitors would be confronted by an enormous work titled Deluge: Noah’s Ark by Peng Hung Chih, made from nearly 6000 pieces of 3D-printed plastic to form the twisted carcass of a half-cruise ship, half-whale.
“That’s the work that we really wanted to show on the Gold Coast because it speaks to global concerns about climate and weather patterns,” McLaren said, adding that she had experienced her first cyclone, Alfred, on the Gold Coast last year.
Another work, Chorus by Liu Chang, involves 12 chairs equipped with hands that eerily come to life and give a round of applause to visitors when they stand on a podium.
“A lot of artists are working with AI and computer technology, but also speaking about the concerns around these technologies and how they’re part of our lives,” McLaren said.
The show is far from a piece of “official” Chinese culture. Artists in China risk persecution, with arguably the nation’s top artist (now in exile), Ai Weiwei, repeatedly arrested and detained by authorities.
“Chinese artists are extremely brave. A lot of them don’t care whether they get put in jail,” Neilson recently told the Australian Financial Review.
McLaren said some works in This Moment take a critical look at power structures of the PRC as well as exploring universal issues.
“There are moments of beauty and delight, and of humour. Humour is especially important in the times we’re living in now, and really important in art.”
This Moment: Highlights from the White Rabbit Collection of Chinese Contemporary Art runs April 18 to October 11 at HOTA Gallery, Surfers Paradise, and admission is free.

Larijani takes over Iran's preparations for war, says report

There has been key changes to Iran's management and defence structure in the wake of a possible war with the United States, according to an article by the New York Times.
As the possibility of military conflict with the US grew, Iranian leader Ali Khamenei has delegated the mission of ensuring the survival of the political structure and managing war conditions to Ali Larijani, the secretary of the Supreme National Security Council, according to The New York Times.
“Since early January and in the wake of internal protests and threats from the United States, Ali Larijani, a 67-year-old politician and former commander of the IRGC, has virtually taken over the direction of key affairs of the country,” said the newspaper, citing statements by six knowledgeable Iranian officials and a number of members of the Revolutionary Guard Corps.
The report said Mr. Larijani's rise has led to the evident marginalization of Iran's president, Masoud Pezharkian, who continues to emphasize his professional identity as a physician and refuses to accept responsibility for solving macro-crises. Quoting Iran's domestic media, the New York Times wrote: “The medics have even resorted to Larijani for issues such as unfiltering, which marks the superior hand of the secretary of the Supreme National Security Council in the current structure.”
The newspaper went on to address the security aspects of issuing the new guidelines in Tehran, adding: “Iran's leader has instructed Ali Larijani and a circle of military-political loyalists to determine the various layers of succession for all key positions. These measures have been taken to ensure that the system does not collapse in the event of an assassination or interruption of communications in wartime.”
“The leadership has full confidence in Larijani and considers him a sensitive and critical man of this time because of his political record and rich intelligence,” the American newspaper wrote, quoting Nasser Imani, an analyst close to the principled spectrum.
Another part of the report is devoted to Iran's field preparations. The New York Times claimed: “Based on the assumption that American military strikes are imminent, Iran has deployed its ballistic missile launchers on the western borders (close to Israel) and the southern shores of the Persian Gulf (within range of American bases), and all armed forces are on the highest level of readiness.”
At the end of the report, the newspaper quoted Ali Vaez, director of the Iran division at the International Crisis Group, as noting that despite all the succession and crisis management plans, the role of the person leader remains irreplaceable as “the main driving force and blocking force of the system” and the system will face unforeseeable challenges without their presence.

‘Beyond worried’: the families waiting to hear how Send reform will change their lives
Unknown

At the age of 12, May Race’s son Joseph spends almost all of his time in his bedroom, too anxious, burnt out and – she says – traumatised even to join his parents and older brother downstairs most days. Joseph no longer leaves the house at all.
He is autistic and has dyslexia and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). His autism is of a type known as pathological demand avoidance, or PDA, which can make the ordinary demands of everyday life feel overwhelming and impossible to cope with. Since he was eight years old, he has rarely been able to go to school. Today, he doesn’t attend at all, and is too unwell even to meet with professionals who may be able to help him.
Joseph is funny and creative and incredibly kind, says his mum, and had been capable of great friendships while he was still able to meet his peers. But somehow, her adored boy is now unable to engage with the world – and the educational and special needs networks that are supposed to support him seem powerless to help.
The Send (special educational needs and disabilities) system in England, says his mother, has failed to help Joseph, who lives near Winchester with his family. In fact, she blames what she describes as its lack of resources, flexibility and understanding for making him more unwell, not less.
It is a system that, everyone agrees, desperately needs reform – from the schools struggling on strangulated resources to support soaring numbers of children with extra needs, to the hard-pressed professionals juggling huge caseloads, and the local education authorities that have built up perilous levels of debt trying to pay for it all. On Monday, the government will announce its plans for a comprehensive overhaul of special education in England that it says will make it quicker and easier to access appropriately supportive school places – though the urgent need to get costs under control is certainly another motivator.
If only Race, and many thousands of other families, felt so confident of improvement. “The system does need reform – because the journey we have been on for years has been absolutely awful,” she says. “And I see it around me all the time, among many, many other families. It is a crisis for these children.” Of course she hopes that the government’s imminent white paper could improve things. “But – and it’s difficult to believe – it could also make things worse.”
More than 1.7 million children in England were classed as having special educational needs in the academic year 2024-25, a vast rainbow that ranges in need and severity from physical disabilities to learning difficulties to neurodivergent diagnoses such as autism and ADHD, and mental health conditions. (Education in the other UK nations is devolved to the Scottish parliament and Welsh and Northern Irish assemblies.)
Though all these children are different, what huge numbers of their battle-scarred parents share are bruising tales of the struggle to secure diagnoses for their children, individual care plans to guarantee services for them, and appropriate school places where they can thrive.
Their anxiety over recent months, as publication of the white paper has approached, has been acute.
Children who already have specialist places and specified support will not lose them under the changes, the education minister Georgia Gould, said last week, telling the Guardian she wants to give mainstream schools the resources to support more children with special needs, meaning fewer of them will need education, health and care plans (EHCPs), which specify the specialist support a child must be provided with by their council.
But with many families relying on these detailed, personalised and (crucially) legally enforceable documents as the only guarantor of support, many fear any move to reduce their number could also strip away their children’s safety nets.
Joseph’s story is far from typical, but elements of his parents’ ordeal will be familiar to many others. He first started struggling with school in his reception year, aged four, developing tics and having severe meltdowns at home – but it was not until almost four years later that he was referred by his school to children’s mental health services. It took 10 months before the family even got confirmation he was on the waiting list.
They had years of traumatic mornings, often physically carrying the distressed little boy into school. By the time he was eight, Joseph was unable to leave the sofa, suffering from what the family now understand as autistic burnout, or a state of severe mental, emotional and physical collapse caused by the long-term stress of trying to navigate a neurotypical environment.
Securing a formal autism diagnosis, an EHCP and a secondary place at a specialist independent school – the only one identified that said it could meet his needs – was gruelling, she says: “I’ve suffered trauma too.” Joseph’s complex needs are such that even that school wasn’t able to meet them, however, and he now has no school place at all.
Even if major reforms are coming, she is worried about how quickly change can be implemented. “It concerns me that the urgency of [the crisis] isn’t being acknowledged. There are so many children who are now in a really bad way because the system has been broken for so long.”
Other parents tell very different stories, but share similar apprehensions about the future. “I think there is an assumption that children like Kyllian will be fine, because he already has a place in special school,” says Becky, a mother from Nuneaton in Warwickshire of her six-year-old son who is blind and has cerebral palsy, epilepsy and learning difficulties. “But actually, he’s not fine, because he’s only legally entitled to that place because of what’s named on his EHCP.”
Though some of her “loving, cheeky, tactile” son’s disabilities were clear from birth, and the family were under the care of many professionals, Becky says some of his needs are now supported only because of her own research – “talking to other people, staying up late at night writing letters, photocopying documents” – her dogged refusal to accept school places that she felt were inappropriate or unsafe, and the advice of agencies such as the disability charity Sense .
An early years classroom was on an upper floor despite Kyllian’s limited mobility, says Becky (who asked not to publish her last name), and even with a one-to-one support worker assigned to him, she felt he was barely integrating with the other students in his mainstream nursery class.
She visited several schools, sometimes touring them in tears because she knew Kyllian couldn’t cope there. Eventually, after what Becky describes as a period of “arguing the toss” with her local authority, Kyllian was offered a place at a specialist school with a dedicated vision support unit, where “for the most part, he’s a really happy little boy”.
Even as the mother of a child with very clear needs, however, Becky says she worries about funding for Send school transport – whose soaring costs have placed intense pressure on council budgets. Because of the risk he could have an epileptic seizure, Kyllian is unable to travel to school by minibus, so his mother receives funding to drive him the 6.5 miles each way.
Will a squeeze on transport funding put his more distant school place at risk? “There’s a lot of fear in the Send parent community,” she says. She feels “up and down all the time, every day, about what the future holds”.
In many ways, Cheryl Garner is very happy with the schooling of her five-year-old daughter, Millie (not her real name), in the East Riding of Yorkshire, where she attends a specialist unit attached to a mainstream primary school. This is a model that ministers have indicated will be rolled out more widely under the new proposals – and for Millie, who has profound and complex special needs including global development delays and non-verbal autism, it has been “absolutely brilliant and amazing”, says her mother.
“She loves school, she loves the teachers. She loves the fact that she gets to paint and play and the environment’s lovely,” even though “I don’t know if it is a long term solution and this will always benefit her.”
But Garner says she is “beyond worried” about what changes to the system could mean. After initially being given a place in a mainstream nursery (in another borough) that was not appropriate to her needs, Millie spent 10 months at home and out of education before her current school place could be found. (All three of the women interviewed for this article have been forced to give up their careers to become full-time parent carers).
Because four local schools said they couldn’t meet her needs, Millie travels 15 miles each way in a taxi every day. When their local authority, eager to keep costs down, changed providers, the new driver lacked training and Millie was unable to use the service, according to her mother, meaning another period stuck at home, out of school.
Though Millie’s autism was identified quite young, some of her other conditions have only become apparent as she has got older, and Garner says she is very concerned by any change that would make services more restricted based on diagnoses – when these can often be very hard to come by.
She believes her daughter has dyspraxia, for instance, which affects motor skills and coordination, and which could help explain Millie’s inability to climb the stairs to their first-floor flat. Garner, a single parent, has to carry her up and down each day, and they are on the council list awaiting rehousing.
Garner has been told, however, that there is no way locally for Millie to get a dyspraxia assessment on the NHS, and she can’t access the mobility support she thinks Millie needs without a diagnosis.
“So we are saving up the money to pay for it privately, before we can put her on the waiting list. It’s a bit daunting and I find it really unfair – because she’s five.”
Nobody pretends any of this is easy to solve, least of all for the local authorities who are legally obliged to meet the needs of children with special needs.
A spokesperson for Hampshire council, Joseph’s family’s local authority, said demand for EHCPs had risen by 243% in the borough since 2015. “Coupled with growing complexity in children’s needs, this makes finding available and suitable placements increasingly challenging.
“However, we always endeavour to achieve the very best outcomes for individual families and to ensure that children and young people with Send receive the right support in the right place.”
Victoria Aitken, East Riding of Yorkshire council’s cabinet member for children, families and education, said the council worked with families “to ensure that every child gets the support in the setting they need, no matter where they live or what challenges they face”. But noting that East Riding’s funding is £18m below average for local authorities, she added: “We want to see bold and brave education reforms that will deliver lasting improved change and fairer funding for schools and families.”
As for Joseph, his mother remains hopeful that, given time and patience, he can live a fuller life, even if mainstream schooling is unlikely to be part of his future. She asked her local authority for funding for an out of school education package but says what the council offered would not have worked for Joseph. They have appealed, and have a hearing date in March 2027.
Her son’s story, she says, has brought anger, trauma and grief. “I feel really sad that that our society can’t support neurodivergent children better. Mostly I feel sad that Joseph is still so unwell, and that he’s been made unwell as a consequence of the system being so broken.”

The next Mamdani? Progressive Nithya Raman shakes up LA mayor’s race

Nithya Raman, a progressive urban planner, entered Los Angeles politics with a bang when she was elected to city council in 2020, defeating an incumbent Democrat endorsed by Nancy Pelosi and Hillary Clinton.
More than five years on, the 44-year-old is making waves again with her last-minute entry into the LA mayoral race. Raman filed to run just hours before the deadline – after recently endorsing Mayor Karen Bass for re-election – to the surprise of constituents, and political allies and opponents alike.
The bombshell development came after the race had finally appeared to be swinging in Bass’s favor, following months of criticism over the city’s handling of last year’s wildfires and ever present frustrations about homelessness and housing. Several competitors had recently announced that they would not run, seemingly easing Bass’s path to victory. That also presented an opening for Raman.
It’s rare to have a serious contender join a race so late, the veteran LA journalist Jim Newton noted, but Raman immediately emerged as one of the strongest and well-known candidates. While running for city council, Raman had received endorsements from stars Jane Fonda and Mindy Kaling.
Media outlets have drawn inevitable parallels between her and Zohran Mamdani, another Democratic Socialist. Raman said in a statement to the Guardian that she viewed running for mayor is an “extraordinary opportunity” to make Los Angeles more affordable and “to govern with urgency and accountability”.
Her candidacy has changed the calculus of the race, and fueled fascination with the race and her split with Bass. In a lengthy interview with Raman, the NBC Los Angeles political reporter Conan Nolan suggested that, to Bass, the development was not unlike Brutus’s betrayal of Julius Caesar.
“I don’t think we should talking about the future of LA in the context of friendship or betrayal,” Raman said. “We need to be talking about the issues that are facing us and how we can fix them.”
Now the question is whether she can build a campaign that will resonate with voters, particularly when key portions of the city’s liberal base have already aligned with Bass.
“A lot of folks on the left are taken aback by her candidacy because it was so sudden [and] because at the present moment with the current chessboard, it threatens the traditional progressive coalition in Los Angeles,” said Mike Bonin, who spent nearly a decade on the Los Angeles city council.
‘Voters are angry’
Progressive politicians and policies swept Los Angeles and other major cities in 2020. That year Los Angeles elected a new district attorney (though he would later lose his campaign for re-election).
Raman’s victory over David Ryu, a well-funded incumbent, stood out. Raman, a director of Time’s Up, an anti-sexual harassment organization founded amid the #MeToo movement in Hollywood, had received an endorsement from Bernie Sanders and centered her campaign around housing and homelessness.
Her team included more than 2,000 volunteers who knocked on 80,000 doors across a sprawling district that stretches from Silver Lake to the suburbs of the San Fernando Valley in what she described in an interview with the Guardian as a record number of door-knocks. The win drew comparisons to Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez.
“She ran in 2020 as a total outsider with no establishment backing and defeated an incumbent for the first time in a couple [of] decades,” said Bonin, who is now the executive director of the Pat Brown Institute for Public Affairs (PBI) at Cal State Los Angeles.
Raman won by mobilizing new voters and received more votes than any council candidate in history, he added.
While in office, she has continued her focus on housing issues, and serves as the chair of the council’s housing and homelessness committee. Some of her positions have shifted during her time in office, but despite moderating in some areas and frustrating the left, voters still view Raman as a progressive, Bonin said.
Fernando Guerra, a professor at Loyola Marymount University and the director of the Center for the Study of Los Angeles, said that Raman has appeal among key political factions including liberal establishment Democrats, DSA members and moderate business Democrats.
The mayoral race comes during a challenging chapter for the city.
Last year, unprecedented wildfires sparked in the hillsides of Altadena and the Pacific Palisades, and tore through communities, killing 31 people, destroying more than 16,000 structures and displacing tens of thousands of people.
Bass and other LA leaders faced intense criticism for the response and handling of the fire in the Palisades, which falls under the city’s jurisdiction. Scrutiny has intensified in recent months, after the Los Angeles Times revealed that a controversial after-action report evaluating the department’s response to the wildfires was edited to understate the shortcomings of agency leadership and the city.
Sources told the newspaper that Bass, concerned about the city facing legal liabilities, was behind the significant changes to that report. The mayor denied those allegations, describing the Times’ reporting as “dangerous and irresponsible” and relying on “third-hand unsourced information to make unsubstantiated character attacks”.
Last summer, the city saw widespread ICE raids that brought life in many immigrant neighborhoods to a standstill, and Trump ordered the deployment of the national guard to the city, against the wishes of Bass and the California governor.
In recent mayoral cycles, re-election for the incumbent has been almost a foregone conclusion, said Guerra. But in past times of crisis – such as the 1994 Northridge earthquake or the 1965 uprising in Watts - the challenge for the political establishment is how they manage that, he said.
While Bass had received praise for her handling of the raids, frustrations have continued to mount in the city.
“In the weeks leading up to the filing deadline, there was a palpable sense that voters were in what I describe as a ‘hangry’ mood,” Bonin said. “They’re angry over a lot of things. They’re angry over the response to the fire, the quality of city services.
“I think there was a lot of hunger for a real contest in the mayor’s race.”
From ally to challenger
While more than 40 people have thrown their hat in the ring for the city’s top office, a group of leading contenders has begun to emerge: Bass; Rae Huang, a community organizer, DSA member and housing advocate; Adam Miller, a tech leader and nonprofit founder; Spencer Pratt, a Republican reality TV star turned advocate for Palisades fire victims; and Raman.
But high-profile challengers, including Rick Caruso, the billionaire developer Bass faced off against in 2022, have announced they would not run. The evening before the deadline, it appeared Bass would likely win the June primary and avoid a November runoff, even though some polls had suggested significant dissatisfaction with her leadership.
“And then, boom, Saturday morning. It was the political event that was on nobody’s bingo card,” Bonin said of Raman’s late entrance to the race.
That’s largely because Raman and Bass have been allies. She backed the mayor in her first campaign for mayor, and Bass endorsed Raman’s campaign for re-election to city council in 2024. And Raman recently described Bass as the most progressive mayor LA has ever had.
The shift fueled criticism among Bass’s supporters. Yvonne Wheeler, the president of Los Angeles County Federation of Labor, described Raman as an opportunist, according to a Los Angeles Times report.
“With Donald Trump’s ongoing war against the people of Los Angeles, our working families and immigrant communities, now is not the time for distractions from a political opportunist – especially one who backed the mayor’s re-election campaign just weeks ago,” Wheeler said.
Raman has said she admires Bass and supported her re-election, but that she’s felt a “call from Los Angeles … for change across the entire city”, she told NBC Los Angeles political reporter Conan Nolan.
“I feel a sense of frustration and even despondency among Angelenos that something is wrong in the city, that things are worse than they were before. I can feel that every single day when I go out and talk to my constituents,” she said.
In a video announcing her campaign, Raman said the city could no longer manage the basics, and was doing too little to address the housing shortage, and that Los Angeles was at a “breaking point”.
Bass has defended her record as mayor, with her website stating that she stood up against ICE raids and pointing to decreasing street homelessness, the lowest homicide rate in the city in 60 years, and a record fast clean up after the wildfires.
Bonin said it was a mistake for Bass allies to focus on the betrayal angle: “Voters do not give a shit how one politician treats another politician. Voters care how elected officials are treating them.”
While observers might have thought Bass faced a greater risk from a self-financed moderate, the mayor is more vulnerable from the left, Newton said.
“[This] is a liberal city and getting more liberal all the time. That’s why people are taking this seriously,” said Newton, who has chronicled Los Angeles and its politics for decades.
Raman, Newton said, has her work cut out for her running in a citywide election. She needs to raise significant funding, mend fences with allies caught off guard by her decision, and show voters how she went from being a Bass supporter to an opponent.
Bonin agreed, saying Raman needs to build an organization from scratch without the city’s traditional progressive coalition, which has for decades included labor and the Black community.
“Both are squarely in Mayor Bass’s camp,” Bonin said. “[Raman] has definite pathways to victory. She can definitely put together a coalition. But it does raise the pretty big question of what does it mean to be a progressive in Los Angeles?”
Raman’s entry, regardless of the outcome, shows how much LA politics have shifted in recent decades, Newton noted.
“Nithya Raman would not be a serious candidate for mayor in LA 20 years ago, when we still had Republicans on the city council,” Newton said, adding that the city has gotten younger and its immigrant population had grown. “The electorate is bigger, and as it’s gotten bigger it’s become less the provenance of homeowners.”
That might hold the key to a Raman victory, renters and residents who are pro-housing development. “That’s a tough coalition to knit together. I’ve tried,” Bonin said. “But given that the mayor has other parts of a progressive coalition, that might be what Raman tries to assemble.”
Raman is still in the early stages of her campaign with a limited website. But, so far, she has emphasized delivering the basics in the city, expanding housing, and responding to residents’ desire for change.
“The response over the last two weeks has been incredible, with hundreds of volunteers signing up to propel our people-powered campaign,” Raman told the Guardian. “It’s clear that many Angelenos want change. Our campaign is about bringing new leadership to city hall that’s ready to take responsibility, build for the future, and deliver for the people who call this city home.”

The world order we’re leaving behind may be replaced by no order at all | Eduardo Porter

The Canadian prime minister, Mark Carney, inspired a wave of enthusiastic nodding among the cosmopolitan crowd gathered in Davos last month when he took to the podium and proclaimed that the world order underwritten by the United States, which prevailed in the west throughout the postwar era, was over.
The organizing principle that emerged from the ashes of the second world war, that interdependence would promote world peace by knitting nations’ interests together in a drive for common security and prosperity, no longer works. The US blew it up.
Donald Trump came to believe that every other country treated the US as a chump, free riding on its security guarantee and abusing its open market – no matter that the United States set most of the rules underpinning the postwar architecture, and broke them when it suited its interests, or that the rules enabled an era of remarkable American prosperity.
In an act of bravery not often experienced among the jet setters in the Swiss Alps, the Canadian prime minister challenged every other country to accept the loss of American leadership and build an alternative global architecture that might bypass the great powers intent on bending everybody else to their will.
“Great powers have begun using economic integration as weapons, tariffs as leverage, financial infrastructure as coercion, supply chains as vulnerabilities to be exploited,” he said. “You cannot live within the lie of mutual benefit through integration when integration becomes the source of your subordination.”
The analysis is catching like wildfire. A couple of weeks after Carney’s speech, the German chancellor, Friedrich Merz, opened the Munich Security Conference arguing that “the international order based on rights and rules is currently being destroyed”. He warned that the “leadership claim of the US is being challenged, perhaps already lost”.
The report prepared for the gathering in Munich articulated well the general feeling of America’s (erstwhile) friends. “For generations, US allies were not just able to rely on American power but on a broadly shared understanding of the principles underpinning the international order,” it noted. Washington has betrayed that understanding. “As a result, more than 80 years after construction began, the US-led post-1945 international order is now under destruction.”
European leaders seem to have accepted they must face the world alone. “Europe has to learn to become a geopolitical power,” the French president, Emmanuel Macron, said in Munich. Europeans, said the British prime minister, Keir Starmer, “must build our hard power, because that is the currency of the age. We must be able to deter aggression, and yes, if necessary, we must be ready to fight.”
But if the old order is behind us, what comes next? Is it possible to create an alternative order that’s liberal, multilateral, rules-based and resilient enough to withstand pressure from the US and China as they struggle for supremacy?
Carney posited the choice thus: “Compete with each other for favor, or combine to create a third path with impact.”
But things aren’t looking great for a third path. It is likely to prove extraordinarily onerous, if not impossible, to build the institutions needed to support an alternative liberal order based on values, where durable alliances are worth more than ad-hoc deals.
What’s likelier is that foreign policy will become harder in a world of hodgepodge dealmaking, as countries join potentially competing coalitions built around specific goals. Pragmatism, rather than ideological alignment or shared values, will be the main driver of international relations. Alliances will be less solid, more transactional.
And potential American aggression will loom over it all.
A rupture, not a transition
I asked Jorge Castañeda, Mexico’s former foreign minister, for his view on the potential for countries to follow that third path. “What Carney proposes is not viable,” he said. He doesn’t think there are too many countries with the wherewithal to join an endeavor that explicitly decouples from Washington’s preferred trajectory.
But some are trying, by engaging in a variety of uncoordinated efforts to build defenses against this more dangerous world, stalked by a newly aggressive America. New trade pacts and “strategic” agreements of uncertain scope or stability are sprouting up everywhere. Talk of financial decoupling from the dollar abounds, with Brussels and Beijing eager for the world to consider the euro or the yuan as alternatives.
Countries from Canada to south-east Asia, Brazil and South Africa have turned to China as a potential counterbalance to the United States. Korea and China have traded state visits since last fall. A few days before his speech in Davos, Carney was in Beijing. And Starmer visited a couple of weeks later.
Mistrust of Trump’s America is providing incentives for other potential alliances, too. In January the specter of Trump’s tariffs encouraged the European Union and India to sign a free-trade agreement that had been stuck in limbo for 20 years.
But despite the recent activity, even like-minded countries may have a hard time building concrete alliances. Last month, days after the European Union finally signed the trade agreement it reached in 2019 with the four founding members of South America’s trading bloc Mercosur, lawmakers in the European parliament bowed to opposition from the farm lobby, which fears competition from South America’s imposing agricultural industry, and challenged it in court, potentially derailing the deal.
And eager though Canada and other countries may be about the prospect of a world order that sidesteps the United States, losing America means losing a lot.
It’s true that the so-called rules-based western order the United States did so much to build over the last 80 years or so might have been hypocritical. In Latin America and beyond, the American commitment to market liberalism often took a back seat to its imperative to keep the red scare at bay by whatever means necessary. Much of its project was imposed at the point of a gun.
Still, the American-led order did provide a number of valuable public goods. They included a set of rules and dispute settlement mechanisms to undergird a liberal global economy that generated enormous prosperity. The US offered the dollar, a global means of exchange. It provided low-risk, liquid treasury bonds for governments and investors around the world to store their wealth. And it offered a regime of collective security – which helped manage conflict from the Balkans to the South Pacific.
Japan, still one of the world’s largest economies, is probably too dependent on America’s security guarantees to be able to truly annoy Washington. Even the European Union – which by some measures has as big an economy as the United States – may not be able to move out of Washington’s shadow, especially given its dependence on the US to thwart Russia’s ambitions to take Ukraine (and perhaps more).
Nato chief Mark Rutte, who is Dutch, probably didn’t make many friends when he argued that “if anyone thinks here, again, that the European Union, or Europe as a whole, can defend itself without the US, keep on dreaming. You can’t. We can’t. We need each other.”
The fact is that French dreams of strategic autonomy will need military hardware that Europe, today, does not make. As became evident with the recent turmoil over a planned Franco-German fighter jet, developing such hardware will require perhaps an unrealistic amount of political will.
Even Canada may not be able to pull it off. Two-thirds of Canada’s exports go to the United States, down from three-quarters a couple of years ago. It may rely less on American military protection. But its prosperity is tightly linked to the economy next door.
Given what’s at stake, it’s unsurprising that some world leaders still want to cling to the hope that the old order can be restored in some shape or form. Wolfgang Ischinger, the chair of the conference in Munich, said he hoped the event would help build a “constructive transatlantic reset”.
Merz challenged Trump to reconsider the value of the alliances he seems so keen to trash. “In the era of great power rivalry,” he said, “even the United States will not be powerful enough to go it alone.” European Union foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas argued that “the vast majority of countries also want the same thing: stability, growth, and prosperity for their people. The best way to get there is to go together.”
Democrats in the United States are also eager to push the idea that the Trump administration represents just a momentary lapse in American sense. “Donald Trump is temporary – he’ll be gone in three years,” Gavin Newsom, the California governor and potential Democratic 2028 presidential candidate told the Munich gathering. “It’s important for folks to understand the temporary nature of this current administration.” Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, another potential presidential contender, said that Democrats colleagues were “ready for the next chapter” and wanted to deepen relationships with allies.
And yet, Carney is probably right that Trump represents a “rupture not a transition.” The toothpaste can’t be pushed back into the tube. Whatever emerges from this moment will look less like a new order and more like a mess, where power will prevail over cooperation.
A world ripe for the taking
An alternative superpower is not about to enforce an alternative arrangement. China, the other power comparable to the United States, shows little interest in taking the mantle of global hegemony to protect some liberal multilateral order.
The Asian giant played a part in bringing us to this moment. Its wave of exports to the United States contributed to build the sense of grievance that turned American voters against the liberal, globalized order and into Trump’s embrace.
Its persistent mercantilistic tactics, from undervaluing its currency to subsidizing exporting firms even as it closes its market to imports from abroad, make clear it has no interest in making the sacrifices needed to be a global leader. From Europe to Latin America, countries swamped by Chinese exports will have a hard time trusting Beijing to lead.
It is also unclear whether it wants to confront the US at this stage, likely preferring to wait and see what it can salvage from the present global order that has brought it such prosperity. But it is probably not worried about the implosion of the postwar international institutional architecture – built by the western democracies under the aegis of the United States – that it perceives as hostile to its form of government and national interests, from the South Pacific to Taiwan.
In the absence of a leader capable of providing tools with which to build a new international architecture and draw others into some new global understanding, the world risks being pulled apart by many uncoordinated efforts as countries cut ad-hoc deals to gain markets and buy insurance against the riskier global environment. Such deals won’t be based on any sense of shared values and principles, but on narrow calculations of costs and benefits. Alliances will be transactional, fluid, prone to be reassessed and jettisoned at the flip of the coin. This is a world ripe for the taking.
Alexander Stubb, president of Finland, has emerged as a leading thinker about the world’s present quandary, cited approvingly in Carney’s speech as providing inspiration for Canada’s new principled yet pragmatic approach to the world. “We live in a new world of disorder,” Stubb argues, on the level of other historical watersheds – the first and second world wars, and the end of the cold war.
Each of these ushered in a new world order, which lasted for a few decades until the next inflection point. The next five to 10 years, Stubb thinks, will shape the world order over the next 30 to 50.
Stubb would prefer a world order based on values and multilateral rules, perhaps one less hypocritical than the one we are abandoning, but which affirms dialogue and cooperation as the main tool to address global challenges.
Achieving that, Stubb says, will require rebuilding many of the global institutions erected after the second world war – from the United Nations to the IMF, the World Bank and the World Trade Organization – to reduce the dominance of the United States and other western powers, and give more voice to nations from the global south such as Brazil, India and Indonesia.
But that will be hard to build without the United States. Success will depend on whether Washington wants to preserve a multilateral world order in which it would not exercise power as freely as it has over the last 80 years. The odds for that look very long.
Even if were Trump succeeded three years from now by a reasonable human being with some decency and an understanding of the value of win-win international relations, eager to mend the global institutions and the trust he has done so much to destroy, it would be extremely difficult to convince countries which will have spent four years trying to protect themselves from American aggression to simply accept Washington’s word and walk happily back into a US-led global tent.
A more likely outcome, at this stage, seems to be that the multilateral, globalized order we are leaving behind will be replaced by no order at all – a system with no agreed upon guidelines to conduct trade or international finance and no common legal understanding to guarantee rights like states’ sovereignty, let alone things like asylum or human rights.
Perhaps this splits the world into competing spheres of influence, with weaker countries shoehorned, whether voluntarily or less so, into rival blocks, likely revolving around the two great powers, China and the United States. Or maybe we get a free for all in which the mighty wander the world imposing their will on the relatively weak.
It is unclear where the European Union or other rich countries like Japan, South Korea or Australia would fit in this arrangement. They are most likely to try to restore a multilateral architecture – supporting efforts to consolidate a dispute settlement mechanism without the US under the umbrella of the WTO. They will try to maintain trade and financial links to both China and the United States.
Some bigger nations in the global south – like Brazil and India and maybe even Indonesia – may have the heft to maintain their independence, playing off the rival powers against each other, taking what’s best from relationships with either. But many developing nations will have no choice but become some sort of vassal state, with limited policy autonomy.
Brazil may have the heft – and the distance from the United States – to protect its vigorous trade with China, which buys much of its iron ore, beef and soya beans. Others won’t – Mexico just raised tariffs up to 50% on imports from China, a move largely believed to be about placating Trump. Panama’s supreme court just invalidated the longstanding contract with Hong Kong-based CK Hutchison to run ports at either end of the Panama canal.
This new world will be very different from that which emerged from the second world war, when the United States promoted a vision in which economic interdependence would tie countries together in the pursuit of shared prosperity.
The cost-benefit analysis has changed for good. Over coming decades, the search for new opportunities will be met with the fear of new vulnerabilities. This will stunt trade and temper investment, raising costs for businesses and consumers, and limiting entrepreneurs to opportunities close to home. The world will lose economies of scale and forfeit common insurance against risk, forcing each country to seek protection against the many threats the future will bring – economic, environmental, about health or security – largely on its own.
We will come to rue having taken this path. History seems pretty clear that a world of roaming great powers is not particularly safe nor prosperous. For all the flaws and the hypocrisy in the postwar order, rules-based multilateralism and cooperative problem-solving provide a better way for organizing the world’s affairs.
That ship seems to have sailed, though. Whatever institutional architecture emerges from this moment, it will be hard to escape the world lamented by Carney, ascribed to Thucydides, in which “the strong can do what they can, and the weak must suffer what they must”.

My daughter turns 18 today. I’m giving her the gift of shared caring responsibilities with her brothers | Ranjana Srivastava
Unknown

14:00:40 UTC
23:00:40 KST

‘Why do you always grip the dashboard like that when I am driving?’
It’s the bleary-eyed 5am run to rowing practice and I have just relented to the eager ‘Can I drive?’ When your teenager takes a reluctant ‘I guess’ as full-throated approval, you still want to show grace. Especially when there are many more mandated hours of supervision en route to a probationary licence.
Instead of the dashboard, I grip my ribs and sit stiff with attention, mute of tongue.
Just then, a huge truck in the next lane honks unnecessarily but I feel the universe has spoken for me.
When considering how many children to have, I forgot to take stock of how much driving there would be to do and teach. Only up to the middle child, many more nerves remain to be jangled. My eyes are darting everywhere but we spend the time driving peaceably enough, listening to the news.
At our destination, my sweet child says, ‘I really appreciate the time you take’, and permitting myself a chuckle, I respond that one day she’ll be paying me back.
She rolls her eyes, knowledgable from the stories I’ve long brought home from the hospital.
I often think that my geriatric oncology clinic provides a window into the sweep of human conditions. Here, I meet couples in a touchingly long marriage and those who have lost a spouse through estrangement or death. Also, people impaired through cognitive decline, organ failure and that most ubiquitous and insidious of things, loneliness.
We suggest all patients attend their appointment with another adult because there is a lot to take in. I have watched with interest to see who (besides a spouse) shows up with my patients – in my experience, it’s almost always a woman.
They are daughters, daughters-in-law, nieces and granddaughters. Women friends. Women neighbours. Women from church, bingo and bowls. Sometimes, a patient’s health or the weather takes a turn for the worse and we switch to telehealth. Who helps them connect to a video link? See above. Who sits in the corner and takes notes? See above.
Of course, I also meet sons (and the rare son-in-law) in such roles. For five long years, I watched one bring his slowly dementing mother to see me. He would collect her from her facility and return her via a visit to see her great-grandchild. The latter filled her with delight. As she lost her capacity to talk, he matched his pace and advocacy to her needs. When she grew too weak and we said goodbye, I told him I admired his commitment. Countless daughters do the same, but he stands out in my memory.
Anyone who knows will tell you that taking a parent to an appointment isn’t just about the time.
For instance, I want to know about recent medication changes, other specialist appointments and which, if any, aged care services they have gone into yet (a vexed issue).
It’s not uncommon for a son to say, ‘I don’t know, you’ll need to ask my sister.’ A daughter will pull out her diary.
The practical outcome of ‘ask my sister’ is that I get to interrupt her day of respite from care which she is usually spending at work. Then we are both frustrated and she laments that she might as well have come to the appointment.
It’s a common sight to have multiple daughters attend important medical visits or ask to be connected via phone. One asks questions, one takes notes, one provides eyewitness accounts.
‘Dad, remember that fall?’ ‘Mum, let’s be honest about your pain.’ Who wins? The patient.
I am not saying it doesn’t happen but it’s rare to see a band of sons doing this.
Why does this matter?
It matters because even in the modern age, women make up seven out of 10 primary carers. They provide a collective 2.2bn hours of informal care, which adds up $77.9bn each year.
The peak age for a woman to become a carer is 55, a time that also marks the onset of new ‘conditions’: adult children who can’t afford to leave home, ageing parents fighting to remain at home, a resetting of marital expectations and the significant changes of menopause to mention a few.
For my friends and me in this age bracket, every ‘state of the nation’ report starts with whose parents face which ailments and what appointments. Caring for our elders is right but the right thing has a cost: doing the disproportionate share of unpaid care means working less, earning less and worrying more.
As a doctor, I have a front-row seat to the physical, emotional and financial impact on women who find themselves having slipped into the role of carer. We need a rulebook.
I am more conscious of this today because my daughter, who was a (malcontent!) baby just the other day, turns 18 this week.
The gift I would like to give her is the key to an adult life that contains a balance between duty to self and service to others.
But since she is the type that gives without expectation, it feels necessary, though strange, to counsel her to pull back a bit and recognise that the task of caring must be shared by her brothers. Today, this concerns her grandparents. Tomorrow, her parents.
I don’t want my daughter to be the lead planner, helper and carer from birthdays to emergencies.
So, I ask her brothers to do the same housework as she does and invest as much concern and thought into caring for other causes. I hope they will continue to listen until this becomes second nature in their own home lives.
Soon, my daughter will have her driving licence. By the time I am in her passenger seat, I hope society will have reconsidered some more gender stereotypes. I want her to drive me because she is the one who happens to be free, not because it is ‘women’s work.’

Do you have a ‘competence hangover’? | Emma Beddington

Are you bone-deep exhausted and struggling to cope? Do you have “insomnia, headaches, irritability, emotional flatness and a sense of being permanently on?” I mean, obviously you do, you’re a person existing in 2026, but you may also have a “competence hangover”. That’s what Grazia says some women in the workplace are experiencing. They are depleted by accepting additional responsibilities, over delivering, taking on emotional labour, supplying the Colin the Caterpillar birthday cake, and generally being the person to whom everyone complacently says: “What would we do without you?!”
It’s a familiar story in the domestic sphere, where women shoulder disproportionate responsibilities plus a bonus mental load. At work, as multiple surveys and reports have indicated in recent years, they are more likely to burn out (the “competence hangover” sounds like burnout lite). In large part this is due to difficulties reconciling the domestic burden and professional obligations. Other factors also amp up the pressure to over perform professionally: women’s extra hours are rewarded less than men’s, according to a 2024 study; presenteeism means women who work more efficiently (completing their work in fewer hours) are judged negatively for it; and they lack the “status shield” men enjoy, meaning they’re more likely to bear the brunt of negative emotions and perceptions. No wonder McKinsey’s 2025 Women in the Workplace report suggested for the first time that “women are less interested in being promoted than men”.
But while women in particular are suffering from competence hangovers, I think the seduction (and trap) of competence can be universal – because competence is wonderful. Discussing how we fell for our partners with friends recently, I explained that my now-husband swiftly and efficiently acquired, then installed, a telly for me in my sad studio flat, fashioning an aerial from a fork. A’s partner had rigged up a complex, brilliant stereo system for her flat, and H’s now-husband produced an extravagant vodka ice luge for her house party. It’s delightful and relaxing to feel secure in the knowledge that a competent person has your back.
Competence is also a hard habit to break. I don’t speak from experience – I like to think of myself as the “personality hire” half of my relationship, and my professional hangovers are inevitably the product of incompetence (waking up horrified to remember some mistake the previous day). But competence and conscientiousness go hand in hand, so effective people of all genders in the workplace often end up overburdened, and being a safe pair of hands becomes exhaustingly habitual, which is a real problem.
It can stem from rational fears (no one wants to lose their job in this economy, and women face the extra obstacles I’ve described) or a deeper desire to over deliver, please and be perfect. The psychologist Dr Audrey Tang, who contributed to the Grazia article, describes the psychologically unhelpful sensation of being “soothed” by busyness; and in a new French book, Ciao les nazes, (Ciao, losers) on the worst of workplace culture, the writer Séverine Bavon, a former 120%-giving super employee, describes how a voice in her head perpetually pushed her to take on more (she eventually quit, hence the book title).
We need to protect the heroically competent from crashing out – what would we do without them? – so we have to find ways to head off those hangovers: the workplace equivalent of a full-fat Coke, a packet of Hula Hoops and an afternoon of Netflix. Tang suggests these people need a mindset shift – “unlearning the belief that your value is tied to what you produce and how you solve things” – which makes sense, but it’s also, on some level, more work for them.
So perhaps my kind, the incompetent slackers, could help out? For instance, I could teach not offering to take notes. It’s something I’ve been framing as “feminist” for years – women always do the notetaking! – but it’s actually simple laziness and only requires learning how to sit through an awkward silence. Or I could explain to the overly competent how to look pathetically panicky and beg for assistance with a project (or just setting the photocopier to A3): “You’re so brilliant at it! I’ll just mess it up!” Really, though, the best thing we can do for the overstretched and on-the-edge is to step up.

France summons US ambassador over interference

Quentin Deranque, 23, died two days after suffering severe head injuries in a brawl in the city of Lyon on February 12, drawing criticism from the Trump administration which described the death as the result of left-wing violence.
“We are summoning the US ambassador to France because the embassy issued a commentary on this event which concerns the national community. We reject any interference in this event,” Barrot said in an interview with radio station France Inter.
On Friday, the US embassy in France shared an X post from the US State Department’s Counterterrorism Bureau which said reports that Deranque “was killed by left-wing militants, should concern us all.”
“Violent radical leftism is on the rise and its role in Quentin Deranque’s death demonstrates the threat it poses to public safety,” the X post said.
The fatal brawl was caught on video, which showed several masked people kicking and punching a man on the ground, causing widespread shock and anger in France.
Authorities have charged two people with murder in connection with Deranque’s death, and altogether 11 have been arrested.
The incident has also sparked a diplomatic spat between France and Italy, after Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni said Deranque’s death was caused “by groups linked to left-wing extremism” and condemned “a climate of ideological hatred sweeping several nations.”

China’s Type 095 nuclear submarine spotted for first time in new satellite images
Next-generation SSN features advanced acoustic stealth and strike capacity, narrowing tech gap with rival US
China has launched its first next-generation Type 095 nuclear-powered attack submarine (SSN), according to satellite imagery analysed by defence experts.
Images captured between February 9 and 12 showed the vessel being fitted out at the Bohai Shipyard in Huludao, Liaoning province, according to Janes and Naval News.
Defence analysts said the pictures revealed a new design with advanced acoustic stealth and strike capacity.
It also appears to be equipped with a pump-jet propulsor, which is critical for reducing noise signatures. This has already been used on the Type 093B – the latest variant of the Chinese navy’s existing Shang-class submarines.

'Ultra-left,' 'antifa': What do these labels really mean?

The death of far-right activist Quentin Deranque, who succumbed to his injuries on Saturday, February 14, two days after being beaten during clashes between radical groups in Lyon, led broad swathes of the political spectrum in France to point fingers at the "far left," the "ultra-left," or "antifa" groups.
Some of these terms, which have been around for more than two centuries, are now used by both the left and the far right, often with meanings far removed from their historical reality. Le Monde takes a closer look at four descriptors that are regularly used in France's public debate to better understand their history and meaning.
'Far left'
"Far left" has served as an umbrella term, since the 19th century, for political forces that stand to the left of the reformist left and advocate for the overthrow of capitalism. Historian Sylvain Boulouque, a specialist of anarchism and the far left and author of Communisme et syndicalisme dans la France de l'entre-deux-guerres ("Communism and Trade Unionism in France between the World Wars," 2026), said the French Communist Party embodied the far left in France until the 1936 Popular Front alliance, when it joined forces with other left-wing parties.

80% of Spanish apples contain residues of several toxic pesticides at the same time

A study coordinated by PAN Europe across 13 countries has found that 85% of conventionally grown apples tested contained multiple pesticides at the same time. In Spain, the figure stands at 80%. The combined effects of these substances have not yet been officially assessed.
They are among the most widely consumed fruits in Spain and across Europe, and their healthy image has rarely prompted much suspicion. Yet a report published this week by Pesticide Action Network Europe, produced in collaboration with 13 partner organisations across the continent, presents some uncomfortable figures: 80% of apples tested in Spain contained residues of several toxic pesticides at the same time. The European average stands even higher, at 85%.
The figure is based on 59 samples of locally produced apples collected from supermarkets and markets in September 2025. On average, each apple contained three different pesticides, with some samples showing traces of as many as seven. This is far from an isolated issue: in eight of the thirteen countries surveyed — including Germany, Poland, the Netherlands and Croatia — every single sample contained multiple pesticide residues.
At the other end of the scale, Denmark recorded the lowest level of contamination, with just 20% of apples affected, followed by Belgium at 50%. Spain, France and Italy sit in the middle, each at 80%.
Among the substances identified, the study highlights two groups of particular concern. Neurotoxic pesticides were found in 36% of the samples, while PFAS — per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances — appeared in 64% of the apples analysed.
Fludioxonil, classified as an endocrine disruptor by the EU in 2024, was detected in almost 40% of the fruit. The fungicide captan, considered a possible carcinogen, was present in 61% of samples. Acetamiprid, an insecticide designated as neurotoxic by the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) since 2013, was found in around 20% of apples and is known to be capable of crossing the placental barrier.
A two-decade regulatory gap
The problem, the report argues, lies not only in what is found on apples, but in what regulators are failing to measure. European legislation has required the assessment of the combined impact of pesticides — the so-called “cocktail effect” — for more than 20 years. Yet EFSA has still not developed an official methodology to do so.
Existing studies assess each substance in isolation, leaving what the authors describe as a significant blind spot: the combined effect of several chemicals can be “far greater” than the impact of each one individually.
According to the report, 71% of contaminated apples contained substances that the EU itself classifies as “highly toxic” and which, in principle, should have been withdrawn from the market. In some cases, their presence in European food has increased rather than declined in recent years. Apple trees, the authors note, can be treated with pesticides up to 30 times a year.
The findings raise particular concerns for vulnerable groups. If the apples analysed had been marketed as processed baby food, 93% would have failed to meet EU standards, which set a maximum residue limit of 0.01 milligrams per kilogram for children under the age of three.
In some samples, residue levels were up to 600 times higher than this threshold. Pregnant women are also considered at risk, as several of the substances identified may affect foetal neurological development.
What can be done amid EU plans
In response, the Spanish NGO Hogar sin Tóxicos, which contributed to the report, recommends prioritising locally produced organic apples, grown without synthetic pesticides. In Germany, around 15% of apple production is already organic, demonstrating that alternatives to conventional farming are viable.
Politically, however, the outlook is less reassuring. The authors warn that the European Commission is currently considering an omnibus food safety proposal which, in its current form, could weaken protections for both public health and the environment.
Martin Dermine, executive director of PAN Europe, was unequivocal, ""If EU and national regulatory authorities properly implement the law, a series of pesticides detected on apples would have been banned long ago. Like acetamiprid, which is toxic to foetuses' brains or difenoconazole, an endocrine disruptor and neurotoxic. Instead, the EU is proposing to weaken health protection with its Omnibus proposal on food and feed. Our report highlights that a more thorough regulation is needed, not less."

Farage under fire for blocked Chagos Islands ‘stunt’
- Nigel Farage's plan to deliver aid to the Chagos Islands was blocked by UK authorities, who reportedly intervened via the Maldives government.
- The Reform UK leader had travelled to the Maldives to join a delegation aiming to support four Chagossians attempting to establish a permanent base on Ile du Coin.
- Ben Wallace, a former defence secretary, criticised Farage's actions, accusing him of “performing Trump-style stunts” and saying that no MP can visit the military base without pre-clearance.
- Mr Farage said that the British government made every effort to prevent him from reaching British territory, calling his trip a “humanitarian mission”.
- The incident occurs amid criticism of the UK government's deal to hand sovereignty of the British Indian Ocean Territory to Mauritius.

Hundreds gather in New York’s Times Square for Ramadan iftar and prayers
Hundreds of Muslims gathered in New York’s Times Square for iftar and Taraweeh prayers on Friday night, with 1,500 free meals distributed at Broadway and Seventh Avenue.
Organised by Muslim American content creator WayofLifeSQ, the event drew large crowds and included the distribution of 1,200 copies of the Quran in multiple languages.
The YouTuber documented the Ramadan gathering across his social media platforms, where it gained significant traction both online and in person, as well as praise from fellow observers of the Islamic holy month.
Attendees at the iconic New York square were seen taking part in the voluntary night prayers known as Taraweeh following the Isha prayer during Ramadan.
According to WayofLifeSQ, two Americans also converted to Islam during the event, prompting applause and support from those gathered on Friday.
However, the YouTuber also raised concerns about the presence of an alleged non-Muslim heckler who reportedly caused disruption during the Ramadan iftar and Taraweeh event.
Described as an "anti-Muslim troll", WayofLifeSQ and other bystanders attempted to film the unnamed man, who was said to have made Islamophobic remarks, calling Muslims "paedophiles" and accusing them of “not respecting women”.
Many social media users highlighted the event’s emphasis on inclusivity, particularly following the election of New York City’s first Muslim mayor, Zohran Mamdani.
"The Muslim community was out distributing iftar boxes (chicken & rice) to anyone and everyone passing by. NYC really is a melting pot," one user wrote on the social media platform X.
"God forbid they organize a Times Square event once a year to feed people iftar and educate about Islam and Ramadan," another person wrote on X ironically. "Tomorrow and the day after, you’ll have Times Square all to yourself to roam. Let’s cool the hysteria and realize that every organized group holds public events."
New York City had permitted similar public Muslim gatherings in Times Square prior to Mamdani’s mayoralty in 2026.
Previous Ramadan events were held under former mayor Eric Adams, and comparable gatherings have taken place for years in public spaces such as Washington Square Park.
More than half a million practising Muslims in New York City recently marked the start of Ramadan, regarded as the holiest month in the Islamic calendar.

Bill Maher fires back at Trump rant over White House dinner: ‘I’m not that guy’
Bill Maher has responded to Donald Trump's Valentine's Day rant about him following a dinner they shared back in April.
The president railed against the TV host in a Truth Social message, criticising Maher for being “anti-Trump” on his show, despite the two enjoying a “great dinner” together at the White House last year.
Responding during Real Time on Friday (20 February), Maher recalled his confusion about why Trump would assume he would stop criticizing him following the dinner.
"I never stopped criticizing him," Maher said. "I never said I would. I know how women feel now: A guy buys you dinner and expects you to put out. I'm not that guy."

France to summon U.S. ambassador over comments on Quentin Deranque's death

France to summon U.S. Ambassador Charles Kushner over State Department's comments on activist's death
France will summon U.S. Ambassador Charles Kusher to protest comments made by the Trump administration over the death of a far-right activist, the foreign affairs minister said on Sunday.
Jean-Noel Barrot was reacting to a statement by the U.S. State Department's Counterterrorism Bureau, which stated that "reports, corroborated by the French Minister of the Interior, that Quentin Deranque was killed by left-wing militants, should concern us all."
The State Department said in its post on X that "violent radical leftism is on the rise and its role in Quentin Deranque's death demonstrates the threat it poses to public safety. We will continue to monitor the situation and expect to see the perpetrators of violence brought to justice."
Deranque, a far-right activist, died of brain injuries last week from a beating in the French city of Lyon. He was attacked during a fight on the margins of a student meeting where a far-left lawmaker, Rima Hassan, was a keynote speaker.
His killing highlighted a climate of deep political tensions ahead of next year's presidential vote. French President Emmanuel Macron called for calm on Saturday as some 3,000 people joined a march in Lyon organized by far-right groups to pay tribute to Deranque.
"We reject any instrumentalization of this tragedy, which has plunged a French family into mourning, for political ends," Barrot said. "We have no lessons to learn, particularly on the issue of violence, from the international reactionary movement."
Seven people have been handed preliminary charges. The Lyon public prosecutor's office requested that each of them be charged with intentional homicide, aggravated violence and criminal conspiracy. Six of the accused were charged on all three counts. The seventh was charged with complicity in intentional homicide, aggravated violence and criminal conspiracy.
Barrot said he has other topics to discuss with Kushner, including U.S. decisions to impose sanctions on Thierry Breton, a former European Union commissioner responsible for supervising social media rules, and Nicolas Guillou, a French judge at the International Criminal Court.
Barrot said both are targeted by "unjustified and unjustifiable" sanctions.
The Foreign Affairs Ministry did not say when the meeting will take place.
This is the second time Kushner has been summoned by France. In August last year, he was summoned over a letter he sent to Macron alleging the country did not do enough to combat antisemitism.
In a statement obtained by CBS News at that time, France rejected the allegations, saying the "run counter to international law."
"They also fall short of the quality of the transatlantic partnership between France and the United States and of the trust that must prevail between allies," the statement said.
Macron told "Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan" in September that it was out of line for Kushner, who is the father of President Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner, to publicly accuse him of taking insufficient action to combat antisemitism.
Macron said a French ambassador would never be allowed to make similar public remarks about another country because it would risk diplomacy with those nations.
"So either you are a person who wants to express freely," Macron said. "If you are a diplomat, you have to follow the rule of diplomacy. … The [American] taxpayer money is not properly used to finance this kind of statement."
France's foreign officials met with a representative of the U.S. ambassador since the diplomat did not show up to the meeting.

Diana Armstrong, an Ulster Unionist Party Member of the Legislative Assembly (MLA) for Fermanagh and South Tyrone, told the Belfast Telegraph: “Today is a very dark day for families who have been plunged into shock and mourning following last night’s road traffic collision on the Armagh Road, Moy.
“I send my deepest sympathies and sincere condolences to the families and friends of those who died in this horrific collision, who must be totally at a loss to comprehend the scale of this tragedy.
“The toll of the loss of life in this incident has shocked the local community and many will be holding those impacted in their thoughts and prayers today.
“My thanks go to the PSNI and emergency services who attended the scene and transferred those affected for medical treatment.”
Local Sinn Fein MLA Cathal Boylan added: “At this time, my thoughts are with those involved in the accident and their families.
“I am also thinking of the emergency services who attended the scene.”

Dozens of illegal Israeli settlers storm Jerusalem’s Al-Aqsa Mosque on 5th day of Ramadan
Palestinian residents of occupied East Jerusalem are frequently subjected to harassment during settler incursions into Al-Aqsa
RAMALLAH, Palestine
Dozens of illegal Israeli settlers stormed the Al-Aqsa Mosque in occupied East Jerusalem on the fifth day of the Muslim fasting month of Ramadan on Sunday, Palestinian media reported.
Illegal settlers entered the flashpoint site and performed Talmudic and provocative rituals in the mosque courtyards under the protection of Israeli police, the official news agency Wafa said.
The agency said the settler incursion was part of a series of repeated Israeli measures “to make demographic changes at the mosque and East Jerusalem,” Wafa said.
Palestinian residents of occupied East Jerusalem are frequently subjected to harassment during settler raids, including physical assaults on worshippers and restrictions on access to the mosque.
Ramadan began on Wednesday in several Arab and Muslim countries, including Palestine.
Each year during Ramadan, Israel imposes heightened security measures in occupied East Jerusalem and its surroundings, imposing tight restrictions on Palestinian access to Al-Aqsa.
Israeli police first permitted settler incursions into the mosque compound in 2003, despite repeated calls from the Islamic Waqf Department in Jerusalem to halt them.
Al-Aqsa Mosque is the world's third-holiest site for Muslims. Jews call the area Temple Mount, claiming it was the site of two Jewish temples in ancient times.
Palestinians view occupied East Jerusalem, where Al-Aqsa is located, as the capital of their future state, while Israel considers Jerusalem, including both its eastern and western sectors, its capital.

Ex-Belarus Interior Minister linked to network laundering Ukrainian grain – investigation

Ex-Belarus Interior Minister linked to network laundering Ukrainian grain – investigation
This was reported by Ukrinform, citing documents obtained by the Belarusian opposition organization BELPOL and provided to the agency.
“An analysis has identified the operation of a stable commercial and logistics network that ensures the seizure of agricultural products in the occupied territories of Ukraine, their documentary legalization through Russian structures, subsequent processing and change of country of origin in Belarus, and export to foreign markets as formally ‘legal’ goods,” BELPOL official representative Vladimir Zhigar told Ukrinform.
According to him, coordination of key assets and companies leads to a group of individuals affiliated with the former Interior Minister of the Republic of Belarus and ex-head of the Belarusian presidential security service, Vladimir Naumov.
Documents show that one of the key elements at the initial stage of the scheme is a structure created by the occupation authorities — the so-called State Corporation “Agrarian Donbas” (Donetsk), which acts as a centralized operator for the production and sale of agricultural goods from the occupied parts of the Donetsk, Zaporizhzhia, and Kherson regions.
Among the partners of this structure is the Russian company Zorka Food, founded by the joint-stock company Zolotoy Rudnik (Moscow). A ballot from an extraordinary shareholders’ meeting of this company dated November 20, 2021, confirms the involvement of Vladimir Naumov himself as well as his children, Anastasia and Zakhar Naumov.
At the same time, Anastasia and Zakhar Naumov are co-founders of Zvezda Pharmaceutika DD LLC, registered in Minsk, which also appears in the supply chain. Another 50% of this company belongs to Belarusian citizen Oleg Korzhal, who is also the registered owner of Zorka Food LLC in Belarus’s Brest region – a company bearing the same name as the Moscow-based structure.
“The network is controlled by Vladimir Naumov, a former Belarusian Interior Minister who is under international sanctions. Formal ownership of assets is distributed among relatives and trusted associates, management is carried out through nominal directors, and the beneficiary himself avoids direct presence in corporate documents. This model is typical for circumventing sanctions and concealing the ultimate beneficial owner,” a BELPOL representative said.
The documents also detail specific transactions. Both companies – Zorka Food and Zvezda Pharmaceutika DD – signed supply contracts with Agrarian Donbas back in 2022. Cooperation between the two was also recorded. In particular, on February 8, 2023, Zorka Food shipped 20 tons of sunflower seeds from the 2021 harvest to Zvezda Pharmaceutika DD. The packing list directly lists Agrarian Donbas as the producer, and the delivery terms were specified as FCA–“DPR,” Volodarske settlement (occupied Donetsk region).
A separate episode concerns logistics through occupied Mariupol. On August 25, 2023, Zorka Food shipped 1,400 tons of wheat directly from Mariupol seaport. This is confirmed by a declaration of transport characteristics and a certificate issued by the Russian company TsNIIMF. In the documents, the producer is listed as “enterprises of the agro-industrial complex of the Russian Federation.”
In addition, the scheme involves the Chechen company Torgtrade LLC (Grozny). According to research protocols from the Rostov reference center of Russia’s agricultural watchdog, in May 2023 the company submitted sunflower seed samples for analysis from a 1,000-ton batch grown in the Dzhankoi district of temporarily occupied Crimea, with Belarus listed as the destination.
Under a framework agreement dated March 20, 2023, Torgtrade also cooperates with the Belarusian company Trial Expert LLC (Minsk), which later becomes a key element in changing the documented origin of the goods and re-exporting them.
According to BELPOL’s assessment, it is the Belarusian link that ensures the processing or repackaging of raw materials of Russian or occupation origin, followed by their registration as Belarusian products and export to third countries, including states in the Middle East.
“Belarus is effectively being used as a hub for ‘laundering’ the origin of goods. After processing, the foreign-trade commodity code and country of origin are changed, making it possible to export the products as Belarusian,” a BELPOL representative explained.
As Ukrinform previously reported, more than 2 million tons of grain were removed from Ukraine’s temporarily occupied territories last year alone, and overall Russia has already appropriated more than 15 million tons of Ukrainian grain.

The Paris Agriculture Fair opened on Saturday without cows on display for the first time in its history – a major attraction that has drawn large crowds in previous years – due to concerns over a recent outbreak of lumpy skin disease. The government’s handling of the epidemic, which included culling entire herds in affected areas, has been criticised by some French farmers. Anger over the issue was among the drivers of protests in Paris last month. Jean-Luc Demarty, former director-general for trade at the European Commission, said the broader problems plaguing France’s farming sector stem from “15 years of failure” in the country’s agricultural policy.

He emphasized that much has already been accomplished recently in the investigation of this assassination attempt: "We have practically identified all the participants and perpetrators of this crime. You know that a number of individuals involved in this have been detained. One citizen managed to escape and hide in Ukraine."
"We clearly understand that the Ukrainian intelligence services are the masterminds. And behind them are third-party countries, which we discussed earlier, with the Ukrainian intelligence services operating under the supervision or with the supervision of Western intelligence services. We see a British connection here, first and foremost," the FSB chief noted.

Washington's political establishment has been tracking every hint from the White House about a possible strike on Iran. President Donald Trump has signaled he is weighing further military steps, but behind the scenes, pressure has been building – both from within the administration and from his own electorate – to avoid sliding into a broad war that could shake the political landscape eight months before the November midterms.
The fear of losing Congress
President Donald Trump is at a particularly delicate juncture vis-à-vis Congress, because Republican control of it hinges on a slim margin of seats to begin with. As of now, Republicans hold a relatively narrow majority of 218 seats against 214 Democrats, with three vacant seats set to be filled in special elections in 2026 – a dynamic that could narrow their advantage even further. On top of that, three Republican members occasionally vote against Trump's agenda on certain issues, which tightens the margin still more.
Historically, the president's party almost always loses seats in the midterms, and sometimes even control of one of the two chambers – a pattern that has recurred in recent decades and made it harder for presidents to advance their agenda in the final years of their term.
For Trump, the risk is not only legislative but personal: losing Republican control of the House could reopen the door to impeachment proceedings. Trump himself had warned previously that Democrats "are just waiting to return to power to launch another witch hunt" against him, following the two impeachment attempts he faced during his first term.
According to a Pew Research Center poll conducted at the end of January, the approval rating among Republicans and Republican-leaning voters stands at 73%. That represents a notable drop from the start of his second term, when the figure was around 84%, though it still reflects a clear majority within the Republican camp.
By comparison, the same poll found that among the general public the approval rating stands at 37%, and among Democrats and their supporters at just 5% – figures that illustrate how Trump's support base has remained almost exclusively Republican, amid deep partisan polarization.
Fox News cited Republican strategists as noting that a decision to strike Iran "carries domestic political risks heading into the midterms, where voters are far more concerned about the economy than about foreign conflicts" – precisely against this backdrop.
The cost of living front and center
Growth figures for 2025 showed a 2.2% expansion in GDP – a respectable pace, though slightly slower than the previous year. Yet according to recent YouGov data, 24% of Republicans and 23% of all respondents identify inflation and prices as the most important issue facing the US today, placing it at the top of the national priority list.
According to a USA Today report, Republican members of Congress have been urging Trump to convey empathy for "grocery bills, rent, and prescription drugs." Fox News warned that a prolonged confrontation and disruption to the Strait of Hormuz could spike energy prices and hurt consumers already anxious about inflation.
The tariff crisis and the Supreme Court shock
The political backdrop grew more complicated still following the Supreme Court ruling on Friday, which struck down most of the tariffs Trump had imposed under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, known as IEEPA.
The ruling, led by Chief Justice Roberts, determined that tariff authority rests with Congress – and dealt a blow to a central tool Trump had sought to use to fund his economic agenda. Against this backdrop, opening a new military front could be perceived as a dangerous distraction.
The Epstein affair and anger among younger voters
Adding to the equation is the Jeffrey Epstein affair. A New York Times report described how young Republicans are frustrated with the administration's handling of the document release, viewing it as a "betrayal."
The poll cited in the article found that more than a third of young Republican men consider the opposition to full disclosure of the files to be "very concerning." When that anger intersects with the cost of living, it creates a sense of disconnect between the populist base and the leadership.
In the middle of an election cycle, the White House can ill afford yet another source of erosion among a young audience that turned out in force in 2024.
Trump voters and the aversion to "endless wars"
Trump was re-elected in 2024 on a promise to avoid "endless wars." The Washington Post reported that last year prominent figures in the MAGA camp warned against sliding into a broad war with Iran, arguing that the base has no interest in further military entanglements. While some of those voices quieted after the limited strikes in the summer, the fear of a prolonged campaign has remained.
At the same time, Reuters reported that Trump's advisers have been pushing him to train his attention on voters' economic worries ahead of November's midterms. A senior White House official acknowledged that despite the president's combative rhetoric, the administration has reached no consensus on military action against Iran. At a closed-door briefing last week attended by several senior administration members, those present were told that the economy is the central election issue – according to a source in the room. Trump himself was absent.
Republican strategist Rob Godfrey was unsparing in his assessment. A prolonged standoff with Iran, he said, would pose a real political threat to Trump and the party. "The president must remember that the base that carried him through three consecutive campaigns is deeply wary of military involvement abroad – ending the era of 'endless wars' was an explicit campaign promise of his," Godfrey said. For all the internal dissent, many in Trump's MAGA movement backed the operation that pushed Venezuela's president out of power last month.
Iran, however, is a far harder problem than Venezuela – militarily and diplomatically – and a war could generate real resistance from the very base Trump needs to hold together.
Republican strategist Lauren Cooley offered a narrower opening. Trump supporters could back military action against Iran, she said, but only if it were swift and decisive. "The White House will need to link any action directly to defending America's security and economic stability," she said. A White House official added that Trump "has made clear he always prefers diplomacy, and that Iran must close a deal before it is too late," and that the president has repeatedly stressed that Iran "cannot possess nuclear weapons or the capacity to build them, and must not enrich uranium."
A late-January Politico poll put support for US military action against Iran at 50% among Trump's 2024 voters – the highest figure for any target covered in the survey. Among self-identified Trump supporters and MAGA Republicans, that number climbs to 61%. But Amy Walter, editor of the Cook Political Report, drew a critical distinction: Trump's supporters differentiate sharply between targeted strikes and open-ended wars of the Iraq-and-Afghanistan kind. A limited operation, in their framing, is not a "war" – it is a contained military action. "If he were to say tomorrow that we're sending troops to the Middle East or putting boots on the ground in Venezuela, that's the kind of thing that could blow apart the coalition," she said.
The internal Republican rift over Israel
Running alongside all of this is a fracture inside the Republican tent over Israel. The New York Times described how "a rift over Israel is tearing MAGA apart," with prominent voices including Tucker Carlson and Candace Owens mounting sharp attacks on unconditional support for the Jewish state.
A December 2025 poll from the Manhattan Institute laid bare the divide. A solid majority of longtime Republican voters still regard Israel as a key US ally. But among "new Republicans" – younger or more recently registered party members – the picture is considerably more complicated. Roughly 24% of this group view Israel as a burden on the United States. Only about 39% call it an important ally. The poll also found that roughly 17% of Republicans overall hold a cluster of views classified as "antisemitic," including conspiracy theories and the belief that Israel pulls America into wars that do not serve American interests.
The State of the Union: the moment of reckoning
All of these pressures converge Tuesday evening – Wednesday morning, Israel time – when Trump delivers the State of the Union before a joint session of Congress. It will be the first formal State of the Union of his second term. The address he gave in March 2025, just weeks into the new administration, was a joint session speech rather than a formal State of the Union.
That speech ran for one hour and forty minutes. Trump declared that "America's golden age has only just begun," promising economic relief for working families, lower energy prices, and a tariff policy to power his economic vision. Nearly a year later, the picture looks different. The Supreme Court has struck down that tariff policy. Inflation remains the issue voters rank highest. His overall approval rating has hit a low.
Congressional Republicans are watching closely to see which version of Trump takes the podium – the one who tells the country everything is on track, or the one who shows he understands the real pressures bearing down on ordinary voters. An address that leans into further military confrontation risks reading as a leader out of touch with everyday anxieties. A balanced message – one that sidesteps any commitment to a prolonged war and keeps the emphasis squarely on American interests – could go a long way toward steadying the base.

Explosions which Ukrainian authorities have called a terror attack have killed a 23-year-old police officer and injured 25 people in the western city of Lviv.
Russia targeted Ukraine with another heavy night of bombing as it launched 50 missiles and nearly 300 drones across different Ukrainian regions, days ahead of the four-year anniversary of Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine.
The country’s energy infrastructure remains one of the main targets, as well as logistical infrastructure such as railway facilities and water infrastructure in cities, according to a social media post by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.
Fifteen people, including four children, have been injured, and one man has been killed in a Russian strike on the Kyiv region, including the capital. Temperatures were reported to have dropped to -10C when the capital was struck during the night.
"The enemy is attacking the capital with ballistic weapons," the head of Kyiv's military administration, Tymur Tkachenko, said on Telegram, urging people to remain in shelters.
Seven regions were targeted, including "Kyiv and the region, the Dnipro, Kirovohrad, Mykolaiv, Odesa, Poltava, and Sumy regions," Zelenskyy wrote on social media.
Meanwhile, in Mykolaiv, 16,000 people have been left without electricity in below-freezing temperatures after energy infrastructure was damaged in the strikes, regional authorities reported.
Significant damage and large-scale fires were also reported at energy facilities in the south-western region of Odesa by Ukraine’s emergency workers.
Zelenskyy said that this week alone, Russia launched more than 1,300 drone attacks.
Terror attack in Lviv
Meanwhile, also overnight, in the western city of Lviv, 25 people were injured and a police officer was killed in what Ukrainian officials have called a terror attack. Two homemade bombs exploded in waste bins after police responded to a reported break-in, according to the National Police of Ukraine.
For the moment, the Ukrainian president said: "Several individuals have been detained, and all facts will be established within the necessary procedural framework."
In an interview released on Saturday, US President Donald Trump's Special Envoy Steve Witkoff did not rule out the possibility of a summit between Zelenskyy and Russian President Vladimir Putin. Speaking to Fox News, Witkoff said: "We are hopeful, Jared (Kushner) and I, that – we've put some proposals on the table to both sides that will bring them together in the next three weeks and maybe even result in a summit between Zelenskyy and President Putin."
On Friday, Zelenskyy said that another round of talks may be on the cards before the end of February.

Iran-US tensions: What would blocking Strait of Hormuz mean for oil, LNG?
More than $500bn in oil and gas flows through waterway annually, leaving the global economy exposed to disruptions.
Whenever tensions rise between Iran and the United States, one narrow waterway moves to the centre of global attention – the Strait of Hormuz.
The world’s largest warship, the nuclear-powered aircraft carrier USS Gerald R Ford, is heading to the Gulf, joining one of the largest US military build-ups in the region since the 2003 invasion of Iraq. This time, Iran is in Washington’s crosshairs.

This month, Tehran signalled how it might respond to an attack when it announced the temporary closure of sections of the Strait of Hormuz, the narrow gateway linking the Gulf to open seas.
Iranian authorities carried out live-fire military drills in the corridor, through which about 20 percent of global oil supplies are shipped.
The move marked a rare suspension of activity in parts of the strait. It served as a pointed warning about the economic consequences if Washington proceeds with its threats to strike Iran, highlighting how quickly a regional confrontation could spill into global markets.
Where is the Strait of Hormuz?
The Strait of Hormuz is the world’s most critical oil chokepoint.
The curved waterway lies between Iran to the north and Oman and the United Arab Emirates to the south. It is roughly 50km (31 miles) wide at its entrance and exit and narrows to about 33km (20 miles) at its tightest point. It forms the only maritime link between the Gulf and the Arabian Sea.
Despite its narrow width, the channel accommodates the world’s largest crude carriers. Major Middle Eastern oil and gas exporters rely on it to move supplies to international markets while importing nations depend on its uninterrupted operation.
How much oil and gas pass through the strait?
According to the US Energy Information Administration (EIA), about 20 million barrels of oil transited through the Strait of Hormuz each day in 2024. That equates to nearly $500bn in annual energy trade, underlining the waterway’s central role in the global economy.
The crude passing through the strait originates from Iran, Iraq, Kuwait, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the UAE.
Any prolonged disruption would rattle producers and the economies that depend on their exports.
The strait also plays a critical role in the liquefied natural gas (LNG) trade. In 2024, roughly a fifth of global LNG shipments moved through the corridor with Qatar accounting for the vast majority of those volumes, according to EIA data.
Where does it all go?
The strait handles LNG flows in both directions. Kuwait and the UAE import supplies sourced outside the Gulf, including shipments from the US and West Africa.
The EIA estimated that in 2024, 84 percent of crude oil and condensate shipments transiting the strait headed to Asian markets. A similar pattern appears in the gas trade with 83 percent of LNG volumes moving through the Strait of Hormuz destined for Asia.
China, India, Japan and South Korea accounted for a combined 69 percent intake of all crude oil and condensate flows through the strait last year. Their factories, transport networks and power grids depend on uninterrupted Gulf energy.
What are Iran’s options?
Under international law, states may exercise sovereignty up to 12 nautical miles (22km) from their coastlines. At its narrowest stretch, the Strait of Hormuz and its designated shipping lanes fall entirely within the territorial waters of Iran and Oman.
That legal reality gives Tehran geographic leverage. About 3,000 vessels transit the strait each month. If Iran tried to obstruct traffic, one of the most effective tactics would involve deploying naval mines using fast attack boats and submarines.
Tehran’s fleet includes fast boats equipped with antiship missiles, alongside surface vessels, semisubmersible craft and submarines designed for asymmetric warfare.
Iran’s parliament last year approved a motion to close the Strait of Hormuz. Any final decision rests with Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei.
Regional dynamics could further complicate the situation.
In Yemen, the Houthi group, which maintains close ties with Iran, could again try to disrupt traffic through the Bab al-Mandab Strait, another vital maritime chokepoint linking the Red Sea to global trade routes. Shipping through that corridor suffered significant disruptions after Israel’s genocidal war on Gaza began in October 2023.
The Houthis, who control northwestern Yemen, including the capital, Sanaa, recently organised a mass rally under the slogan Steadfast and Ready for the Next Round, signalling readiness for a potential confrontation with domestic or foreign adversaries.
Any coordinated pressure on the Strait of Hormuz and Bab al-Mandab Strait would amplify risks for global shipping, energy markets and international trade.
Impact on global oil prices
Colby Connelly, head of Middle East content at Energy Intelligence, told Al Jazeera from the UAE that a full or partial closure of the Strait of Hormuz would have a “major impact on oil prices in the near term”, depending on how long the strait remains contested.
“There are no other major sources of supply that can make up for what comes from the Gulf, especially given the consideration that around 70 percent of OPEC+ spare production capacity sits in the Gulf,” Connelly said, referring to the group of oil-producing countries that collectively sets production volumes.
Saudi Arabia relies heavily on the strait to export its crude, shipping roughly 5.5 million barrels per day through the corridor – more than any other country in the region, according to EIA data.
Iran’s oil exports, about 90 percent of which go to China, averaged roughly 1.7 million barrels per day in the first half of 2025, according to the EIA.
“Saudi Arabia and the UAE both have limited pipeline capacity that can allow exports to continue via the Red Sea coast and Fujairah,” a UAE port on the Gulf of Oman, Connelly warned.
While some Gulf producers hold substantial volumes in overseas storage that could cushion supply shocks, Connelly noted that buffers may prove limited in the face of serious disruptions. He cautioned: “Oil prices have been highly reactive to geopolitical tensions in recent weeks, and as a result, prices could spike to well over $100 per barrel if there were to be a major disruption.”
Impact on global economy
Any disruption to energy flows through Hormuz would drive up fuel and factory costs, especially as China leans on manufacturing and exports to sustain its economic growth.
Higher energy prices would raise production expenses with companies likely passing those costs along supply chains and to consumers.
“That’s going to have severe inflationary effects for the global economy,” warned Samuel Ramani, an associate fellow at the Royal United Services Institute in the United Kingdom.
The consequences would extend beyond China. Several major Asian economies depend heavily on shipments transiting through the strait.
Almost half of India’s crude oil imports and about 60 percent of its natural gas supplies move through the Strait of Hormuz. South Korea sources roughly 60 percent of its crude via the same route while Japan relies on it for close to three-quarters of its oil imports.
“For the Gulf countries in particular, it’s going to cause a lot of disruption,” Ramani told Al Jazeera. “I was in the UAE recently, and investors in Dubai are concerned about what that would mean for the tourism and finance sector. This may cause some investment hiccups in some of the Vision 2030 projects in Saudi Arabia.”
“There’s many, many layers of concern here, not just exports and prices but also broader macroeconomic and microeconomic consequences. So we should be looking at this as a very serious adverse financial development,” Ramani added.

Arrest of Britain’s former prince Andrew hands King Charles fresh royal crisis

- King Charles’ reign, since September 2022, has faced multiple crises, including Prince Harry’s memoir and both his and Princess Catherine’s cancer diagnoses.
- His brother, Mr Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor, was arrested Feb 19, posing the "gravest threat" to his reign.
- Experts warn Andrew's arrest could be "hugely damaging" to the institution's moral authority, requiring visible change from the monarchy to restore stability.

LONDON – Britain’s King Charles III has been left wrestling with a new test after the arrest of his brother
“Charles has, since coming to the throne in September 2022, been battered by a succession of difficulties and crises, whether it’s in relation to his second son, Prince Harry, his health, the health of Catherine, or the very disruptive figure of Andrew,” royal commentator Ed Owens said.
After decades waiting in the wings, the former prince Charles became king in September 2022
His coronation on May 6, 2023, was rich in pageantry, projecting continuity and tradition.
Yet, trouble stirred even before the crown was placed on his head.
In January 2023, his youngest son, Prince Harry, released his explosive memoir Spare, launching repeated attacks on the royal family and airing private disputes lapped up by a global audience.
Living in California with his wife, Meghan, Duchess of Sussex, since 2020 and estranged from his family, Prince Harry has been accused by critics of damaging, for personal and commercial gain, an institution long seen as unshakeable.
Though Prince Harry has since sought reconciliation, the rift remains.
Then in February 2024, King Charles, now 77, revealed he was undergoing treatment for cancer
Weeks later came another blow: Catherine, Princess of Wales and wife of heir apparent, Prince William, announced she too was being treated for cancer.
While Princess Catherine has since said she is in remission and King Charles indicated in December that his treatment was being eased, illness has cast a long shadow over the royal household.
The King has won admiration for his dignified, touching fight against cancer, talking about his shock at learning his diagnosis, and making a point of publicly visiting patients, urging prevention and early detection.
But arguably the gravest threat to his reign has come from his younger brother, Mr Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor, as he is now known, who remains eighth in line to the throne.
Royal historian Andrew Lownie said it is “a crunch point” for the monarchy.
If it is found that “they have been abetting him, enabling him, protecting him, then I think Charles will have to stand aside”, he said.
The longstanding ties between the deeply unpopular Mr Mountbatten-Windor to late convicted American sex offender Jeffrey Epstein have caused years of embarrassment.
A photograph published in 2011 showing the former prince with his arm around the waist of Ms Virginia Giuffre, Epstein’s main accuser
‘Monarchy unstable’
Scrutiny has intensified in recent months.
In October, King Charles sought to draw a line under the affair by stripping his brother of all his titles
But new documents released by the US Department of Justice in January reignited public outrage.
On Feb 19, Mr Mountbatten-Windor was arrested and held for hours in police custody, suspected of having passed confidential information
It was the first time a senior British royal has been arrested in modern history.
In a rare personally signed statement, King Charles vowed that the “law must take its course” and expressed his “deepest concern”.
Some commentators have likened the moment to other crises that have shaken the monarchy, such as the 1936 abdication of Edward VIII and the 1997 death of Princess Diana, King Charles’ ex-wife.
In both cases, it took more than a decade to restore stability and public confidence, Mr Owens said.
For Professor Pauline Maclaran, an academic and royal family expert, King Charles is in part a victim of timing.
“The monarchy seems quite unstable now, and that was always going to happen after the queen passed away because she had been there for so long and had given this great sense of continuity,” she said.
The late queen “certainly protected Andrew”, Prof Maclaran added.
Mr Owens was more direct.
“Andrew was an unexploded bomb that the queen passed on to Charles,” he said.
“This episode, I think, could potentially be hugely damaging to the institution,” he added. “Already, I think its moral authority has suffered. That includes the moral authority of the king.”
Restoring that authority will require visible change, Prof Maclaran argued.
“William has indicated that he will change things, but they’ve got to really emphasise that more now,” she said. AFP

Iran and US have 'differing views' on sanction relief: official
Iran and the United States have differing views over sanctions relief in talks to curb Tehran's nuclear ambitions, a senior Iranian official told Reuters on Sunday, adding that new talks were planned in early March as fears of a military confrontation grow.
Iran and the US renewed negotiations earlier this month to tackle their decades-long dispute over Tehran's nuclear programme as the US builds up its military capability in the Middle East, fuelling fears of a wider war.
Iran has threatened to strike US bases in the Middle East if it is attacked by US forces.
"The last round of talks showed that US ideas regarding the scope and mechanism of sanctions relief differ from Iran’s demands. Both sides need to reach a logical timetable for lifting sanctions," the official said.
"This roadmap must be reasonable and based on mutual interests." Iran's Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi said on Friday that he expected to have a draft counterproposal ready within days, while US President Donald Trump said he was considering limited military strikes.
Readiness to compromise
While rejecting a US demand for "zero enrichment" - a major sticking point in past negotiations - Tehran has signalled its readiness to compromise on its nuclear work.
Washington views enrichment inside Iran as a potential pathway to nuclear weapons. Iran denies seeking nuclear weapons and wants its right to enrich uranium to be recognised.
Washington has also demanded that Iran relinquish its stockpile of highly enriched uranium (HEU). The UN nuclear agency last year estimated that stockpile at more than 440 kg of uranium enriched to up to 60% fissile purity, a small step away from the 90 percent that is considered weapons grade.
The Iranian official said Tehran could seriously consider a combination of exporting part of its HEU stockpile, diluting the purity of its most highly enriched uranium and the establishment of a regional enrichment consortium in exchange for the recognition of Iran's right to "peaceful nuclear enrichment".
"The negotiations continue and the possibility of reaching an interim agreement exists," he said.
Benefits for both sides
Iranian authorities have said that a diplomatic solution delivers economic benefits for both Tehran and Washington.
"Within the economic package under negotiation, the United States has also been offered opportunities for serious investment and tangible economic interests in Iran’s oil industry," the official said.
However, he said Tehran will not hand over control of its oil and mineral resources.
"Ultimately, the US can be an economic partner for Iran, nothing more. American companies can always participate as contractors in Iran’s oil and gas fields."

Trump warns Netflix of ‘consequences’ unless it pulls top Democrat from board

Donald Trump has told Netflix to remove the Democratic foreign policy expert Susan Rice from its board or “face the consequences”, while the streaming platform is locked in an extraordinary corporate battle to take control of Warner Bros Discovery (WBD).
In comments posted on his Truth Social platform, the US president described Rice – who served as national security adviser to Barack Obama and UN ambassador and White House adviser under Joe Biden – as a “political hack” and accused her of having “no talent or skills”.
Trump’s comments herald a fresh intervention in the takeover battle between Netflix and Paramount Skydance for the studios and streaming businesses of WBD only weeks after promising not to get involved.
He said in an interview with NBC News in early February that the justice department would handle the takeover of WBD, having insisted previously he would be involved in reviewing the deal. Any takeover of WBD will have to be approved by federal regulators.
On Saturday, however, Trump wrote of Rice: “HER POWER IS GONE, AND WILL NEVER BE BACK. How much is she being paid, and for what???”
Rice was a member of Netflix’s board from 2018 to 2020, before leaving during the Biden administration. She rejoined in 2023 and sits on the company’s nominating and governance committee.
She appeared on a podcast in recent days, during which she said that corporations, law firms and news organisations that showed loyalty to Trump would be held accountable if the Democrats returned to power.
As part of his intervention, Trump reposted a post on X by the rightwing influencer Laura Loomer, who called Rice and Netflix “anti-American” and accused her of “threatening half of the country with weaponised government and political retribution for choosing who they wanted to vote for as president?”
Trump’s latest comments come with a couple of days left for Paramount Skydance to table its best and final offer for WBD to compete with Netflix’s existing offer.
Paramount, which is controlled by the billionaire Ellison family, has tried to secure a $108.4bn (£80bn) takeover of WBD with a bid backstopped by a personal $40bn guarantee by Larry Ellison, a co-founder of Oracle.
Under the Netflix deal, the streaming company’s vast library would take control of WBD’s prize assets including Warner Bros, the studio behind franchises including Harry Potter, Superman and Batman, as well as HBO, home to shows including Game of Thrones, The White Lotus and Succession.
The tie-up between Netflix and WBD has faced a backlash from US politicians and figures in the entertainment industry, with some voicing concerns that the resulting media giant would control almost half of the streaming market.
Netflix has been approached for comment.

Trump tariff chaos: What does 15% levy mean for trade deals the US signed?
From the EU to Vietnam to the UK and India, multiple countries had signed or finalised trade deals with the US.
The United States Supreme Court’s ruling, which declared Donald Trump’s sweeping tariffs unlawful, has injected uncertainty into global trade yet again, as the US president imposed a new 15 percent tariff on Saturday.
Weeks after his inauguration in January 2025, Trump imposed tariffs against foes and allies using the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA), unleashing a trade war that rattled global trade.

- list 2 of 3Trump suggests he won’t refund tariffs after Supreme Court ruling

But on Friday, in a 6-3 decision, the top court agreed that Trump exceeded his authority by invoking the 1977 law, which was designed to allow US presidents to respond to specific national emergencies. The court said tariffs are a form of taxation, and under Article I of the Constitution, the power to tax belongs exclusively to Congress.
The court’s ruling, however, does not apply to Trump’s tariffs on steel, aluminium, lumber and automotives since these were imposed under a different law – Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962.
Following the verdict, a furious Trump called the Supreme Court judges “fools and lapdogs” who are “very unpatriotic and disloyal to our Constitution”. He immediately signed an executive order under Section 122 of the US Trade Act of 1974 to impose a blanket 10 percent tariff on all countries the US trades with, starting on February 24. On Saturday, he raised the tariff to 15 percent, the highest rate allowed under this trade law.
So, what is this new trade law that Trump has used to impose tariffs? What does this mean for trade deals the US has already signed with countries around the world?
Here’s what we know:
What is the new trade law Trump is using?
Under US law, Section 122 of the US Trade Act of 1974 empowers the president to impose tariffs of up to 15 percent to address “large and serious balance-of-payments deficits”.
Tariffs can be imposed under this law only for 150 days unless the US Congress agrees to extend it. Trump is the first president to use this law to impose tariffs.
In a statement on Friday, the White House said some goods, such as certain agricultural products like beef, tomatoes, natural resources and fertilisers that cannot be grown or produced in the US, aerospace products, among others, will not be subject to the temporary levy.
Shantanu Singh, an international trade lawyer, noted that since this is the first time this legal authority has been used by any US president, it could likely be litigated.
“But the government has considerable leeway to determine this as trade deficits can form part of balance-of-payments deficits,” he told Al Jazeera. Trump has justified the tariffs as a way to balance the US’s trade deficits of more than $900bn.
What happens to the trade deals?
Several countries had signed trade deals to cushion themselves from Trump’s punishing tariffs last year. The United Kingdom, India and the European Union, among others, had entered into deals to lower tariffs on their exports to the US.
But the ongoing tariff spectacle has thrown the future of those trade deals into doubt. Will they be charged the new 15 percent tariff or the agreed rate signed in the trade deals? Will India be tariffed at 18 percent, as per the trade deal, or 15 percent as announced by Trump on Saturday?
Speaking to reporters on Friday, Trump said some of these trade agreements will stand.
“The trade deals, because they are international, will likely remain in place,” Singh, the international trade lawyer, said.
However, after the Supreme Court’s ruling, he said, the big incentive for doing trade deals with the Trump administration, which was to get a lower reciprocal tariff rate before competitors, has vanished.
“That reduces the incentive for trade partners to comply with their part of the deal for the time being,” he said.
Here is a look at some of the trade agreements and what their future looks like.
United Kingdom
The UK was one of the first to sign a trade deal with the US last May after being hit by 5 percent tariffs on steel and aluminium exports, as well as a 25 percent tariff on cars and auto parts.
Under their agreement, the US agreed that there would be zero tariffs on steel and aluminium imports from the UK, and for other goods, it was set at 10 percent. Last December, the two nations also agreed to zero tariffs on pharmaceuticals and medical products.
After Friday’s Supreme Court ruling, William Bain, head of trade policy at the British Chamber of Commerce, said in a statement that the ruling does “little to clear the murky waters for business”.
On Friday, a spokesperson told the media that the British government was “working with the US” to understand more about how the court’s ruling will affect the UK.
The court ruling will not impact the UK’s deal on steel, aluminium and pharmaceutical exports.
But Bain said the new 15 percent global tariff rate, which has been imposed under Section 122 of the Trade Act 1974, “will be bad for trade, bad for US consumers and businesses and weaken global economic growth”.
China
Trump had imposed one of the highest tariffs on China, and the world’s two largest economies were engaged in a trade war. At one point, they had slapped reciprocal tariffs exceeding 100 percent on some goods.
The two countries have yet to sign a trade deal, but they agreed to lower the tariffs as part of a trade truce.
After several rounds of trade talks and a summit between Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping in South Korea in October, the two countries agreed to a one-year truce with a 10 percent baseline tariff. Trump also slashed the so-called fentanyl tariff to 10 percent.
The Supreme Court ruling will lift tariffs imposed on chemicals used in fentanyl. However, tariffs on other Chinese exports, such as electric vehicles, aluminium and steel, will remain.
Following the court’s ruling, Chinese Embassy spokesperson in the US, Liu Pengyu, told journalists that tariffs and trade wars serve neither the US nor China’s interests. He called on Beijing and Washington to work together to “provide greater certainty and stability for China-US economic and trade cooperation and the global economy”.
Trump is scheduled to travel to China from March 31 to April 2 to meet Xi and discuss trade.
But Singh, the trade lawyer, said countries like China that did not negotiate deals with the US are quite well placed because, as a result of the court’s ruling and repeal of the reciprocal tariffs, they have achieved a lower rate of tariff without having to make concessions.
“China will definitely feel it has the upper hand going into negotiations with the US,” he said.
South East Asia
Last year, South East Asian countries Indonesia, Malaysia, Vietnam and Cambodia entered into trade agreements with the Trump administration to lower tariffs.
Malaysia reduced its tariff from 25 percent to 19 percent, while Cambodia’s tariff dropped from 49 percent to 19 percent after their respective trade agreements with the US last year. Vietnam and Indonesia also signed deals, reducing their tariffs to 20 percent and 19 percent, respectively.
After the Supreme Court’s decision, Trump’s trade representative, Jamieson Greer, told Fox News that US imports from countries such as Malaysia and Cambodia would continue to be taxed at their negotiated rates of 19 percent, even though the universal rate was fixed at 15 percent on Saturday.
Indonesia’s chief negotiator for US tariffs, Airlangga Hartarto, also said the trade deal between the countries that set US tariffs at 19 percent remains in force despite the court decision.
India
At 50 percent, India faced among the highest US tariffs. The US first imposed a 25 percent levy on Indian imports and later added another 25 percent citing the country’s purchases of Russian oil as the reason.
Earlier this month, the US and India reached a framework trade deal. Trump said Prime Minister Narendra Modi agreed to stop buying Russian oil and that US tariffs would be lowered to 18 percent for India’s top exports to the US, including clothing, pharmaceuticals, precious stones, and textiles. India said it will eliminate or reduce tariffs on all US industrial goods and a range of agricultural products.
An Indian trade delegation, which was scheduled to travel to the US to finalise details of the trade agreement, has been postponed.
European Union
Last July, the EU and the US struck a deal to avert a transatlantic trade war after Trump imposed a 30 percent tariff on imports from the 27-member bloc. Under the agreement, EU exports to the US would face a 15 percent tariff.
The deal, however, had not yet come into effect since EU lawmakers paused its ratification after Trump threatened to annex Greenland, an autonomous territory of Denmark, last month.
The European Parliament’s trade committee is set to vote on the EU’s trade deal with the US on February 24, but the Supreme Court’s ruling and Trump’s new tariffs have made the future of the deal uncertain.
An EU commission spokesperson told journalists after the court’s ruling that the bloc is in “close contact” with the US administration to seek more clarity.
Mexico
Mexico was one of the first countries to be targeted by Trump’s tariffs last year. It was hit by a 25 percent tariff on some pharmaceuticals, and an additional 25 percent “fentanyl tariff” over what Trump said is the flow of drugs across the Mexican border into the US.
Approximately 85 percent of Mexican exports to the US were exempt from tariffs because of the US-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA), which came into force in July 2020.
The Supreme Court ruling will reduce the tariffs on Mexico’s exports.
However, the USMCA is set to be reviewed again later this year, and it is uncertain whether products exempt from US tariffs under it will face levies if the agreement lapses.
Mexico’s Economy Minister Marcelo Ebrard has said he will travel to the US in the near future to discuss the issue.
Canada
Canada faces 35 percent tariffs on goods from certain sectors, like steel and aluminium, and most of its goods have also been impacted by a 50 percent levy on imported metals and a 25 percent duty on non-US cars.
Most of its goods are exempt under the existing USMCA.
Following the court verdict, Canada-US Trade Minister Dominic LeBlanc told journalists that significant work remains as Washington-imposed tariffs on steel, aluminium, softwood lumber and automobiles remain in place.
Moreover, with the USMCA review coming up later this year, some Canadian leaders are also worried about what Trump could do next.
What happens next?
Countries are waiting to hear how exactly the top court’s ruling and Trump’s new tariffs will play out.
Singh, the trade lawyer, said the US administration will likely use the 150-day period during which the 15 percent Section 122 global tariffs will be effective.
“During this period, the United States trade representative will swiftly conduct investigations under another legal authority – Section 301 – to make findings on unfair trade practices of its trade partners and try to reinstate the reciprocal tariff rates which were invalidated,” he said.
“The trade deals could then be adjusted to reflect this new reality.”

Why adults pursuing career growth or personal interests are the 'new majority' student
Millions of adults are continuing their education by returning to school and enrolling in credit and non-credit courses, certificates, micro-credentials, job training and degree programs
- Bookmark
Interested in starting a business, learning about artificial intelligence or exploring a new hobby? There's a class for that.
Millions of U.S. adults enroll in credit and non-credit college courses to earn professional certificates, learn new skills or to pursue academic degrees. Some older students are seeking career advancement, higher pay and job security, while others want to explore their personal interests or try new things.
“They might have kids, they might be working full-time, they might be older non-traditional students," said Eric Deschamps, the director of continuing education at Northern Arizona University in Flagstaff, Arizona. But returning to school "opens doors to education for students that might not have those doors open to them otherwise.”
Older students, many of whom bring years of work and life experience to their studies, often are juggling courses with full-time jobs, caregiving and other family responsibilities. It is a challenging balancing act but can also sharpen priorities and provide a sense of fulfillment.
Here's what experts have to say about returning to school, what to consider beforehand and how to balance coursework with work and personal commitments.
Why more people want to continue learning
UCLA Extension, the continuing education division of the University of California, Los Angeles, offers more than 90 certificate and specialization programs, from interior design, early childhood education and accounting to photography, paralegal studies and music production. Individual courses cover a wide range of topics, including retirement planning, writing novels, the business of athletes and artists, and the ancient Japanese art of ikebana, or flower arranging.
About 33,500 students — nearly half of them older than 35 — were enrolled during the last academic year. UCLA reported a full-time enrollment of about 32,600 degree-seeking undergraduate students during the same period.
“I prefer calling our (adult) learners not only continuous, but the new majority student. These are learners who tend to already be employed, often supporting a family, looking for up-skilling or sometimes a career change,” Traci Fordham, UCLA's interim associate dean for academic programs and learning innovation, said.
Higher education experts say some adults take classes for professional development as economic concerns, technological advances and other workforce changes create a sense of job insecurity.
“A great example of that is artificial intelligence. These new technologies are coming out pretty quickly and for folks that got a degree, even just 5 or 10 years ago, their knowledge might be a little bit outdated,” Deschamps said.
What to ask yourself before returning to school
Adults interested in becoming students again may want to assess their time and budgets, and weigh the potential benefits and consequences, including the financial impact, the potential for burnout and rewards of education that may take a while materialize, academic advisors say.
Deschamps suggests asking where you want to be in 5 or 10 years and how the training and knowledge received through an additional class or certificate can help get you there. For example, if you want to start a microbrewery, learning to brew your own beer or launching a business will help. If a promotion or career change is the goal, training for a new job, refreshing skills or understanding a different industry may help show you are qualified.
Schools like UCLA and Northern Arizona University are working to make continuing education courses accessible by keeping the cost low in comparison to degree-track classes and offering financial assistance. A variety of learning environments usually are offered — in-person and online classes, accelerated and self-paced instruction — to help adults integrate schoolwork with their home and work lives.
Katie Swavely, assistant director for academic advising and student success at UCLA, started at community college before transferring to UCLA to study anthropology. She said it took her 10 years after graduating to go back for her master's degree in counseling with a focus on academic advising. Swavely completed that degree in 2020 and credits access to the program through employer-sponsored tuition assistance from her job at the time.
“I felt like in so many ways I didn’t really know who I was or what I wanted to do other than just pay the bills and survive,” said Swavely, who is married and has two children. “It was hard. And I thought about quitting many times. We had to budget to the extreme and find additional ways to make it work.”
She added: “There are questions of how are we going to make it work and do we have the money. As a parent, sacrifices are there all the time. You make those judgment calls every day. But making sure that you’re investing in yourself. There’s always gonna be reasons why it’s not today, not this month, not this year, but it’s also OK to just jump in and go for it and see how it works out.”
As an avid book lover, Swavely now wants to take a book editing course and hopes to continue her education and enroll in that through the university soon.
Overcoming barriers to returning at any age
Some experts say one of the main barriers to returning to school is psychological. There might be concerns that their writing skills are rusty and that they don't know enough math or technology, bringing up feelings of uncertainty or failure.
“I think this is tied to access. Many of our learners, not all of them, haven’t imagined themselves in any kind of higher education, post-secondary education environment,” Fordham said.
Swavely said it was important for her to build a support network and take advantage of the counseling and advising options that were available to her as a student.
She encourages adults who are furthering their educations to spend time “finding your community.” Having people around who helped build up her confidence at home and during classes got her through graduate school, Swavely said. She also suggests setting boundaries and giving yourself grace when you need need help.
“The biggest piece of advice is for people to realize you’re never too old to learn," she said.

LONDON, February 22. /TASS/. Indirect talks between Iran and the US may take place in March, a senior Iranian official told Reuters.
"The negotiations continue and the possibility of reaching an interim agreement exists," he said.
Tehran and Washington have different views on the scope and mechanism for lifting sanctions against Iran, the official said. He also noted that Tehran could seriously consider exporting part of its highly enriched uranium stockpiles, downgrading it, and creating a regional uranium enrichment consortium. However, in exchange for this, Iran’s right to "peaceful uranium enrichment" must be recognized, according to the source.

2 killed, including soldier, in attack by unknown gunmen in Syria’s Raqqa
There was no immediate claim of responsibility for attack
ISTANBUL
Two people, including a soldier, were killed in an attack carried out by unidentified assailants in the countryside of Syria’s northeastern Raqqa province, the Defense Ministry said Sunday.
An army member was targeted by unknown gunmen in the village of al-Wasita in the northern Raqqa countryside, resulting in his death along with a civilian, the ministry’s Media and Communications Directorate told the SANA news agency.
No further details were provided.
There was no immediate claim of responsibility for the attack.
ISIS (Daesh) sleeper cells are active in the region, which was previously controlled by the terrorist group in 2014 before it was ousted three years later by a US-led international coalition.
The area later fell under the control of the terror group YPG/SDF before the Syrian Army recently regained control of the region.

Ukraine’s Air Assault Forces regain control of eight settlements in Oleksandrivka sector
The Air Assault Forces Command reported this on Facebook, according to Ukrinform.
The paratroopers are operating jointly with adjacent units of the Defense Forces.
The main objectives are to disrupt the Russian army’s plans for further advances in the Dnipropetrovsk and Zaporizhzhia regions, to defeat the enemy force grouping, and to push it beyond the administrative border of the Dnipropetrovsk region.
The Air Assault Forces grouping of the Armed Forces of Ukraine is repelling all enemy attacks and successfully conducting offensive operations. Overall, the situation is described as “very dynamic.”
“The enemy is clinging to every meter of seized territory, using all available resources, both manpower and equipment. However, despite fierce resistance, the Ukrainian units are carrying out their assigned tasks and step by step liberating their native land,” the Air Assault Forces noted.
The paratroopers emphasize: “While the active phase of the operation continues, it is somewhat premature to speak about its final results.”
As Ukrinform previously reported, Ukrainian assault units pushed Russian troops back near Ternove and Kalynivske, located on the border between the Dnipropetrovsk and Zaporizhzhia regions.

BRUSSELS — The European Union is pushing Washington to clarify how the United States will proceed after the U.S. Supreme Court struck down President Donald Trump’s global tariffs, the EU executive said on Sunday.
"The European Commission requests full clarity on the steps the United States intends to take following the recent Supreme Court ruling on the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA)," the Commission said in a strongly worded statement issued after Trump announced Saturday he wants to impose a new global tariff rate of 15 percent.
"The current situation is not conducive to delivering 'fair, balanced, and mutually beneficial' transatlantic trade and investment,'" the Commission said.
EU Trade Commissioner Maroš Šefčovič spoke with U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer and U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick on Saturday, as the EU grapples with the uncertainty of whether its trade agreement struck in Scotland last summer still applies in light of Trump's latest tariff threats.
The quickly evolving situation pushed a senior EU trade lawmaker to urge the European Parliament to postpone a vote on legislation implementing the EU’s side of its transatlantic trade deal.
Trump's imposition of a 15 percent global tariff following Friday's high court defeat is "a clear breach of the deal we had agreed," Bernd Lange, chair of the European Parliament's trade committee, told POLITICO on Sunday. "I will therefore propose that we suspend ratification of the agreement for the time being," he said.

England bowlers crush Sri Lanka in T20 World Cup Super Eight opener
The 2022 champions demolish host nation Sri Lanka for just 95 runs to win in Pallekele.
Will Jacks has impressed with bat and ball to rescue England from a poor start and help them to a 51-run victory over Sri Lanka in a low-scoring Super Eight match at the Twenty20 World Cup.
Tournament cohosts Sri Lanka appeared to be well set on Sunday after restricting England to a below-par 146-9 in the Group 2 match at the Pallekele International Cricket Stadium.

Experts warn of rapid loss of water in the Baltic Sea: 'A vibrant reef is turning into an underwater wasteland'
Unknown

22:19:15 KST

At the beginning of February, the water level in the Baltic Sea dropped sharply. Experts tell Euronews it is a result of climate change.
While global water and ocean levels are rising, the Baltic Sea lost 275 billion tonnes of water at the beginning of February. It is now 67 cm lower than the average recorded in 1886.
The situation, although it has not happened for 140 years, is caused by atmospheric factors. On the surface, these should not be a cause for concern, but, as Dr Tomasz Kijewski of the Institute of Oceanology of the Polish Academy of Sciences told Euronews, such a deviation is a glaring example of the impact of climate change on the environment. The Arctic plays the first fiddle here.
'The open refrigerator effect'
If water levels are rising, why has so much water disappeared in the Baltic Sea basin? Experts explain that it is the result of strong winds, a high pressure zone and the absence of significant atmospheric fronts.
"The long-lasting strong easterly winds persisting since the beginning of January have pushed water masses through the Danish Straits towards the North Sea, resulting in a drop in levels throughout the basin," reads a post by the Institute of Oceanology of the Polish Academy of Sciences. "As long as this meteorological configuration continues, water is being 'held down' at the south-eastern end of the basins, with levels locally decreasing."
The violent winds and harsh winters that allow these conditions to occur are not proof that, as some claim, climate change does not exist. In fact, the complete opposite is true. As Tomasz Kijewski points out, the phenomenon of climate change itself is not sudden warming, but the numerous weather anomalies that are caused, among other things, by melting glaciers in the Arctic.
"The persistence and extent of the high, which also extended over the North Sea, making room, as it were, for the large volume of water flowing out of the Baltic Sea, is responsible for the scale of the phenomenon," he says. "We are talking about 275 cubic kilometres of water! This exceptional situation did not happen in isolation from the large-scale processes we observe in the Earth's atmosphere. The most important of these in this context is the disintegration of the polar vortex, a circulation of air in the upper layers of the atmosphere (10-50km) which, colloquially speaking, is responsible for keeping the Arctic cold. This vortex is linked to the jet stream, the rapidity of which and the course of this current are responsible for the migration of lows and highs. Hence, deviations such as blocked highs, Arctic frost waves or heat waves in the north are the result of disturbances to this jet stream, and hence the warming of the Arctic."
As he explains, the mass of frigid air that has always existed over the Arctic and has, as it were, sealed it off from the rest of the world is beginning to 'unseal', having a significant effect on the temperature of atmospheric currents.
"We jokingly call it the open fridge effect," says the biologist. "When we open the fridge, air escapes down the bottom and we get cold feet."
In the case of the Baltic Sea, a combination of anthropogenic and human-independent factors is causing the sea to gradually dry out.
"The total volume of rainwater in the area is increasing," according to the expert. "Since the last glaciation, the Earth's crust has been slowly rising, making this sea slowly shallower. This also favours shallowing. Shallow bodies of water are more likely to heat up as a result of global warming, and waters carried by regulated rivers bring more fertiliser compounds into the sea, especially phosphorus, which favours cyanobacteria. The sum of these factors is not conducive to species richness. The water will become sweeter and warmer, which in turn favours algal blooms. Algae, in turn, take away oxygen, which is needed by other living organisms."
Arctic is warming 'four times faster compared to the global average'
Anna Sowa from the Institute of Oceanology of the Polish Academy of Sciences, now working at the Experyment Science Centre in Gdynia while doing her research on the Arctic, noted that species from lower latitudes are expanding their ranges northwards. "This phenomenon is called borealisation and this type of change has already been recorded in various Arctic habitats," - she says in an interview with Euronews. "The new arrivals may start to compete with the local Arctic fauna, which could lead to a reduction in the abundance of Arctic species or even their complete displacement."
During her research between 2004 and 2020, she noted a marked decrease in the density of the endemic bryophyte species Harmeria scutulata. "This allowed me to conclude that with climate change, there is also a reorganisation of species communities in the Arctic hard bottom ecosystem."
The Arctic area is particularly vulnerable in terms of climate change, she says, because "the warming reported there is occurring about four times faster compared to the global average". Rising temperatures may be acting directly on marine organisms, the researcher says, but beyond that, "it is also causing cascading changes such as melting glaciers and sea ice, turbidity of waters associated with increasing suspended solids run-off from rivers and melting glaciers, desalination of surface waters and increasing acidification of waters resulting from increased dissolved CO2 concentrations in water".
"A vibrant reef is turning into an underwater wasteland"
What challenges do the seas and oceans currently face and can they still be saved?
According to biologists, the rise in temperatures cannot be stopped, but the extinction of some species can be partially halted. One of the greatest tragedies of the seas and oceans today is the mass extinction of coral reefs, which provide survival and shelter for at least 25% of all marine species. Biologists point out that a 1.5 °C warming will destroy 70-90% of coral reefs. However, it is not only warming that is affecting the loss of biodiversity in the oceans.
"What worries oceanographers most is the warming of the global Ocean (i.e. all the salt waters that are connected to each other - the Baltic is part of the Ocean)," Kijewski says. "Both energy buildup, affecting climate change, and violent weather events are cause for concern. The most spectacular example is coral bleaching, which entails the annihilation of entire coral reef ecosystems. At elevated temperatures, coral polyps shed symbiotic algae that produce a dangerous excess of oxygen. This in turn leads to starvation of the polyps and the entire ecosystem collapses like a house of cards. Within a few weeks of an oceanic heatwave occurring (by up to 2°C), a vibrant reef turns into an underwater wasteland."
The disappearance of ecosystems in turn translates into the collapse of the fishing industry, says the expert. Similarly, the exploitation of underwater metal resources - so-called rare earth mines on the ocean floor - involves environmental degradation on a larger scale than land-based open-pit mines."It is not only the bottom that is destroyed, but the overburden - that part of the excavated material that on land is stored in heaps - in the Ocean disperses throughout the depths, eliminating access to light and space for ocean creatures."
The Baltic Sea: A reputation for pollution
The Baltic is a sea with a reputation as one of the most polluted. However, according to Kijewski, the basin's worst period of pollution is behind it."Since the common policy of the Baltic States, coordinated by HELCOM and the EU, has led to the installation of biological wastewater treatment plants and generally increased attention to the state of the environment, pollution of the Baltic has largely been halted. A prime example is the Bay of Puck, which until recently was virtually extinct, and for the past two decades we have seen a spontaneous return of seagrass meadows and even seaweed there. The state of plastic pollution is also low, which, unlike the rest of the Ocean, has not increased during the last 30 years."However, he says, the peculiarities of the Baltic's hydrology require a long time for the water to undergo a purifying exchange. An event such as the current low is conducive to this purification, but it will still take another 30 years for the Baltic Sea to undergo significant self-purification. However, it will still be under pressure from climate change and global warming.One example is the cod population, which is currently in a critical state. "There are not many typically marine creatures in the Baltic Sea, such as starfish. There are only a few species of mussels. Most ocean animals cannot function in such low salinity. Cod, although adapted to Baltic water, have to spawn in the bottom water, which is saltier and colder, so much so that anaerobic conditions develop near the bottom and in a few decades the areas friendly to cod eggs have more than doubled. It is true that no extinction of any species in the Baltic Sea has been recorded, but the ecological capacity of this sea is shrinking for everyone - except blue-green algae."
Is there any way we can help the seas and oceans? According to Tomasz Kijewski, the only and most effective thing we can do is "not interfere". Experts agree: man's incompetent interference with the oceans has already caused enough lasting damage.

Europe struggles to matter in a chaotic Middle East today - opinion

For decades, Europe cultivated the belief that the Middle East was not merely a distant arena of instability, but a defining stage upon which the European integration project could demonstrate global relevance. From the aftermath of the Six Day War in 1967 onward, the conflict became a recurring fixture on the European foreign policy agenda.
It was never simply about diplomacy.
It was about identity.
Europe was emerging from its own violent 20th century, sought to present itself as a normative power capable of shaping peace beyond its borders.
That aspiration has always contained an element of tension. Europe wanted to matter. But it rarely possessed the instruments of hard power necessary to impose outcomes. The result was a paradox that critics captured succinctly: Europe was often a player, but primarily a payer.
This pattern became particularly visible after the Oslo Accords in 1993, when the European Union (EU) positioned itself as a central financial pillar of the peace process. European funds sustained Palestinian institutions, supported civil society initiatives, and underwrote much of the infrastructure associated with nation-building. Europe’s economic weight translated into an undeniable presence, even if political influence remained uneven.
Today, however, that long-standing equation appears increasingly fragile.
The past two and a half years have reshaped the regional landscape in ways that have exposed the limits of European engagement. The October 7 massacre and the ensuing Israel-Hamas war generated seismic political and humanitarian consequences.
The subsequent 12-day war between Israel and Iran in 2025 further underscored the volatility of a region already stretched by overlapping crises. Against this backdrop, the EU has struggled to articulate a coherent strategic posture. Statements have been plentiful. Influence has been scarce.
Europe risks being perceived as a marginal actor
The uncomfortable truth is that Europe now risks being perceived not as an underpowered actor, but as a marginal one.
This evolving reality is reflected in Europe’s reaction to what Trump has branded the “Board of Peace.” This initiative, controversial and loosely defined, carries the unmistakable imprint of American political theater. (It also comes with $1 b. member-state fee.) Europe’s response has been revealing.
The EU has made it clear that it wishes to remain in the room. Participation signals continued interest. Absence would signal irrelevance. At the same time, Brussels has been careful to avoid any suggestion that it seeks to displace or undermine the United Nations’ longstanding role in the Middle East peace process.
This duality captures Europe’s dilemma. It wants visibility without confrontation, presence without ownership. The EU’s instinct is to observe, engage, and influence indirectly, while preserving the legitimacy of multilateral frameworks. In principle, this is defensible.
The UN remains the internationally recognized forum for conflict resolution. In practice, however, such restraint risks reinforcing the impression that Europe is content with symbolic involvement rather than substantive leadership.
Perception, in diplomacy, is rarely a secondary matter. The launch of the 2025 EU “Pact for the Mediterranean” was precisely intended to counter this sense of drift. The initiative promised renewed economic cooperation, investment, and regional partnership.
It sought to reposition Europe as a long-term stakeholder in its southern neighborhood. Yet, the timing has complicated its reception. In a period defined by wars, security threats, and geopolitical realignments, development-oriented frameworks struggle to command attention. Grand strategies cannot easily compete with immediate crises.
More troubling is the growing suspicion that Europe’s diminished role is not solely a matter of capability, but also of priority.
Europe today faces an existential security challenge much closer to home. The Russian war of aggression in Ukraine has reoriented political energies, financial resources, and strategic thinking.
European governments are consumed by questions of deterrence, defense spending, and preparedness for the possibility of broader confrontation. In such an environment, the Middle East slides down the hierarchy of urgency.
This is not indifference. It is triage.
Still, for regional actors, the distinction may be academic.
Europe’s limited profile at the inauguration ceremony of Trump’s Board of Peace only amplified this perception.
Representation matters in international politics. Sending a low-key EU commissioner conveyed a message, intentional or not, about Europe’s relative investment in the initiative. For regional observers, symbolism accumulates. The narrative that emerges is one of cautious engagement bordering on disengagement.
Europe, as ever, appears primarily preoccupied with itself.
What does this diminished posture mean for Israel?
First, it demands realism.
The EU is unlikely to function as a decisive political broker in the current Middle Eastern landscape. Divergent member-state positions, institutional constraints, and competing priorities limit the Union’s capacity for unified strategic action. Israel cannot tie its security calculus to European diplomatic intervention.
Yet, dismissing Europe outright would be a strategic miscalculation.
The EU remains Israel’s largest trading partner, a relationship that anchors deep economic interdependence.
European markets, investment flows, and regulatory frameworks shape significant sectors of the Israeli economy.
Even more consequential is Europe’s role in supporting Israeli science and technology. Through research and innovation programs, European funding has contributed substantially to Israel’s academic and technological prowess. This cooperation reflects a longstanding European admiration for Israeli innovation, even amid persistent political tensions.
That contradiction is unlikely to disappear.
Europe will almost certainly emerge as one of the largest contributors to the reconstruction of Gaza once conditions permit large-scale rebuilding. Financial involvement has long been Europe’s preferred instrument of regional engagement.
However, economic participation does not necessarily translate into political alignment. European criticism of Israeli policies has become an unconcealed feature of the relationship, rooted in legal, humanitarian, and normative frameworks that Brussels considers central to its identity.
For Israel, therefore, the EU represents neither a reliable political ally nor an irrelevant actor. It is an indispensable economic partner coupled with a frequently adversarial diplomatic voice.
Navigating this complexity requires abandoning binary expectations.
Europe’s waning influence in the Middle East does not signal the end of its regional presence, but it does mark a transformation. The EU is recalibrating its external ambitions under the pressure of internal vulnerabilities and immediate security threats. Whether this recalibration proves temporary or structural remains an open question.
What is clear is that Europe’s long-cherished aspiration to act as a global player in the Middle East now faces its most severe test.
History shows that geopolitical vacuums rarely remain unfilled. If Europe retreats, others will step forward. The consequences of that shift will not be confined to the region. They will reverberate back toward a continent that once believed its future relevance depended on shaping distant peace.
Brussels may still wish to remain in the room. The question is whether it will matter.

Poland scrambles jets as Russia launches mass attack on Kyiv
Polish air defense systems put on high alert after Russia launched coordinated attack in Ukraine, one of the most significant escalations of cross-border hostilities since start of war nearly 4 years ago
WARSAW
Polish Air Force jets were scrambled and the country’s air defense systems went on high alert early Sunday after Russia launched a large-scale missile and drone assault on Kyiv and other parts of Ukraine, said the Polish Armed Forces Operational Command.
“On-duty fighter pairs and an early warning aircraft were scrambled, and ground-based air defense and radar reconnaissance systems reached the highest state of readiness,” the command wrote on X.
According to the statement, the move was preventive and aimed at ensuring the security of Polish airspace, particularly along the border with Ukraine, where Russian strikes have intensified in recent days.
Polish fighter jets and air defense units were poised to intervene if incoming threats approached or crossed into Poland. At no point was Polish airspace violated, the military stressed.
The operational command also expressed gratitude to NATO allies, including the Allied Air Command and the air forces of Germany and the Netherlands.
Ukrainian officials said the Russian military on Saturday night launched a coordinated attack involving multiple missiles and suicide drones on the capital Kyiv and other regions. The incident marks one of the most significant escalations of cross-border hostilities since the start of the Ukraine war on Feb. 24, 2022, four years ago this week.

BUDAPEST, February 22. /TASS/. Hungary will block any EU’s sanctions-related decisions against Russia until Ukraine resumes oil transit through the Druzhba pipeline, Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban said following an emergency meeting of the country's Energy Security Council.
"We decided that until supplies via the Druzhba pipeline are resumed, we will not support any [EU] sanctions policy. Consequently, we will also reject the 20th sanctions package submitted to the EU for consideration. If oil supplies are resumed, we will return to the previous conditions," he said in a video address broadcast by the M1 TV channel.
Earlier, Hungarian Minister of Foreign Affairs and Trade Peter Szijjarto said that Budapest would not support the approval of the 20th package of EU sanctions against Russia at the meeting of EU foreign ministers to be held in Brussels on February 23.
Orban also noted in the video address that the Ukrainian leadership's refusal to resume Russian oil transit could pose a "threat to Hungary's energy security." "Today, this threat has been averted, and we are ensuring the normal functioning of the country's economy," he stressed.
"At the same time, we have decided to take countermeasures and stop diesel fuel supplies from Hungary to Ukraine until oil supplies from Ukraine are resumed," Orban noted. Furthermore, in response to the suspension of transit via the Druzhba pipeline, Hungary has blocked the EU's 90 bln euros war loan to Ukraine.

LONDON
France said Sunday that it would summon the US ambassador to France, Charles Kushner, following comments from US officials about the killing of a French far-right activist.
"We are going to summon the United States ambassador to France, since the US Embassy in France commented on this tragedy ... which concerns the national community," Foreign Minister Jean-Noel Barrot told local media.
He added: "We reject any attempt to use this tragedy ... for political purposes."
The move comes after the death of Quentin Deranque, a French far-right activist who on Feb. 12 was beaten to death in a fight with alleged hard-left activists.
The US Embassy in Paris and the US State Department’s Counterterrorism Bureau said they were monitoring the case, with both warning on X that “violent radical leftism is on the rise” and should be treated as a public safety threat.

Over 100 Palestinians arrested by Israel in West Bank since start of Ramadan, rights group says
Arrests marked by severe beating, sabotage, Palestinian Prisoner Society says
RAMALLAH, Palestine
The Israeli army has detained more than 100 Palestinians across the occupied West Bank since the start of the Muslim holy month of Ramadan, a Palestinian rights group said Sunday.
Several women and children were among the detainees since Ramadan began on Feb. 18 in most provinces of the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, the Palestinian Prisoner Society said in a statement.
The arrests were marked by “severe beating, organized acts of terrorism against detainees and their families, along with widespread sabotage and destruction of citizens' homes, and confiscation of vehicles, money, and gold jewelry," the group added.
More than 9,300 Palestinians are currently held in Israeli prisons, including 350 children, and they face torture, starvation, and medical neglect that has led to the deaths of dozens, according to Palestinian and Israeli human rights organizations.
Israel has intensified operations in the occupied West Bank since launching its military campaign in Gaza on Oct. 8, 2023.
At least 1,117 Palestinians have been killed and around 11,500 others injured in attacks by the army and illegal settlers in the West Bank during that period.

Jean Pisani-Ferry: 'German commitment to rearmament is good news and a challenge for Europe'
France
Unknown Publisher

22:05:41 KST

At their June 2025 summit in The Hague, all NATO member states committed to raising their defense and security spending to 5% of their gross domestic product (GDP).
Germany is among those who have taken this commitment the most seriously. Even before the summit, the budget reform passed in March 2025 by the ruling coalition exempted defense spending beyond 1% of GDP from the Schuldenbremse, "debt brake" in German, while also creating a multi-year investment fund of €500 billion for infrastructure and climate initiatives. This marked a major shift for a country that had traditionally relied on the US to ensure its security.
The commitment is good news for Europe and the credibility of its defense efforts, even though France, Italy, and the United Kingdom are not on course to meet the target. Only Poland and the Baltic countries have reached that threshold. Germany has already begun to implement it: The International Monetary Fund (IMF) projected that the effects of this investment would be felt as soon as 2027, with growth at 1.5% after years of stagnation, and a public deficit at 4% of GDP. But the momentum now underway will inevitably trigger a series of imbalances, each representing a challenge for Europe.
France lagging behind
The first challenge is political. While Germany started from a lower baseline, the share of GDP it devotes to defense spending will soon surpass that of France. On February 13, at the Munich Security Conference, Chancellor Friedrich Merz reiterated his intention to make the German army the most powerful conventional force in Europe, while his foreign minister, Johann Wadephul, openly criticized the lack of ambition in France's military programming law. With little room for maneuver in its budget, France risks being relegated to a supporting role.
The second challenge is industrial. Traditionally, France and Germany had a fairly simple division of labor when it came to defense equipment: France produced aircraft, while Germany produced heavy tanks. Each government maintained a close relationship with its national suppliers, stifling competition and innovation. However, this division of tasks is now being called into question due to the increase in Germany's defense efforts.

New law puts Kansas at vanguard of denying trans identities on drivers licenses, birth certificates
Kansas is set to invalidate about 1,700 driver's licenses held by transgender residents and roughly as many of their birth certificates
- Bookmark
Kansas is set to invalidate about 1,700 driver’s licenses held by transgender residents and roughly as many birth certificates under a new law that goes beyond Republican-imposed restrictions in other states on listing gender identities in government documents.
The new law takes effect Thursday. Democratic Gov. Laura Kelly vetoed the measure but the Legislature's GOP supermajorities overrode it last week as Republican state lawmakers across the U.S. have pursued another round of measures to roll back transgender rights.
The bill prohibits documents from listing any sex other than the one assigned birth and invalidates any that reflect a conflicting gender identity. Florida, Tennessee and Texas also don't allow driver's licenses to reflect a trans person's gender identity, and at least eight states besides Kansas have policies that bar trans residents from changing their birth certificates.
But only Kansas' law requires reversing changes previously made for trans residents. Kansas officials expect to cancel about 1,700 driver's licenses and issue new birth certificates for up to 1,800 people.
“It tells me that Kansas Republicans are interested in being on the vanguard of the culture war and in a race to the bottom,” said Democratic state Rep. Abi Boatman, a transgender Air Force veteran appointed in January to fill a vacant Wichita seat.
Kansas' new law enjoyed nearly unanimous GOP support. It is the latest success in what has become an annual effort to further roll back transgender rights by Republicans in statehouses across the U.S., bolstered by policies and rhetoric from President Donald Trump's administration.
Trump and other Republicans attack research-backed conclusions that gender can change or be fluid as radical “gender ideology." GOP lawmakers in Kansas regularly describe transgender girls and women as male and as they say they're protecting women.
Like fellow Republicans, Kansas Senate Majority Leader Chase Blaisi said Trump’s reelection and other GOP victories in 2024 show that voters want “to return to common sense" on gender.
"When I go home, people believe there are just two sexes, male and female,” Blasi said. “It’s basic biology I learned in high school.”
Kelly supports transgender rights, but GOP lawmakers have overridden her vetoes three of the past four years. Kansas bans gender-affirming care for minors and bars transgender women and girls from female sports teams, kindergarten through college.
Transgender people can't use public restrooms, locker rooms or other single-sex facilities associated with their gender identities, though there was no enforcement mechanism until this year's law added tough new provisions.
Transgender people have said carrying IDs that misgender them opens them to intrusive questions, harassment and even violence when they show it to police, merchants, and others.
In 2023, Republicans halted changes in Kansas birth certificates and driver's licenses by enacting a measure ending the state's legal recognition of trans residents' gender identities. Though the law didn't mention either document, it legally defined male and female by a person's “biological reproductive system” at birth.
However, a lawsuit led to state court decisions that last year permitted driver's license changes to resume.
Legislators in at least seven other states are considering bills to prevent transgender people from changing one or both documents, according to a search using the bill-tracking software Plural.
But none would reverse past changes.
The extra step by Kansas legislators reinforces a message “that trans people aren’t welcome,” said Anthony Alvarez, a transgender University of Kansas student who works for a pro-LGBTQ rights group.
Kansas is likely to notify transgender residents by mail that their driver's licenses are no longer valid and they need to go to a local licensing office to get a new one, said Zachary Denney, spokesperson for the agency that issues them.
The Legislature hasn't earmarked funds to cover the cost, so each person will pay it — $26 for a standard license.
Alvarez already has had four IDs in four years as he's changed his name, changed his gender marker and turned 21.
He's always planned to stay in his native Kansas after getting his history degree this spring.
But, he said, “They’re just making it harder and harder for me to live in the state that I love.”

The minister called Ukraine's decision not to resume Russian oil supplies via the Druzhba pipeline clear political blackmail, adding that Ukraine will not succeed in undermining Hungary's energy security.

DOHA, February 22. /TASS/. Iran did not discuss the issue of removing highly enriched uranium stockpiles from the republic during indirect talks with the United States, Al Jazeera reported, citing an Iranian official.
"Our nuclear obligations, as well as Washington's commitment to lifting sanctions and economic cooperation, are being discussed during the talks," the TV channel quoted the official as saying. "The issue of removing Iran’s highly enriched uranium stockpiles was not discussed during the talks," he noted.
At the same time, the source denied rumors about possible Iran’s concessions in the oil and gas sector. "Talk about handing over mines and oil fields to Washington is illogical and not on the agenda," he stressed.

How daily routines in Minneapolis and St Paul have changed amid 3,000 federal immigration agents – in pictures
Unknown

In St Paul, Minnesota, Brittany Kubricky pulled into a school parking lot. Normally, she was there just to pick up her daughter. But today, two of her daughter’s schoolmates also climbed into the backseat. Their mother had been sheltering at home for weeks, afraid of a run-in with federal immigration agents. So friends coordinated school pickup for her.
In December, the Trump administration launched Operation Metro Surge, deploying a reported 3,000 agents to Minnesota to target undocumented immigrants with criminal records, officials said. But in two months, agents have instead detained thousands of people, regardless of legal status, including US citizens pulled out of their cars, taken from their homes and picked up while working. Agents have also killed two Minneapolis residents – and US citizens – Renee Good and Alex Pretti, while they were monitoring Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) activities.
Federal agents’ presence, and their often abrupt and aggressive handling of residents, has left the Twin Cities on edge. Protests have become part of the metro area’s daily rhythm. So have community networks patrolling and documenting agents’ interactions with neighbors. Many people have been sheltering at home, fearful of being detained over the color of their skin. Daily lives have been interrupted: fewer errands, fewer social visits, fewer routines that once felt ordinary and a greater dependence on their neighbors.
“People are scared to work,” Kubricky said, “or even if they are going to work, people are missing from the household that were contributing to the household income.”
Community networks, created in response, have become a lifeline. On Kubricky’s dining room table lay a college-ruled notebook with pages of dollar amounts, phone numbers and notes about families and what they need. Beneath the television, boxes of canned food and household supplies waited to be delivered through a network largely made up of strangers and social media connections.
Kubricky has also raised more than $40,000 over the past several months, distributing the money to families in her community, largely for rental assistance and basic needs.
“I haven’t really ever done something like this before,” Kubricky said. “This is just something I tried, and it happens to be working.”
In the Twin Cities, businesses have struggled or closed. Many that remain open, like Mexican restaurant Oro by Nixta in Minneapolis, leave their front doors locked, letting in customers one by one by an employee.
On Lake Street in south Minneapolis, a five-mile stretch that hosts many immigrant-owned businesses, the effects are visible in storefront windows. Taqueria Los Ocampo has a note on the door that reads: “Due to current conditions in the Twin Cities, we will be temporarily closed until further notice. This decision was made with safety in mind.”
The Lake Street Council estimates a $46m loss for December and January for the corridor’s 1,000 immigrant-owned businesses. This number reflects not just missed sales and altered routines for families avoiding shopping trips, but also lost wages for workers.
Panaderia San Miguel, a bakery known for its sweet breads that’s been in the neighborhood for more than 15 years, closed for three weeks in January out of concern for its employees’ safety. When the bakery reopened, daily operations looked different. They now do deliveries and arrange rides for their employees. One of the owners is always there, said Vanessa Rubio, whose family owns the bakery.
The presence of community watch groups, paired with customers’ requests, played a major role in the bakery’s decision to reopen. “There was a need for our bread,” Rubio said.
The changes are visible in quieter ways at Hmong Village, a large indoor market serving south-east Asian communities from across Minnesota and neighboring states. Lee Vang, a produce vendor who rents multiple stalls, said sales have dropped sharply. Vendors still arrive, arranging their stalls, but customers are fewer. Joe Chanthhee, a customer who stopped for lunch, said his relatives in southe-astern Minnesota have stopped making their regular weekend trips to the market altogether.
On a cold January morning at Bethel church in south Minneapolis, volunteers with Community Aid Network MN unloaded vehicles packed with supplies. A U-Haul, a box truck, hatchbacks and sedans lined the curb, overflowing with donations. Volunteers with whistles dangling from their necks, ready to alert neighbors if they saw immigration agents nearby, lifted boxes. They pushed carts through the parking lot, where snow and ice were compacted by shoes and tires, onto a shoveled sidewalk edged with slight banks of snow, to get donations indoors to sort. Inside, boxes of diapers were stacked to the ceiling.
In the last week of January, Community Aid Network MN served an estimated 575 families with food and household goods, nearly double its November numbers. Tom Kachelmacher, a co-founder who works full-time as an event planner, has taken paid time off to keep up. His weekly volunteer hours jumped from about 10 in November to more than 30.
Meanwhile, community members have jumped in to help. By early February, the organization announced a two-week pause on donations after reaching capacity. Volunteer slots are filled through April.
For many families, mutual aid has become part of their weekly routine.
Z, who asked to be identified only by her first initial for her safety, has been sheltering at home for about a month. Friends drop off groceries and, occasionally, art supplies, and days are spent indoors. She finds herself scrolling on social media. “All you see online are protests,” she said. “I can’t go out and protest, but I feel the anger. I’m like, what can I do?”
She’s been able to keep her job, which has been vital in financially supporting her family and connecting them with resources. Some family members have lost jobs, one was deported, and many continue to shelter in place.
Respite comes in small doses. “I love watching YouTube videos to decompress,” Z said. “Just watching somebody else have a normal day.”

How to make proper rice pudding – recipe | Felicity Cloake's Masterclass

There are almost as many rice puddings as there are savoury rice recipes. If you were also put off by that dazzlingly white, school dinner gloop, fear not, this is a much more luxuriant baked dessert, gently spiced and finished with sweet wine and cream. It can be enjoyed warm or cool, on its own or with a spoonful of jarred fruit or some vivid pink spring rhubarb.
Prep 5 min
Cook 2 hr 10 min
Serves 4
50g butter, plus extra for greasing
50g soft light brown sugar
100g pudding rice
1 litre whole milk (see step 4)
1 unwaxed lemon
¼ tsp freshly grated nutmeg
¼ tsp ground cinnamon, or a small length of cinnamon stick
1 bay leaf
½ vanilla pod, or 1 tsp vanilla extract
1 pinch salt
2 tbsp sweet fortified wine –eg pedro ximenéz or cream sherry, madeira, tawny port (optional)
150ml double cream
1 A note on the cooking vessel
Heat the oven to 160C (140C fan)/325F/gas 3. Find a wide baking dish or ovenproof pot large enough to hold about 1.2 litres of liquid (if in doubt, fill the dish with water, then tip into a measuring jug). Butter or grease the dish lightly.
2 Melt the butter and sugar
Put the butter (or dairy-free alternative) in a medium saucepan on a gentle heat and add the sugar (this isn’t a very sweet rice pudding, because I like to serve it with fruit or jam, but feel free to increase the amount, or swap in white sugar, or four tablespoons of honey, golden syrup or another sweetener, if you prefer). Stir to dissolve.
3 Add the rice
Tip in the rice (pudding rice is just a starchy short-grain rice that’s usually found in the vicinity of tinned rice pudding, custard and so on at the supermarket, but if you can’t find it, you can use risotto or paella rice instead, though it’ll probably be more expensive) and stir to coat with the butter and sugar.
4 Pour in the milk
Keep stirring until the rice turns semi-translucent (but has not taken on any colour) and has started to swell slightly. Add the milk (almond milk also works well here – indeed, medieval rice puddings were often made with it on fast days; soy or coconut milk also works). Scrape the bottom of the pan to dislodge any stuck grains.
5 Add the flavourings
Finely grate in half the lemon zest, leaving behind the white pith; if you can’t find an unwaxed lemon (organic fruit is never waxed), give it a good scrub with hot water first. Stir in the nutmeg, cinnamon and bay leaf, then slit the vanilla pod down its length and scrape out the seeds into the pan; drop in the empty pod, too.
6 Bake the rice pudding
Bring the milk to a very gentle simmer, then add a pinch of salt and the wine, if using. Turn off the heat and stir in the cream. Pour the rice pudding mix into the greased dish and bake for about two hours, until set but still slightly wobbly; check on it regularly towards the end of the cooking time.
7 Serving suggestions
Remove and leave to cool for at least 15 minutes before serving – like most dairy-rich dishes, rice pudding is best enjoyed warm or at room temperature, rather than hot from the oven, when the flavour will be muted. Serve with seasonal fruit (right now, baked rhubarb is perfect, as is sliced citrus), jam, jarred or tinned fruit, or compote.
8 Variations on the theme
Think of this recipe as a template that you can vary according to taste. Swap the spices for ginger, saffron, cardamom, say, and the vanilla for flower waters, the lemon zest for orange or lime, the wine for rum or whisky, add dried fruit, crystallised ginger or citrus peel, nuts or cocoa nibs … You can’t go far wrong.
9 And if you want rhubarb …
To bake rhubarb at the same time, cut 500g into chunks of an even length, trimming off any brown ends, then wash. Arrange in a single layer in the base of an oven dish and sprinkle over two tablespoons of sugar or honey, plus a splash of water. Cover and bake for 35-45 minutes, until tender but not mushy.

Worst of the worst? Most US immigrants targeted for deportation in 2025 had no criminal charges, documents reveal
Unknown

22:00:37 KST

A Guardian analysis of government records has found that the vast majority – 77% – of people who entered deportation proceedings for the first time in 2025 had no criminal conviction, exposing a stark gap between the Trump administration’s rhetoric and reality.
Within days of Donald Trump’s inauguration, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) trotted out a phrase that his surrogates would come to use over and over again: “the worst of the worst.”
The term has become a shorthand justification for the administration’s unprecedented overhaul of immigration enforcement – a relentless campaign the administration claims is focused on arresting and deporting violent criminals.
However, a review of records obtained by the Guardian and the Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press, through a Freedom of Information Act lawsuit filed against DHS, raises questions about those claims.
The findings come from little-known documents known as I-213 forms. DHS uses these forms in court to prove that a person is in the country illegally. The documents are filed when a person first encounters ICE, and DHS begins the deportation process, which is often when they are arrested. The documents contain biographical details about the person, including their criminal history, as well as any information that DHS feels is relevant to the immigration court case.
The documents released to the Guardian do not cover every arrest since Trump took office, but do cover everyone that DHS started deportation proceedings during most of 2025.
The Guardian analyzed data extracted from nearly 140,000 I-213 forms, from January 2025 through mid-August 2025, and found that the surge in arrests under Trump is driven by the apprehension of people who have never been convicted of a crime.
The analysis also reveals:
-
Fewer than half of the people in the data (40%) had any criminal charge against them, and only 23% had a conviction.
-
Of those who did have a criminal conviction, nearly half were for non-violent traffic and immigration offenses.
-
Traffic offenses alone made up nearly 30% of the convictions, the largest category by far.
-
Some 9% of criminal convictions were for assault, while only 1% were for sexual assault and just 0.5% were for homicide.
The findings offer one of the most granular pictures yet of the criminal records of the tens of thousands of people swept up in DHS’s massive deportation campaign, building on reporting by the Guardian and others that show most of the people targeted for arrest and deportation are not violent criminals.
The expansion of immigration enforcement to broad, sweeping arrests, experts say, has led to a massive expansion of immigration detention, with the highest number of people held in US history.
“What is being conducted is dragnet enforcement with the goal of ensnaring as many people as possible in the detention and deportation process, despite all the public claims of the administration that they’re going up for the worst,” said Phil Neff, research coordinator with the University of Washington Center for Human Rights.
The documents reveal a different picture, Neff said. “It really represents a cross-section of society at large in the United States, of people who have been here for many years and who have close ties to communities.”
The Guardian reached out to DHS and Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) for comment on the findings but did not receive a response before publication.
‘Worst of the worst’
DHS secretary Kristi Noem first used the phrase “worst of the worst” shortly after being confirmed by the Senate in January 2025, telling Sean Hannity that DHS was “picking up the worst of the worst in this country”. By the end of 2025, it was the administration’s go-to line, appearing in hundreds of press releases about its mass deportation efforts. DHS even launched a “worst of the worst” website complete with people’s blurry mugshots and the crimes DHS says they’ve been convicted of.
But the I-213 forms, also known as “Record of Deportable/Inadmissible Alien” forms, undercut those arguments.
The forms are one of the first things filled out after the government initiates deportation proceedings, said Chris Opila, staff attorney for transparency at the American Immigration Council, and are the key piece of evidence the government uses to prove that a person is eligible for deportation.
“It’s the record that ICE will produce in immigration court to substantiate its claims that this person is present in the United States unlawfully,” Opila said.
There are groups of people not included in the data release, such as immigrants who had deportation proceedings initiated before 2025 but who were arrested in 2025. The Guardian compared the data in the I-213 form release to other datasets released by ICE and found that it covers approximately 80% of the total arrests in 2025 covered in other datasets.
The documents do, however, include every person whom ICE apprehended for the first time in 2025 and show clearly whom the administration targeted during Trump’s second term in office.
The Guardian, working with the Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press, sued DHS and received spreadsheets with data extracted from I-213 forms.
Each form represents a person that the administration is trying to deport. The data contains details of more than 138,000 people swept up in the administration’s deportation pipeline in 2025. Each form contains a person’s name, how they entered the country, the number of children and each child’s citizenship, and detailed information about their criminal history. It is some of the most detailed data yet available on the people that the administration is trying to remove from the country.
The forms have each person’s criminal history, taken from the National Crime Information Center, an FBI database that tracks criminal justice data. The charges are tracked in broad categories, such as “sexual assault” and “immigration”, and sometimes less useful categories such as “general crimes”.
The Trump administration has apprehended people with criminal convictions, but the I-213 forms show that most convictions are for either traffic or immigration offenses, not violent crimes.
A Guardian analysis of the crimes people were convicted of found that only 1% of convictions were for sexual assault and only 400 – less than 1% of all convictions – were for homicide.
“This is not about removing the worst of the worst,” Opila said. “Enforcement is about removing whoever they can to feed a quota, regardless of how long these people have been in their communities, regardless of whether they have stable employment, regardless of what their family situation is in the United States. They’ve decided that they need to remove everyone possible.”
“If there was data that supported the administration’s position that it is only deporting the worst of the worst, the administration would publicize the data,” Opila added. “And they’re not doing that because the data doesn’t support it. We’d have something better than the memes.”

Russian missile barrage hits energy, railways across Ukraine
Russia fired scores of missiles and drones at targets across Ukraine on Sunday, crashing into energy and rail infrastructure and residential buildings, just two days before the fourth anniversary of Russia's invasion.
AFP journalists in Kyiv heard a series of blasts starting at around 4:00 am (0200 GMT), shortly after an air raid alert was issued, with the air force later widening the alert nationwide citing the threat of missiles.
"Moscow continues to invest in strikes more than in diplomacy," Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky commented on the attack on social media, saying that Russia launched about 50 missiles and 300 drones overnight.
"The main target of the attack was the energy sector. Ordinary residential buildings were also damaged, and there is damage to the railway."
One man was killed and a dozen more people were wounded, among them four children, in and around Kyiv, Ukraine's national police said.
AFP saw rescuers sifting through debris of a largely destroyed two-storey house in Sofiivska Borshchagivka in the Kyiv region.
Temperatures had plunged to nearly -10C when the capital was struck, with emergency services deployed across the city.
The Ukrainian capital, regularly targeted by Russian missile and drone attacks since the start of the invasion on 24 February 2022, has faced waves of overnight strikes in recent weeks as Moscow has intensified its winter assaults.
The Russian army said it had carried out a mass strike targeting facilities used by Ukraine's military, saying all targets were hit, in a standard comment for such attacks.
Authorities in Russia's western Belgorod region said one man died after a Ukrainian drone strike.
'Act of terrorism'
The bombardment, which included ballistic and cruise missiles, prompted heightened vigilance across Ukraine, all the way to the western border.
Ukraine's energy ministry said consumers in six eastern and southeastern region were without power after the strikes.
Poland's Operational Command said early Sunday it was scrambling jets after detecting "long-range aviation of the Russian Federation conducting strikes on the territory of Ukraine".
In a separate attack, an explosion rocked a store in central Lviv, a western city near the Polish border far from the front line that is largely spared the worst of the conflict.
Explosions ripped through a central shopping street at around midnight, killing a policewoman and wounding 25 people after officers responded to a reported break-in.
Hours later, law enforcement said it had detained a Ukrainian woman suspected in carrying out the bomb attack, without providing any further details and saying that an investigation was ongoing.
"This is clearly an act of terrorism," mayor Andriy Sadovyi said of the nighttime assault.
Ukraine 'not losing'
Ukraine will mark four years since Russia's assault on 24 February 2022, a war that has shattered towns, uprooted millions and killed large numbers on both sides.
Moscow occupies close to a fifth of Ukrainian territory and continues to grind forward, especially in the eastern Donbas region, despite heavy losses and repeated Ukrainian strikes on logistics.
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky told AFP on Friday that Ukraine was "definitely not losing" the war and that victory remained the goal.
He said Ukrainian forces had clawed back about 300 square kilometres (116 square miles) of territory in recent counter-attacks, gains AFP could not immediately verify.
If confirmed, they would be Kyiv's most significant advances since 2023.
The United States is pushing both sides to end the war, brokering several rounds of talks in recent weeks without a clear breakthrough.

Sudan decries Uganda hosting RSF commander as 'blatant disregard of genocide crimes'

Sudan called Uganda's reception of the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) commander, Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo, “a blatant disregard for the crimes of genocide.”
Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni met with Dagalo on Sunday at the presidential palace in Entebbe.
This reception “is an unprecedented step that contradicts Uganda's commitments to good neighborliness, at a time when innocent lives are being lost," the Sudanese Foreign Ministry said in a statement.
“Atrocities committed by the terrorist militia (RSF) have been documented by the international community and condemned by regional organisations to which Uganda belongs, such as the African Union," it added.
The ministry condemned Dagalo’s reception in Uganda as “a step that disregards the most basic human values and ignores the scale of the crimes committed against Sudanese citizens.”
“It also violates the laws governing relations between member states of regional and international organisations and constitutes support for rebel forces against a legitimate, internationally recognised government."
Kampala accused of backing rebels
While respecting Uganda’s right to “receive whomever it wishes” and have bilateral relations with, the ministry said the move “reflects a new policy of the Ugandan government towards Sudan, supporting the rebels and acting against the unity, security, and safety of the Sudanese people."
This step "is direct support for the genocidal crimes committed by the rebels against civilians, which have been documented by independent international organisations," it stressed.
“The Sudanese government will not allow its territory or the territory of neighboring countries to be used to support rebel forces against the state," the ministry said.
There was no immediate comment from Uganda on the Sudanese statement.
Dagalo’s visit to Uganda marked his first appearance since September, when he toured Nyala, the capital of South Darfur in western Sudan.
Sudan has been locked in a bloody conflict between the army and the paramilitary RSF since April 2023, killing tens of thousands, displacing about 13 million people, and creating one of the world’s worst humanitarian crises, according to UN reports.

Opinion
Why cost-of-living woes will probably linger for years
No one likes going backwards financially, and last week Treasurer Jim Chalmers received some pretty grim news on this front.
A two-year period in which wages rose more quickly than inflation came to an end in December, when the annual pace of wage growth was 3.4 per cent, below the inflation rate of 3.8 per cent.
While Chalmers pointed out wage growth has been above 3 per cent for more than three years, any decline in “real”, or inflation-adjusted, wages is unwelcome news for a government. Especially a Labor government that’s vowed to fight the cost-of-living crisis with stronger pay rises.
Even so, the economy is a complex beast that is hard to sum up with a few simple figures, and when you look more closely at how household incomes are faring, the truth is more complicated than “we’re all going backwards”.
For example, Reserve Bank governor Michele Bullock also told a parliamentary hearing this month that broader measures of household income – which take into account more than just wages – tell a more positive story about how real incomes have grown since COVID-19.
“We’re looking at a measure of what people are actually being paid. It’s not shooting the lights out either, but it is above where it was pre-COVID,” she said.
Or, if you look at how many customers are falling behind on their home loans, things have been getting better, not worse. Indeed, the main surprise in the latest round of bank profits was the very low number of borrowers unable to repay their loans.
So, how is it possible to get such different impressions about the cost-of-living crisis? Are all workers’ incomes really going backwards after inflation, as those wage figures suggest? Or are things not quite so bad?
One reason for the conflicting narratives on the cost of living is technical: it depends what you’re measuring. There’s a huge range of data and statistics on the economy, and each can tell a different story. Even something you’d think would be simple, such as household incomes, can be measured in various ways.
Last week’s wage price index, for example, is not necessarily a great picture of most people’s income over time. The index tracks hourly pay across a “basket” of jobs, but doesn’t measure what happens when someone gets a pay rise from being promoted, or how their pay changes when they move to a new employer. Given that most of us do change jobs or roles over the years, that’s a significant gap.
Without getting too far into the minutiae, the RBA also looks at a different, broader, measure with the clunky name of average earnings from the national accounts (AENA). It includes bonuses, overtime and pay rises from promotions, and the RBA says it’s a “more complete measure” of labour earnings in the economy.
This broader measure has been higher than the wage price index that was released last week – though it’s also more volatile. AMP economists say AENA is up 42 per cent since December, which is more than twice as much as the increase in wages over that time.
This suggests the reality for many households is not quite as bad as the recent decline in real wages would have you believe.
Over the longer term, however, there’s no getting around the fact that real wage growth has not been a strong point for the Australian economy over the past 15 years or so.
Wage growth was miserable for much of the 2010s, and then the surge in post-COVID inflation landed a major blow to our spending power, from which we are still recovering.
AMP deputy chief economist Diana Mousina says inflation has risen by 23 per cent since the end of 2020, while wages have risen less than that, at 18 per cent.
While the media will always make a big deal about quarterly movements in the consumer price index and the wage price index, this longer-term hit from inflation probably matters more to our everyday sense of the cost of living. That’s because most of us aren’t thinking about the latest inflation numbers when we’re at the shops, but we do notice that things at the supermarket are a lot more expensive than they were five years ago.
What’s more, Mousina says it could take years more for wages to catch up to inflation and make up for that hit, so “concerns about cost of living are unlikely to go away”.
What can we do about it?
The RBA is using interest rates to try to get inflation back in its range, which in a roundabout way would eventually help with “real” wages by lowering the pace of price rises.
But it’s far from ideal. The RBA’s weapon, higher interest rates, is blunt (it slows the whole economy) and somewhat arbitrary: it hurts people who have borrowed to buy a home, especially more recent buyers, while sparing others.
The more important long-term objective is what every business type and economist is on about, and that’s improving our poor productivity performance. This sounds dry, but it has a direct link to inflation and the ability of workers to get sustainable wage rises.
Why is productivity so closely linked to wages and inflation? Basically, if a business can get its workers producing more output per hour, it should be more able to give them a pay rise without needing to raise its prices as much to cover the higher wages bill. If many businesses can do that (give out pay rises, without raising prices as much as they would otherwise), that helps “real” wage growth.
It’s the secret sauce of capitalism, and the reason material standards of living have risen over time.
None of this makes improving productivity easy – but it’s why so many people are demanding Chalmers take action in this year’s federal budget.

Last A-10 to Leave Depot, Maintenance Squadron to Deactivate
Unknown

22:00:00 KST

The Air Force will send off its final A-10 Thunderbolt II from depot maintenance this month and deactivate the unit that performs overhauls, upgrades, and rebuilds on the venerable close air support jet.
Closing the depot signals another step in the Air Force’s push to retire the A-10 and could mean future major repairs to particular aircraft go unresolved and hasten the end of their service lives. The fleet’s retirement has been the subject of back-and-forth demands between the Air Force and Congress for more than a decade.
The announcement came Feb. 18 from the 75th Air Base Wing at Hill Air Force Base, Utah, where the Ogden Air Logistics Complex is housed. The 571st Aircraft Maintenance Squadron will be deactivated and its personnel reassigned to sustainment lines for the F-35, F-16, and C-130 at the facility, according to the release.
“This mission has been a point of pride for the entire complex,” Brig. Gen. Hall Sebren, Ogden Air Logistics Complex commander, said in the release. “The A‑10 came to Hill because of the skill and dedication of our workforce, and it stayed here because that expertise only grew stronger with time. Our maintainers extended the life of this aircraft again and again, and they did it with a level of pride and professionalism that has become part of Hill’s identity.”
The 75th Air Base Wing did not immediately respond to an Air & Space Forces Magazine query.
While the A-10’s main depot is closing down, the jet itself remains in service—and is actually particularly busy at the moment. This month, the Pentagon released images showing an A-10 providing close air support and security for the USS Santa Barbara (LCS 32) during a training exercise in the Arabian Gulf. The aircraft can be used to counter threats such as small boat swarms that threaten ships in the area.
And as of this week, multiple media outlets have tracked A-10s maneuvering in the Middle East amid heightened tensions with Iran.
It’s not the first time the A-10 has made its presence known in the Middle East. Since entering service in the 1970s, the aircraft has played a key role in conflicts from Desert Storm to the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan and Operation Inherent Resolve. It is beloved by ground troops for its close air support, including its 30mm GAU-8/A Gatling gun capable of defeating enemy armor.
Despite this, the aircraft has been a frequent target for retirement and divestment by the Air Force for more than a decade. Leaders have argued that the aging platform is not survivable on the modern battlefield and its mission can be covered by other aircraft, such as the F-35. The Air Force first requested the aircraft’s retirement in 2014 and has continued to make annual requests since.
However, Congress has fought the service’s efforts to shed the aircraft, only allowing the retirement of a select number beginning in the fiscal 2023 budget and preventing a wholesale divestment in the most recent budget. Lawmakers have noted the aircraft’s use in recent wars and the lack of a dedicated close air support aircraft to replace the A-10 in the service’s plans.
The back-and-forth over divestment has impacted the A-10’s depot before. Initial budget plans in fiscal 2014 and 2015 called for the A-10’s depot maintenance fund to be cut by $15.5 and $58 million, respectively. But in October 2016, then-Air Force Materiel Command chief Gen. Ellen Pawlikowski told Aviation Week that depot maintenance for the A-10 had been “fully reopened” to rebuild capacity and meet supply chain requirements.
A similar pattern may be playing out now. In its fiscal 2026 budget request, the service announced plans to retire its remaining 162 A-10s two years ahead of its previous timeline. Budget documents show a corresponding cut in depot maintenance the service cut depot maintenance funding from $124.5 million in fiscal 2024 to $60.8 million in fiscal 2025, then nothing for fiscal 2026.
But Congress has again pushed back and, in December, halted plans to retire 102 of those aircraft, Air & Space Forces Magazine previously reported.
Without a depot or dedicated funding for depot-level maintenance, those 102 aircraft may face availability issues over time. A 2018 Congressional Budget Office report noted that A-10s follow a “risk-based” schedule for receiving depot maintenance, going in every 1,500 to 3,000 flying hours.
As the Air Force has gone through its long goodbye with the A-10, flying units have converted to a variety of other missions.
Moody Air Force Base, Ga., is replacing its A-10s with F-35s. The Idaho Air National Guard’s 124th Fighter Wing and the Indiana ANG’s 122nd Fighter Wing are getting F-16s.
Selfridge Air Bational Guard Base, Mich., announced in 2025 that it would begin replacing its A-10s with F-15EX Eagle IIs in fiscal 2028.
The Ohio Guard’s 179th Airlift Wing converted to the 179th Cyberspace Wing in 2023, and Maryland ANG’s 175th Wing began converting to a cyber wing in 2025; it was already home to the 175th Cyberspace Operations Group.

Zelensky orders additional forces to protect skies over Sumy region
He said this in a post on Telegram, Ukrinform reports.
"I held a coordination call on the situation in the regions following Russia's overnight missile and drone attack. There were nearly 50 missiles, including 22 ballistic ones, as well as 297 drones of various types. A significant portion was shot down, and I thank all of Ukraine's partners who work with us every day, every week to supply air defense missiles. Protection is needed every day. This time, Russian targets included not only energy facilities, but also logistics, in particular railway and municipal water supply infrastructure. We discussed in detail with regional representatives that protection against Russian strikes must be scaled up while promptly taking into account changes in Russian tactics," Zelensky wrote.
He noted that in the Boryspil district, Kyiv region, a church was damaged in the attack, and civilian homes were damaged in other regions.
Zelensky also ordered the deployment of additional forces to protect the skies over the Sumy region.
"The day before, in the Shostka district, a Russian drone struck an ambulance vehicle – it was a deliberate attack. Tragically, three people were killed. Russians must feel the consequences for every such strike, and all border and frontline regions must feel that protection against Russian drones is increasing," he added.
He also received a briefing from the interior minister on the investigation into the Lviv terrorist attack. "Not everything can be disclosed publicly right now. Several individuals have been detained, and all facts will be established within the necessary procedural framework. Law enforcement officials will provide more information to the public later," he said.

BUDAPEST – Hungary will block the European Union’s latest package of sanctions against Russia unless Ukraine reopens a key oil pipeline that supplies the country, Hungary’s prime minister and foreign minister both said on Feb 22.
“No support for sanctions; the 20th sanctions package will be rejected,” Prime Minister Viktor Orban posted on social media platform X.
“Until Ukraine resumes oil transit to Hungary and Slovakia via the Druzhba pipeline, we will not allow decisions important to Kyiv to move forward,” Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto posted, also on X.
This threat came a day after Mr Orban threatened to veto
Ukraine says the Druzhba pipeline that crosses its territory to deliver Russian oil to Slovakia and Hungary was damaged on Jan 27 by Russian strikes.
The EU in early February proposed new sanctions against Russia, targeting the banking and energy sectors, its 20th package since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine
The European Commission also intends to activate its anti-coercion tool, for the first time, to ban the export of all machine tools and radio equipment to countries where there is a high risk that these products will be re-exported to Russia.
All the EU’s 27 member states must give their approval before the new sanctions can take effect. AFP

Indonesian forces evacuate workers following deadly attack at gold mine
75 workers, including 26 Chinese nationals, evacuated from restive Central Papua province
ISTANBUL
Indonesian security forces on Sunday continued evacuating workers, including 26 Chinese nationals, from a gold mining site in the Central Papua province following an armed assault that killed two people, local media reported.
The evacuations began after attackers from the armed group known as KKB launched an assault Saturday at the remote mining site, Indonesia’s Antara News Agency reported.
Samuel Tatiratu, adjunct senior commissioner to the Nabire police chief, said 75 people had been evacuated along the Musairo River as of Sunday. Authorities are still working to identify one of the bodies, he said.
The attack follows another incident earlier this month in which KKB militants shot down a small aircraft and killed its pilot and co-pilot.
Central Papua is part of Indonesia’s restive easternmost region, where a separatist insurgency has persisted for decades, with armed groups targeting security forces and civilians.

Supreme Court rejects Braverman's appeal, keeps travel ban in place over ‘midnight meeting’ probe
Unknown
Unknown Publisher
2026-02-22
12:54:37 UTC
21:54:37 KST

Supreme Court Justice David Mintz on Sunday rejected a request by Prime Minister’s Office chief of staff Tzachi Braverman for leave to appeal a district court ruling that reinstated restrictive conditions against him in the so-called “midnight meeting” affair, including a ban on leaving Israel, keeping the restrictions in place through Tuesday.
Braverman had asked the Supreme Court to intervene after the Lod District Court overturned an earlier magistrate’s decision that had lifted the travel ban and narrowed limits on his contacts, arguing that the continued restrictions were unnecessary and disproportionately harmed both his diplomatic appointment as Israel’s next ambassador to the United Kingdom and the country’s foreign relations more broadly.
According to his appeal, the case raises unresolved legal questions about whether courts weighing pre-trial release conditions may consider broader public interests - including potential harm to Israel’s diplomatic standing - alongside the needs of an ongoing investigation.
Mintz declined to rule on that broader question, saying the case did not justify Supreme Court intervention at this stage. Leave to appeal in matters involving pre-trial restrictions is typically granted only in rare cases that raise a significant legal issue of public importance, he noted - a threshold this case did not meet.
He added that the restrictions imposed on Braverman were due to expire within days, making the case a poor fit for setting precedent on how much discretion judges have in weighing such conditions.
Even assuming, for argument’s sake, that diplomatic considerations could be relevant in such proceedings, Mintz wrote, it was difficult to see how a brief extension of the travel ban would meaningfully harm Israel’s foreign relations in a way that would justify overturning the district court’s balancing between investigative needs and Braverman’s personal interests.
Court upholds Braverman’s restrictions amid probe into leak
The decision leaves in force the set of restrictions reinstated by the district court, which bar Braverman from leaving Israel, restrict his contact with individuals connected to the probe - including Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu - and prevent him from entering certain sensitive workplaces, including the Prime Minister’s Office compound and the Kirya military headquarters.
Investigators suspect Braverman of transmitting official information by a public servant, obstructing justice, and fraud and breach of trust in connection with a broader investigation into the leak of classified military intelligence to the German newspaper Bild during wartime.
The underlying probe centers on the unauthorized transfer in September 2024 of sensitive intelligence materials relating to Hamas’s internal assessment of hostage negotiations and Israeli public pressure for a deal - documents that were published abroad after failing to receive military censor approval and which investigators believe may have been leaked in an effort to shape domestic opinion on the continuation of military pressure in Gaza.
Former Prime Minister’s Office spokesman Eli Feldstein was later charged in connection with the possession and dissemination of the materials, which prosecutors allege could have caused serious harm to state security and to wartime efforts to secure the release of hostages.
According to investigative material cited in the court proceedings, Braverman is suspected of having learned in October 2024 that security authorities had opened a probe into the leak and subsequently summoning Feldstein to a late-night meeting at the Kirya, where he allegedly showed him the names of individuals believed to be under investigation and asked whether the matter was “connected to us,” adding that if it involved the Prime Minister’s Office he could “turn it off.”
The Bild leak itself forms part of a wider investigation into the unauthorized transfer of sensitive security materials abroad during wartime that has intersected with what has become known as the “Qatargate” affair, examining alleged improper channels and foreign influence surrounding hostage diplomacy after October 7.
That parallel probe has focused on suspicions that senior advisers to Netanyahu - including Feldstein and close associates Yonatan Urich and Israel “Srulik” Einhorn - received payments tied to Qatari interests in order to promote a favorable public narrative about Doha’s role in mediation efforts following the Hamas attacks, despite the Gulf state’s longstanding ties to the terror group.
In rejecting the appeal, Mintz also addressed Braverman’s contention that a travel ban requires concrete evidence of an intent to flee the country, reiterating that under existing Supreme Court case law such a restriction may also be imposed where there is a substantive concern that a suspect’s presence abroad could obstruct an ongoing investigation.
The district court, he noted, had already determined on the basis of the investigative material before it that the case presented a significant risk of obstruction, justifying the reinstatement of the full slate of conditions.

Tech Talk: Deel puts $15m. behind YC-style global start-up competition, launching in Tel Aviv

The barriers to launching a company have never been lower. Cloud infrastructure is cheaper, development cycles are faster, and technical expertise, once limited to a select few, is now accessible to anyone with an internet connection. Yet, this accessibility has created a new bottleneck.
As it becomes easier to launch, more startups are competing for the same attention and capital. In that race, founders with elite networks and proximity to major hubs are often seen first, keeping startups invisible, sidelined before they even have a chance to enter the market.
Nowhere is this dynamic more apparent than in AI. Between February and May 2025, VCs poured more than $69 billion into North American AI and machine learning startups, compared with $6.4 billion in European AI ventures and $3 billion in Asia.
Even Israel, a smaller market competing with entire continents, raised approximately $15.6 billion in 2025, with a significant portion of the investments focused on AI. In a field defined by global talent, capital remains concentrated in familiar geographies and circles.
As a result, even startups that solve some of the world’s most complex problems aren’t rewarded the same opportunities simply because they aren’t based in the world’s innovation hubs. In response to this visibility gap, Deel has launched “The Pitch,” a global startup competition designed to identify, promote, and invest in leading Seed-stage founders worldwide.
The program includes an investment pool of more than $15 million and is expected to attract more than 20,000 startups across seven countries. At the global finale in Abu Dhabi in May, Deel says up to 10 ventures could receive up to a $1 million investment each.
Deel’s competition starts in Tel Aviv with 40 Israeli startups
Deel has structured the competition into seven in-person regional finals across major tech hubs, with Tel Aviv hosting the first event on March 23, 2026. An estimated 40 Israeli finalists are expected, 15 of whom will advance to the final round.
Winners of the Tel Aviv regional final will also receive media and brand support from ReBlonde PR, a communications firm that has extensive experience with technology companies and startups across various industries.
The initiative aims to identify promising startups regardless of geographic location, giving them a direct path to investors and market attention that would otherwise be difficult to access.
It is also designed to move faster than traditional fundraising, as early-stage rounds can take months of outreach, meetings, and due diligence before founders secure backing. The Pitch is structured as a compressed, roughly three-month cycle from application to the global finale.
Applications opened on February 5, with founders asked to submit details on their startup, product, and traction. Compared with other international accelerators, Deel expects the final acceptance rate to be approximately 0.05%, making it among the most selective globally.
The additional six locations for the regional events include Dubai, Singapore, New York, Paris, London, and Berlin, with up to 100 regional-round winners receiving a $50,000 investment.
Rather than treating funding as the finish line, the program keeps founders engaged by providing access to Deel’s online startup community, where they can find investor mentorship and connect with builders facing similar early-stage challenges. The competition is supported by partners including a16z, Google, Stripe, JP Morgan, Mubadala, Ribbit Ventures, dLocal, and others.

Small but mighty: Colombia’s Muslim community celebrates Ramadan
Colombia’s Muslims comprise less than 0.2 percent of the population in a country that is majority Catholic.
Medellin, Colombia – Ziauddin Yahya Iqbal Sandoval, known to his friends as Zia, observes Ramadan with quiet conviction.
The 14-year-old was born and raised in Colombia, where Christianity remains dominant. Nearly 63 percent of the population identifies as Catholic.

But Zia is one of an estimated 85,000 to 100,000 Muslims in Colombia, comprising less than 0.2 percent of the country’s population.
Within that community, though, is a prism of diverse backgrounds and experiences. Some of Colombia’s Muslims reflect a rich history of migration to the region. Others are converts.
“The Colombian Islamic community is a small one but enjoys more on account of its diversity,” Zia said, as he took a break from serving tea in his uncle Zaheer’s restaurant in the upscale Poblado neighbourhood of Medellin.
On the eve of Ramadan, Muslim communities in cities like Bogota and Medellin prepared for the coming festivities with decorations and prayer.
Golden, glittering letters spelled out wishes for “Ramadan Karim” — or a “generous Ramadan” — above a modest mosque in Belen, on the outskirts of Medellin.
Inside, shoes were lined neatly along the wall. In a small, square prayer room, about eight men of different ages and nationalities stood shoulder to shoulder, bowing in unison.
“The majority of those who come to the mosque are Colombians, but we see people from Trinidad and Tobago, Tunisia, Pakistan and other Arab countries,” said Mu’tasem Abdo, the mosque’s imam who came to Medellin from Egypt four years ago.
He explained how, because Colombia’s Muslim community is relatively small, newcomers sometimes find themselves aching for the festive experience they remember from home.
“A native from a Muslim country can miss the grandeur of Ramadan as experienced back home,” Abdo explained.
Pakistani immigrant Rana Arif Mohammad remembers arriving in Colombia 23 years ago with dreams of adventuring through Latin America. But he too felt isolation as a Muslim in the country.
He settled in Medellin and founded a restaurant where he serves Pakistani and Arabic specialities in his Belen restaurant. But fellow Muslims were few and far between, and he remembers struggling to find a mosque.
“Twenty-three years ago, I met just four to five Muslims, just a few from Lebanon and Turkiye,” Mohammad said.
But Mohammad and others have observed Muslim visibility on the rise in Colombia.
In 2020, for instance, Colombia elected its first Muslim mayor in the border city of Maicao. And Mohammad explained that there are now more Islamic cultural centres and places of worship.
“Today, Medellin has five mosques,” he said, counting the ones he knows.
The Muslim population in Latin America first surged after the collapse of the Ottoman Empire in the early 20th century. There have been several waves of migration in the century since.
In Colombia, one of the most significant came during Lebanon’s civil war in the 1970s. The conflict triggered an exodus of nearly one million Lebanese people that included many Muslims and Christians.
Some settled in cities like Maicao, where one of the largest mosques in Latin America was built and completed in 1997.
The continued migration into Colombia has contributed to the diversity of its Muslim community.
In Bogota, Sheikh Ahmad Qurtubi speaks proudly of the range of nationalities in his jamaat, or congregation, at the Qurtubi Islamic Centre in the west of the city.
“There are people of different nationalities, approximately 10 or 15 different countries, and we find great diversity in this centre,” Qurtubi explained after delivering the Taraweeh prayer marking the first night of Ramadan.
Though there are no official statistics on the origins of Colombia’s Muslim population, Qurtubi has noticed an increase in Muslim converts.
He estimates that roughly 100 to 200 worshippers in his jamaat are new to the religion. It can be a struggle, though, to build a sense of cohesion, given the different backgrounds of the worshippers.
“The biggest challenge in Colombia is maintaining a stable community that has an impact on society and a common identity,” he said.
“In a community where most people have converted due to different circumstances that led them to Islam, it can be a little more complicated to achieve.”
But Qurtubi said the diversity of his congregation has led to celebrations that embrace the spectrum of Colombia’s Muslim identity.
He described how, on each night of Ramadan, a different family volunteers to cook food for the Iftar, the breaking of the fast.
“The food options can be very varied. Why? Because it depends on each person’s culture and background,” he explained. “For example, I can offer Moroccan food, one person can offer Pakistani food, others Colombian food.”
He believes community events like Ramadan create an opportunity for Colombia’s Muslims to embrace their differences and build communal understanding.
“Knowledge is what allows a community to grow, to flourish … and to have the opportunity to prosper and put down roots here in Colombia,” he said.

Russia, Ukraine report overnight strikes on energy supply
February 22, 2026Russia carried out a barrage of drone and missile strikes on energy infrastructure across Ukraine overnight, President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said on Sunday.
"The main target of the attack was the energy supply, but normal residential buildings were also damaged, and there was damage to the railway," Zelenskyy said in a post on Telegram.
At least one person was killed in the Kyiv region and eight others were injured, he added.
Ukraine's power grid operator Ukrenergo said the attacks prompted emergency power outages in a number of regions, including Kyiv.
Zelenskyy said almost 300 drones and 50 cruise and ballistic missiles were launched at the Ukrainian regions of Kyiv, Dnipropetrovsk, Kirovohrad, Mykolaiv, Odesa, Poltava and Sumy overnight.
The governor of Odesa, Oleh Kiper, wrote on Telegram that a drone attack on the region's energy infrastructure sparked several fires but that all of them had been extinguished.
Moscow has ramped up its attacks on Ukraine's power grid in recent weeks, increasing the toll on millions of civilians amid harsh winter temperatures.
Russian-controlled areas also report attacks
The Russian Defense Ministry said 86 Ukrainian drones had been intercepted over Russian-controlled areas and the Crimean Peninsula overnight.
Yevgeny Balitsky, Moscow-installed governor of the Russian-controlled parts of Zaporizhzhia, said the region was facing an electricity outage after a major Ukrainian attack on energy infrastructure there.
Meanwhile, the Russian-installed leader of Luhansk, a Ukrainian city also occupied by Russia, said a fuel reservoir caught fire after a Ukrainian drone attack on an oil depot.
One man died in a Ukrainian drone strike in Russia's western Bolgorod region, according to authorities there.
Talks stall as war's 4th anniversary approaches
Ukraine says Russia has deployed more than 1,300 combat drones, 1,400 guided aerial bombs and 96 missiles this week alone.
"That is why we must strengthen our air defense," Zelensky stressed, adding that that Ukraine needs systems to counter ballistic missiles. "Each such package protects critical infrastructure and maintains normality of life."
The latest attacks come just two days before Russia's war in Ukraine enters its fifth year.
US-mediated negotiations between the two countries to end the war are ongoing. A main sticking point is Moscow's demand that Kyiv withdraw from parts of the eastern Donbas region it still controls. Kyiv has rejected that proposal.
Their most recent talks in Geneva last week ended without a breakthrough.
Police officer killed in Lviv 'terrorist attack'
Separately, at least one police officer was killed and several other security personnel were injured in a series of blasts in the western Ukrainian city of Lviv, authorities said Sunday.
Mayor Andriy Sadovyi said police had detained a suspect and opened a criminal investigation.
"This was a terrorist attack," he said in a video posted to Telegram.
According to the public prosecutor's office, police had been responding to a reported break-in at a shop in Lviv's old town at around midnight when the explosions went off.
Officials said a 23-year-old policewoman was killed and some 24 other people were injured. Mayor Sadovyi said two vehicles, including a police car, were damaged in the incident.

Iranian Students Protest For A Second Day, Clash With Security Forces In Tehran

Iranian students faced off with security forces outside Tehran universities for the second day in a row, according to videos published online, in the biggest reported show of opposition in the capital since the deadly crackdown last month.
The latest protest erupted on February 22 outside the Amir Kabir University of Technology as students confronted soldiers from the Basij, a volunteer paramilitary force that has played a prominent role in quashing past political protests.
The students could be heard chanting anti-government slogans according to the social media videos. Others could be seen waving the Iranian national flag.
Similar rallies were previously reported at least five other universities across the country, including another Tehran's Sharif University.
Universities in Tehran have often been the scene of student protests that have taken place since the 1979 revolution and resulted in brutal crackdowns by the security forces.
The demonstrations coincided with hundreds of ceremonies that have been held across the country this week commemorating victims killed during major clashes with security forces in January.
At least 7,000 people were killed during the nationwide protests that erupted in late December 2025, according to human rights groups, although the real death toll is believed to be significantly higher.
Most of the killings reportedly occurred from January 8 to 10, the peak of the crackdown.
The protests, which have since subsided, were among the largest in Iran since the 1979 Islamic Revolution.
Historically, memorial ceremonies have often taken on political significance during times of unrest in Iran.
The protests have drawn global attention and condemnation of the brutal crackdown by government forces.
Amnesty International said at least 30 Iranians were facing the death penalty in connection with the protests.
US President Donald Trump has warned Tehran against further violence against demonstrators, and threatened military actions against the regime.
Trump dispatched two aircraft carrier strike groups, with dozens of fighter jets and bombers to the region, and other military planes and supporting forces have been spotted flying into airbases in the Middle East.
The Trump administration has also been pressuring Iran to agree to curtail its nuclear programs which it insists are intended for peaceful, civilian purposes, like electricity generation. Washington, along with Israel, have accused Tehran of intending to build atomic weapons.
Reportedly, US negotiators are ready to hold another round of talks with Iran on February 27 in Geneva if they receive a detailed Iranian proposal for a nuclear deal in the next 48 hours, Axios quoted its source in the US administration on February 22.
The same day, Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araqchi said a diplomatic solution was still possible. Omani Foreign Minister Badr Albusaidi later confirmed Iranian-US talks on Tehran's nuclear program will take place on February 26.
In a speech broadcast live by state TV on February 21, Iranian President Masud Pezeshkian said his country would not give in to pressure from world powers.
"World powers are lining up to force us to bow our heads...but we will not bow our heads despite all the problems that they are creating for us," Pezeshkian said.
US and Israel forces bombed several Iranian facilities believed to house key components of Tehran's nuclear infrastructure. But it was unclear how much the bombing set back its programs.
Trump said he was mulling a limited military strike.
"I guess I can say I am considering that," he said during a White House gathering on February 20.
Serbia and Sweden became the latest countries to urge their citizens to leave Iran amid the massive US buildup.

Images show huge new British warship ahead of sea trials
United Kingdom

New images of HMS Glasgow show the Royal Navy’s first Type 26 frigate taking shape on the Clyde as the 8,000-tonne warship moves closer to sea trials.
The photographs, taken today, capture the scale of the City-class frigate, with her towering mast, expansive flight deck and enclosed mission bay now clearly visible as outfitting progresses.
The vessel, the first of eight planned for the Royal Navy, recently reached a key milestone by generating her own power for the first time. In December, BAE Systems confirmed that HMS Glasgow’s diesel generators had been switched on, allowing the ship to self-power as systems integration gathers pace. The generators form a core part of the Type 26’s hybrid propulsion architecture, providing electrical power for onboard systems and enabling quiet propulsion when required.
The Type 26 Global Combat Ship has been designed primarily for anti-submarine warfare, with low acoustic signature central to the platform’s design. Power generation, auxiliary systems and internal routing have been engineered to minimise noise and vibration, reducing detectability during operations.
HMS Glasgow is being built at BAE Systems shipyards on the Clyde, where further ships in the class are at varying stages of construction. The programe also includes five Type 26 frigates for Norway, while variants of the design have been selected by both Canada and Australia.
The Type 26 frigate, known in Royal Navy service as the City class, is the United Kingdom’s next generation anti submarine warfare escort. Designed and built by BAE Systems on the Clyde, it is intended to replace the ageing Type 23 fleet and to form the backbone of Britain’s surface escort force into the 2030s and beyond. Eight ships are planned for the Royal Navy, beginning with HMS Glasgow, followed by Cardiff and Belfast, with the remaining vessels due to enter service in the years after 2030. Variants of the same basic design have also been selected by Australia, Canada and Norway.
At around 8,000 tonnes at full load and just under 150 metres in length, the Type 26 is a large frigate by historical standards. It has been shaped first and foremost for anti submarine warfare in the North Atlantic, reflecting a renewed focus on tracking increasingly capable submarines. The hull and internal layout have been engineered to reduce underwater noise, and the propulsion system combines a Rolls Royce MT30 gas turbine with four diesel generators driving electric motors. In quiet electric mode the ship can operate with a far lower acoustic signature, while still being capable of speeds above 26 knots when required. Range is expected to exceed 7,000 nautical miles, giving the class the endurance for sustained global deployments.
The sensor fit mirrors that emphasis on undersea warfare. Royal Navy ships will carry the Type 997 Artisan three dimensional radar for air and surface surveillance, supported by modern navigation radars and satellite communications. Beneath the waterline, the combination of a bow mounted sonar and the Sonar 2087 towed array provides both active and passive detection at considerable range, together with torpedo warning capability. Electronic warfare and decoy systems, including the Ancilia launcher now being introduced across the escort fleet, are intended to improve survivability against contemporary missile threats.
In terms of armament, the class balances anti submarine specialisation with broader combat power. Sea Ceptor surface to air missiles provide local area air defence, housed in a vertical launch system capable of carrying up to 48 weapons. A separate 24 cell Mark 41 strike length launcher offers flexibility for future systems, including the Anglo French Italian Future Cruise or Anti Ship Weapon. The main gun is a 127 millimetre Mark 45, replacing the Royal Navy’s long serving 4.5 inch weapon, and is backed up by 30 millimetre guns, Phalanx close in weapon systems and machine guns. The flight deck is large enough to operate a Chinook helicopter, with an enclosed hangar for a Merlin or Wildcat, and there is a substantial mission bay designed to take boats, containers or specialist equipment depending on the tasking.
With propulsion systems energised and major equipment now installed, the ship is progressing towards eventual sea trials later this year before formal acceptance into Royal Navy service.

‘I have given them 21 years of my life, now they want my soul’: IPP prisoner jailed for stealing £20 could be deported in days

‘I have given them 21 years of my life, now they want my soul’: IPP prisoner jailed for stealing £20 could be deported in days
Exclusive: Sheldon Coore, who has lived in Britain since he was a toddler, has been moved to an immigration removal centre near Gatwick Airport ahead of his deportation to Jamaica
- Bookmark
A father who has spent almost 20 years in prison for stealing £20 has begged the government to halt plans to deport him within days, fearing he faces homelessness in a country he does not know.
Sheldon Coore, 47, has lived in Britain since he was 16 months old, when he arrived with his mother to join his Jamaican grandparents who settled during the Windrush era.
He was handed a controversial imprisonment for public protection (IPP) jail term in 2005 after he put a man in a headlock and stole £20 from his pocket, having already racked up a string of previous convictions when he turned to crime in order to fund his drug addiction.
Despite originally being handed a minimum tariff of two years and 65 days, Coore languished in prison for two decades under the widely discredited open-ended jail term, which has since been scrapped.
But rather than releasing him into the community to rebuild his life with his five daughters in Huddersfield, the Home Office has decided to deport him to his country of birth.
In January, he told The Independent he felt he was being punished “twice and thrice and even tenfold” for his crimes after losing his last appeal against his removal.
On Friday, he was moved to Brook House immigration removal centre near Gatwick airport, where he is being held in segregation. He described the transfer process as “heavy handed” after officers dressed in riot protection gear put him in a body belt restraint device for the journey.
He was originally told he would be put on a flight to Kingston, Jamaica’s capital city, on Monday, but his legal team is battling to halt this and seeking a judicial review.
Coore has only ever visited the Caribbean country once in his adult life. If he is deported, he has no idea where he will stay, if he will have any money or a phone to contact his family in Britain.
In desperate messages from inside HMP Erlestoke, a category C prison in Wiltshire, before he was transferred, he revealed had not been able to eat or sleep since receiving the news of his imminent removal.
“I am scared, in fact I am petrified,” said Coore, who says he has recently been diagnosed with autism. “I do not know what my future holds, do not know if I will make it through the night of my deportation.”
He continued: “Since this news, I have not slept or eaten and just keep on having all these thoughts going through my head. It is unbearable.
“If this was to go ahead, l am worried about everything. Where am I going to sleep, eat, drink? How am I going to be able to survive without any money or job? Who is going to be there to help me as an autistic man?”
He fears he will be left destitute with no family in Jamaica to support him after spending decades in prison.
He pleaded: “I am asking the government to stop all of this once and for all and give me a break.
“I have given them 21 years of my life on this IPP, and now they want my soul. What have I done to the British government so bad that they want to act this kind of revenge on me?”
His lawyers are understood to be fighting his removal. An immigration expert told The Independent that, without friends or family to stay with, those deported will likely be directed to a homeless shelter on arrival in Kingston.
Campaigner group United Group for Reform of IPP (UNGRIPP), who have been supporting Coore in prison, compared his treatment to modern day penal transportation.
“By forcibly removing a man who has lived here since infancy, the government is reviving the colonial practice of shipping ‘undesirables’ out of sight and out of mind,” a spokesman added.
“Sheldon is a victim of the IPP sentence, a discredited, indefinite sentence abolished 14 years ago that has kept him trapped long past his original tariff. To use this failed sentence as a catalyst to deport him to a country he does not know is a cruel double punishment.
“UNGRIPP has supported Sheldon for years; it is heartbreaking to see the government discard a man they failed to rehabilitate, rather than taking responsibility for the broken system they created.”
IPP sentences were abolished in 2012, but not retrospectively. The flawed sentence has left thousands incarcerated indefinitely, with some trapped for up to 22 times longer than their original minimum term, including for some minor crimes.
Almost 2,400 were still languishing on IPP sentences in December 2025, including 924 who have never been released. The majority have served at least 10 years longer than their original minimum term.
Coore served 10 years on his IPP sentence before he was released in 2015, but was recalled indefinitely around 18 months later over allegations in respect of which he was never charged.
He was further convicted of affray and sentenced to 15 months after he ran out with a knife when police came to arrest him, but he insists he only had the weapon to take his own life. He has been in prison ever since.
Coore, who says he has always considered himself British, has only visited Jamaica once on a two-week holiday 26 years ago.
Being removed would mean leaving behind his five daughters – a nine-year-old, twins aged 10, and two in their twenties. He also has a granddaughter, aged four, and another on the way.
At an immigration tribunal hearing last August, Coore argued that deporting him would breach his human rights, but the judge ruled that – although he remains in close contact with his family – he has achieved “no realistic or effective integration” into British society because he has been in prison for so long.
A Home Office spokesperson said: “This government will not allow foreign criminals and illegal immigrants to exploit our laws, which is why we are reforming human rights laws and replacing the broken appeals system, allowing us to scale up deportations.
“All foreign national offenders who receive a prison sentence in the UK are referred for deportation at the earliest opportunity.”

Trump curious why Iran has not 'capitulated' amid US military buildup, says Witkoff

Feb 22 - U.S. President Donald Trump is curious as to why Iran has not yet "capitulated" and agreed to curb its nuclear programme, as Washington builds up its military capability in the Middle East, Trump's special envoy Steve Witkoff said.
"I don't want to use the word 'frustrated,' because he understands he has plenty of alternatives, but he's curious as to why they haven't... I don't want to use the word 'capitulated,' but why they haven't capitulated," Witkoff said during an interview on Saturday with Fox News' "My View with Lara Trump," hosted by the president's daughter-in-law.
"Why, under this pressure, with the amount of seapower and naval power over there, why haven't they come to us and said, 'We profess we don't want a weapon, so here's what we're prepared to do'? And yet it's sort of hard to get them to that place."
Trump has ordered a huge buildup of forces in the Middle East and preparations for a potential multi-week air attack on Iran. Iran has threatened to strike U.S. bases if it is attacked.
IRAN DENIES SEEKING NUCLEAR WEAPONS
The United States wants Iran to give up enriched uranium which Washington says can potentially be used to make a bomb, as well as stop supporting militants in the Middle East and accept limits to its missile programme.
Tehran says its nuclear programme is peaceful but it is willing to accept some curbs on it in return for the lifting of financial sanctions. It rejects tying this to other issues such as missiles and support for armed groups.
"They've been enriching well beyond the number that you need for civil nuclear. It's up to 60% (fissile purity)," Witkoff said. "They're probably a week away from having industrial, industrial-grade bomb-making material, and that's really dangerous."
A senior Iranian official told Reuters on Sunday that Iran and the United States still have differing views over sanctions relief in talks.
Witkoff also said he has met at Trump's direction with Iranian opposition figure Reza Pahlavi, son of the shah ousted in Iran's 1979 Islamic Revolution. He did not provide further details of the meeting.
Pahlavi, who lives in exile, served as a rallying figure for some of Iran's opposition during anti-government demonstrations last month in which thousands of people are believed to have been killed, the worst domestic unrest since the revolution era.
Earlier in February, Pahlavi said U.S. military intervention in Iran could save lives, and urged Washington not to spend too long negotiating with Tehran's clerical rulers on a nuclear deal. REUTERS

EU lawmaker urges delay to US trade deal vote after tariff upheaval
Sign up now: Get ST's newsletters delivered to your inbox
BRUSSELS – A senior EU lawmaker proposed on Feb 22 postponing a vote on the EU-US trade deal that had been planned for this week, arguing that the terms and legal basis on which the deal was struck had changed.
The US Supreme Court struck down President Donald Trump’s global tariffs
“Pure tariff chaos from the US administration. No one can make sense of it any more – only open questions and growing uncertainty for the EU and other US trading partners,” Mr Bernd Lange wrote in a post on X.
The European Union and the US agreed at Mr Trump’s Turnberry golf course in Scotland in July 2025 on a deal averting a trade war under which the EU is to remove its import duties on many US products in return for a 15 per cent US tariff on most EU goods exports.
The reduced EU duties need clearance from EU governments and the European Parliament.
Mr Lange wrote that the terms of the Turnberry agreement and the legal basis on which it was reached had changed and that clarity was now needed.
The Greens have also said the vote should be paused.
The European Parliament in January suspended its work on the deal in protest against Mr Trump’s demands to acquire Greenland and threats of tariffs on European allies who oppose his plan, but subsequently decided to put the deal to a vote at the end of February. REUTERS

Seeking recognition, Somaliland minister says US can access its minerals, military bases
Khadar Hussein Abdi suggests granting ‘exclusive’ mineral rights to Washington, is ‘open to offer’ military sites; won’t rule out possibility of Israeli military presence
Somaliland is willing to give the United States access to its minerals and military bases, a minister told AFP in an interview Saturday, as the breakaway region of Somalia seeks international recognition.
Israel became the only country in the world to recognize Somaliland’s independence in December — something the territory has been seeking since declaring its autonomy from Somalia in 1991.
The government in Mogadishu still considers Somaliland an integral part of Somalia even though the territory has run its own affairs since 1991, with its own passport, currency, army and police forces.
“We are willing to give exclusive [access to our minerals] to the United States,” Khadar Hussein Abdi, minister of the presidency, told AFP in an interview on Saturday.
“Also, we are open to offer military bases to the United States,” he said.
“We believe that we will agree on something with the United States,” the minister added. He also would not rule out the possibility of also allowing Israel to set up a military presence.
Earlier this month, Somaliland president Abdirahman Mohamed Abdullahi said that the country expects to reach a trade agreement soon with Jerusalem, and is willing to offer rights to valuable mineral deposits as part of a deal.
Somaliland officials have said natural resources include lithium, coltan and other sought-after materials critical for batteries and electric vehicles, though independent studies are lacking.
Abdullahi said that while no bilateral economic deal with Israel had yet been reached, the two governments were likely to sign “a partnership agreement.”
“Somaliland is a very rich country in resources — minerals, oil, gas, marine, in agriculture, energy and other sectors… We have meat, we have fish, we have minerals and they [Israel] need them. So trade can start from these main sectors,” he said. “The sky is the limit.”
He said in return Somaliland would seek access to Israeli technology.
Abdullahi also said he has a good working relationship with Washington and believes US President Donald Trump will “someday” recognize Somaliland.

Pope says peace in Ukraine 'cannot be postponed'
Sign up now: Get ST's newsletters delivered to your inbox
VATICAN CITY, Feb 22 - Pope Leo made an impassioned appeal on Sunday for peace in Ukraine, saying an end to the four-year-old conflict "cannot be postponed" as the United States tries to broker an elusive accord between Moscow and Kyiv.
Russia, which launched a full-scale invasion of its neighbour on February 24, 2022, used drones and ballistic and cruise missiles in its latest attacks overnight, the Ukrainian military and local officials said on Sunday.
"My heart goes out again to the dramatic situation that everyone can see," the pope said during his weekly address to pilgrims in St. Peter's Square after a Sunday prayer.
"So many victims, so many broken lives and families, so much destruction, so much unspeakable suffering."
The U.S. has been seeking to mediate between the two sides, but progress has been halting, with Russia demanding Ukraine withdraw from parts of the eastern Donbas region it still controls, an idea Kyiv has rejected.
"Peace cannot be postponed," the pope said. "It is an urgent necessity that must find space in hearts and be translated into responsible decisions."
He said war was a "wound inflicted on the entire human family", which leaves behind "death, devastation, and a trail of pain that marks generations." REUTERS

The health condition people now fear more than cancer
As progress continues in the treatment of cancer, another illness is causing family carers concern
- Bookmark

Britain’s biggest health fear is no longer cancer, according to recent research.
Around 31 per cent of family carers fear dementia, a 4 per cent increase from last year, while concerns around cancer dropped from 30 per cent to 21 per cent in the same amount of time, according to Home Instead.
The at-home care provider surveyed 4,000 people, including 1,600 family carers, over the course of a year in a study tracking the country’s feelings around ageing and care.
Almost two-thirds of those surveyed (63 per cent) called for the government to declare dementia a health emergency as the disease takes a growing toll on families, according to the research. Almost 90 per cent of carers called for a dedicated dementia allowance to help fund care.
Home Instead chief executive Martin Jones said: “Dementia has now eclipsed cancer as our greatest health fear for the future. Unlike cancer, where decades of research have shifted perceptions and care outcomes, dementia feels like a greater threat – a condition with no cure in sight.”
While cancer remains the leading cause of death in the UK, and nearly one in two Brits will be diagnosed with cancer in our lifetimes, scientists continue to make progress in treating and curing cancer.
Cancer survival in the UK has doubled in the past 50 years, according to Cancer Research UK. Meanwhile, dementia remains incurable and every three minutes someone in the UK develops it, according to the Alzheimer’s Society.
David Thomas, of Alzheimer’s Research UK, told The Telegraph: “We are at a tipping point for dementia research, but we need the government to be more ambitious in tackling what is the UK’s biggest killer.
“Blood tests for Alzheimer’s are being trialled in parts of the NHS and more new drugs are being researched than ever before. These innovations have the potential to help us really get a grip on dementia and make the sort of progress we’ve seen with other conditions, like stroke and cancer.”
As dementia is caused by different diseases, it is unlikely that there will be a single cure for it, according to the NHS website.
“Huge strides have been made in understanding how different diseases cause damage in the brain and so produce dementia. And with increased funding over the past few years, there are now many more research studies and clinical trials taking place,” a statement on the website reads.
“Although a cure may be some years away, there are some very promising advances.”
Last October, donanemab, a drug which can slow down the decline in memory and thinking skills of people living with early Alzheimer’s disease, was licensed in the UK as a private treatment.
The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) published its final guidance, where its recommendation remains that donanemab not be provided through the NHS because it did not meet the cost-effectiveness threshold.

TESERO /Italy/, February 22. /TASS/. Russian Darya Nepryaeva's Olympic marathon result has been annulled for violating ski changing rules.
Nepryaeva covered most of the distance on skis that weren't hers. After reaching the 21.6-kilometer mark, the Russian mistakenly entered the box of German skier Katharina Hennig Dotzler and used her skis. The German skier finished 9th, while Nepryaeva finished 11th.
The marathon was the final race in the skiing competition at the Olympic Games in Italy. The Games will conclude on February 22.

US special envoy says possible peace talks in 'next 3 weeks' may lead to Putin, Zelenskyy summit
Steve Witkoff tells Fox News that US is 'hopeful' it put forward proposals to both Russia, Ukraine that will bring both sides together 'in the next 3 weeks'
ISTANBUL
US Special Envoy Steve Witkoff said Washington is "hopeful" that it has put proposals to both Russia and Ukraine that could bring them together “in the next three weeks” and potentially result in a summit between their presidents.
Speaking to Fox News in an interview released on Saturday, Witkoff described the ongoing Russia-Ukraine war, which on Tuesday is set to hit the four-year mark year, as a “silly war.”
“You know, everyone throws the word 'dignity' around. But what does dignity get you if you have that amount of killing there?” Witkoff said, adding that he thinks recent US-mediated peace talks between Moscow and Kyiv have had a “real positive effect in some respects.”
He argued that both Russia and Ukraine “don’t seem like they really want to fight with one another, and I don't think they do," adding that he thinks the main difficulty in reaching a peace agreement lies “at the leadership levels.”
He said he and Jared Kushner, US President Donald Trump’s son-in-law and unofficial aide, are hopeful they have made some proposals that will bring both sides together in the next three weeks “and maybe even result in a summit between (Ukrainian President Volodymyr) Zelenskyy and (Russian) President (Vladimir) Putin.”
He also stated the possibility of such a summit taking place at the trilateral level with Trump’s participation, but noted that the US president does not want to take part in such a meeting “unless he feels that he can consummate this thing and get the best result.”
On his meetings with the Russian president, Witkoff said Putin had been “straight” with him about his red lines and motivations. He defended his multiple visits to Russia, saying that understanding the other side’s positions is necessary to reach an agreement.
Witkoff’s remarks come after he took part in another round of trilateral peace talks on the Russia-Ukraine war in Geneva, Switzerland, earlier this week.
The talks on Tuesday and Wednesday followed up on two earlier rounds of negotiations in the United Arab Emirates capital Abu Dhabi on Jan. 23-24 and Feb. 4-5.

Iranian commander says ‘enemy’ movements monitored amid tensions with US
‘All enemy movements are continuously monitored,’ ground forces commander says
TEHRAN, Iran
An Iranian commander said Sunday that his country’s forces are monitoring “enemy” movements around the clock amid rising tensions with the United States.
“All enemy movements are continuously monitored,” Ground Forces Commander Ali Jahanshahi said during a visit to a military unit in the city of Piranshahr in West Azerbaijan province near the Iraqi border.
“Thanks to their advanced capabilities, our soldiers will not allow any hostile action against this land,” he added in his comments cited by local media.
The Iranian commander said that his forces are “fully ready and can neutralize potential threats to the country at their early stages.”
Iran and the United States resumed nuclear negotiations earlier this month in Muscat, followed by another round of talks in Geneva on Tuesday under Omani mediation.
The renewed diplomacy comes amid heightened regional tensions, fueled by a significant US military buildup in the Persian Gulf as well as Iranian military drills.
On Friday, US President Donald Trump said he was considering a limited military strike to pressure Iran into reaching a “meaningful” agreement.

Khamenei takes steps to ensure succession amid rising fears of US strikes, assassination - NYT
Unknown

21:36:42 KST

Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei has taken steps to prepare for the possibility of his own elimination amid rising threats from Israel and the United States, according to a Sunday report by The New York Times.
Khamenei appointed his close ally, Ali Larijani, as the country’s de facto leader during the height of the anti-government protests in January, the NYT report claimed, in a move that could reflect the increasing military pressure put on Tehran and Khamenei’s expectation that he could be targeted in future Israeli or American strikes.
The report comes after earlier reports this week that speculated what a potential US strike on Iran might look like.
Two US officials cited by Reuters have stated that the US military could target individual Iranian leaders as part of an attack on Tehran, which could aim to change the regime.
The anonymous sources did not specify who might be targeted in such attacks.
Larijani, a seasoned politician and former commander in the Revolutionary Guards, has long been a trusted member of Khamenei’s inner circle.
He currently serves as the secretary of Iran’s Supreme National Security Council, and since his appointment, he has effectively taken over decision-making, sidelining the elected president, Masoud Pezeshkian, a doctor by profession.
Larijani prepares contingency plans for managing Iran during a potential war
The decision to appoint Larijani, who took a main role in the deadly suppression of the recent anti-regime protests, has further consolidated his power within the government.
As protests intensified in January, Khamenei turned to Larijani to manage the country’s response, including coordinating with regional allies such as Russia, Qatar, and Oman, as well as overseeing negotiations with Washington on the nuclear issue.
According to sources within the IRGC and Iran’s political establishment that were cited by the NYT, Larijani is also preparing contingency plans for managing the country during a potential war with the US, especially as US military forces remain concentrated in the region.
As part of the preparations for a potential military conflict, Khamenei has issued instructions to Larijani and a small circle of trusted political and military figures on how to ensure the survival of the Islamic Republic in the event of military strikes or his own assassination.
Sources close to the leader reportedly revealed that Khamenei has outlined a four-layered succession plan for each key military and governmental role, with each position to have up to four designated replacements.
In addition, he has empowered a select few to make decisions in the event of communication breakdowns or if he is killed.
Khamenei’s succession remains a contentious issue. While Larijani is a central figure in Iran’s leadership, he is not a senior Shi’ite cleric, a crucial requirement for the position of Supreme Leader.
However, he is seen as the closest figure to Khamenei, alongside other prominent individuals such as Parliament Speaker Mohammad-Bagher Ghalibaf and Khamenei’s personal advisor, Ali Akbar Velayati.
Larijani’s rise to prominence
Larijani’s increased prominence follows the May 2025 missile strike, which targeted Iran’s top military chain of command, leading Khamenei to expedite plans for his succession.
Despite continued diplomatic negotiations on the nuclear deal, the Iranian leadership is operating under the assumption that a US strike is imminent.
The country has placed its military forces on the highest alert, deployed ballistic missile launchers along its western border with Iraq and in the Persian Gulf, and conducted military exercises, including the temporary closure of the Strait of Hormuz.
The succession issue is compounded by concerns about Iran’s political survival amid increasing external pressures.
Speculation has arisen over potential candidates to succeed Khamenei, with Larijani currently at the forefront, though former president Hassan Rouhani has also been mentioned, despite being sidelined from decision-making circles in recent years.
Rouhani, a senior cleric, holds a significant advantage over Larijani and other military leaders due to his religious credentials.
Larijani’s visibility has risen sharply in the past month. He traveled to Moscow for a meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin, met with leaders in the Middle East, and appeared in extended television interviews.
Meanwhile, Pezeshkian’s public profile has diminished, and he has admitted in cabinet meetings that he often has to turn to Larijani to advance key issues, such as removing internet restrictions, according to the report.
Larijani is also playing a central role in sensitive negotiations with Washington, where his approval is necessary for key diplomatic decisions.
When US envoy Steve Witkoff inquired about potential executions of protesters, Iran’s foreign minister turned to the president, who then consulted with Larijani before proceeding with the response.
Khamenei’s careful distribution of power reflects his awareness of the uncertain future.
As tensions with the West grow, he has increasingly delegated authority to Larijani, who is seen as the man preparing Iran for the “next big event,” potentially a war.
But for now, Khamenei remains the figurehead, keeping the system intact while laying the groundwork for his successor.

UK slams West Midlands Police over Maccabi fan ban based on AI reports

The UK Parliament’s Home Affairs Committee on Sunday published a report criticizing the decision to bar Maccabi Tel Aviv supporters from attending the Europa League match against Aston Villa at Villa Park in Birmingham in November 2025, saying the process was driven by flawed evidence and poor coordination across government.
The committee said West Midlands Police (WMP) relied too heavily on “inaccurate and unverified” material, including information partly based on false AI-generated content that painted a misleading picture of violence surrounding a previous fixture involving Maccabi in Amsterdam.
According to the report, evidence that reinforced pre-existing assumptions about the risk posed by Maccabi fans was accepted readily, while contradictory information from authoritative sources was not given proper weight. The committee said a lack of due diligence meant gaps in evidence-gathering went uncorrected, even after the matter came under parliamentary scrutiny.
The committee also noted that WMP’s evidence-gathering is now subject to an investigation by the Independent Office for Police Conduct.
Police admitted to using AI-generated sources in report
While the committee found no evidence that the police response was motivated by antisemitism, it concluded that WMP failed to take appropriate steps to engage with Jewish communities in Birmingham, particularly when compared with its consultation with other groups.
In January, West Midlands Chief Constable Craig Guildford apologized after acknowledging a fictitious reference to a West Ham-Maccabi Tel Aviv match in a report about the force's decision had been generated by Microsoft's Copilot AI tool.
He had previously said artificial intelligence was not used in preparing the document.

Despite sweeping and severe efforts by the Iranian regime to quell protests, Iran International and Tousi reported that students at Amirkabir University of Technology in Tehran staged a protest and blocked a street near the campus.

A video circulating from the scene showed students dispersing while chanting, “Don’t be afraid, we are all together,” according to the outlets. One demonstration was underway at Sharif University of Technology in the capital, where chants of “Death to Khamenei” were allegedly heard along with “Long live the King.”
Another report said students at the Medical University in Mashhad also held a protest, during which demonstrators chanted “Freedom.”
Trump clashes with Iran's FM over Iranian crackdown
On Friday, President Donald Trump and Iran’s foreign minister clashed over the scale of casualties from Iran’s crackdown.
Speaking at a news briefing, President Trump said, “Iran should make a deal.” Asked whether he had a message for the Iranian people, he added, “Iran should make a deal. It’s a very sad situation. The Iranian people are better than their leaders. Thirty-two thousand people were killed in a short time.”
He added, “They were going to hang 800, two weeks ago, hang some by a crane. They lift them up with a tall crane, and they play with them around the square.”
Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi rejected those figures, addressing the death toll in a post on X. “We are fulfilling our commitment to full transparency with our people,” he wrote. “The government has already published the complete list of 3,117 victims in the recent terror operation, including about 200 police officers.”
In late January, Iran International reported that as many as 36,000 people may have been killed during the crackdown, with many more injured and imprisoned. A US-based human rights agency told CBS the number of arrests was above 50,000.

Why Mike Huckabee's interview with Tucker Carlson matters for the Middle East - analysis

An interview between American commentator Tucker Carlson and US Ambassador to Israel Mike Huckabee has led to several controversies, with a number of countries across the Middle East condemning the US Ambassador’s remarks.
The interview has also led to a debate in some sectors about how views on Israel and the Middle East are shaping US policy, and also how religious views have shaped policy in the region.
Starting with the positive, two people sat down in an amicable format and discussed controversial topics in a mostly polite manner. There was no shouting or extremism. This was a respectable interview, and it shows that people with very different viewpoints can speak about them in a calm manner.
This is in contrast to how some shows prefer to have interviews where they gather several guests and have them shout at each other.
Shouting may be good for ratings, but none of the listeners learn anything.
For instance, during the Israel-Hamas War, did anyone really learn anything from the shows that included shouting and talking points, such as: “Israel is doing genocide!”
“No, it isn’t, you’re an antisemite!” Did anyone learn anything? The public was mostly made less educated.
Did the Carlson-Huckabee interview educate us? It certainly provided a few insights into key discussions about the recent war, Israel, and US policy.
These insights included a discussion about civilian casualties in Gaza.
Carlson pressed the Ambassador on the number of casualties in Gaza, as well as the number of children killed. What this reveals is the continuing problem of relying solely on the data of the Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza. While some people reject the numbers of that ministry, they refuse to provide any alternative numbers.
Even today, with the IDF running half of Gaza and a new US-backed peace plan, there is no alternative health ministry. When people in Gaza are killed, there is no one to document it who is considered a reliable independent source. This appears unconscionable. How can two million people be denied the right to have basic documentation about their lives?
Another revealing part of the Carlson-Huckabee interview focused on the question of Jewish rights to Israel and issues relating to Christian Zionism.
This is the part of the interview that led to countries in the region condemning the US Ambassador’s remarks.
Ostensibly, the question relates to an interpretation of the Biblical Land of Israel stretching from the Nile to the Euphrates. The way the Ambassador’s comments were related to the region can be seen in the article by Turkey’s Anadolu.
“US Ambassador to Israel Mike Huckabee argued that Israel has a biblical right to the land stretching from the Nile to the Euphrates rivers, saying, ‘It would be fine if they (Israel) took it all,’ on a podcast released Friday.” The question this raises is whether Biblical interpretations should guide police regarding modern-day Israel.
Before discussing the issue of the Bible and Zionism and what it means for modern politics, it’s worth looking now at the negatives that came out of the interview.
Around a dozen countries say that they “affirm their countries’ categorical rejection of such dangerous and inflammatory remarks, which constitute a flagrant violation of the principles of international law and the Charter of the United Nations, and pose a grave threat to the security and stability of the region.”
This is from a joint statement by “the Ministries of Foreign Affairs of the United Arab Emirates, the Arab Republic of Egypt, the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan, the Republic of Indonesia, the Islamic Republic of Pakistan, the Republic of Turkey, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, the State of Qatar, the State of Kuwait, the Sultanate of Oman, the Kingdom of Bahrain, the Lebanese Republic, the Syrian Arab Republic, and the State of Palestine, and the secretariats of the Organization of Islamic Cooperation (OIC), the League of Arab States (LAS), and the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC)” which wrote to “express their strong condemnation and profound concern regarding the statements made by the United States Ambassador to Israel, in which he indicated that it would be acceptable for Israel to exercise control over territories belonging to Arab states, including the occupied West Bank.”
This is not a small number of countries. Many of them are US allies and partners. Several of them have peace with Israel. Several of them are also key to the current US-Iran talks, and they host US military bases. What these countries are saying is they are concerned by the comments by the US Ambassador in the interview, and they claim the comments contradict the policies of the Trump administration.
Why a discussion on Biblical Zionism matters
Now, let’s consider why the discussion of the Bible and Zionism matters. Support for Zionism and Israel among some Christians has sometimes been rooted in understandings of the Old Testament. This helped lead to support for the Balfour Declaration in 1917.
Israel’s Foreign Ministry notes, regarding the declaration, “Moreover, far from acting alone, Great Britain was actually part of a major international consensus supporting Zionism, the aspiration of the Jewish people to restore their independence and sovereignty in the Land of Israel. Prior to issuing the declaration, Great Britain coordinated with its allies.”
IT SHOULD be recalled that the declaration’s actual language is rooted in more than just generalizations about returning Jews to the Land of Israel.
“His Majesty’s Government view with favor the establishment in Palestine of a national home for the Jewish people, and will use their best endeavors to facilitate the achievement of this object, it being clearly understood that nothing shall be done which may prejudice the civil and religious rights of existing non-Jewish communities in Palestine, or the rights and political status enjoyed by Jews in any other country.”
What is clear from the policies that underpinned support for Zionism and the underpinnings of modern Israel is that it is not just a Biblical discussion; it is rooted in rights as well.
What the Carlson-Huckabee interview appears to have missed is a wider discussion of how this debate about the Bible relates to modern-day policy. Israel is not the only country in the region whose nationalist history is tied up in ideas of a “greater” nationalism. Greek and Turkish nationalism also have wider claims than the modern-day states.
Arab nationalism once envisioned one large Arab state in the region. Turkey speaks of the Mediterranean as the “Blue Homeland.” Kurds would like to have a Kurdistan. Talk about “greater Israel” therefore does not exist in a vacuum. However, in a region with overlapping claims, it clearly provokes strong reactions.
Understanding the interplay between modern borders and policy and the Biblical discussion of the roots of Zionism clearly is a sensitive discussion and should be approached with that sensitivity.
There are lessons from the Carlson-Huckabee interview, and they should be discussed. Carlson has been critiqued over the last several years for his apparent shift in his views of Israel. This shift among some right-leaning US commentators is not only related to Carlson.
The Gaza war led to a deep discussion in American right-leaning and Christian circles about this, including among supporters of Israel.
Some have accused this discussion of becoming influenced by antisemitism. There is also a wider discussion about how Evangelicals relate to Israel and whether there are shifting views among younger Evangelicals on Israel, in part due to the Gaza war and other trends.
The Carlson-Huckabee interview is a window into this discussion, even if some would prefer not to look out that window. It is also a window that many countries in the region and others are looking through.

Met police using AI tools supplied by Palantir to flag officer misconduct

Scotland Yard is using AI tools supplied by the US tech company Palantir to monitor staff behaviour in an attempt to root out failing officers, the Guardian has learned.
The Metropolitan police has previously declined to confirm or deny whether it used technology supplied by the company, which also works for the Israeli military and Donald Trump’s ICE operation. It has now confirmed that it is using Palantir’s AI to analyse internal data about sickness levels, absences from duty and overtime patterns in an effort to identify potential shortcomings in professional standards.
The Police Federation, which represents rank-and-file officers, criticised the approach as “automated suspicion”. It said: “Officers must not be subjected to opaque or untested tools that risk misinterpreting unsustainable workload pressures, sickness or overtime as indicators of wrongdoing.”
With 46,000 officers and staff, the Met is the UK’s largest police force and has faced a wave of controversies, ranging from failures to properly vet officers – highlighted by Wayne Couzens’ murder of Sarah Everard – to the toleration of discriminatory and misogynistic behaviour.
The force said: “There is evidence to suggest a correlation between significant levels of sickness, increased absences or unusually high overtime, and failings in standards, culture and behaviour.”
By bringing together data from multiple existing internal databases, the aim of the time-limited pilot of Palantir’s technology was to “help us identify these patterns of behaviour in our officers and staff” and was “part of our wider effort to drive up standards and improve the Met’s culture”.
It added: “Palantir’s systems help to identify the patterns, but it is officers who then explore further and make any determinations on standards, performance or other issues.”
A spokesperson for the Police Federation said: “Any system that profiles officers using algorithmic patterns must be treated with extreme caution. Policing already operates under some of the broadest and deepest scrutiny of any profession … If forces are serious about raising standards and public confidence, the focus must remain on proper supervision, fair processes and human judgment, not the automation of suspicion.”
Palantir has been caught up in the ongoing row over Peter Mandelson’s role as Keir Starmer’s ambassador to the US before he was sacked over his links to Jeffrey Epstein. A lobbying firm Mandelson co-owned, Global Counsel, works for Palantir, which was co-founded by the Trump-supporting tech billionaire Peter Thiel.
Mandelson and Starmer visited Palantir’s technology showroom in Washington DC last year and met its chief executive, Alex Karp, shortly after Mandelson’s appointment. MPs have called for greater transparency over Palantir’s public sector contracts in the UK, including a £330m deal signed with the NHS in November 2023 to provide a federated data platform, and a £240m contract agreed with the Ministry of Defence in December 2025.
Responding to the Met’s Palantir pilot, Martin Wrigley MP, a Liberal Democrat member of the Commons science, innovation and technology select committee, said: “I am concerned about the rights of officers as employees. Bosses spying on staff has been controversial even before some used AI to do so. Palantir seems to be watching over every aspect of government. Who is watching Palantir?”
Palantir’s AI is already available for use by several other police to assist investigations as part of services provided through two regional investigations units.
Labour said in its policing white paper last month that it was “committed to supporting the police to adopt AI responsibly, at pace and scale”. The party plans to invest more than £115m over the next three years “to support the rapid and responsible development, testing and rollout of AI tools across all 43 forces in England and Wales”.
A spokesperson for Palantir said: “We are proud that our software is being used to deliver better public services in the UK. That includes improving police operations, delivering more NHS operations, helping Royal Navy ships to stay at sea for longer.”

Hungary steps back from electricity supply threats to Ukraine, citing concern for Hungarians in Zakarpattia
Hungarian Foreign Minister Péter Szijjártó has said that "special caution" is needed regarding electricity supplies to Ukraine in order not to harm ethnic Hungarians living in Zakarpattia Oblast.
Source: Szijjártó in a video on Facebook, as reported by European Pravda
Details: Szijjártó recorded the video following a government energy council meeting held on Sunday to discuss the suspension of Russian oil supplies via the Druzhba pipeline.
Quote: "Today we also considered issues related to electricity supplies. Nearly half of Ukraine's electricity imports come from Hungary. However, we concluded that we must act with special caution in this matter, as Hungarians also live on the other side of the border, and stopping electricity exports would primarily affect Zakarpattia, creating particular problems, challenges and suffering for the families living there."
Details: Szijjártó added that "our dispute is not with the people living in Ukraine, not with the families living in Ukraine. Our dispute is with the Ukrainian state, with the Ukrainian government, with President Zelenskyy."
Background:
- Earlier, Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán threatened to stop electricity supplies to Ukraine if oil transit through the Druzhba pipeline is not restored.

Ukrainian forces repel enemy near Ternove, Kalynivske – military spokesperson
Vladyslav Voloshyn, spokesperson for the Southern Defense Forces, said this in a comment to Ukrinform.
"We reported that in certain areas of the frontline, along the border of the Dnipropetrovsk and Zaporizhzhia regions, Ukrainian assault units are conducting counterattacks and offensive operations. Ternove and Kalynivske are among these areas," Voloshyn said.
According to the spokesperson, active Ukrainian operations in the south began around mid-January, with active defense and efforts to regain control of settlements continuing in some sectors.
"Thanks to successful actions, we managed to push back the enemy," Voloshyn said.
He also recalled that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky told France-Presse that up to 300 square kilometers of territory have been liberated in the south due to these operations.
"Tensions and combat activity remain high daily in the Huliaipole and Oleksandrivka sectors. Over the past day, 35 clashes were recorded on the Huliaipole front. Additionally, our units conducted more than 15 search-and-strike and assault operations," the spokesperson added.
Voloshyn noted that the enemy is actively using aircraft to counter Ukrainian units, with over 20 airstrikes recorded, including guided bombs, close air support, army aviation, and more than 40 unguided aerial rockets.
According to DeepState, an interactive online map of the hostilities in Ukraine, Ukrainian forces pushed back the enemy near Kalynivske and Ternove.

The worst supermarket fruit and veg for pesticides
One sample of grapes contained at least 16 different pesticides
- Bookmark
- CommentsGo to comments
Tests have revealed the fruit and vegetables most affected by potentially cancer-linked pesticide mixtures.
Using data released by the government earlier this winter, the Pesticide Action Network (Pan) UK found 12 food items were at risk of a “cocktail effect”, meaning several pesticides mixed together increase the toxicity level of the chemicals.
While the government’s health and safety food monitoring programmes concluded that the vast majority of samples tested contained a safe level of pesticides, Pan UK said the report only tested individual pesticides and not a mix.
Grapes were found to be the worst of all the food groups, with one sample containing the residue of at least 16 different pesticides. At least 90 per cent of the 108 grape samples tested contained multiple pesticides.
A sample of sultana grapes from Turkey included man-made PFA “forever” chemicals, which are toxins that do not break down in the body naturally and can accumulate, leading to cancer and environmental damage.
Grapefruit fared poorly, with around 99 per cent of samples found to contain multiple pesticide residues. One sample was found to contain 10 different types.
Other foods affected included 79 per cent of 24 lime samples, 67 per cent of 73 banana samples, 49 per cent of 96 sweet pepper specimens and 46 per cent of 97 melons. Chilli peppers were found to contain 11 different pesticides, while one sample of broccoli contained eight.
Beans, mushrooms, aubergine and dried beans were also included in the so-called “dirty dozen”.
“We found that a quarter of vegetables and three-quarters of fruit contain multiple pesticides,” Pan UK wrote.
It explained that 123 different chemicals were found in the 17 types of fruit and vegetable tested, which included 42 pesticides with links to cancer and 21 known to interfere with hormone systems that could potentially lead to birth defects, developmental disorders and reproductive issues.
The government’s food monitoring programmes tested 3,482 samples each for an appropriate range of pesticides, testing a total of 1,153,009 food and pesticide combinations.
Surveys conducted across the UK found that 51.26 per cent of the samples had none of the residues the programmes looked for, and 46.67 per cent had residues found at or below the maximum residue limit. Only 2.07 per cent of the samples had residues above this limit, according to the report.
However, Pan UK has argued that the limits need to be reassessed, as they do not take into account chemicals exposed through plastic food packaging and water.
Around 29 per cent of the pesticides found during testing are not approved for use by British farmers, but can slip into the food system when imported from outside the UK.
A spokesperson for the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs told The Independent: "We have placed strict limits on pesticide residues, which are set after rigorous risk assessments to ensure levels are safe for the public. These limits apply to both food produced domestically and imported from other countries.”

A Ukrainian soldier’s story: years of war and fading hope
February 22, 2026Journalist Kostiantyn Honcharov worked with DW until 2022, when he, like many Ukrainians, returned home to join the volunteer army defending against Russia's invasion. The following is his personal report on four years of war in his country.
I honestly still don't understand why this war started, why it continues, and how, when and at what cost it could be brought to an end. To me, war is something archaic, a return to the logic of brute force, at a time when humanity is talking about colonizing Mars.
When the war reached my homeland, I, a man who had never held a weapon in my hand, was faced with the choice of remaining a spectator or helping defend my country. My decision to join the army has less to do with a sense of duty than with the desire to have agency, rather than become a subject of history. It was about the right not to become a victim of circumstances.
Over time, the war lost its abstract nature for me and became deeply personal. It has become a routine, a part of my everyday life. I don't notice any profound psychological changes in myself, perhaps because they have already taken place and become a habit. I can no longer imagine what it's like to live any other way.
I'm pained by the friends who are gone and the places of my past that have been laid to waste. I see what is happening in front-line cities. But I am particularly worried when Kyiv is attacked, writing my loved ones after every bombardment, asking them, "How are you? Do you have electricity? Is your home without heating?"
Problems facing Ukrainian forces
It's not just the fighting that is destroying people. The Ukrainian army has been dogged by problems that have accumulated over the years, and this is aside from discussions over the technological transformation of modern warfare. These persistent problems are beginning to break front-line fighters faster than the enemy.
Mass desertions in the Ukrainian army are not occurring because soldiers have suddenly become cowards or stopped being patriots. The reason is that fighters in front-line units are physically and mentally exhausted.
Exhausted front-line units are not withdrawn to recover. Instead, their deployment is prolonged to the point of inhumanity. Their reinforcements either never arrive or find themselves ill-prepared for what awaits them. After I was wounded and evacuated from the front line in the winter of 2023, only five members of my 30‑man platoon remained behind — all others had been wounded or killed.
With this infantry shortage, decision-makers resort to transferring drivers, cooks, mortarmen, anti-aircraft gunners and supply unit members to the infantry, expecting them to hold the front line without the necessary combat experience. Yet they, too, are wounded, killed or desert. And so, the fighter shortage is only exacerbated.
Ukraine's difficulty replacing exhausted troops
A person's resilience has limits. If rotations were more regular, if soldiers were replaced more often and circumstances a little more humane, we would not have such a dire situation along the front line. We often require soldiers to be heroes when we should allow them to be soldiers — well-trained, equipped and somewhat rested fighters.
The widespread use of drones has made rotations on the front line much more difficult. Detailed route planning, tracking of enemy drones and coordination with electronic warfare units are needed when advancing to the foremost front-line positions and then withdrawing through the "death zone," which stretches for miles. In favorable weather, however, rotations are vital and possible.
After all, if infantrymen spend an average of 60 days on the front line, they can hardly be efficient fighters. The prevailing battle stress is so enormous that it eats a person up inside.
Who is defending Ukraine?
Yes, the war is indeed being waged over much greater distances. Today, fighting and battlefield monitoring are mainly done by using drones. This is a major technological advance.
There are drone units that work closely with the infantry. Yet ultimately, it all boils down to the people in the trenches holding positions. The future of the country depends on how long they can hold out and remain capable of fighting. Unfortunately, there is a shortage of such fighters.
I am not an expert on critical infrastructure or military service fitness. But when the number of men on leave of absence has exceeded 1 million, and you see a group of conscription-age workers painting a small bridge for days on end in the hinterland, you can't shake the feeling that some people are contributing more to the war effort than others.
The illusion of peace negotiations
Soldiers, therefore, have a different take on peace negotiations than civilians. Among the military personnel I speak to, only a few think peace talks offer a real prospect for Ukraine. News of a possible ceasefire creates an illusion that has little to do with what is happening on the battlefield.
For people far from the front line, news of negotiators meeting could give the impression that a kind of peace process has begun, suggesting a solution to end the conflict may be closer than it was yesterday. There may be a sense of a "turning point" and that peace, or a ceasefire, may be on the horizon.
Yet for those on the battlefield, nothing changes. Artillery keeps firing, attacks continue, drones keep flying, and people continue dying.
I really wish I was wrong. I want to return to my family as soon as possible. But the reality is that this battle will rage on for a long time.

First migratory birds back in Switzerland
The bird migration has started: the first migratory birds have returned to their breeding grounds in Switzerland after spending the winter in the south.
+Get the most important news from Switzerland in your inbox
An increase in sightings of starlings and song thrushes is currently being recorded on the “ornitho.ch” observation platform, the Swiss Ornithological Institute in Sempach, canton Lucerne, confirmed to the Swiss News Agency Keystone-SDA.
Although individual starlings spend the winter in Switzerland, the majority of individuals of this bird species spend the winter in southern Europe. Song thrushes are also considered to be short-distance migrants that spend the winter in the Mediterranean region.
+ More than 35,000 migratory birds spotted in Switzerland
In addition to the increased sightings of some short-distance migrants, the bird migration radar of the Swiss Ornithological Institute has also detected an increase in bird movements in recent nights. As around two-thirds of migratory birds migrate at night, an increase in nocturnal bird movements indicates the start of migration.

More advanced maths students needed for science, tech sectors: Hong Kong committee head
Government will review admission score calculation for some universities’ science, technology, engineering, arts and mathematics programmes
Hong Kong must more than double the number of secondary school pupils studying advanced maths to ensure a sufficient pipeline of students pursuing science and technology courses at university and careers in those sectors, according to the head of a curriculum review.
The government plans to review the admission score calculations for some of the universities’ science, technology, engineering, arts and mathematics (STEAM) programmes, as well as revamp the combination of related elective subjects in secondary schools with the aim of encouraging more students to take advanced maths.
Ng Tai-kai, the chairman of the Curriculum Development Council Standing Committee on STEAM education, told the South China Morning Post that many future jobs would require employees to have knowledge of advanced maths, but the number of students studying the necessary subjects remained low.
“Many university STEAM programmes require students to study the two extended maths modules, commonly known as M1 and M2 … but the current number studying these subjects is far from sufficient,” he said.
Mathematics is a core subject of the Diploma of Secondary Education (DSE), Hong Kong’s university entrance examination. Students can choose to study extended modules in calculus and statistics (M1) or calculus and algebra (M2) if schools offer them.
According to examination authorities, 9,114 students will sit for the M1 or M2 exams in the 2026 DSE, representing only 20 per cent of the total number of students taking the core maths exam.

Opinion | China seeks to cultivate a food supply immune to geopolitical shocks
Amid increasing pressure from trade wars and climate change, Beijing is reframing agriculture as a matter of national security
A single policy could redraw global food supply lines and scramble markets from the Americas to Southeast Asia.
In early February, the Communist Party of China’s Central Committee and State Council released the annual “No 1 document”, the country’s first policy statement of 2026 and its blueprint for agriculture, farmers and rural areas. As one of the world’s largest agricultural producers, importers and exporters, any shift in Beijing’s food strategy carries global repercussions.
Covering grain, vegetables, livestock and fisheries, this document calls for stable, higher-quality and more efficient output while linking domestic production to trade. It emphasises expanding high-standard farmland, strengthening disaster resilience, accelerating agricultural science and technology innovation, including biotechnology, stabilising output and addressing labour shortages.
Crucially, the plan signals a strategic shift towards food import diversification, reflecting Beijing’s concerns about over-reliance on any single country or region for imports. The policy elevates national security, technological self-reliance and agricultural resilience as central objectives.

Holding national elections while Ukraine remains under martial law would be “a poison for the country,” Kyiv Mayor Vitali Klitschko told TVP World, arguing that political competition during the war risks weakening Ukraine from within.
Klitschko, a former heavyweight boxing champion who has led the Ukrainian capital since 2014, spoke on the eve of the fourth anniversary of Russia’s full-scale invasion, reflecting on the first hours of the attack and the strain of running a city repeatedly hit by strikes on critical infrastructure.
JOIN US ON TELEGRAM
Follow our coverage of the war on the @Kyivpost_official.
Winter pressure on Kyiv
Klitschko described what he called the hardest winter of the war so far, with temperatures plunging to around -20°C and repeated Russian attacks disrupting heating, water and electricity for thousands of residents.
He said repair work is often “reset” by fresh strikes, forcing municipal crews back to “point zero” as they race to restore basic services after each new wave of missile and drone attacks.
Russia has continued to target Ukraine’s energy system in recent weeks, launching large-scale strikes on multiple regions and compounding outages during freezing conditions.
Unity is the key
Pressed about reported tensions with President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, Klitschko criticized public infighting and urged politicians to “forget about political games” while the war continues, adding that national unity is essential to resisting Russia’s aggression.
A Personal Tribute to a Friend, Courageous Opponent of Soviet Political Abuses of Psychiatry
He said any negotiations must safeguard Ukraine’s national interests and include credible security guarantees, warning that a temporary pause in fighting could give Russia time to regroup for a future assault.
Klitschko also appealed to European audiences not to see the war as distant. “If you think this war doesn’t touch you personally, it’s the biggest mistake,” he said, calling for sustained support to maintain pressure on Moscow.
Warmth from Poland
The mayor highlighted aid from Poland, thanking Polish citizens and Warsaw Mayor Rafał Trzaskowski for their support, including fundraising drives that delivered generators and other equipment to help keep the city running during blackouts.
Poland recently sent hundreds of generators and heaters to Ukraine amid continued strikes on infrastructure and a deepening winter heating crisis
Klitschko argued that Ukraine’s ability to hold the line directly affects the security of the wider region, insisting that a “successful Ukraine” would make Europe—and Poland in particular—stronger and safer.

Sudan decries Uganda’s reception of RSF commander as ‘blatant disregard of crimes of genocide’
RSF commander’s visit to Uganda marked his first appearance since September
ISTANBUL
Sudan on Sunday called Uganda's reception of the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) commander, Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo, “a blatant disregard for the crimes of genocide.”
Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni met with Dagalo on Sunday at the presidential palace in Entebbe.
This reception “is an unprecedented step that contradicts Uganda's commitments to good neighborliness, at a time when innocent lives are being lost," the Sudanese Foreign Ministry said in a statement.
“Atrocities committed by the terrorist militia (RSF) have been documented by the international community and condemned by regional organizations to which Uganda belongs, such as the African Union," it added.
The ministry condemned Dagalo’s reception in Uganda as “a step that disregards the most basic human values and ignores the scale of the crimes committed against Sudanese citizens.”
“It also violates the laws governing relations between member states of regional and international organizations and constitutes support for rebel forces against a legitimate, internationally recognized government."
While respecting Uganda’s right to “receive whomever it wishes” and have bilateral relations with, the ministry said the move “reflects a new policy of the Ugandan government towards Sudan, supporting the rebels and acting against the unity, security, and safety of the Sudanese people."
This step "is direct support for the genocidal crimes committed by the rebels against civilians, which have been documented by independent international organizations," it stressed.
“The Sudanese government will not allow its territory or the territory of neighboring countries to be used to support rebel forces against the state," the ministry said.
There was no immediate comment from Uganda on the Sudanese statement.
Dagalo’s visit to Uganda marked his first appearance since September, when he toured Nyala, the capital of South Darfur in western Sudan.
Sudan has been locked in a bloody conflict between the army and the RSF since April 2023, killing tens of thousands, displacing about 13 million people, and creating one of the world’s worst humanitarian crises, according to UN reports.

Ex-defence secretary accuses Nigel Farage of ‘performing Maga stunt’ with failed Chagos ‘aid mission’
Former defence secretary Ben Wallace hit out at Nigel Farage’s actions, saying that no MP can visit the Chagos archipelago without pre-clearance and accusing him of performing Trump-style stunts

Nigel Farage has been accused of “performing Maga stunts” by a former defence secretary, after his plan to deliver aid to the Chagos Islands was blocked.
The Reform UK leader had flown to the Maldives to join a delegation carrying food and medicine to support four Chagossians who were attempting to set up a permanent base on a deserted island, as part of a mission to establish a colony in their former homeland.
Mr Farage had boarded a boat carrying food and medicines preparing to make the 24-hour trip to Ile du Coin, which sits 300 miles from the Maldives.
But sources told The Telegraph the plans failed because UK authorities insisted that only trained crew should be on board.
The newspaper reported that Mr Farage, who had been due to return to the UK on Saturday night, had received a phone call from a senior source in the Maldives government warning him that British officials wanted him to be prevented from setting foot on the island.
Former defence secretary Ben Wallace hit out, saying that no MP can visit the archipelago without pre-clearance and accusing him of performing Trump-style stunts.
Posting to social media platform X, he added: “It is a serious Military base which does serious work. It doesn’t need a pub bore like Nigel (who didn’t even appoint a defence spokesperson this week) performing MAGA stunts.”
Sir Ben – who served as defence secretary under the previous Conservative government from July 2019 to August 2023 – was referring to Mr Farage’s unveiling of his top team this week, which included spokespeople for education, home affairs, the economy and business.
No spokesperson for defence has yet been appointed by the party.
In the wake of the incident, the Reform leader said: “The British government has made every effort to prevent me heading towards the Chagos Islands. They have asked the Maldives government to stop me from leaving here and setting foot on the boat.
“This was information conveyed to me by a senior figure in the Maldives government. I cannot believe such an attempt has been made to stop a British citizen from reaching British territory.
“My source told me the British were ‘very concerned’ about me and wanted to know why I was here. This trip is a humanitarian mission and I don’t want my presence to jeopardise that.”
The four Chagossians travelled to the island on Tuesday to protest the government’s deal to hand sovereignty of the British Indian Ocean Territory to Mauritius.
The agreement has faced intense criticism both domestically and abroad, with Donald Trump throwing the deal into doubt this week after he launched a fresh attack on the plans.
Earlier this week, Mr Trump urged Sir Keir Starmer not to “give away Diego Garcia” – an island on the archipelago which is home to a joint UK-US military base – despite Washington signalling its official backing for the deal on Tuesday.
Thousands of people were forcibly removed from the archipelago in the 1960s and 70s to build the air base.

Display of St. Francis of Assisi's bones confirms enduring appeal of relics for Christians
The bones of St. Francis of Assisi have gone on public display for the first time
- Bookmark
The bones of St. Francis of Assisi went on public display for the first time Sunday, capping an 800-year saga over his bodily remains and confirming the enduring appeal to Christians of venerating a saint’s relics.
Nearly 400,000 people registered in advance to see the bone fragments, which are contained in a slim, bulletproof Plexiglas case in the lower Basilica of St. Francis in the hilltop Umbrian town the medieval friar made famous.
The Franciscans decided to exhibit the bones for one month, through March 22, to honor the 800th anniversary of St. Francis ’ death in 1226. The aim is to revive his message of peace and fraternity that made him one of the most beloved Christian saints and inspired Pope Francis to take his name, the first pope to do so.
The exposition of his bodily remains is particularly remarkable given the somewhat tortured history of the body of St. Francis, a wealthy merchant’s son born in 1182 who gave up all his possessions to live as a mendicant friar.
At the end of his life, St. Francis’ body was said to have acquired the stigmata, the first documented case of a saint acquiring the marks of Christ on the cross.
In death, his body was lost for hundreds of years, after it was secretly buried by one of his followers who feared it would be stolen during the fight over relics that was common in Christianity in the Middle Ages.
That history is recounted in an exhibition mounted in the Franciscan convent, adjacent to the basilica, which pilgrims can visit as part of their appointment to pass by the bones.
A fascination with relics that isn’t gruesome
Brother Giulio Cesareo, spokesman for the Franciscans in Assisi, said the exposition wasn’t a macabre celebration of the dead. Rather, he said, it was part of the long tradition of Christians venerating the physical remains of saints to experience the spirit that lived in them.
“It is not so much about venerating Francis, but rather encountering Francis by venerating the Holy Spirit who filled that humanity and made it capable of giving itself,” he said. “And it is, at least for a believer, a way to renew oneself in this one life.”
Over centuries, the fascination with relics has of course led to abuses, with thefts, forgeries and now online sales all part of their history. But that doesn’t diminish their hold on the faithful, said Sean Pilcher, who runs Sacra: Relics of the Saints, which provides consulting and authentication services to the Catholic Church.
If the saints are our brothers and sisters in heaven, “then it makes sense that we’re going to have things that we hold on to,” he said. “And what the church does is just take this natural desire that we all have for connection and belonging and direct it in a way that leads us toward Christ.”
For Fiorella Farina, a resident of northern Reggio Emilia who is so devoted to St. Francis that she bought a country house in Assisi and named her children Francesco and Francesca, the exposition is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.
“Just talking about it gives me goosebumps,” she said outside the basilica. “It’s an event I couldn’t miss.”
St. Francis, she said, went against all societal norms to live out the Gospel message of peace, care for the poor and the environment.
“In this historic moment, we need him,” she said.
Security significant but discreet to protect bones
Security was tight but discreet on Sunday morning as the first pilgrims passed through metal detectors before filing into the basilica. Police declined to provide details, but said extra officers, sniffer dogs, plain-clothed police, television cameras and other measures were being used to protect the relics.
Given the history of St. Francis’ body, such measures seem only appropriate.
Even before he died, St. Francis had gained such a reputation for sanctity that he traveled with an armed escort when he made his final return to Assisi, said Brother William Short, professor of Christian spirituality at the Franciscan School of Theology at the University of San Diego.
There are also references in contemporary accounts of people reaching up to try to grab parts of his tunic as he went by on horseback, believing that his relics could help heal the sick or prevent calamity, Short said in an interview at the Franciscan residence in Rome, where he directs an international Franciscan study center.
When St. Francis died Oct. 3, 1226, he was initially buried in a small Assisi church, San Giorgio. Within two years, Pope Gregory IX had canonized him and laid the cornerstone for a basilica to house his tomb.
But on the eve of the transfer, St. Francis’ trusted aide, Brother Elias, took the body and secretly buried it in the basilica, fearing it could be stolen, said Short. The body remained there, hidden in a column but unmarked, until 1818. That's when excavations discovered the remains and Pope Pius VII confirmed the bones belonged to St. Francis.
“It was a matter of safety and economics,” Short explained. “If you have a big saint, a new saint — and this guy had the potential to be a really big saint — whoever gets the body gets the pilgrims.”
And Assisi now has them, in spades.
Some people signed up to visit the relics when the exposition was first announced in October, and they were slotted into 10-minute increments starting Sunday morning.
Silvanella Tamos traveled to Assisi from Pordenone, north of Venice, with a group of 54 people from her diocese. They had had one of the earliest slots Sunday, at 9:30 a.m.
“It’s a body that’s alive,” she said. “It’s not a dead body. He still has a lot to tell us today,” she said.

Herzl sculptures and rare memorabilia up for auction to support lone soldiers

An original IDF strategy map from 1948’s Operation Hiram on the northern front, an old armored vehicle periscope and a memorial parchment signed by David Ben-Gurion are among the rare heritage items now up for auction. All proceeds will go toward establishing an alumni fund to support dozens of lone soldiers from North America, graduates of the Hannoton Leadership Academy, who are set to enlist in the coming days.
The auction, scheduled to take place over the next two weeks, was launched through a partnership between the Hannoton Leadership Academy and Curio Auctions, operated by Keren Israel and specializing in Jewish and Israeli historical artifacts. The items, all donated by private collectors who chose to remain anonymous, form what organizers describe as an open archive of Zionist history.
Among the featured items on the Curio website is an official memorial parchment bearing Ben-Gurion’s signature, commemorating Pvt. Shalom Zamirin, who was killed in the Battle of Tzemach four days after the establishment of the state. The item is valued at $4,500 to $5,000. Also listed are an attack map from Operation Hiram, valued at $1,100 to $1,300; rare Sabbath candlesticks by Israeli artist Yaacov Agam; a 1945 pamphlet calling for Jewish enlistment in the Jewish Brigade; and a rare photograph of Yitzhak Rabin during his tenure as Israel’s ambassador to the United States.
“People who participate in charity auctions like this are not simply collectors checking how much an item is worth, as they might at Sotheby’s or Christie’s,” said Jay Shultz, president of Keren Israel and director of the auction house. “Purchasing these items connects those who made the country’s history with those who are making it today.”
One of the most moving items, Shultz said, is the portion of the official memorial parchment signed by Prime Minister David Ben-Gurion, expressing condolences to the Zamirin family over the death of their son, Pvt. Shalom, in the May 18, 1948, battle near the Sea of Galilee. Seventy-eight years later, the yellowed parchment will be sold to support other pioneering soldiers who left their homes overseas to join Israel’s military and settlement efforts. “For me, these items honor the past for the sake of the future,” added Shultz, who immigrated to Israel from New Jersey about two decades ago.
The financial goal of the auction is directed entirely toward the first cohort of Garin Tzabar at the Hannoton Leadership Academy, which is also supported by Keren Kayemeth LeIsrael and JNF USA. The 27 participants in the program are not recent high school graduates but bachelor’s degree holders from universities in the United States and Canada.
Unlike other frameworks that place lone soldiers in either religious or secular kibbutzim, this cohort is mixed, including secular, Orthodox, Reform and Conservative participants. “They are people whose lives were set,” Rabbi Yoav Ende, head of the academy, told Yedioth Ahronoth. “October 7 changed everything. They finished their degrees, boarded a plane and came to us. They are looking for community and a sense of belonging, and they represent a Jewish mosaic that it is our responsibility to help complete.”
The funds raised will establish a foundation to support them after their military service ends. “During their service, the entire country embraces lone soldiers,” Ende said. “But the day after their discharge, the title ‘lone soldier’ disappears and they are considered regular citizens. Yet they have no family support network here. The goal is to provide them with backing for the next 10 years, so they will not remain alone the day after.”

Milan Cortina Olympics to close at Verona Arena as Olympic flag passes to France
The Milan Cortina Winter Games will close with a ceremony inside the ancient Verona Arena, bringing the spread-out Olympics together one last time
- Bookmark
The Milan Cortina Olympics end Sunday with a closing ceremony inside the ancient Verona Arena, roughly mid-distance between the far-flung mountain, valley and city venues that made these the most spread-out Winter Games in Olympic history.
The 2½-hour ceremony will celebrate Italian music and dance, both classic and contemporary, headlining internationally acclaimed ballet dancer Roberto Bolle along with popular Italian singer Achille Lauro and DJ Gaby Ponte.
Organizers are expecting some 1,500 Olympians, a bit over half those who competed in the Games, to parade into the monument built in the first century for gladiator fights and exotic animal hunts.
They will enter en masse behind a pair of flag bearers from each of the 92 participating nations, including biathlete Lisa Vittozzi and speedskater Davide Ghiotto for host Italy, and hockey player Hilary Knight and ice dancer Evan Bates for the United States – all gold medal winners.
Some 12,000 spectators will join the athletes and officials for the closing ceremony. It will be much more intimate than the opening ceremony, which starred Mariah Carey and Andrea Bocelli inside Milan’s San Siro soccer stadium, attended by more than 60,000 people.
The ceremony will celebrate Italian lyric opera, which has been recognized by the U.N. cultural agency UNESCO as a global treasure, but also pay tribute to contemporary Italian classics. Both opera and dance are at home in the stone amphitheater, which each summer hosts a popular opera festival with lavish productions and the gala dance performance titled Roberto Bolle and Friends.
This is the first Games for the International Olympic Committee president, Kirsty Coventry, a two-time Olympic champion in swimming, who will oversee the ceremony alongside Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni.
One of the key moments of the ceremony is when the Olympic flag is handed over to the next Winter Games host nation, France, and its flag is raised next to Italy’s and Greece’s.
The Milan Cortina Games spanned an area of 22,000 square kilometers (8,500 square miles), from ice sports in Milan to biathlon in Anterselva on the Austrian border, snowboarding and men’s downhill in Valtellina on the Swiss border, cross-country skiing in the Val di Fiemme north of Verona and women’s downhill, curling and sliding sports in co-host Cortina d’Ampezzo.
It’s a model that will remain for future Games, to avoid the expense of building new facilities. The 2030 Winter Games in the French Alps will stage events in the Alps and Nice, on the Mediterranean Sea, while speedskating will be held abroad in a venue to be decided.
The closing ceremony will conclude with the Olympic flames being extinguished at the unprecedented two cauldrons in Milan and Cortina, to be viewed via video link. A light show will substitute fireworks, which are not allowed in Verona, to protect animals from being disturbed.
A total of 116 medal events have been held in eight Olympic sports across 16 disciplines, including the debut of ski mountaineering this year, over the course of 17 days of competition.
The Milan Cortina Paralympics' opening ceremony will also take place in the Verona Arena, on March 6, and the Games will run until March 15.

U.S.-born skier Eileen Gu defends Olympic ski halfpipe gold at Milano Cortina Games
Eileen Gu defended her Olympic ski halfpipe title on Sunday to make it six medals in six events over her Winter Games career.
The 22-year-old Gu, American-born but competing for her mother's homeland of China, is already the most decorated freeskier in the short history of the sport at the Olympics. She also captured two silver medals at the Milan Cortina Games, to pair with two golds and a silver from the Beijing Games.
Gu won the event on the strength of her second run, a clean, technically sound pass. She got even better in her final run — pumping his ski poles after landing the final trick — and finished with a score of 94.75. Her teammate, Li Fanghui, took silver and Zoe Atkin of Britain was third.
"She is unreal. It's pretty crazy how good she is," New Zealand's Mischa Thomas said of Gu. "She is 'Wonder Woman.'"
The event was rescheduled to Sunday following a big snowstorm the night before. It was a bright, sunny day as Gu shone in the final event at the Livigno Snow Park. She shielded her eyes from the sun to catch a peek of her winning score — and instantly liked what she saw.
There were quite a few Gu fans at the base of the halfpipe, holding up pictures of her and waving flags.
Atkin, an American-born skier who competes for her father's homeland of Britain, soared high all contest, a staggering 5.4 meters (18 feet) above the pipe at one point. She finished ninth at the Beijing Games but has been a steady presence on World Cup podiums ever since. She has three victories over the last four years, all in events where Gu didn't compete. The 23-year-old Atkin is the defending world champion.
In her second run, Thomas dropped into the halfpipe — and dropped her phone. It had to be retrieved for Thomas. After the competition, she reported: "My phone is great. Never been better."
Svea Irving was a "DNS" — did not start — in the American's second run. She returned for a third run but struggled to complete a maneuver and finished in 11th.
"It was pretty insane," Thomas said on the broadcast of the competition.
Atkin took the lead after the first run with a smooth performance. Meanwhile, Gu lost her balance on her first trick and cut the run short.
Cassie Sharpe of Canada sat out the final after a hard crash in Thursday's qualifying round. She won the gold in the event at the 2018 PyeongChang Games and silver four years later in Beijing.

Ex-Philippines President Duterte suffers setback as ICC denies 2 pleas ahead of key hearing
4-day confirmation of charges hearing set to begin Monday will determine whether there are substantial grounds to believe Rodrigo Duterte committed crimes against humanity
ISTANBUL
The International Criminal Court (ICC) has denied two pleas by former Philippines President Rodrigo Duterte, who faces crimes against humanity charges, just a day before the confirmation of charges hearing in The Hague, local media reported on Sunday.
The ICC's Pre-Trial Chamber, in a unanimous decision, rejected a defense request to compel the prosecution to disclose further identifying information about certain witnesses and to submit less-redacted versions of key documents, including one containing the charges and the pre-confirmation brief, the Manila Times reported.
The judges also denied a defense request to disqualify the external legal representatives of victims of Duterte’s drug war, saying his lawyers had not adequately demonstrated any conflict of interest or legal impediment that would warrant the removal of the victims’ lawyers.
The four-day confirmation of charges hearing, set to begin on Monday, will determine whether there are substantial grounds to believe Duterte committed crimes against humanity in connection with killings linked to his anti-drug campaign as mayor of Davao City and later as president, a post he held from 2016 to 2022.
The detained ex-president will not be at the hearing, in person or online, as he has waived his right to be there, citing his rejection of the ICC’s jurisdiction and his health.
Presiding Judge Iulia Antoanella Motoc, joined by Reine Alapini-Gansou and Maria del Socorro Flores Liera, ruled that existing redactions — which obscure only information that could identify victims and witnesses — appropriately balance the principle of public proceedings with the court’s obligation under the Rome Statute to ensure the safety and dignity of those involved
Opposing the request earlier this week, the prosecution argued that the redactions were necessary due to sensitive security-related information concerning victims and witnesses.
The chamber also rejected a defense request to compel the prosecution to declare the whereabouts and availability of certain witnesses for trial, noting that no legal basis had been provided to support such a demand under the court’s framework.
The judges have already granted requests from both the defense team and the prosecutors to expand their respective lists of evidence.
Duterte, 80, who has detained at the ICC detention facility in The Hague since last March, faces three counts of crimes against humanity linked to drug war deaths between 2011 and 2019.

US Envoy Witkoff says Iran could be ‘a week away’ from enriching uranium to weapons grade
'They're probably a week away from having industrial-grade bomb-making material,' says Steve Witkoff, adding: 'And that's really dangerous'
ISTANBUL
US President Donald Trump’s Middle East Envoy Steve Witkoff said Saturday that Iran could be about "a week away" from producing industrial-grade bomb-making material, calling the situation “very dangerous” and reiterating Washington’s red lines in ongoing nuclear talks.
Speaking to Fox News, Witkoff said Iran has enriched uranium up to 60%, which he argued exceeds levels needed for civilian nuclear purposes.
“They’re probably a week away from having industrial-grade bomb-making material,” Witkoff said. “That’s really dangerous. So they can’t have that.”
He said before talks with Iran, Trump instructed him and Jared Kushner, the president’s son-in-law and unofficial aide, that there would be “zero enrichment” and that the US would seek the return of nuclear material. Witkoff said the US position is that Iran must not enrich uranium and must hand over its stockpiled material. “There have been some very hard red lines drawn,” he said.
Witkoff added that Trump has questioned why Iran, under significant US pressure and naval presence in the region, has not declared that it is not seeking a nuclear weapon.
He also confirmed that, at Trump’s direction, he met with Reza Pahlavi, the exiled son of Iran’s overthrown shah, to discuss developments, including protests in Iran. He described Pahlavi as someone who cares about his country but said US policy would be determined by Trump’s approach.
There has not yet been any response from Iran to Witkoff's claims.

Explosions kill police officer and injure 25 in western Ukraine
A 23-year-old female police officer has been killed and 25 people injured in what Ukrainian officials have called a terror attack in the western city of Lviv.
Two homemade explosive devices detonated after police crews responded to a reported break-in shortly after midnight on Sunday, the National Police of Ukraine said. The devices were planted in waste bins, it added.
President Volodymyr Zelensky confirmed "an individual suspected of carrying out the terrorist attack" had been detained. Lviv Mayor Andriy Sadovyi said she was a Ukrainian woman.
The police later said the 33-year-old suspect had made and planted the explosives on the "instruction" of an agent of Russia's special services.
The victim of the attack was named as Viktoria Shpylka.
"She was only 23 years old and had begun her service at the start of the full-scale invasion of the Kherson region," the police wrote on Telegram on Sunday morning.
Police said the first blast occurred after a police car arrived at the scene of the reported break-in at a shop in the city centre.
"Later, when a second crew arrived, another explosion went off," it added.
Eleven people were admitted to hospital, six of whom were law enforcement officers in serious conditions.
Interior Minister Ihor Klymenko said police and the Security Service of Ukraine had detained the suspect, a resident of the north-western Rivne region.
"We are identifying other persons involved in committing this crime," he wrote on Telegram.
Meanwhile, the regional prosecutor's office said it had started an investigation into the "act of terrorism that led to grave consequences".
Elsewhere, Ukraine faced another night of overnight Russian strikes ahead of the fourth anniversary of Moscow's full-scale invasion on Tuesday.
Kyiv said its air defences had countered 50 Russian missiles and nearly 300 drones overnight. The attacks targeted the energy sector, residential buildings, and railways, Zelensky said.
At least one person was killed in the Kyiv region, top local official Mykola Kalashnyk said, while a woman and a child were taken to hospital with injuries.
The latest aerial attack comes two days before the fourth anniversary of Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine.
The invasion ordered by President Vladimir Putin has become the biggest war in Europe since World War Two, with hundreds of thousands of military casualties -killed, wounded and missing - believed to be on each side.
Western military experts estimate that Russian combat losses have been much higher than Ukraine's.
Moscow currently controls about 20% of Ukrainian territory, including the southern Crimea peninsula it annexed in 2014.

How four years of Ukraine war have changed Russia

How four years of Ukraine war have changed Russia
From curbs on rights to fewer choices at the market, the war has taken its toll. Still, support for it remains high. Al Jazeera speaks to people in Russia and Russians abroad.
Nearly four years ago, Russian President Vladimir Putin announced on national TV that the country’s armed forces had begun a full-scale invasion of Ukraine.
The war, known by its official euphemism of “special military operation” (SMO), has now lasted longer than Russia’s involvement in World War II from 1941 to 1945. Russian combat deaths, verified by the BBC and the independent Russian outlet MediaZona, have now topped 186,000 – nearly 13 times the Red Army’s losses during the entire 1980s war in Afghanistan, which lasted a decade and included soldiers from across the Soviet Union.
But while millions of Ukrainian refugees have fled and those who remain brave a bitter winter as Russian missiles batter the country’s energy infrastructure, how have the past four years changed Russia? Al Jazeera spoke with people inside and outside the country to learn how life has changed since February 24, 2022.
Life goes on
Areas of western Russia bordering Ukraine, such as the Kursk and Belgorod regions, have come under artillery barrages, drone strikes and even ground incursions from Ukrainian forces with part of Kursk falling under Ukrainian control temporarily.
“Just over a year ago whilst Ukrainian forces were still in this region, you’d get strikes multiple times per day,” said 25-year-old YouTuber Ben the Brit, who moved to Kursk with his Russian wife in 2021.
“I think what might shock people is how used to it locals became and me included in that. Nobody ran to shelters with each strike. Otherwise, you’d never be able to live your life. You’d always be in there.”
According to the local news site Fonar.tv, at least 458 civilians have been killed in Ukrainian attacks on the Belgorod region since the war began.
But major metropolises, such as Moscow and St Petersburg, have barely felt the war while the sanctions imposed by Ukraine’s Western allies are mere inconveniences.
“It’s so expensive. I’m in shock,” said Andrey, a 30-year-old Muscovite.
“It’s just like Europe – everybody’s complaining about the prices there too. Even if you only buy some beer, cigs and chocolate, you still wind up spending at least 1,000 roubles [$13] at the store. But in Moscow, people’s purchasing power hasn’t obviously fallen much. Kids are crowded in lines at supermarket cafes. The whole city is full of taxi drivers and endless delivery drivers.”
Some things have changed.
“It became very problematic to find some brands that you used to buy before,” said Kirill F, a 39-year-old photographer from St Petersburg who requested that his full name not be disclosed.
“They can be found from resellers, but they’ve become more expensive, and they’re no longer sold in stores,” he said. Some South Korean brands have returned to Russia, he said. LG washing machines and refrigerators are now available again.
Chinese brands are also available, but they are “not as good quality as the tech we used to get from Germany or Poland”, Kirill said.
To get around overseas payment restrictions because of Western sanctions, for example on apps, Kirill opened a bank account in Kyrgyzstan. It’s not an insurmountable obstacle but an annoyance, he said.
But Kirill is less sanguine about the restrictions imposed by his own government. Since 2022, the Kremlin has introduced strict laws penalising what it calls “fake news” about the invasion. Additionally, the authorities have blocked social media such as Instagram and Facebook and made it harder to use WhatsApp, Telegram and YouTube, promoting state-backed alternatives such RuTube and the messaging app Max instead.
“At first, we were blocked from using Facebook, but we had few people using it and they just installed VPNs, and then YouTube was banned,” Kirill recounted.
“For ordinary citizens, this blockage just worsens life. That’s all. Younger people perceive it as a violation of their personal life, and they will grow up hating the state.”
Opinions about the war
Opinion polls consistently find the war enjoys widespread support among the public although analysts cautioned that laws criminalising antiwar sentiment make it hard to judge the accuracy of these polls.
The brother of 30-year-old Vladislav from Saratov in southwestern Russia enlisted as a drone pilot in the Russian forces a month ago. The Russian military now attracts plenty of recruits through generous pay packets rather than relying on conscripts.
“At first, I thought [the war] was wrong, like what ‘denazification’ are you talking about?” Vladislav told Al Jazeera via Telegram before hastily deleting his messages. The Kremlin has described the Ukrainian leadership under President Volodymyr Zelenskyy as pro-Nazi, and has insisted that its military operation is driven by a desire to “denazify” Ukraine.
“But then the Ukrainian side started posting photos of swastikas, SS skulls and other symbols of fascist ideology,” Vladislav said, referring to symbols that have appeared on some Ukrainian soldiers’ uniforms and unit flags. “… Both my grandparents were WWII veterans; may they rest in peace.”
Now, he said, he agrees with Russia’s war on Ukraine. “Zelenskyy and his entire fascist fraternity must be destroyed, no more prisons. … I hope my brother will make a huge contribution,” he added. “He’s a great guy, an excellent driver, and the fact that he spent so much time playing simulation games will help him defeat every Nazi scum in Ukraine.”
Kirill, too, had his doubts about the invasion, considering the outbreak of war a failure of Russian diplomacy, and still shakes his head when he sees Russian pro-war symbols in public.
But as time went on, his attitude towards both peace and liberals grew more jaded.
“We read both the foreign press and the liberal analysts, who told us the Russian economy had two weeks left, yet here we are four years later, and everything’s fine. What do you think our attitude will be towards the people who told us such things?” he asked rhetorically.
“I believe that since it’s already begun, we need to go all the way to victory,” Kirill added. “If you started a fight, you can’t just say ‘I’m sorry’ and stop. That is to say, I don’t support [the invasion], but I also don’t support reparations, all this nonsense. No one will go for it. Even among those who are against the war, they don’t want to lose completely because their lives will be adversely affected.”
Then there’s the question of apathy. Historically, many Russians have concerned themselves more with day-to-day survival than the machinations of power, a trend that has continued with the “special military operation”.
“Everyone’s in denial. Almost everyone in my circles is staunchly apolitical and tries to ignore the news,” Andrey observed.
Going AWOL
But denial is impossible for some.
Seeing the carnage up close made Alexander Medvedev* change his mind. Having completed both his national service, a 12-month mandatory draft, and a previous deployment to Syria, the 38-year-old trucker from Kemerovo in Siberia was mobilised into the elite Ural Battalion, where he was assigned the post of machinegunner in a support platoon.
“We’d been told for years that everything in Ukraine was steeped in Nazism and hatred of Russia and Russians,” he told Al Jazeera.
“At the time, I thought and assumed this was a punitive operation aimed at the regime in that country than at the Ukrainian people as a whole.”
By January 2023, Medvedev’s unit entered the Luhansk region of eastern Ukraine, setting up base in an abandoned mine. Medvedev considered himself lucky to have been assigned to a support platoon because the assault squads “suffered 60 or 70 percent casualties in an hour of combat”.
Travelling through war-torn Ukrainian villages and speaking with the locals, Medvedev began questioning his mission. “The realisation that I was fighting a war that no one needed, that would bring no good to anyone in this world but would only produce a mountain of corpses, widows, orphans and miserable mothers and fathers haunted me,” he told Al Jazeera.
On July 7, 2023, he went AWOL and tried to return to his hometown.
“For the first few months after returning, I didn’t understand what was going on around me at all. There was a war somewhere, but here in Siberia or the Urals, people were living as if nothing was happening.”
Facing criminal indictment for abandoning his post, Medvedev contacted the organisation Get Lost, which helps draft dodgers and deserters. With its help, he escaped abroad.
“I miss my homeland very much. I hope to return but to a different country where people will begin to value and cherish peace.”
‘Get the hell out’
In the first year of the war, experts estimated that about two million Russians left their motherland. Among them were young men fearing they would be conscripted and sent to the front lines as well as those with deeply held anti-Putin convictions, such as 35-year-old Mike* from Russia’s fourth largest city.
Mike packed one small bag and decided “to get the hell out of Yekaterinburg”.
Mike has since settled in Berlin, where he’s involved in an activist community helping those still in the country. But he’s grown disillusioned with both the West and the liberal Russian opposition.
“The genocide in Gaza conducted in front of our very eyes with the clear complicity of Western elites shattered whatever illusions one could have about the Western powers helping Ukraine,” he sighed.
If the West isn’t ready to intervene more directly, Mike said, then a compromise seems more reasonable, even if that essentially means a defeat for Ukraine.
“After four years, the situation looks really bleak, and this winter in Ukraine, Putin’s regime showed its most cynical, completely inhumane nature by destroying civic infrastructure all across the country. That tells you a lot about how far they can go in pursuing their goals.”
Because of difficulties fitting in or finding work in their host countries, many Russian emigres have since returned home. Rising anti-immigrant sentiment, including in Germany, isn’t helping.
“Life is good, but I’m more and more conscious of my immigration status,” Mike said. “I didn’t plan on leaving [Russia], but I’m not fantasising about returning.”

Landlord bias ‘pushing young people into homelessness’
- Charities warn that young people are being forced into homelessness or unsafe living conditions due to "unfair" discrimination in the private rental sector.
- EveryYouth found landlords frequently reject young tenants based on age, profession, lack of a family guarantor, or previous connection to homelessness services, even when they can afford rent.
- While the Renters' Rights Act will introduce new protections against discrimination for some groups, EveryYouth said that it may not adequately address the challenges faced by young renters and could inadvertently worsen their situation.
- EveryYouth is urging the government to implement stronger protections against age discrimination, including penalties for landlords.
- The Government said age-related discrimination is unacceptable, and it will “keep action under review” to extend the powers in the Renters’ Rights Act.

France to summon US ambassador over comments on far-right activist’s death

PARIS - French Foreign Minister Jean-Noel Barrot said on Feb 22 that he would summon US ambassador to France Charles Kushner over comments on the killing of a French far-right activist
French far-right activist Quentin Deranque was beaten to death in a fight with alleged hard-left activists, in an incident that shocked the nation and has been called “France’s Charlie Kirk moment”, referring to the 2025 shooting of the US conservative activist.
The US Embassy in France and the US State Department’s Bureau of Counterterrorism said they were monitoring the case, warning on social media platform X that “violent radical leftism was on the rise” and should be treated as a public safety threat.
“We refuse all political opportunism around this drama, which is the bereavement of a French family,” Mr Barrot said during an interview with French media outlets France Info, France Inter and Le Monde.
He added that he would also raise the US sanctions against former European commissioner Thierry Breton and French judge at the International Criminal Court Nicolas Guillou, describing the measures as attacks on the autonomy of European Union decision-making and the independence of the international justice system.
The Tribune newspaper reported on the night of Feb 21 that French President Emmanuel Macron had written to US President Donald Trump asking him to lift the sanctions against Mr Breton and Judge Guillou. REUTERS

After two years of war, defense tech buoys Israel’s economic recovery

After two years of war, defense tech buoys Israel’s economic recovery
Though entire tech sector took serious hit from workers’ reserve duty, air traffic pauses and brain drain, demand is now high for technology that was honed and tested in wartime
AFP — Israel’s vital tech sector, dragged down by the Gaza war, is showing early signs of recovery, buoyed by a surge in defense innovation and fresh investment momentum.
Cutting-edge technologies represent 17 percent of the country’s GDP, 11.5 percent of jobs and 57 percent of exports, according to the latest available data from the Israel Innovation Authority (IIA), published in September 2025.
But like the rest of the economy, the sector was not spared the knock-on effects of the war, which began with the Hamas terror group’s October 7, 2023, attack and led to staffing shortages and skittishness from would-be backers.
Now, with a ceasefire largely holding in the Strip since October, Israel’s appeal is gradually returning, as illustrated in mid-December, when US chip giant Nvidia announced it would create a massive research and development center in the north that could host up to 10,000 employees.
“Investors are coming to Israel nonstop,” Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said at the time.
After the war, the recovery can’t come soon enough.
“High-tech companies had to overcome massive staffing cuts, because 15 to 20 percent of employees, and sometimes more, were called up” to the front as reservists, IIA director Dror Bin told AFP.
To make matters worse, in late 2023 and 2024, “air traffic, a crucial element of this globalized sector, was suspended, and foreign investors froze everything while waiting to see what would happen,” he added.
The war also sparked a brain drain in Israel.
Between October 2023 and July 2024, about 8,300 employees in advanced technologies left the country for a year or more, according to an IIA report published in April 2025.
The figure represents around 2.1 percent of the sector’s workforce.
The report did not specify how many employees left Israel to work for foreign companies versus Israeli firms based abroad, or how many have since returned to Israel.
Rise in defense startups
In 2023, the tech sector far outpaced GDP growth, increasing by 13.7 percent compared to 1.8 percent for GDP.
But the sector’s output stagnated in 2024 and 2025, according to IIA figures.
Industry professionals now believe the industry is turning a corner.
Israeli tech companies raised $15.6 billion in private funding in 2025, up from $12.2 billion in 2024, according to preliminary figures published in December by Startup Nation Central (SNC), a non-profit organization that promotes Israeli innovation.
Deep tech — innovation based on major scientific or engineering advances such as artificial intelligence, biotech and quantum computing — returned in 2025 to its pre-2021 levels, according to the IIA.
The year 2021 is considered a historic peak for Israeli tech.
The past two years have also seen a surge in Israeli defense technologies, with the military fighting on several fronts, including the West Bank, Lebanon, Syria, and Yemen, in addition to Gaza.
Between July 2024 and April 2025, the number of startups in the defense sector nearly doubled, from 160 to 312, according to SNC.
Of the more than 300 emerging companies collaborating with the research and development department of Israel’s Defense Ministry, “over 130 joined our operations during the war,” ministry Director General Amir Baram said in December.
Until then, the ministry had primarily sourced from Israel’s large defense firms, said Menahem Landau, head of Caveret Ventures, a defense tech investment company.
But he said the war pushed the ministry “to accept products that were not necessarily fully finished and tested, coming from startups.”
“Defense-related technologies have replaced cybersecurity as the most in-demand high-tech sector,” the reserve lieutenant colonel explained.
“Not only in Israel but worldwide, due to the war between Russia and Ukraine and tensions with China,” he added.

Russia strikes railway infrastructure in four regions – Kuleba
Ukraine's Deputy Prime Minister for Restoration and Minister for Communities and Territories Development Oleksii Kuleba said this in a post on Telegram, Ukrinform reports.
"Last night, the Russian army again targeted Ukraine's civilian and critical infrastructure with drones and missiles. The capital and the Kyiv region were hit by a massive strike. Unfortunately, there is one fatality. My sincere condolences to the family and loved ones. There are also injured people. Energy infrastructure facilities were damaged. Civilian buildings were also affected in the Kyiv, Odesa, Sumy, Mykolaiv, Dnipropetrovsk, Zaporizhzhia regions, and other regions," Kuleba wrote.
He noted that the enemy also targeted railway infrastructure in the Donetsk, Zaporizhzhia, Mykolaiv, and Odesa regions. Two locomotives were damaged, but train services continued to operate.
According to Kuleba, specialized services and repair crews are already working to eliminate the consequences of the attacks.
Earlier reports said that in the Kyiv region, several trains were operating on modified routes following the overnight Russian attack.

France to summon US Ambassador Charles Kushner over comments on far-right activist’s death
France is summoning U.S. Ambassador Charles Kushner to protest American comments about the killing of far-right activist Quentin Deranque
- Bookmark
The French foreign minister announced he will summon U.S. Ambassador Charles Kushner over comments related to the killing of the French far-right activist Quentin Deranque.
Jean-Noel Barrot was reacting to a statement by the State Department’s Counterterrorism Bureau, which posted on X that “reports, corroborated by the French Minister of the Interior, that Quentin Deranque was killed by left-wing militants, should concern us all.”
Deranque, a far-right activist, died of brain injuries last week from a beating in the French city of Lyon. He was attacked during a fight on the margins of a student meeting where a far-left lawmaker, Rima Hassan, was a keynote speaker.
His killing highlighted a climate of deep political tensions ahead of next year’s presidential vote. French President Emmanuel Macron called for calm on Saturday as some 3,000 people joined a march in Lyon organized by far-right groups to pay tribute to Deranque.
“We reject any instrumentalization of this tragedy, which has plunged a French family into mourning, for political ends,” Barrot said. “We have no lessons to learn, particularly on the issue of violence, from the international reactionary movement.”
The State Department said in its post that “violent radical leftism is on the rise and its role in Quentin Deranque’s death demonstrates the threat it poses to public safety. We will continue to monitor the situation and expect to see the perpetrators of violence brought to justice.”
Seven people have been handed preliminary charges. The Lyon public prosecutor’s office requested that each of them be charged with intentional homicide, aggravated violence and criminal conspiracy. Six of the accused were charged on all three counts. The seventh was charged with complicity in intentional homicide, aggravated violence and criminal conspiracy.
Barrot said he has other topics to discuss with Kushner, including U.S. decisions to impose sanctions on Thierry Breton, a former EU commissioner responsible for supervising social media rules, and Nicolas Guillou, a French judge at the International Criminal Court.
Barrot said both are targeted by “unjustified and unjustifiable” sanctions.

Arab, Muslim nations rebuke US envoy's Israel land claim

Arab, Muslim nations slam US envoy's Israel land remarks
February 22, 2026Arab and Muslim nations on Sunday sharply condemned remarks by the United States Ambassador to Israel Mike Huckabee after he suggested Israel could claim large parts of the Middle East based on a biblical reading.
Speaking on the podcast of far-right commentator and frequent Israel critic Tucker Carlson on Friday, Huckabee said, "It would be fine if they took it all."
Huckabee, a former Baptist minister, known as a Christian Zionist and fervent Israel supporter, was responding to Carlson's question about the meaning of a biblical verse sometimes interpreted as saying Israel is entitled to the land between the River Nile in Egypt and the Euphrates in Syria and Iraq.
He later backtracked, saying Israel was "not asking to take all of that," adding: "It was somewhat of a hyperbolic statement."
Strong condemnation from across the Arab and Muslim world
In a joint statement released on Sunday, the United Arab Emirates, Egypt, Jordan, Indonesia, Pakistan, Turkey, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Kuwait, Oman, Bahrain, Lebanon, Syria, the Palestinian Authority, as well as the Organization of Islamic Cooperation, the Arab League and the Gulf Cooperation Council, denounced the remarks.
They called Huckabee's comments "dangerous and inflammatory."
They said the comments violate the UN Charter and undermine efforts to de-escalate the Gaza war and pursue a comprehensive political solution.
They said Israel has no sovereignty over the occupied Palestinian territory and reiterated their rejection of any move to annex the West Bank, separate it from Gaza, or expand settlements.
The Palestinian Authority said on X that Huckabee's words "contradict US President Donald Trump's rejection of (Israel) annexing the West Bank."
In recent months, Israel has expanded its control over the occupied West Bank by accelerating the construction of settlements — widely seen as illegal under international law — retroactively legalizing settler outposts, and adjusting administrative policies.
But Trump has said he will block any Israeli move to annex the territory.
Ever-changing border
Israel has expanded its control over several areas since the war with Hamas in Gaza, which followed the Hamas-led terror attack on southern Israel on October 7, 2023.
Under the current ceasefire, Israeli forces have pulled back to a buffer zone in Gaza but continue to control more than half of the territory. Further withdrawal is stipulated, but no timeline is specified.
After Syrian President Bashar Assad was removed from power in late 2024, Israeli forces took control of a demilitarized zone established under the 1974 Israel-Syria ceasefire, describing the move as temporary and focused on border security.
Israel also continues to hold five hilltop positions on Lebanese territory following its brief conflict with Hezbollah in 2024.

Pakistan claim of killing 80 militants ‘false’, Taliban security source says
The Afghan Defence Ministry said ‘various civilian areas’ in eastern Afghanistan were hit, including a religious madrasa and multiple homes
Pakistan’s claim of killing at least 80 militants in strikes on Afghanistan is “false”, a Taliban government security source told Agence France-Presse on Sunday.
“The figure of 80 martyrs given by the Pakistan regime is false and imaginary,” the source said on condition of anonymity.
Talal Chaudhry, Pakistan’s deputy interior minister, offered no evidence for his claim in an interview with Geo News that at least 70 militants were killed in the strikes. Pakistan’s state-run media later reported that militant fatalities jumped to 80.
Agence France-Presse journalists in Afghanistan were not able to verify the toll given by Pakistan, while Afghan officials said at least 18 people were killed in the strikes including children.
The Afghan Defence Ministry said in a statement that “various civilian areas” in the provinces of Nangarhar and Paktika in eastern Afghanistan were hit, including a religious madrasa and multiple homes. The statement called the strikes a violation of Afghanistan’s airspace and sovereignty.
Afghanistan’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs summoned Pakistan’s ambassador to Kabul to protest against the Pakistani strikes.

France to summon US ambassador after comments about death of far-right activist

The French foreign minister, Jean-Noël Barrot, has said he will summon Charles Kushner, the US ambassador to France, over comments related to the killing of the French far-right activist Quentin Deranque.
Deranque was beaten to death in Lyon last week during a fight with allegedly hard-left activists.
The US embassy in France and the US state department’s bureau of counter-terrorism said they were monitoring the case, writing on X that “violent radical leftism is on the rise” and should be treated as a public safety threat.
Deranque’s death has put France on edge, stoking tensions between left and right ahead of the 2027 presidential vote.
It has also drawn international attention. Donald Trump’s administration denounced what it called “terrorism” in France on Friday, prompting pushback from Paris.
“We reject any use of this tragedy, which has plunged a French family into mourning, for political ends,” Barrot told Le Monde, France Inter and France Info. “We have no lessons to learn, particularly on the issue of violence, from the international reactionary movement.”
The foreign ministry did not announce when the ambassador, the father of Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner, would be summoned.
Deranque, 23, died of head injuries after clashes on the sidelines of a 12 February demonstration against a politician from the leftwing France Unbowed party in Lyon.
His death has been called “France’s Charlie Kirk moment”, referring to the killing last year of the US far-right commentator.
More than 3,000 people marched in Lyon on Saturday in tribute to Deranque, with authorities deploying heavy security for fear of further clashes.
The US state department’s under secretary for public diplomacy, Sarah Rogers, said on Friday that Deranque’s killing showed “why we treat political violence – terrorism – so harshly”.
“Once you decide to kill people for their opinions instead of persuade them, you’ve opted out of civilisation,” she wrote on X.
The state department’s bureau of counter-terrorism separately posted: “Violent radical leftism is on the rise and its role in Quentin Deranque’s death demonstrates the threat it poses to public safety” – a post shared in French by the US embassy account.
Deranque’s killing has also caused a diplomatic feud between France and Italy, whose rightwing prime minister, Giorgia Meloni, has warm ties with Trump.
She called the death “a wound for all of Europe”, prompting the French president, Emmanuel Macron, to criticise her for speaking about French domestic affairs.
Macron called for calm on Saturday during the Lyon march.
Six men suspected of involvement in Deranque’s death have been charged over the killing, and a parliamentary assistant to a radical leftwing MP has been charged with complicity.
Barrot said he had other topics to discuss with Kushner during the summons, including US decisions to impose sanctions on Thierry Breton, a former EU commissioner responsible for supervising social media rules, and Nicolas Guillou, a French judge at the international criminal court.
He said they had been targeted by “unjustified and unjustifiable” measures, that he described as attacks on EU autonomy and the independence of the international justice system.
Kushner was also summoned in August last year over a letter to Macron alleging the French state did not do enough to combat antisemitism. Foreign ministry officials met one of his representatives because he did not attend the summons personally.
France’s Tribune de Dimanche newspaper reported that Macron had written to Trump asking him to lift the sanctions against Breton and Guillou.

Background:
- Following a Russian attack on the Brody oil hub in Ukraine's west and damage to the Druzhba pipeline, the governments of Slovakia and Hungary simultaneously declared a state of emergency on their domestic oil products markets. Both countries claim that Ukraine is deliberately not repairing the pipeline because it does not want to supply them with Russian oil.
- Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán has threatened to stop electricity supplies to Ukraine if oil transit through the Druzhba pipeline is not restored.
- Hungary has also announced a suspension of diesel fuel supplies to Ukraine and blocked a €90 billion EU loan for Ukraine.

Amateur YouTube detectives’ constant streams put cases in jeopardy: ‘It’s clickbait’

On the 10th day of the search for Nancy Guthrie, reporters camped outside of the missing woman’s home noticed a strange man strut right up to the front door. It had been more than a week since the mother of Today show host Savannah Guthrie had disappeared, and authorities had just announced they had a new lead from Ring footage of what looked like a “potential subject” attempting to tamper with the doorbell camera on the morning of her disappearance. So now who was this unknown person, clad in a gray top and black pants, carrying a large black bag and striding to the door?
It was a Domino’s delivery driver.
“Never seen something quite like this,” local ABC reporter Ford Hatchett wrote on X. “Delivery was for an independent journalist out here who is live streaming, @JLRINVESTIGATES. A viewer ordered it for him.”
JLR Investigates is the name of the YouTube channel run by Jonathan Lee Riches, who describes himself as a “fearless investigator” and has more than 540,000 subscribers that watch his dispatches from outside Guthrie’s Tucson home.
“We can’t believe we have to say this, but media on scene: please do not order food delivery to a crime scene address,” the Pima county sheriff’s department wrote in a statement. “This interferes with an active investigation. Please also respect private property laws.”
National media has descended on crime scenes since the dawn of tabloids more than 100 years ago. The modern media circus only became more invasive with the advent of the 24/7 news cycle. The Nancy Guthrie investigation is no different; but this time an even more meddling type of reporter has come to define the three-week investigation: the true crime streamer.
Self-declared sleuths like Riches have inserted themselves into the investigation, broadcasting their videos to a sizeable audience.
He posts stream with titles like, “BREAKING – MANHUNT!!! NANCY GUTHRIE KIDNAPPING – LIVE” but once you click through you mostly see Riches simply sitting in his car. On day 19 of the investigations he was at one point documenting a police shift change at the scene of the crime. “Bathroom break,” he narrated to his 29k viewers.
Riches does try to offer more than just dry footage of the house’s exterior. He has “investigated” tips, such as an unrelated car tow and hospital airlift, as if these leads might go somewhere. Followers might appreciate Riches’ tenacity, but the false tips breed misinformation. State representative Alma Hernandez slammed “wannabe reporters” who “have now caused more harm than good to this entire situation and put this serious case in jeopardy”.
Before his true crime pivot, Riches spent time in jail for wire fraud. He made headlines in 2012 for driving to Connecticut in the wake of the Sandy Hook tragedy posing as the elementary school shooter’s uncle. He is known for his prolific filing of absurd lawsuits – the San Francisco Chronicle estimated more than 4,000 by 2024 – including one against the Kardashian family for participating in al-Qaida training. He once filed a phoney lawsuit against representative Gabrielle Giffords, posing as the man who shot her and killed six people in 2011. He even attempted to sue the Guinness Book of World Records for dubbing him the world’s most litigious person – but representatives for Guinness said they did not have that record category. The suit was later dismissed.
Riches did not respond to a request for comment. He told the Arizona Republic that the fake lawsuit against Giffords was a joke he filed to entertain himself in prison and was in bad taste. For this he would be sentenced to five years’ probation on a charge of making false statements.
Riches is one of a handful of livestreamers that have relocated to Tucson. Jimmy Williams, a former construction worker turned full-time streamer, spends up to six hours sitting in a lawnchair outside the Guthrie family home. Williams, who streams on his channel Dolly Vision, told an Australian reporter his trips are totally funded by viewer donations: “the plane tickets, the hotels” all come courtesy of his audience.
In one video Williams reported on “shocking chaos” at the scene of the crime – which ended up being a fight the streamer had with a neighbor over parking.
As well as the streamers there are such figures as Megyn Kelly getting involved. Kelly used to be part of the institutionalized media: after her lengthy stint at Fox News she was briefly Savannah Guthrie’s colleague on the Today show. Now she’s an independent journalist, self-producing a daily talkshow, and reporting on unverified online theories about the Gutheries (although she did not descend on their home). On her show she floated an eerie social media theory about Savannah Guthrie’s plea to her mother’s captors. Kelly discussed a video message in which Savannah Guthrie spoke of her mother’s kindness and then said: “Talk to her, and you’ll see.” The line mirrors a quote from the horror film The Silence of the Lambs, where a deranged serial killer kidnaps a senator’s daughter. In the movie, the senator releases a similar statement, using the same phrase. As Kelly put it: “The choice of words could be completely coincidental, or it might not be.”
This week, after Riches and others suggested Guthrie family members might be responsible for the crime (and Kelly said she wouldn’t rule the family out as suspects), sheriff Chris Nanos refuted the allegation, writing: “The family has been nothing but cooperative and gracious and are victims in this case. To suggest otherwise is not only wrong, it is cruel … Please, I’m begging you the media to honor your professionalism and report with some sense of compassion and professionalism.
But Nanos’s statement is directed toward an inherently unprofessional media: most of these true crime streamers lack any streaming or good reporting judgment. In the past, they might have covered solved murders or decades-old cold cases – not breaking news. That’s changed in recent years, says Kate Winkler Dawson, a producer and senior lecturer in broadcast journalism at University of Texas at Austin.
“I first noticed it with Gabby Petito,” said Dawson, referring to the vlogger who was killed by her boyfriend while the pair documented their van life through the American west. It took almost a month for authorities to discover Petito’s body. “There was a clear and present danger,” Dawson said. “Where is she? There is an entitlement from some folks [online] who don’t feel like they’re getting enough information.”
Petito’s missing van was discovered thanks to dashcam video from another YouTuber, which, to some viewers, validated their involvement in the case. “It perpetuates the belief that folks online hold the key to breaking cases, and sometimes they do, but most of the time it really slows down the case and is unhelpful,” Dawson said.
Mandy Matney was a newspaper journalist in South Carolina who struck true crime podcast gold while covering the crimes of Alex Murdaugh, a lawyer who was found guilty of killing his wife and son. The show, Murdaugh Murders Podcast, doggedly followed the police investigation and subsequent trial, becoming the No 1 podcast on Apple in 2021, and the basis for a Hulu series starring Jason Clarke and Patricia Arquette. Matney says she was “caught in the middle” as a journalist turned social media star.
She said during her reporting she found herself surrounded by true crime influencers. “We weren’t really competing at all with legacy media for scoops,” Matney said. “We were competing with TikTokers and content creators who were just making up news and publishing very baseless tips. It takes years of learning how to vet information [as a journalist] and really falling on your face to learn how to properly source stories and decide what information the public needs to hear.”
After the killing of Rob and Michele Reiner in their Brentwood home – and police charging their son Nick with first-degree murder – reports surfaced of influencers showing up at the scene in hopes of filming macabre, on-the-scene videos. One streamer wore a Burger King hat and yelled racial slurs at reporters; two others drove by filming for their audience while blasting music from their car.
“One of the biggest problems [with this behavior] is the sentiment behind it,” said Dawson. “It’s not to help the case or to inform people. It’s clickbait, a way to make money, and stay relevant in the true crime world.”
Jennifer Youngblood streams under the handle Jay is 4 Justice, which is also the name of her true crime podcast. Youngblood, who is 52 and lives in Clearwater, Florida, spent most of her career in home healthcare and hospice work. She now fully supports herself through true crime. She started streaming in 2018, documenting the case of Christopher Lee Watts, a Colorado man who killed his pregnant wife and two children. She met Riches, the Guthrie streamer, in Facebook groups created to follow various cases.
Youngblood is now in Tuscon, where she’s mostly shadowing Riches and making a few videos of her own about Guthrie. She says he goes out with his tripod, two phones, and a fan in case his phones overheat.
She does not find the presence of streamers, or their lack of standards, problematic. “I think anybody has the right to report on anything they want,” Youngblood said. “The viewers know that Jonathan is not in the know. They know he’s not an investigator. They know he’s not a cop. I think people are intrigued by watching every step of the way.”
Youngblood says that Guthrie’s neighbors are “appreciative” of Riches. “There’s been so many neighbors that have come up and said, ‘We’re so happy you’re here. We’re watching you, we want to see what’s going on. We’re not kept in the loop [from the police].”
Youngblood believes the mainstream media is “bewildered” by Riches’ popularity, and may be feeling a bit of “professional jealousy”, too. “He’s getting millions of views, and that’s what’s got their attention,” she said.
She says she knows all about Riches’ history of wire fraud and phoney lawsuits. It does not bother her. “Everyone wants to talk about his felony background and the things he went through, but I think that people should be celebrated for changing their life and doing good things,” she said. She trusts him to be accurate, saying: “I think his record speaks for itself.”
And what about when streamers do get things wrong? “I think that anytime you have a case of this magnitude, you have misinformation, regardless if there’s people streaming or not,” Youngblood said. “You have forums like X and Reddit. I think that social media itself is the bearer of misinformation.”
Mainstream journalists are mostly appalled by attitudes like Youngblood’s. “One of the unfortunate things is that the public may sort of confuse these vultures and their ghoulish questions and prying with more mainstream, legitimate news outlets,” said Mark Feldstein, who spent 20 years as an on-air investigative correspondent at CNN and ABC News and is now the chair of broadcast journalism at the University of Maryland. “They’re just winging it, making it up as they go along, and so it kind of deflates the currency for all journalists.”

How loose social ties can help heal political division | Eva M Meyersson Milgrom

The first time a woman I’ll call Shoshana went toBrandi Carlile’s music festival, she arrived alone. She had just been through another unsuccessful round of IVF. During one of the songs, about motherhood, she began to cry in the middle of the crowd. Then two women she had never met stepped closer and wordlessly wrapped their arms around her until her breathing slowed.
“That’s when I realized,” Shoshana told me in an interview, “this place isn’t just about music.”
Over the next five days, Shoshana would meet dozens of people she would never otherwise have crossed paths with – women from different parts of the world with different life stories. She was doing something most of us are never taught to do: she was connecting to what I call a social pipeline, a loosely connected group of weak ties.
Research, notably Mark Granovetter’s work, has consistently demonstrated the significant impact of weak social ties. In fact, major opportunities – such as jobs, breakthrough ideas, new paths and life-altering connections – typically originate not from our closest friends, but from acquaintances, near-strangers, and people in different social circles. These are what we call our weak ties.
But not all weak ties are created equal. As a sociologist who studies social networks, I have found that the ties that really matter are bridge ties – these are connections that take us into new social spheres where we know no one at all. They cross the boundaries that normally structure our lives: age and gender, work and class, culture and politics, belief and life stage.
Imagine someone in your running club who happens to introduce you to a group of board game enthusiasts, whom you’ve never met before: the bridge tie’s introduction enables you to explore an interest you’ve never been able to develop. In this way, our bridge ties don’t just expand our social circles; they change what we believe is possible, in our lives and in the world. And yet we barely notice them.
Shoshana’s annual ritual of going to the music festival gave her access to a constantly changing social pipeline where she makes new connections along with people she meets year after year. Some remain friendly strangers, while other relationships deepen in unexpected ways. For example, she has become part of informal music circles that nurture her love of singing. She helped a festival friend through a painful breakup just as others comforted her when she needed help. Many of these ties never become close friendships. That’s not the point. “They don’t demand my whole life,” Shoshana later told me. “But they give me access to a larger one.”
Bridge ties matter not only because they widen our social reach, but also because they make us more resilient. When we need advice, our bridge ties tell us what they actually think, not what we want to hear – because they have less of a stake in pleasing us. If they are able to support us, they tend to do so freely without expecting anything in return. They help us through life’s big transitions when we are forced to make new connections, from landing a new job to moving to a new city to retirement. They do all this good work in our lives without making demands on our time or seeking our commitment.
Contrast this with your tight-knit circle of friends – perhaps your kids become friends with their children and you even take vacations together. In such settings, where everyone knows everyone else, your entire social world is built on sameness. A difference of opinion can be perceived as wrong and even dangerous. A single conflict can unravel your entire social life, leaving you alone. When our social ties overlap too much, we don’t just lose a friend, we lose access to our entire social world.
This fragility of our social networks helps explain why today’s extreme political polarization, which has turned violent, feels so personal: we no longer have social lives that can absorb disagreement. That’s because we lack the connective tissue of bridge ties that make difference and disagreement survivable.
By bringing us into contact with others through shared interests rather than shared beliefs, our bridge ties allow us to see others in multidimensional ways rather than as representatives of a single political, cultural or religious category. They teach us how to practice living with difference by cultivating familiarity across our differences. So, we become more tolerant and politically resilient as well.
We can see this in action in the largely nonviolent resistance in cities like Minneapolis, where diverse networks of people, who are very loosely connected, have deliberately come together to resist ICE operations and support immigrants and Black and brown residents, from delivering meals to alerting people about ICE activity, and documenting violence. What makes these improvised networks so powerful is precisely the protesters’ ability to stand up for their neighbors across lines of culture, class, politics and faith.
Their actions evoke what Dr Martin Luther King said in his Letter from Birmingham Jail: “We are caught in an inescapable network of mutuality … Whatever affects one directly, affects all indirectly.” King was speaking about justice, but I believe he was also describing a social structure based not on sameness or tribal loyalty, but on integrating with people who are different from us. In an era of division, cultivating bridge ties is not a soft social skill. It is essential civic infrastructure – our lives and democracies depend on it.
What’s giving me hope now
I find hope in powerful examples of collaboration. In Minneapolis, a white Jewish congregation and a largely Latino Lutheran church held joint prayer services amid ICE operations. Members provided food, medicine and transport to Latino and Somali immigrants, sharing risk and offering protection to those targeted by ICE. Similarly, I am moved by how the Israeli human rights organization Rabbis for Human Rights mobilizes volunteers each year to protect Palestinian farmers who work in their fields during the olive harvest. Personally, through my Palestinian former daughter-in-law, I’ve gained firsthand insight into the living conditions in Gaza and found ways to offer my support. These instances underscore how our “bridge ties” connect us with profoundly different social worlds, allowing essential resources, ideas and understanding to flow between them.

How a Welsh village saved its forest … and its future

It was a Saturday in February 2020 when the flood came. It had been a wet winter, so wet it seemed that before the month was out, the brown trout of the River Taff might be washed clean out into Cardiff Bay before the fishing season had even begun. But this is Wales. People are used to a spot of rain. No one realised how bad it would get.
For two days, it hammered on the windows of the houses at the top of the South Wales Valleys, where people tucked in their children before a sleepless night. It poured into the rivers at the bottom. By the time the rain departed again, many people would be standing in water up to their knees.
A history of coal mining had left the sides of the valley covered with a monocrop of larch, planted for pit props. The forests became overgrown and impenetrable. Under the coal board, villagers were warned off entering them. Before the Pentre floods, Natural Resources Wales, which took over from the Forestry Commission in Wales in 2013, stepped in with felling licences, drawing the ire of dogwalkers and hikers when they sent in their machines. As the authorities felled and winched the trees, dead material and branches snapped and dropped on to the forest floor.
The high street in Pentre had never flooded. But that night in February, the rain was unable to find its natural course. With a crack barely audible against the downpour, the banks broke and the water gushed towards the houses below.
An inquiry was promised. No wrongdoing was found. But the people of the valleys knew the land with its knotted forests, old mines and ancient springs. They feared the felling done by public bodies in their name. The summers were getting warmer, the winters wetter. Diseases thrived on the damp, stressed trees. A different way was needed to manage the valleys. Not by profiteering businessmen, nor paternalistic government, but by the locals themselves.
Eighteen months later, in the cool, dappled sunlight of a clearing in the Cwm Saerbren forest above Treherbert, a larch stands tall but dead. Its black branches turn like spindles in the breeze, covered in black and yellow burrs. Behind the dead tree the valley drops sharply, covered in forest. A handful of people jostle for space on the uneven ground around Richard Phipps, an official from Natural Resources Wales, the body that manages these valleys. But they don’t look at Phipps, in his hiking boots and a regulation beige shirt. Everyone is looking up at the dead tree.
“It’s a fire hazard,” Phipps says. He sounds so certain that it’s hard not to believe him. He explains that the longer a dead tree is left in the ground, the harder it is to get it out as the forest grows around it, and the harder it is to use the timber, which degrades over time.
He has been put in charge of drawing up the official forest resource plan, a document created every 10 years. These plans detail how the authority will manage the Welsh government’s woodland estate, including how and when tree felling will take place. In order to meet certain standards, Natural Resources Wales has to consult the public, so it normally makes the documents available online. Few look for them, and those who do find colour-coded maps that are meaningless without explanation. So this kind of engagement – coming to the forest for a tour of the trees – is somewhat new.
For as long as they can remember, the villagers have heard these kinds of warnings about the forest. Industrialists barred people from entering, protecting their crop of pit props. That narrative was inherited by the public body, Natural Resources Wales. As part of its mandate to maximise profit from the timber, it restricted access, rather than welcoming people to the forests as a public good.
For many years, this status quo has been unchallenged. But something is changing, thanks to an initiative started by land reform activist Chris Blake called the Skyline project. Skyline is working with a local organisation called Welcome to Our Woods to propose a co-management plan for the forest. As part of the programme, a handful of locals visited a croft in Scotland. On their return, they asked Natural Resources Wales if they could have a hand in designing their management plan. Then they set up a series of 10 meetings over the course of a year, and invited Phipps and his colleagues to join.
The trip up the side of the valley is the second meeting of the 10. One of the women steps forward and says they want a plan where they manage the woodland alongside Natural Resources Wales, 50-50. “Not 80-20,” she says. “We need to have a say in what happens.” “Hear, hear,” says Ian Thomas, who coordinates Welcome to Our Woods, the local organisation that has for many years been teaching young people to care for the forest by starting campfires safely, to address a history of teenagers going into the woods after dark to set things alight.
Over the next year, the group meets Natural Resources Wales to consider every aspect of their relationship to the valleys. They dream up plans from beekeeping to producing renewable electricity using water and wind. But the two sides differ on one major issue: whether or not to cut down all of the trees at once: a method called clear felling. Over the 18 months of talks, this point comes up over and over again. At the first meeting, when Phipps said clear felling was the only way to manage the forest, Thomas spoke up. “That’s your version of the truth, not ours,” he said. Thomas has worked with the woodland in Treherbert for long enough to have seen whole forests disappear, leaving empty hillsides where once people walked and hiked. Once felled, it takes 30 years for the trees to grow back.
Thomas knew that some of the forests around Treherbert were so old and overgrown that clear felling had become the only option. But the community wanted to change the policy for the future so that the forests would be continually thinned, taking out the biggest or the weakest every year, to maintain their productivity for hundreds of years. By thinning, not clearing, the ecosystem survives, allowing nature to thrive – and people can still enjoy the trees. It is called continuous cover, a method of forestry more popular in Alpine regions than the UK.
It takes many decades to establish continuous cover, planting trees with a mix of ages, so bigger trees can be removed without destroying the whole habitat. With smaller amounts of timber from regular thinning, a local forestry company could be established to process the wood and use it to build everything from houses to tables, creating jobs in the village.
At the end of March 2022, Phipps stood up in front of the people of Treherbert again to share the forest resource plan. The community assembled nervously to hear how much from the co-production process had been included. In his speech, Phipps promised felling would be done differently. Instead of cutting down forests covering whole sides of the valleys, Natural Resources Wales would work in blocks over the course of a decade, so the community always had some forest to use.
Phipps said the plan was to work more closely with communities in the future. “I want to reduce conflict,” he said. “To make sure the community doesn’t feel ignored and Natural Resources Wales doesn’t feel attacked, by working together.” It sounded so good. Thinning not clear felling. Working in partnership. But the community had heard it all before. The people in Treherbert needed more than a plan. They needed to see that partnership in action. The next few years would be crucial.
Two years later, Thomas and Blake take a trip up the side of the valley, past culverts carved neatly into the side of the road, and cubes of rocks in mesh put in place to stop landslides and flash floods. At the top of the valley, they get out of the car. They are standing on one of the 12 coal tips that surround Treherbert, a manmade mountain that never existed before the mines.
The settlements run down the centre of the valley, alongside the River Rhondda, conjoined like the beads on a necklace: Treherbert, Treorchy, Pentre. From here, it’s possible to see where the Pentre flood started, just below the square tower of a church. No one could have expected a place like that to flood. It was too high up the valley, too far from the river. But flash flooding and trapped brash nonetheless conspired against the people of Pentre that day.
Thomas can just about pick out the fire pit first established by Welcome to Our Woods. The forest around it is gone, clear felled as part of the compromise the community made with the authorities. One day, in early 2024, the machines arrived: gigantic trucks and chippers bearing the branding of a nearby biomass plant. Within a day, the timber had been driven off to be incinerated to make electricity.
Over the other side of the valley, they can see the timber roundhouse that has been constructed by Down to Earth, a social enterprise offering healthcare and education programmes through sustainable construction to excluded communities. Their work ranges from this beautiful, open meeting place, to whole developments of sustainable timber housing, residential accommodation and public buildings in Wales.
The roundhouse is symbolic. It’s the first structure to be built from Rhondda larch for many years, proof that Natural Resources Wales can do more with the wood in these forests than chip it and burn it as fuel. Thomas has grand plans for the little wood they have acquired from felling. Steps from the roundhouse, safely stowed in a metal shed, is a small green tractor. Thomas dreams of the day it will be hauling logs at a brand new Welcome to Our Woods timber processing plant. One day, not so long from now, the roundhouse will be the entrance to the Cwm Saerbren nature reserve: a permanent place for residents and tourists to celebrate the natural history of this part of the forest.
On the high street, the old library has become the headquarters for Welcome to Our Woods, where the organisers are working with Black Mountains college, a local interdisciplinary education institution started by the writer Ben Rawlence, to offer courses about wellbeing in nature, coppicing and green wood trades: skills to equip local people for the planetary emergency. They are planning to run their courses in an old grammar school just off the high street, opening up another of Treherbert’s vacant buildings. Right next to the old library, the village pub serves as a reminder of what can happen if these buildings are left empty. A year after its owners sold up, a police bust found cannabis plants in black tubs, state-of-the-art ventilation equipment, UV lights and piles of compost bags.
The true economic right to manage the land eludes the people of the valleys. This is still public land. Only a forest croft of the kind they visited in Scotland gives them the right to profit from the timber. But the project proves that there are other ways to give communities the control they need to deliver benefits for people and for nature in the long term.
Treherbert will go down in history as the first Welsh village to secure an agreement with the government to stand shoulder to shoulder on decisions about how to manage its land. It’s a blueprint for a different kind of stewardship. A first for Wales, and a signpost to other post-industrial communities across the world.

How Israel’s genocide in Gaza has made it nearly impossible for this Palestinian teenager to manage her chronic illness
Unknown

Two months before the war on Gaza began, 16-year-old Shahd al-Afifi returned to Gaza to visit her family, carrying a sense of hope. For the previous three years, she had been living abroad, receiving specialized medical treatment in Australia through a medical scholarship. There, she was not only receiving consistent care but also living something close to an ordinary teenage life.
“I was receiving good treatment and going to school normally,” Shahd tells Mondoweiss. “My condition was stable, and I was feeling good.”
The visit back home was meant to be temporary, and Shahd planned to return to Australia to continue her treatment. Then the war began.
Borders closed, movement stopped, and she was unable to leave. Since then, her life has been defined by pain, loss, and confinement.
Her mother had inhaled phosphorus during the 2008 war on Gaza when she was pregnant. Shahd was later born with Lamellar Ichthyosis, commonly known as “fish scale disease,” a rare genetic disorder that causes skin cells to build up into thick, plate-like scales rather than shedding naturally. These scales are rigid and brittle. They do not bend with the body’s movements.
“My body always feels thick and dry,” Shahd says. “This causes severe burning and cracking, and sometimes my skin starts to bleed.”
There is no cure for Shahd’s condition. It can only be managed through a strict daily routine that includes constant moisturization, careful hygiene, and a humid, climate-controlled environment in a clean, safe home. Before the war, maintaining this routine was difficult but possible. The war stripped all of this away.
After losing their family home in Beit Hanoun, in northern Gaza, Shahd endured repeated displacement between the north and south of the Gaza Strip. Eventually, she ended up living in a cramped, torn tent with her grandmother, two aunts, and her uncle.
The tent offers little protection from rain, heat, dust, or overcrowding. For someone with her condition, heat is especially dangerous. Because her skin is so thick, Shahd struggles to sweat normally, which prevents her body from regulating its temperature. Cold weather also worsens her condition, making her skin drier and more painful.
To manage her illness, Shahd is supposed to take a shower every day. But even this basic routine has become almost impossible. Water — one of the most essential elements for managing ichthyosis — has become a luxury.
“We hardly have access to water,” her grandmother says. “My young son has to stand in long queues every day to bring bottles of water that must be shared between cooking, drinking, laundry, and sometimes bathing.”
“Shahd can barely shower once a week,” she adds. “After each shower, her body needs moisturizing to keep her skin from cracking.”
“We usually use Vaseline,” the grandmother explains, “because it is the only moisturizer available in Gaza now.”
After each bath, Shahd needs an entire large container of Vaseline to cover her body.
Shahd also requires between 500 and 700 Israeli shekels ($160 – $220) each month for medical supplies, including creams, ointments, and other basic medical supplies. For her family, this amount is nearly impossible to secure. “Medicines are either expensive or plain scarce,” the grandmother says.
Despite the ceasefire, Israeli authorities have continued to restrict the entry of medical aid. Gaza’s Ministry of Health reports that less than 30 percent of the Strip’s monthly medical aid needs are being allowed in, with 62 percent of primary health-care medicines currently unavailable. More than 288,000 patients are affected by these shortages.
“We don’t have a stable source of income,” her grandmother says. “One month, if we’re lucky, she can get part of her treatment. The next month, she can’t.”
The grandmother is now the family’s sole provider and caregiver. Like tens of thousands of families in Gaza, they rely entirely on humanitarian aid for basic survival and on charitable donations to cover other necessities, including Shahd’s medication.
Barred from treatment
Shahd’s mental health has also deteriorated. “She is usually alone,” her grandmother says. “She has no friends, and she cries a lot. If she had received proper treatment, she could have lived normally and made many friends.”
Shahd has never known the care of either parent. Her mother abandoned her at birth, unable to accept her condition. Her father was killed in an Israeli attack in 2008, two months before Shahd was born. So her grandparents raised her instead.
“She became a daughter, not a grandchild,” her grandmother says. “She was very attached to her grandfather. He was the father she never knew.”
In May 2024, her grandfather was killed in northern Gaza after refusing to leave the city at the start of the war. “This added another layer of pain for Shahd,” her grandmother says.
Shahd’s grandmother also says that even education has become a source of suffering. “I am always afraid to send Shahd to school,” she explains. “Any sudden movement, accidental push, or crowded space could cause her skin to split and bleed.”
There is another reason as well. Now 16 years old, Shahd is at an age when friendships shape identity, yet she lives in near-total isolation. She has no close friends in the camp and spends most of her days inside the tent.
“Children her age are afraid of her,” her grandmother says. “They avoid her, and sometimes they bully her.”
The isolation has taken a visible toll. Shahd lives in constant grief. She cries often, withdraws, and struggles with sadness.
“She is always sad,” her grandmother says quietly.
For now, the family believes it may be safer for Shahd not to return to school. Her social world is limited to her aunts and a few relatives who accept her condition. “Shahd longs to feel comfortable and protected,” her grandmother says. “She wishes to receive an education and to live like any other child.”
Since the war began, Shahd’s family has been trying to obtain medical permission for her to travel abroad and complete her treatment.
“We know that traveling outside won’t cure her disease,” her grandmother says. “But at least it would allow her to access the medication and treatment she needs, so she can live like any other child her age.”
Although the Rafah crossing recently reopened, only a very limited number of Palestinian patients are allowed to leave or enter the Strip, and those who were allowed through report intensive interrogation, mistreatment, and humiliation. Israeli authorities continue to impose strict restrictions on passengers, further deepening the humiliation and suffering of those in need of urgent medical care.

Oleksandr Syrsky, commander of the Ukrainian arm, to Le Monde: 'Russian army losses have exceeded its recruitment level'

At a politically sensitive moment in the Russia-Ukraine conflict, as difficult negotiations are underway, General Oleksandr Syrsky remains true to his approach: not a word about politics or diplomacy. His domain is the battlefield, every inch of which he knows intimately. The commander-in-chief of the Ukrainian army, 60 years old, described by President Volodymyr Zelensky as the "most experienced general in Ukraine" when he entrusted him with command, can speak for hours about military planning and combat, village by village, kilometer by kilometer.
During an interview with Le Monde in Kyiv in February, as he assessed the state of the battlefield, General Syrsky acknowledged "an extremely difficult period for my country, for my people," also insisting on "an incredible period of struggle [for the Ukrainian] armed forces." Facing "the largest, most powerful army in Europe" and "a war that exceeds all imaginable and unimaginable scales," he said he aimed to demonstrate "the resilience of the armed forces."
Regarding the year 2025, General Syrsky said that the military situation could have been much worse. He did not deny the difficulties on the front but stated that Russian objectives had been far more ambitious. The general had maintained the same stance when assessing the year 2024, which, according to him, could have been even more devastating for Ukraine if he had not led the daring "Kursk" operation on Russian soil.

US senator urges probe after Palestinian-American teen killed in West Bank
US senator Chris van Hollen has called for accountability following the killing of a 19-year-old Palestinian-American in the occupied West Bank.
Speaking to The New Arab, the Democratic senator urged an urgent "impartial investigation and accountability" after Nasrallah Abu Siyam was shot by an Israeli settler in the village of Mukhmas, near Ramallah, on Wednesday.
Van Hollen, who has previously criticised the Israeli government’s encouragement of settler violence in the West Bank, called on the US State Department to ensure the safety and protection of American citizens in the occupied territory.
"State Department leaders often say their first priority is the safety of US citizens abroad, and yet they fail repeatedly to uphold that commitment when it comes to US citizens harmed or killed in the West Bank," Van Hollen told The New Arab.
He continued: "I have serious concerns about this latest killing of a 19-year-old Palestinian-American. When a US citizen is killed abroad, there must be an impartial investigation and accountability."
The Trump administration has yet to address claims that its policies have failed to curb a surge in settler violence, particularly following the killing of Abu Siyam.
The Palestinian Authority’s Wall and Settlement Resistance Commission said that he was the first Palestinian killed by settlers in 2026.
The State Department said it was aware of the death of a US citizen and was "carefully monitoring the situation".
In an updated statement released on Saturday, it said it extends its “deepest condolences” to the victim’s family and expects “a full, thorough, and transparent investigation into the circumstances surrounding the death”.
It added that the US embassy in Jerusalem had been in direct contact with the family to provide assistance.
Meanwhile, the Israeli embassy in Washington also issued a statement, saying the incident was under review and that an "operational inquiry… must be completed as soon as possible".
According to multiple reports citing relatives of Abu Siyam, settlers raided the West Bank village to steal sheep.
When residents, including Abu Siyam, attempted to prevent the theft, the settlers opened fire, wounding the Philadelphia-born teenager and others.
The Palestinian Ministry of Health confirmed that Abu Siyam died from critical wounds sustained on Wednesday afternoon.
Violence by Israeli settlers against Palestinians in the West Bank has increased sharply since the outbreak of the genocidal war on Gaza in October 2023. According to UN data, nearly 700 people were displaced due to settler attacks in 2026.
In 2025, Israeli forces and settlers killed 240 Palestinians, according to the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs.
Israeli indictments in cases of settler violence remain rare.
Israeli monitoring group Yesh Din has said that of the hundreds of cases of settler violence it documented since the start of the two-year conflict, only 2 percent had resulted in indictments by the end of 2025.
The Trump administration has also faced criticism from rights groups for lifting sanctions imposed under the previous administration of Joe Biden on violent settlers.
Several US citizens, including activist Aysenur Ezgi Eygi, have been killed by Israeli forces or settlers in the West Bank over the past two years.

Minister says children in England will get support more quickly under Send overhaul

Bridget Phillipson has pledged that under the government’s overhaul of the special educational needs system it will take weeks for children to get access to support, not months or years – as she prepares to announce the controversial changes.
Speaking before publication of the white paper on the overhaul, the education secretary said children with special needs would be treated as “integral to the school system” rather than as a carved-out issue. She said the changes would be brought in as part of a “decade-long shift” to give schools and families time to adjust.
Campaigners have raised concerns that children with a legal right to special needs support will face a review when they move to secondary school.
The changes will raise the bar at which children in England qualify for an education, health and care plan (EHCP), which legally entitles children with Send to get support.
Speaking on the BBC, Phillipson said the government was “not going to be taking away effective support from children, and what I’ll be setting out tomorrow is a decade-long, very careful transition from the system that we have, which everyone recognises isn’t working”.
Asked if that could genuinely be said to mean no child would lose support, Phillipson said: “Children will be reviewed in terms of their needs assessed. That should be happening at the moment. We’re meant to have a system where every year an EHCP [education, health and care plan] is reviewed. That doesn’t always happen, and where it does, it doesn’t always work well.
“But what parents will see when we set out our vision tomorrow is a system where if, for example, your child needs speech and language support, the school will be better able to provide that than is the case right now.”
Phillipson said the overhaul of the system would mean children would “get support much, much more quickly than is the case right now. “And the commitment that I give to parents is that when they see all of the documents published tomorrow what they will see is a government that is focused on delivering better outcomes for their children. I am fiercely ambitious for every child in our country.”
She said it would be “a question of weeks, not a question of months and years” compared with the current system where many EHCPs are issued by local authorities beyond the 20-week deadline.
“Part of what we’ve seen is that support for children with Send has been treated almost as an entirely separate issue, rather than it being integral to our school system. Lots of children at some point during their school lives will experience some form of challenge, will need extra support.
“In order to get the support that children need, parents have to fight really hard to get that education, health and care plan. I’ve heard from so many parents just how difficult, how devastating that has been. It can take years. It’s really adversarial.”
The radical overhaul of the Send system will give every child with Send an individual support plan, government sources have confirmed, but the changes will raise the bar at which children in England qualify for an EHCP, which legally entitles children with Send to get support. EHCPs will be reserved for children with the most severe and complex needs, but new plans for children on lower tiers will still confer additional support and legal rights.
Government sources have said those who have EHCPs will not lose them, but there is a fear that children reaching 11 who have educational support plans will be reassessed under new, stricter criteria. Parents would retain legal avenues for appeals under existing equalities legislation and through a tribunal, according to government sources.
The white paper was due to be published last autumn, but was delayed to allow for further consideration of the Send proposals.
Phillipson said the changes were not about saving money. “We’re spending more money and we’ll continue to spend more money both around schools and Send, both together. We are going to spend more money delivering better outcomes for children. What we will be doing, however, is taking action where that money is not being well spent.”

More than 280 tonnes of used fishing nets from Scotland will be sent to Ukraine to help counter Russian drone attacks, the Scottish Government has announced.
The nets, previously stored for recycling, are being repurposed following a direct request from the Ukrainian government. According to the Scottish Government, 228 former salmon farm nets weighing around 280 tonnes will be shipped to Ukraine to be used as overhead anti-drone netting protecting roads and infrastructure in the country’s east.
The nets are intended to trap drone propellers, preventing them from reaching their targets.
External Affairs Secretary Angus Robertson said: “As we approach the fourth anniversary of Russia’s illegal invasion of Ukraine the Scottish Government is committed to aiding Ukraine’s defence and this donation demonstrates that our support is unwavering.”
He added: “The Ukrainian Minister for the Development of Communities made a direct request for Scotland to supply used fishing nets, which would be repurposed to provide anti-drone netting on public roads in Eastern Ukraine.”
Robertson said: “We identified 228 old salmon farm nets, weighing 280 tonnes, sitting in storage awaiting disposal. They work by trapping the drone propellers, stopping them reaching their target.” He continued: “Drone attacks are a near daily occurrence. They have been responsible for many deaths and casualties as well as causing huge devastation across Ukraine. This will help counter some of these deadly attacks.”
The Directorate for International Trade and Investment has allocated £216,000 towards the cost of transporting the nets to Ukraine. Denmark, Sweden and France have also donated fishing nets for similar anti-drone purposes. Scottish Government officials are finalising arrangements for the transfer in coordination with the Ministry of Defence.

France summons US ambassador over comments on slain far-right activist

The French foreign ministry will summon the US ambassador to Paris over comments made by the Trump administration about the killing of a French far-right activist blamed on the hard left, France's top diplomat said Sunday, February 22. The death of Quentin Deranque has put France on edge, igniting tensions ahead of a 2027 presidential vote. It has also provoked international reactions, with US President Donald Trump's administration on Friday denouncing what it called "terrorism" in France.
"We are going to summon the United States ambassador to France, since the US embassy in France commented on this tragedy (...) which concerns the national community," Foreign Minister Jean-Noël Barrot told France Inter radio. "We reject any attempt to use this tragedy (...) for political purposes," he added.
The foreign ministry did not say when Ambassador Charles Kushner – the father of Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner – would be summoned.
Deranque, 23, died from head injuries following clashes between radical-left and far-right supporters on the sidelines of a February 12 demonstration against a politician from the left-wing La France Insoumise (LFI) party in Lyon. More than 3,000 people marched in Lyon on Saturday in tribute to Deranque, with authorities deploying heavy security, fearing further clashes.
On Friday, Sarah Rogers, the State Department under secretary for public diplomacy, said Deranque's killing showed "why we treat political violence – terrorism – so harshly." "Once you decide to kill people for their opinions instead of persuade them, you've opted out of civilization," she wrote on X. The State Department's bureau of counter-terrorism separately posted: "Violent radical leftism is on the rise and its role in Quentin Deranque's death demonstrates the threat it poses to public safety" – a post shared in French by the US embassy account.
Deranque's killing has also caused a diplomatic feud between France and Italy, whose right-wing prime minister, Giorgia Meloni, has warm ties with Trump. She called the killing of Deranque "a wound for all of Europe," prompting French President Emmanuel Macron to criticise her for speaking out on French domestic affairs.
Six men suspected of involvement in the fatal assault have been charged over the killing, while a parliamentary assistant to a radical left-wing MP has also been charged with complicity.

Trump’s trade war risks undermining his hopes of hefty US interest rate cuts | Graeme Wearden

Donald Trump and Denis Healey don’t have much in common. One of the greatest prime ministers Britain never had shares little of his famous hinterland with what some historians see as one of the worst occupants of the White House.
But Trump would be well advised to remember Healey’s first law of holes – when you’re in one, stop digging
Instead, having seen the supreme court reject his sweeping global tariffs on Friday, Trump dug his shovel out, announcing a new global tariff of first 10%, then upping it to 15%. That may have lifted the president’s mood, after a stinging rebuke from the top judges in the US, but it risks backfiring on his hopes for hefty interest rate cuts this year.
The trade war, with its exhortation to businesses to make their products in the US if they know what’s good for them, is one of Trump’s signature policies. The logic is to create prosperity and long-term opportunity through bringing more investment and innovation into the US, lifting incomes.
It also provided lucrative opportunities to tax Americans, with the tariffs rejected by the supreme court estimated to have raked in roughly $110bn (£81bn) from those importing goods from overseas.
The City consultancy Capital Economics has calculated that by raising the global tariff to 15%, Trump has ensured that at least for the next 150 days the effective tariff rate will rise back to 14.5%, slightly above where it had settled before the supreme court stuck down the reciprocal tariffs based on the International Emergency Economic Powers Act.
That means American importers will still be paying higher prices for goods from overseas, with a knock-on impact on inflation.
Companies who have stumped up for IEEPA tariffs are agitating for their money back. That could be a potential fiscal stimulus, if they get the cash. This adds up to a headache for the US Federal Reserve, and its next leader, the freshly anointed Kevin Warsh, and may make it harder to justify a rate cut.
Trump made it clear what he wants from Warsh last Friday, declaring “interest rates should come down very substantially” on his watch. However, Warsh will be on a sticky wicket, as the Fed appears split – the minutes of its last meeting showed that some Fed officials wonder whether rate increases could soon be needed to keep inflation pegged, while others do expect cuts ahead.
A rate rise from the Fed would enrage the ever-flammable Trump. Last month he told the World Economic Forum it was wrong that markets went down when the US reported “a great quarter, a great month, great earnings” because investors expect higher interest rates as a result.
Now it may feel counterintuitive but this “good news is bad news” mechanism is vital for healthy financial markets. If faster growth leads to higher demand, and inflationary pressures, a responsible central bank should be diluting the punchbowl (through tighter monetary policy) to prevent the party getting out of hand rather than encouraging the revelry.
On this point, central bankers’ long-term record is mixed. When he was the Fed chair, Alan Greenspan resisted rate increases during the technology boom of the 1990s – creating an era of cheap money that culminated in the dot-com crash.
While the Trump White House would like Warsh to model his tenure on Greenspan, the US – and world – economy is rather different from three decades ago, even though the Treasury secretary, Scott Bessent, is pushing a 90s-style deregulation drive.
Dario Perkins of TS Lombard, for example, is not convinced that the Bessent-Warsh combo can recreate the bullish macroeconomic conditions of the 1990s.
“Even if AI productivity gains can match the hype – which seems unlikely – the global inflation backdrop is very different from the 1990s. Tariffs and immigration curbs have damaged US supply potential, while ‘crowding in’ [private sector investment] is mostly just rhetoric,” he warns.
Last week the Fed’s favoured inflation measure rose, dampening hopes that deflationary effects were building. That is why the markets expect virtually no chance of a Fed rate cut in March, although two cuts are expected by Christmas.
It is hard to know exactly what the next Fed chair makes of the current economic situation because, unusually, Warsh and Trump did not hold a joint press conference after the president announced his choice in early February.
In the past, Warsh has indicated that the Fed should dial back its “incantations” rather than keeping its audience on “the edge of its seats” by trying to vocally provide signals to the markets through forward guidance. A worthy idea but one that risks leaving investors guessing about how the Fed will approach an economy where growth slowed at the end of last year, and relatively few jobs are being created.
That policy uncertainty risks undermining the US dollar, and the wider markets, in 2026. And with a president digging in to fight his trade war, Warsh may struggle to persuade the rest of the Fed’s interest rate-setting committee to vote for cuts.
Still, he could always remember another Healey maxim: “We cannot hope to achieve full employment and sustain it until we have mastered inflation.”

India cancels key trade mission to US over Trump tariffs chaos
Visit by Indian trade delegation was due to begin on Monday but has now been postponed indefinitely after US Supreme Court ruling on Trump’s tariff regime
- Bookmark
- CommentsGo to comments
India has postponed a high-stakes trade mission to the US after the US Supreme Court struck down much of Donald Trump’s tariff regime.
The three-day trip was due to begin on Monday, with Indian and US negotiators aiming to finalise a much-vaunted interim trade agreement between the two countries.
But both sides have agreed to call off the plans after a ruling by the US Supreme Court on Friday that found key elements of former president Donald Trump’s sweeping tariff programme had been improperly imposed under emergency powers.
Officials familiar with the matter have said that the visit to Washington will now be rescheduled to allow both sides to assess the implications of the court’s decision and how it will impact the emerging deal.
“The decision to defer the visit was taken after discussions between officials of the two countries,” the source, speaking under conditions of anonymity, told Reuters. “No new date for the visit has been decided.”
The Independent has contacted India’s trade ministry for comment.
On Friday, Trump said he would impose a new global tariff regime under alternative powers. Initially, he announced a 10 per cent levy, and then on Saturday raised it to 15 per cent.
The Supreme Court ruling has cast doubt over the legal basis for a range of duties introduced during Trump’s second administration and unsettled trade negotiations with other countries.
Under the original tariff regime, Indian goods were subject to a 10 per cent levy, which was later raised to 25 per cent. At one stage, a further 25 per cent penalty linked to India’s continued purchases of Russian oil pushed the effective tariff burden on some products as high as 50 per cent.
On 3 February, Trump announced in a social media he had agreed with Narendra Modi on a trade deal that would see American tariffs on India lowered from 25 per cent to 18 per cent.
He also said Mr Modi had agreed India would stop buying Russian oil and, in turn, Washington would lift the punitive 25 per cent levy.
But the lack of proper details on the agreement – and the fact it was supposedly arranged over the phone – led to scepticism over how much had really been achieved. India has made no subsequent public commitment to stop Russian oil purchases, and observers now see the outcome as a preliminary framework rather than a binding trade deal.
While the US Supreme Court judgement will have a global impact, it also comes at a particularly delicate point in trade talks between the Trump administration and China.
Trump’s original tariff programme had imposed duties of up to 25 per cent on about $250bn of Chinese imports, along with 7.5 per cent tariffs on another $110bn of Chinese goods. China retaliated with tariffs of up to 25 per cent on roughly $110bn worth of US goods, targeting agricultural exports such as soybeans, and filed complaints at the World Trade Organization.
Some analysts suggest the ruling could shift the balance in the dispute, with Trump due to travel to China from 31 March to 2 April to meet President Xi Jinping and thrash out a bilateral agreement. But while the decision might appear to strengthen Beijing’s hand, others expect both sides to preserve a delicate truce until then.
“It will give China a moral boost in their negotiations with Trump’s team ahead of the summit, but they are prepared for the scenario that nothing actually changes in reality,” Sun Yun, director of the China program at the Stimson Center, a Washington-based think tank, told the Associated Press.
“In general, I think it will just bring in a new period of high uncertainty in world trade, as everybody tries to figure out what the US tariff policy will be going forward,” Varg Folkman, analyst at the European Policy Centre think tank, told Reuters. “In the end it’s going to look pretty much the same.”

‘There is no chance I’ll ever pay off my eye-watering student debt in full. Here’s why that doesn’t matter’

‘There is no chance I’ll ever pay off my eye-watering student debt in full. Here’s why that doesn’t matter’
When Bryony Gooch braved reopening her student finance account and discovered the true total of her debt, she was flabbergasted. However, experts have told her not to panic, and say this is just more evidence for the need for a ‘wholesale rewiring’ of the education system
- Bookmark
- CommentsGo to comments
When it comes to my student debt, I have adopted the same approach as millions of other graduates in my position: out of sight, out of mind.
I knew, when I finally graduated in 2022 after three years as an undergraduate and a one-year Masters course, that the amount I owed was staggeringly vast and, on my meagre first salary in the world of full time work, it was not a problem for now.
But after Rachel Reeves decided to freeze the threshold at which we start paying our loans back, I decided to finally reopen my student finance account and see how bad the damage was.
My debt when I graduated was £84,541.66. I had paid a total of just £310, and yet, thanks to the interest on the debt, I now owe £87,264.76 – £2,700 more than the amount I owed when I left university.
I am one of millions of unlucky people on a Plan 2 loan – widely believed to be the most punishing of the five loan plans.
Plan 2 was introduced in 2012, with loans given an interest rate of retail prices index plus up to three per cent; it increases the more the graduate earns. Graduates repay nine per cent contributions from their earnings above the threshold of £28,470.
This will be frozen at its April 2026 level (£29,385) for three years, instead of increasing with inflation. It is set to increase each year in line with RPI from April 2030.
The education secretary has vowed to “look at” Plan B student loans but refused to commit to changing the system amid widespread concerns over costs. The chancellor has been characterised as a loan shark by the NUS.
The level of student debt has risen sharply in recent years, with the average graduate now leaving university owing around £53,600.

But, experts insist graduates concerned they may never pay off their student debt shouldn’t worry. According to IFS economist Kate Ogden, this was taken into consideration when the student loan system was set up.
She said: “I don’t think anybody should open up their student loan statement and panic. These are not like normal loans.
“It was fully expected from the start that a large proportion of people would not fully repay their loans. It was designed so that high-earning graduates would repay more than they borrowed in real terms. And that would fund a kind of subsidy for lower-earning graduates who’ll just never repay this. They were never meant to.”
The government has forecast that around 56 per cent of full-time undergraduates starting in 2024/25 will repay them in full, more than double the forecast for the 2022/23 cohort at 32 per cent, because of reforms to loan repayments for new students.
With the help of the Centre for Social Justice, I decided to work out what I would have to earn in order to pay off my student debt in full.
The results were, frankly, laughable.
According to their calculations, I would need a post-graduation starting salary of £68,346 – almost three times the average starting salary for graduates and significantly higher than the UK average salary at £39,039. And that would mean I would only just pay off my debt before the 30-year wipeout mark.
To pay off my debt in the next five years, I would have to go into a job that pays £207,773 which would put me in the top one per cent of earners in the UK.
The average graduate, leaving university owing£53,600, fares no better, according to the Centre for Social Justice, which modelled what would happen to their debt in three different financial scenarios*. Based on these simplified scenarios, there was no outcome where the debt was paid off before it was written off after 30 years.
- One person who graduates university to work a minimum wage job would repay just £899.17 while their loan would get written off at £139,056.
- One person who starts on the median graduate salary of £24,800, would repay £3,077.38, while their loan would get written off at £168,545.
- One person moves up through the median salaries for a graduate after one year, then jumps to the median promoted salaries after five and 10 years. They would repay £45,404.41, before the debt would get written off at a total of £177,512.
Ms Ogden added that while many people may never expect to pay back their loans, that doesn’t mean they won’t have an impact on their lives.
“Many people can still expect to repay a substantial amount towards these loans,” she explained. “So even if they don’t fully repay them, they are likely to have paid back thousands of pounds over the next few decades.
“These repayments will have an effect on people’s living standards, on their take-home pay.”
Dan Lilley, head of youth at the Centre for Social Justice, has said that the repayment terms were just one of many indications that the education system needed to change.
He said: “The repayment terms in the bloated student loans system are bonkers, but they are just one of many indications that our education system needs wholesale rewiring.
“For too long we have pushed young people into expensive university degrees whether or not they suit them without being honest about labour-market outcomes or cost, damaging the value of these degrees in the process.”
He suggested that more investment in apprenticeships could go a long way to helping generations get into work: “Apprentices not only earn while they train, but earn on average some £5,000 more than graduates five years after qualifying.”
Martin Lewis is among the many experts who have called for better financial education in schools and universities, so that people who are making decisions about their future understand just what they’re getting themselves into.
He said, in a post on Money Saving Expert last month: “Even after all these years we still, tragically, educate many of our youth into what we call a debt, but never educate them about debt.”
John Webb, head of consumer affairs at Experian, said: “Many young people are committing to complex, long-term student loans at 18 without fully understanding how interest builds, how repayments work or what it means for their financial future.
“We’ve made progress on financial education in schools, but it’s nowhere near enough. Young people should be equipped with a clear, practical understanding of borrowing, budgeting and how to protect their credit score, especially as they head into a tougher jobs market.”
A government spokesperson said: “We inherited the student loans system, including Plan 2, which was devised by the previous government. Threshold freezes have been introduced to protect taxpayers and students now, alongside future generations of learners and workers. The student finance system protects lower-earning graduates, with repayments determined by incomes and outstanding loans, and interest being cancelled at the end of repayment terms.
“Since we were elected, we have been committed to supporting the aspiration of anyone who can and wants to attend higher education.”
*Economic and income-based variables make it nearly impossible for graduates to predict exactly how much they will pay off their student loan. These calculations were based on a simplified scenario where the RPI averaged 2.4 per cent to match the long-run forecast, and wages grew at two per cent per year to reflect the Bank of England’s inflation target.

Andrew’s Met protection ‘asked to guard door at Epstein party’
- Emails suggest Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor's taxpayer-funded Metropolitan Police bodyguards were instructed to provide door security for a lavish dinner party at Jeffrey Epstein’s New York home in 2010, after Epstein's child sex offence conviction.
- The emails, part of the recently released Epstein files, indicate two royal protection officers and 'state security' were given instructions regarding security for the event.
- The revelation comes as the Met urges former and serving close protection officers who worked with Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor to share any relevant information regarding their investigation into Epstein.
- Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor was recently arrested and released under investigation by Thames Valley Police on suspicion of misconduct in public office, leading to calls to remove him from the line of succession.
- That followed allegations from the Epstein files that he shared sensitive information with the financier while serving as a UK trade envoy.

‘We’ll have to live with US tariffs,’ warns SECO head
The Swiss State Secretariat for Economic Affairs (SECO) is calling for patience after the US Supreme Court ruled that some of the US tariffs were illegal.

“It cannot be ruled out that the US administration will introduce new customs duties in a new decree,” it said.
At the moment, certain things are not yet clear,” said SECO head Helene Budliger Artieda in an interview with SonntagsBlick. “We need to wait a few days.” She assumes that the tariffs will remain in force whatever happens.
The United States has in fact announced that there are other legal possibilities, in particular section 232, relating to national security, or section 301, relating to unfair trading practices, Budliger Artieda noted. “I suspect we’ll have to live with the US tariffs.”
+ US tax yo-yo blurs situation for Swiss companies
On Friday evening, US President Donald Trump set the new tariffs at 15% for 150 days, the maximum authorised by a 1974 trade law. Switzerland is examining whether this measure also applies to Swiss goods, which until now have been subject to a rate of less than 15%, Budliger Artieda said.
Challenges and opportunities
This new situation could offer opportunities as well as challenges, according to the Secretary of State. “The primary objective remains to preserve jobs and Switzerland as a production location, and to guarantee our companies the best possible access to the US market, which is very important.”
+ Swiss politicians decry ‘gold bar diplomacy’ in Trump trade deal
On Friday, the US Supreme Court declared the tariffs decreed by the American president to be partially illegal. This decision concerns the tariffs presented as “reciprocal” by the US government, but not those applied to specific sectors of activity, such as automobiles or steel and aluminium.
Trump retaliated on Friday evening by introducing new global tariffs, first at 10%, then at 15%, applicable to all countries. They are due to come into force on Tuesday.

Ukraine condemned “ultimatums and blackmail” by the governments of Hungary and Slovakia on Saturday, after Budapest and Bratislava threatened to stop electricity supplies to Ukraine unless Kyiv restarts flows of Russian oil.
Shipments of Russian oil to Hungary and Slovakia have been cut off since Jan. 27, when Kyiv says a Russian drone strike hit pipeline equipment in western Ukraine. Slovakia and Hungary accuse Ukraine of slow-walking the repairs for political purposes.
Slovakia’s Prime Minister Robert Fico said on Saturday that he would cut off emergency electricity supplies to Ukraine unless Kyiv resumes Russian oil transit to Slovakia over Ukrainian territory. Hungary’s Viktor Orbán made a similar threat days earlier.

Hungary threatens block EU sanctions on Russia over Ukraine pipeline dispute
A unanimous decision from the 27-nation bloc is required for the sanctions to pass
- Bookmark
Hungary has threatened to block a new package of European Union sanctions against Russia and stall efforts to help Ukraine, demanding the immediate resumption of Russian oil deliveries.
This ultimatum precedes a meeting of EU foreign ministers in Brussels on Monday to discuss the bloc's 20th round of sanctions, hoping for approval by the fourth anniversary of Russia's invasion of Ukraine on Tuesday.
Hungarian Foreign Minister Péter Szijjártó announced his intention to block the sanctions in a social media video on Sunday, accusing Ukraine of deliberately withholding Russian oil shipments via the Druzhba pipeline. He stated: "We will not consent to the adoption of the 20th package of sanctions, because we have previously made it clear that until the Ukrainians resume oil shipments to Hungary, we will not allow decisions that are important to them to be approved."
Russian oil shipments to Hungary and Slovakia have been interrupted since 27 January.
Ukrainian officials claim damage to the Druzhba pipeline, which carries Russian crude across Ukrainian territory, was caused by Russian drone attacks, escalating tensions between Budapest and Kyiv.
A unanimous decision from the 27-nation bloc is required for the sanctions to pass.
Most European nations have significantly reduced or ceased Russian energy imports since Moscow launched its war in February 2022.
Yet Hungary and Slovakia, both EU and NATO members, have maintained and even increased their reliance on Russian oil and gas, receiving a temporary exemption from an EU policy prohibiting such imports.
Mr Szijjártó also announced on Saturday that Hungary would block a major €90bn ($106bn) EU loan to Ukraine, intended to support Kyiv's military and economic needs for the next two years. Earlier, Hungary and Slovakia halted diesel shipments to Ukraine over the oil interruptions. Slovakian Prime Minister Robert Fico threatened to cut off emergency electricity supplies to its neighbour if oil deliveries were not restored by Monday.
These actions align with Hungary's nationalist Prime Minister Viktor Orbán, who maintains the closest relationship with the Kremlin among EU leaders.
Mr Orbán argues Russian fossil fuels are indispensable for his economy, claiming switching to alternatives would trigger immediate economic collapse – an assertion disputed by experts. He has frequently threatened to undermine the bloc’s efforts to sanction Moscow, blasted attempts to hit Russia’s energy revenues that help finance the war, and previously vetoed EU military and financial assistance to Ukraine.

France to summon US ambassador over comments on slain far-right activist, foreign minister says
France will summon the US ambassador to France, Charles Kushner, over comments on the killing of a French far-right activist Quentin Deranque last week, French Foreign Minister Jean-Noël Barrot said on Sunday
French Foreign Minister Jean-Noël Barrot said on Sunday that he would summon the US ambassador to France, Charles Kushner, over comments on the killing of a French far-right activist last week.
"We are going to summon the United States ambassador to France, since the US embassy in France commented on this tragedy... which concerns the national community," Barrot told local media.
“We reject any instrumentalisation of this tragedy, which has plunged a French family into mourning, for political ends,” Barrot said. “We have no lessons to learn, particularly on the issue of violence, from the international reactionary movement.”
French far-right activist Quentin Deranque was beaten to death in a fight with alleged hard-left activists, in an incident that shocked the nation.
Deranque's killing highlighted a climate of deep political tensions ahead of next year’s presidential vote. French President Emmanuel Macron called for calm on Saturday as around 3,000 people joined a march in Lyon organised by far-right groups to pay tribute to Deranque.

The US Embassy in France and the US State Department's Bureau of Counterterrorism said they were monitoring the case, warning on X that "violent radical leftism was on the rise" and should be treated as a public safety threat.
Sarah Rogers, the US State Department under secretary for public diplomacy, said Deranque's killing showed "why we treat political violence – terrorism – so harshly".
"Once you decide to kill people for their opinions instead of persuade them, you've opted out of civilization," she wrote on X.
The administration of US President Donald Trump condemned the role of "violent radical leftism" in the case.
Last week, Deranque's killing caused a diplomatic feud between France and Italy, whose right-wing prime minister, Giorgia Meloni, has warm ties with Trump.
Meloni called the killing "a wound for all of Europe", prompting Macron to criticise her for speaking on French domestic affairs.

France is holding municipal elections next month and right-wing political forces have been using the incident to demonise the hard-left France Unbowed party (La France Insoumise, or LFI) led by Jean-Luc Mélenchon. Far-right National Rally leader Jordan Bardella has called for a common front against Mélenchon's party.

Six men suspected of involvement in the fatal assault have been handed preliminary charges over the killing, while a parliamentary assistant to an LFI MP has also been charged with complicity.
Barrot on Sunday said he has other topics to discuss with Kushner, including US decisions to impose sanctions on Thierry Breton, a former EU commissioner responsible for supervising social media rules, and Nicolas Guillou, a French judge at the International Criminal Court.
They have been targeted by “unjustified and unjustifiable” sanctions, Barrot said.
Macron also recently wrote to Trump to call for the lifting of “unfairly imposed sanctions” against several European citizens, including former Breton and Guillou, French weekly La Tribune Dimanche reported Sunday.

UEFA and FIFA may get a red card at the ICC for ignoring Israeli violations
A landmark referral of UEFA and FIFA leaders to the International Criminal Court could set an important legal precedent.
On February 16, a group of Palestinian footballers, clubs and advocacy groups referred the heads of FIFA and UEFA to the International Criminal Court (ICC). The 120-page filing accuses Gianni Infantino and Aleksander Čeferin of “aiding and abetting war crimes (specifically, the transfer of civilian population into occupied territories) and crimes against humanity (specifically, apartheid)”.
This historic case marks the first time sports leaders are being accused of these crimes and sends a warning to presidents of all other corporate entities in and beyond athletics. It offers a perfect opportunity to challenge the impunity of Israeli apartheid, occupation and genocide.
Football is the world’s most popular form of cultural expression, with some five billion fans across the planet. Therefore, the stakes of this charge are immense in terms of the spectacle of accountability and legal precedent.
In the course of its campaign in Gaza, of genocide generally and “athleticide” particularly, Israel has killed 1,007 Palestinian sportspeople and destroyed 184 sports facilities, while damaging 81 others.
Although this “athleticide” cannot be directly attributed to the Israel Football Association (IFA), its activities linked to clubs from illegal Israeli settlements located on the occupied Palestinian territory and their participation in domestic and international tournaments can be seen as abetting Israeli crimes of occupation and apartheid.
Despite facing demands for the suspension of these clubs or the IFA, UEFA and FIFA leadership have taken no action. In a recent interview, FIFA chief Infantino said he opposed a ban on Israeli teams from participation in global football, calling it “a defeat”. He went on to add that he was in favour of enshrining in FIFA statutes that no country should ever be banned from “playing football because of the acts of their political leaders”.
Ironic, when you consider he is the very person who oversaw the suspension of Russia from FIFA in 2022 and the banning of Crimean clubs from playing in the Russian league, linked to UEFA, after the Russian occupation of the Ukrainian peninsula in 2014.
The complaint is filed against Infantino and Čeferin because private organisations cannot be defendants before the ICC, but those individuals responsible for their policies can be.
The focus of the complaint is the fact that the IFA has been permitted to materially support, recognise, and include in domestic and international competitions clubs that are based in the stolen settlement land of the occupied West Bank.
Article 64(2) of FIFA Statutes prohibits member associations and their clubs from playing on the territory of another member association without the latter’s approval.
The complaint alleges that by allowing the IFA to oversee clubs that operate on stolen land, Infantino and Čeferin are accountable for normalising illegal Israeli settlements, in direct contravention of a 2024 pronouncement by the International Court of Justice (ICJ) and a resolution from the United Nations General Assembly, which found the settlements to be “unlawful” and required Israel to “cease immediately all new settlement activities, and to evacuate all settlers from the Occupied Palestinian Territory”.
The existence of sanctioned Israeli clubs in West Bank settlements, the referral argues, contributes to the transfer of the civilian population into the occupied territory, contrary to the Rome Statute Article 8(2)(b)(viii), by normalising colonisation.
Likewise, because Israeli clubs in the occupied territory prohibit Palestinians from spectating matches or playing for or managing these teams, the continued sanction of these organisations falls under the definition of aiding and abetting apartheid (a crime against humanity pursuant to Rome Statute Article 7(1)(j).
In continuing to allow the membership of these clubs and the IFA in global and European sport, the filing alleges that Infantino and Čeferin have acted in full knowledge that they have participated in the violation of international law based on the fact that they have deliberately ignored numerous reports and letters advising them to intervene.
Now that the complaint has been formally filed, the Office of the Prosecutor of the ICC will conduct a preliminary examination to confirm that the elements of jurisdiction, admissibility, and the interests of justice have been satisfied. They will then have the option to either decline to open the investigation or proceed to investigate the legal issues raised in the complaint.
If an investigation does ensue, evidence-gathering will occur and arrest warrants or summonses may ultimately be issued. If that happens, this would set an important precedent and give momentum to the campaign for justice for Palestine.
It is notable that while Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has been able to dodge an ICC arrest warrant by cowering away from Rome Statute signatory states, it would be impossible for Infantino and Čeferin to do so while still fulfilling their roles, assuming it is enforced.
Football is, without question, one of the most popular sports on the planet. When such a cultural juggernaut is connected to business, what emerges is an industry like no other. FIFA and UEFA are global regulatory monopolies, meaning their rules and regulations act the same way a country’s legislation acts on its population. They also preside over a huge, lucrative industry worth hundreds of millions of dollars.
Given the amount of eyeballs and money at stake, the impact of a ban on participation is enormous, as Russia understands all too well after being subjected to suspension. This is no doubt exactly why the presidents of these organisations have refused to act against Israel under the guise of “political neutrality”.
As former UN special rapporteur on the occupied Palestinian territory, Michael Lynk, told us: “When an occupying power is blatantly committing war crimes by creating civilian settlements in occupied territory, the rest of the world – including states, corporations and international sporting organisations – is required to ensure the enforcement of international law by doing everything in their power to bring the violations to a swift end. Yet, FIFA and UEFA are sportswashing the illegal Israeli occupation by allowing the Israeli Football Association to include clubs based in the illegal settlements to participate in their domestic leagues. Nothing could be further from the rules of fairness and equity.”
The bottom line is that sport is and has always been political. The veneer of “political neutrality” conceals the reality that politics is the name of the game for FIFA and UEFA.
Nobody is entitled to stand above international law. It is time for the ICC to prove it.

Afghanistan's Taliban say Pakistan strikes kill, injure dozens
Pakistan said it launched strikes on militant targets in Afghanistan after blaming recent suicide bombings, including assaults during the Muslim holy month of Ramadan, on fighters it said were operating from its neighbour's territory.
Women and children were among the dozens killed and injured in Saturday's attacks, the South Asian nation's ruling Taliban said, in remarks Reuters could not verify, while its defence ministry vowed an appropriate response at a suitable time.
The strikes bring a sharp escalation in tension just days after Kabul released three Pakistani soldiers in a Saudi-mediated move to ratchet down worries following months of clashes along the rugged frontier.
The attacks featured "intelligence-based selective targeting of seven terrorist camps and hideouts" belonging to the Pakistani Taliban as well as Islamic State Khorasan Province along the Afghan border, Pakistan's information ministry said.
In a statement, it added that it had "conclusive evidence" the attacks were carried out by Khwarij, employing a term by which it refers to the Pakistani Taliban.
They were acting on instructions from "their Afghanistan-based leadership and handlers," the ministry said in Saturday's statement.
Kabul has repeatedly denied allowing militants to use Afghan territory to stage attacks in Pakistan.
A Taliban spokesperson said the attacks had killed and injured dozens of people, including women and children, but Reuters was unable to independently verify the remarks.
Afghanistan's defence ministry condemned what it called the blatant violation of national sovereignty as a "breach of international law, the principles of good neighbourliness and Islamic values."
It added in its statement, "An appropriate and measured response will be taken at a suitable time."
Among the incidents of strike Pakistan listed were a mosque bombing in Islamabad and violence in the northwestern border districts of Bajaur and Bannu.
On Saturday, the military said a suicide bomber in these districts targeted a convoy of security forces, killing five militants in a gun battle and two soldiers when an explosives-laden vehicle rammed into a military vehicle.
Tension has forced repeated closures of key border crossings, disrupting trade and activity along the 2,600-km (1,600-mile) frontier.
Clashes in October killed dozens before a fragile ceasefire was agreed, but Pakistan continues to accuse Afghanistan's Taliban rulers of harbouring militants who stage attacks inside its territory - a claim Kabul denies.

High Court orders state to advance permits for egalitarian Western Wall plaza

The High Court of Justice on Thursday ordered the government and the Jerusalem Municipality to move forward with obtaining building permits for long-delayed repairs and infrastructure upgrades at the Western Wall’s egalitarian prayer platform, setting binding procedural deadlines aimed at ending nearly a decade of stalled implementation.
In a unanimous decision issued by an expanded seven-justice panel, the court instructed state authorities to complete the necessary bureaucratic steps required to restore and upgrade the Ezrat Yisrael plaza – the southern prayer area designated for mixed-gender and non-Orthodox worship under the government-backed 2016 “Kotel Agreement.”
The ruling followed a hearing earlier last week, during which justices pressed state and municipal representatives over why worshipers at the egalitarian section still cannot reliably reach the Western Wall itself and why even basic repair work has remained stuck for years amid disputes over planning authority and permitting procedures.
In Thursday’s decision, the court clarified that no additional cabinet or ministerial approval is required as a precondition for filing building-permit applications. This determination removes a key procedural hurdle cited as a cause of previous delays.
The justices further ordered that any remaining sign-off required from the Israel Antiquities Authority must be decided within 14 days. Following that determination, the state must submit new building permit applications within an additional 14 days.
If planning authorities do not issue a decision within 45 days of submission, the lack of response will be treated as a refusal, triggering the state’s obligation to file an appeal with the Jerusalem District Planning and Building Committee.
The state and the Jerusalem Municipality were also instructed to submit an update to the court within 90 days detailing progress on securing the necessary approvals.
The egalitarian prayer space, located near Robinson’s Arch at the southern end of the Western Wall, was established as part of a compromise intended to provide a recognized venue for pluralistic prayer alongside the traditional, gender-segregated main plaza.
Plans for egalitarian prayer space frozen amid political pressure
But plans to develop the site were frozen in 2017 under political pressure from ultra-Orthodox coalition partners, prompting petitions by the Reform and Masorti movements, Women of the Wall, and religious-pluralism advocacy groups.
Petitioners have argued that the area remains difficult to access, lacks basic facilities, and does not offer meaningful proximity to the Western Wall’s stones – conditions they say undermine the intent of the original compromise.
The court did not revisit legal questions concerning prayer rights at the site in Thursday’s ruling, instead emphasizing the need to advance the “practical implementation” of arrangements already approved in principle.
Pluralism advocates welcomed the decision as a significant step toward restoring physical access to the egalitarian section.
Religious authorities and ultra-Orthodox political leaders, on the other hand, sharply criticized the court’s intervention, saying that matters concerning prayer arrangements at the Western Wall fall outside its jurisdiction.

Most Jewish Israelis blame Arab crime wave on 'cultural problem,' poll finds

A majority of Jewish respondents (56%) said the main reason for the high number of murders in Arab society was a 'cultural problem' within the sector, according to a Maariv poll released on Friday.
The survey also found a sharp divide between Jewish and Arab respondents on the causes of the violence. While most Jewish respondents pointed to cultural factors, a similar majority of Arab respondents (57%) blamed police inaction.
Across the full sample, about half of respondents said cultural factors were the main cause, 31% pointed to police inaction, 12% blamed restrictions imposed by the judicial system on police and security agencies, and 8% said they did not know.
On violent demonstrations, 69% of respondents said authorities should use the maximum force legally possible, with especially strong support among opposition voters (78%), according to the poll. Another 17% said the events should be contained as much as possible, while 14% said they did not know.
The findings came amid continued uncertainty over the Iranian front and public uproar following the attack on two female soldiers in Bnei Brak, against the backdrop of a political system that remains largely deadlocked.
Recent surveys have also pointed to deep concern over crime, policing, and personal security, especially in Arab society. A November 2025 Abraham Initiatives survey found that 64% of Arab respondents named crime and violence as the most pressing issue facing Arab society.
Arab respondents report high fear of violence, low security
An Israel Democracy Institute survey published in November reported that 80% of Arab respondents feared serious violence or gunfire tied to criminal conflicts, and only 19% expressed high trust in police. INSS data published in January found that only 7% of Arab respondents reported a high sense of personal security, while 55% reported low or very low security.
At the same time, the Maariv poll showed little change in the broader electoral map.
The poll was conducted by Lazar Research under Dr. Menachem Lazar in cooperation with Panel4All on February 18-19 among 501 respondents, a representative sample of Israel’s adult population aged 18 and over, Jewish and Arab. The maximum margin of sampling error was 4.4%.

8 hours ago
A Palestinian teenager died Sunday of wounds he sustained from Israeli army fire in the northern West Bank, the Health Ministry said.
A ministry statement said that Mohammad Hanani, 17, breathed his last in the town of Beit Furik, east of Nablus.
Hanani was shot in the head on Saturday evening during an Israeli military raid in the town, according to the official news agency Wafa.
Another 16-year-old was injured in the raid.
Israel has intensified raids in the occupied West Bank, including East Jerusalem, since launching its military offensive in Gaza on October 8, 2023.
At least 1,117 Palestinians have been killed and around 11,500 others injured in attacks by the army and illegal settlers in the West Bank during that period.

IDF medics treated war wounded without Hepatitis B protection
Unknown

20:33:35 KST

IDF combat medics – required by military orders to be protected against Hepatitis B and who were exposed to bodily fluids through which the virus can be transmitted – were forced to serve while effectively unvaccinated, at risk of contracting the pathogen through direct exposure, Israel Hayom has learned.
Hepatitis B can lead to cirrhosis and liver cancer. As far as is known, the command echelon, responsible for ensuring immunological protection, did not intervene.
According to testimony obtained by this newspaper, a number of medics serving in regional brigades under Northern Command, who treated soldiers with severe wounds sustained in Syria and Lebanon, served throughout the war without sufficient Hepatitis B antibodies in their bloodstream.
The reports contradict the orders of the IDF's Chief Medical Officer, which require the army to administer a booster shot to soldiers as part of their service as medics – to protect their health, particularly given that they are exposed in heightened ways to blood and bodily fluids carrying various pathogens, including Hepatitis B, and face a high risk of infection.
"At the start of my service, I joined a brigade alongside two other medics who had been in my course," a female medic who recently served in one of the northern regional brigades said. "During that period, we happened to undergo an antibody blood test." The test was conducted months after she had received her booster shot.
"After the results came back, another medic and I were told we didn't have enough Hepatitis B antibodies in our blood and were notified we needed an additional vaccine. At the same time, we discovered that two other medics had also been required to get vaccinated – even though we had all received the booster shot."
This stage should have served as a warning to the brigade commanders and to medical corps professionals responsible for drafting orders in their fields. It appears, however, that the group's case was the last to be taken seriously during that period. "After our case, not a single medic who came in afterward was sent for an antibody blood test – let alone for a vaccine, since there is no need for one if there is no indication from the initial blood tests" – tests that were never conducted at all.
In accordance with Israeli law
In most cases, the IDF administers a booster shot to soldiers designated to serve as medics during the induction process on their enlistment day, so that they arrive at Training Base 10 (the IDF's dedicated combat medic school) already able to safely practice using medical equipment. The decision is based on the Israeli approach, under which anyone born after 1992 receives three vaccine doses before the age of six months.
In practice, the IDF adopted existing Israeli law and adapted it to its needs, in a manner similar to the Health Ministry's procedure for civilian healthcare workers. The ministry's directive states, "Healthcare workers and students in healthcare professions must therefore be vaccinated against serious, important diseases" – at minimum, airborne diseases, as well as polio and Hepatitis B, which can cause severe liver damage that sometimes deteriorates into cirrhosis or even cancer.
As noted, the military adopted a similar directive, requiring that a soldier in the "healthcare worker" population receive a booster shot after age 18 to be considered vaccinated against Hepatitis B.
Alternatively, the IDF ruled that a soldier who received three vaccine doses within the decade before enlistment is considered vaccinated – a clause that is clearly relevant for new immigrants, or for those who refused the vaccine. The IDF's Chief Medical Officer went further, determining, "There is no need for an antibody test after the vaccine or the vaccine series." Receiving the booster shot alone, the officer determined, is sufficient to establish that a medic is immune to the virus.
Yet the serious testimony obtained by Israel Hayom paints an entirely different picture – one that raises sharp questions about how the army protects the health of both its treating medics and its patients.
"Who knows how many 'vaccinated' medics got infected"
The implications are straightforward. A large portion of the medics who served alongside the female medic may have treated patients throughout their service without any immunological protection suited to their role – without intervention from base commanders, and in direct violation of the IDF Chief Medical Officer's order, which states, "Overall responsibility for vaccinating all those required to be vaccinated in a unit rests with the unit commander." It is not unreasonable to assume that medics currently serving at bases across the country are also effectively unvaccinated – and have no idea.
"During my service, I was posted to the brigade's field intensive care unit," the medic who spoke with Israel Hayom said. "We were the first to respond at any point in the sector and treated every type of case – from children with minor cuts to soldiers who came back from Lebanon with partial limb amputations – and I had no idea what the sterile conditions were like there.
"Some of those who boarded the ambulance with me and treated those same patients now say they did so without ever undergoing an antibody test, and I know several who were aware they didn't have sufficient antibodies in their blood but treated patients anyway – because that manpower was needed at that moment."
"As a medic in the army's field intensive care unit, you are exposed to exactly the kinds of cases through which the virus can be transmitted through bodily fluids," said another medic in whom no antibodies were found.
"This is a situation that falls entirely under commanders' responsibility, and it is absurd that these situations didn't raise a red flag for any of them, at a time when the orders state that we are protected and that there is no need to check whether we have sufficient antibodies. I don't want to know how many other bases across the country have the same situations happening right now, with nobody knowing about them," the medic concluded. "Who knows how many medics got infected while thinking they were vaccinated. This is a real danger."
The IDF had not responded by the time of publication. Its response will be included when received.

Tariff ruling limits Trump's leverage but won't end uncertainty for trade partners
Sign up now: Get ST's newsletters delivered to your inbox
WASHINGTON, Feb 22 - The U.S. Supreme Court's decision to strike down a large swath of President Donald Trump's tariffs has weakened his ability to threaten and impose tariffs at a moment's notice, but it won't end gnawing uncertainty for trade partners or companies.
Trump responded within hours to the ruling on Friday, slapping a new 10% tariff on all imports and ordering new trade investigations that could lead to additional levies in months, while insisting that trade and investment deals reached with nearly 20 countries - most with higher tariffs - should remain untouched.
Less than 24 hours later, he raised the rate of the new tariff to 15% - the maximum level allowed under the law.
Wendy Cutler, a former U.S. trade official and senior vice president at the Asia Society Policy Institute, said Trump's rapid-fire change was emblematic of the president's desire - and ability - to keep trading partners on their toes.
"The uncertainty, in his view, just gives him enormous additional leverage beyond the actual tariffs. Because people are worried about what he'll do."
But Cutler and other trade experts agree Trump's wings have been clipped. The 10% replacement tariff lasts only 150 days, and new tariffs imposed under other statutes will take longer to implement, robbing the president of the "anytime, anywhere for any reason" cudgel he used to impose tariffs before his use of the International Emergency Economic Powers Act was nixed.
"He's lost his favorite tool," Cutler said. "Particularly for foreign policy matters and things that irk him on other countries that have nothing to do with trade, he's lost the ability to offer a credible threat."
William Reinsch, a former senior U.S. government official who is now with the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said the Supreme Court's solid 6-3 ruling diminished Trump's ability to threaten other countries.
"It takes away his ability to wave the big stick around," he said, although the economic impact will be limited, with the 10% tariff and other duties expected in coming months replacing some if not all the tariffs now deemed illegal.
Michael Froman, president of the Council on Foreign Relations, said the ruling and the administration's response left many questions unanswered, including how importers could get refunds for duties collected illegally, and what further tariffs were still coming.
"Perhaps the most consequential impact of the Supreme Court's decision is that it should curtail the threat or use of tariffs as the president's preferred form of leverage or punishment outside the trade domain," said Froman, who served as former President Barack Obama's chief trade negotiator from 2013 to 2017.
That development could provide relief to countries scarred by Trump's unpredictability and repeated use of tariff threats to punish them over non-trade matters, extract concessions and secure foreign investments.
The U.S. president had invoked IEEPA to impose tariffs over a range of non-trade issues, leaving countries bruised and skittish, and heightening uncertainty for companies around the world. He threatened tariffs against European countries over their opposition to his claims on Greenland, against Canada for allowing the importation of electric vehicles from China, and against Brazil for its treatment of far-right former President Jair Bolsonaro, a Trump ally.
NO MORE 'TRADE BAZOOKA'
Josh Lipsky, chair of international economics at the Atlantic Council, cautioned that it was too early to predict the impact of the Supreme Court's ruling on Trump's leverage, given uncertainty about fresh tariffs and the president's willingness to use a range of tools.
"It's a significant blow to his international economic trade agenda. It's not a crippling one, necessarily, because of the other authorities, but we have to see how they play out in practice," he said. "It feels like the 'tariff armada' has come to the rescue despite IEEPA. But how that plays out in terms of leverage is a different question in the months ahead."
It is also unclear what will happen to nearly 20 framework deals or firmer trade agreements that the Trump administration has reached with countries in recent months that were based on the IEEPA tariff threats.
Trump, U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer and Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent insisted on Friday that the deals should remain in effect, even if those rates were higher than the temporary universal tax.
Analysts said they doubted countries could seek to abrogate or renegotiate deals, out of concern of triggering Trump's ire.
Miriam Sapiro, a former senior U.S. trade official and adjunct professor of international and public affairs at Columbia University, said Trump might have lost his "trade bazooka," but she didn't expect the existing deals to unravel. However, the ruling could give countries more leverage in new or ongoing negotiations with the Trump administration, Sapiro said.
"There'll still be interest in doing deals because of the uncertainty and the desire to keep the U.S. as a strong ally and strong partner," she said. "But countries do have a bit more bargaining power than they might have felt they had previously."
From Trump's perspective, she said, using IEEPA was a risk he was willing to take because it helped reel in some trade deals quickly, although details still needed to be worked out in some cases and enforcement could be challenging.
Greer told Fox News' "Special Report" program that IEEPA was the appropriate tool at the time, given Trump's desire to move quickly and flexibly, and said it had helped open market access for U.S. firms. "We don't regret it," he said. "We'll just use a different tool."
Initial reactions from overseas were measured as countries assessed the Supreme Court decision. South Korea said it would review the ruling and U.S. response and planned to continue "amicable" talks over implementation of a tariff agreement finalized in November with $350 billion in investment pledges.
Tom Ramage, an economic policy analyst at the Korea Economic Institute of America, said the Trump administration's continued ability to tap other tariff measures would likely persuade South Korea and its companies to maintain their commitments.
"Anything less could increase the likelihood that the president will impose further retaliation, especially if the administration seeks to make an example of countries that want to back out of negotiated deals," he wrote on KEI's website. REUTERS

Coalition calls to criminalise assistance to ISIS-linked Australians seeking to return
In short:
The Coalition has proposed a new criminal offence for those who help associates of terror groups to return to Australia.
It has accused the government of failing to do enough to block the return of 34 Australians with Islamic State links.
The Coalition's shadow national security committee met on Sunday to approve the bill but has not published it in full.
The federal opposition has proposed a new criminal offence to punish those who help Australians with links to Islamic State to return home, as it accuses the government of being complacent about the possible return of 34 wives and children of former fighters.
Home Affairs Minister Tony Burke has imposed a temporary block on one member of the cohort, but told ABC Insiders on Sunday that ASIO did not believe the other 33 met the bar for the same, and that none of the group met the criteria to be denied passports.
The group has been issued passports, which the ABC has reported were brought to Syria by a group of family members and others trying to help them return. Mr Burke has maintained that the government will not assist with the repatriation.
But opposition spokesperson Jonathon Duniam on Sunday accused the government of "not doing enough" to block the group's return, saying the Coalition would work with the government to pass new laws if these would help to achieve that goal.
The new proposal would make it an offence for anyone to assist those who are "linked to terrorist hotspots or terrorist organisations" or have committed terror-related offences to return to Australia.
An exception would apply in circumstances where the government had given "express permission" for repatriation to occur.
"This legislation sends a very clear message: anyone who travels to a designated terrorist hotspot, such as Syria, to support a death cult like ISIS does not deserve to come back to Australia," Senator Duniam said.
The Coalition's shadow national security committee met on Sunday to approve the bill, but has not published it in full. It is not clear whether the Coalition intends for the laws to apply retrospectively to those who have been assisting the current cohort.
The women themselves are not the target of the bill, but may face criminal charges under existing laws when they return to Australia, for associating with a terrorist group. The government has promised the "full force of the law" will apply.
Group of 34 'not consistent': Burke
Mr Burke said the decision to single out just one member of the cohort for a temporary exclusion order was made on the advice of authorities and reflected that the others were "very different people".
"[They have] different histories, and different states of mind, if I can put it in those terms. They are quite different," he said.
Mr Burke added that intelligence agencies had been "following them for a long time", although government officials had not been able to interview them in person since 2022.
The group is currently in the Al-Roj camp in north-eastern Syria, which is under the control of Kurdish authorities. They were not successful in their first attempt to leave that camp last week, but both Syrian and Kurdish authorities want the camp closed.
The ABC has revealed the names of the 11 women in the group, several of whom have spoken to the broadcaster about their circumstances in the past.

UK won’t rule out trade war with US over new tariffs
- A UK Cabinet minister has not ruled out imposing retaliatory tariffs on the US but says that negotiation "behind the scenes" is the preferred approach.
- Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson said the government expects its preferential tariff deal with the US to continue, despite the US president's announcement of 15 per cent global tariffs.
- The US president's new tariffs follow a Supreme Court ruling that struck down his previous import levies, throwing the UK's trade strategy into disarray.
- Previous deals, including specific carve-outs for Britain's steel and car industries, are now in question following the US president's latest tariff announcements.
- The UK government is engaged in ongoing discussions with the US, aiming to secure the best possible deal for British businesses and expects its "privileged trading position" to continue.

Power outages hit six Ukrainian regions following new Russian attacks
Ukraine's power grid operator Ukrenergo announced this on Facebook, Ukrinform reports.
"Where the security situation allows, emergency restoration work has already begun. Energy workers are doing everything possible to bring the equipment damaged by the enemy back online as quickly as possible," the company said.
Due to the aftermath of previous massive attacks, most Ukrainian regions are implementing measures to limit electricity consumption: power restriction schedules for industry and hourly outages for all categories of consumers.
In the regions affected by these schedules, careful energy use remains essential. Ukrenergo urges consumers to limit the use of high-power devices, avoid running multiple appliances simultaneously, and, if possible, move energy-intensive processes to nighttime hours – after 23:00.
Overnight on February 22, Russian forces launched a combined strike on Ukraine's critical infrastructure using attack drones and air- and ground-launched missiles. Ukraine's air defense forces intercepted 33 missiles and 274 enemy drones of various types.

Anti-Zionist group plans keffiyeh protest amid Buchenwald camp's ban on pro-Palestinian symbols

Far-left anti-Zionist groups are preparing to protest this year’s memorial of the liberation of the Buchenwald camp due to the camp’s ban on pro-Palestinian symbols.
The ‘Kufiyas in Buchenwald’ protest group is organized by the Kufiya Network, as well as Jüdische Stimme and Palästina-Solidarität Köln. The groups accuse the Buchenwald camp of “massively intensifying repression against solidarity with Palestine” through bans on keffiyehs and Palestinian flags.
The group describes itself as an initiative of Jews, queer people, and anti-fascists.
Kufiyas in Buchenwald has scheduled a protest for April 11-12. It is set to include a guided tour “that vividly illustrates the events of the former concentration camp,” lectures, and a panel discussion.
The protest against the camp comes after one of the members of the group, Anna, was banned from visiting last year after she filed an expedited court application requesting she be allowed to wear a keffiyeh during her visit there.
Her request was denied. Following this incident, in April 2025, the camp changed its guidelines to introduce a ban on wearing keffiyehs.
The Kufiyas in Buchenwald statement (which has a dedicated website and social media presence) claims that Buchenwald has become a place of “historical revisionism and genocide denial” due to its choice to “consistently spread Israeli propaganda and provide ideological support for the ongoing genocide in Palestine.”
The group cites various “examples” of repression, including its ban on Palestinian symbols (keffiyeh, olive branch, watermelon), bans on certain speeches, and ‘instrumentalization of remembrance.’
The group said that Buchenwald has “cynically linked” the keffiyeh to German fascism and antisemitism, “therefore relativizing and whitewashing German responsibility for the genocide of European Jews by shifting it onto the Palestinians.”
It also condemned how, at the commemoration of the 80th anniversary of the liberation of Buchenwald in April 2025, Jewish philosopher Omri Böhm was “disinvited under pressure from the Israeli embassy for having criticized Zionism and the genocide in Gaza.”
This disinvitation drew particular ire from the group, given Israeli flags and symbols are permitted.
The group claims that Buchenwald’s anti-Palestinian measures have been put in place to “ideologically justify Germany’s renewed participation in genocide – and to do so in a place where genocide was committed 81 years ago.”
It claims this behavior betrays the legacy of those who were imprisoned, tortured, and murdered in Buchenwald – not only Jews, but also Sinti and Roma, queer people, communists, and international anti-fascists.
Kufiyas call for Gaza genocide discussion at Buchenwald
Kufiyas in Buchenwald demands that the management of the Buchenwald and Mittelbau-Dora Memorials Foundation openly address the genocide in Gaza at the Buchenwald Memorial; remove the ban on Palestinian symbols at the Buchenwald Memorial and cease the denigration of them as antisemitic; and halt the no entry or no speaking bans on the premises due to solidarity with Palestine or criticism of the State of Israel.
Given the current ban, the protest will most likely not take place on the grounds themselves.
A spokesperson for the Buchenwald and Mittelbau-Dora Memorials Foundation told the German site NZZ: “We are concerned that attempts are being made to inappropriately exploit the commemoration.”
The Jerusalem Post approached the memorial for comment.

Huckabee tells Carlson Israel ruling entire Middle East 'would be fine,' drawing Arab backlash

In an interview on the Tucker Carlson Show podcast, US Ambassador to Israel Mike Huckabee claimed that although he believed it was “fine” if Israel claimed extensive territory in the Middle East, citing a biblical interpretation, he insisted that Jerusalem is not attempting to do this.
For more stories from The Media Line go to themedialine.org
Nonetheless, his remarks sparked strong criticism from Arab leaders.
The controversy began when Carlson and Ambassador Huckabee discussed a biblical verse that indicated land that including parts of Egypt, Syria and Iraq belonged to Israel.
Carlson observed the territory referenced was “basically the entire Middle East.” He continued: “Does Israel have the right to that land?”
“Not sure we’d go that far,” Huckabee replied. “It would be a big piece of land.”
Carlson repeated: “Does Israel have the right to that land?”
“It would be fine if they took it all,” Huckabee responded, but added, “I don’t think that’s what we’re talking about here today.”
Carlson asked: “You think it would be fine if the state of Israel took over all of Jordan?”
“They’re not trying to take over Jordan. They’re not trying to take over Syria. They’re not trying to take over Iraq or anywhere else, but they do want to protect their people,” Huckabee responded.
“I think you’re missing something because they’re not asking to go back to take all of that, but they are asking to at least take the land that they now occupy, they now live in, they now own legitimately, and it is a safe haven for them,” Huckabee added.
Jordan decries Huckabee's 'absurd and provocative' remarks
Arab governments reacted sharply on Saturday to remarks by Huckabee, describing them as inconsistent with diplomatic practice and international norms.
Jordan’s Foreign Ministry spokesman Fuad al-Majali denounced the comments as “absurd and provocative statements,” saying they amounted to “an assault on the sovereignty of the countries of the region and a flagrant breach of international law.” Egypt’s Foreign Ministry likewise rejected the remarks, calling them a “blatant violation” of diplomatic norms and saying they ran counter to President Donald Trump’s stated vision for ending the war in Gaza.
The secretary-general of the Arab League, which represents 22 member states, Ahmed Aboul Gheit, said Huckabee’s comments were at odds with long-standing US policy positions. Palestinian officials also weighed in, urging the Trump administration to adopt a “clear and explicit stance” in response to the statements.
The White House and the State Department did not respond to requests for comment.

Weak but willful: How would Hezbollah join Iran in a war against US, Israel?
Unknown

As tensions continued to escalate between the United States and the Islamic Republic of Iran, experts told The Jerusalem Post that Hezbollah remains capable and willing to join an attack on Israel, but such a move would prove costly for the Lebanese terror group.
The experts spoke to The Post after the Institute for the Study of War (ISW) had assessed, on Friday, that Hezbollah could participate in the potential conflict should the terror group perceive that the US or Israel were aiming at toppling the Islamic regime.
Former deputy national security adviser Prof. Chuck Freilich (New York University), an adjunct professor at Tel Aviv University (TAU) and Columbia, affirmed to the Post that the Hezbollah terror group had been created by Iran as a backup for any significant potential attack against the regime.
Founded on the ideology of velayat-e faqih (Guardianship of the Islamic Jurist), the Lebanese terror group is loyal to Ali Khamenei, binding his position as the authority on the group’s future role.
Freilich said that the regime had been “certainly disturbed” by Hezbollah’s absence from the 12-Day War in June, and that the potential incoming conflict would be treated as “the test” for the proxy group.
“They [Hezbollah] would like to join; the Iranians are going to be pressing them to join,” he said.
“On the other hand, they have domestic Lebanese constraints which are very much against it. I think a lot of the Lebanese public, even part of the Shia population, has had enough of paying the price for – so to speak – Hezbollah’s wars, and they’re under international pressure, and of course they’re under Israeli pressure, and we’ve seen Israel upping the ante in the last few days, especially.”
On Friday, the IDF struck several terrorists in charge of Hezbollah’s missile array in three separate command centers in the Baalbek area in Lebanon. The military claimed the terrorists were operating to accelerate Hezbollah’s readiness and force build-up while planning fire attacks on the State of Israel and advancing the readiness of terror attacks.
Freilich stressed that the loss of Tehran’s financial and military support would “make it very, very hard for them [Hezbollah] to survive as a military organization for very long” and “may be the scenario that finally forces them to go the political route and become a political party, more of a political and socioeconomic force in Lebanon.”
Zoe Levornik, a nuclear policy and security researcher and analyst at the Alma Research and Education Center, told The Post that, despite nearly two years of war with Israel, the terror group is understood to still have an arsenal of around 25,000 rockets and missiles, mostly short- and medium-range, and at least a 1,000 suicide drones, as well as approximately 40,000-50,000 personnel on active duty, with another 30,000-50,000 reservists.
With the collapse of the Assad regime in Syria, the damage inflicted during the conflict with Israel, along with its weakened political position in Lebanon, Hezbollah’s ability to recover has been slow.
ISW assesses Hezbollah could join war to protect Tehran
A disarmament campaign by Lebanese authorities, though criticized for its lack of speed, has also led Hezbollah to relocate many of its forces to north of the Litani River, according to ISW [a non-partisan, non-profit, public policy research organization].
Freilich predicted that in the coming days, it should be anticipated that there will be IDF activity to degrade the terror group.
“If they do join, they can still cause us a fair amount of pain, but much, much less than they could have a year ago, a year and a half ago,” he said, explaining how the IDF has significantly reduced Hezbollah’s capabilities and may choose to continue to do so.
Despite Hezbollah’s weakened state, ISW published that the terror group could still join an incoming conflict, both out of its loyalty to the regime and out of fear of losing its largest sponsor. That would result in serious setbacks in its ability to rearm and achieve its regional goals. This analysis was mirrored by the experts who spoke to The Post.
ISW noted that if Hezbollah does join the conflict, prioritizing loyalty to the regime over its domestic limitations, there are multiple courses of action that it could take, ranging from the symbolic to a large-scale aerial assault.
Most likely, according to the ISW assessment, the terror organization would carry out a symbolic attack by firing into open areas of northern Israel. This would likely avoid the risk of a large Israeli response but allow Hezbollah to continue to justify its existence as part of the “axis of resistance.”
Hezbollah took such action in firing two missiles at the Shebaa Farms in December 2024, claiming their missiles were a “defensive warning strike” in answer to what they alleged Israeli ceasefire violations; no casualties resulted, and while Israel responded with some attacks, the conflict did not escalate.
Hezbollah could also choose to target the five Israeli outposts in Lebanese territory, framing the attacks to align with the group’s image of “resisting occupation.” However, such attack would likely incur a swift response from Israel, ISW noted, which in turn would fuel discontent within southern Lebanese civilian society, which is still recovering from the last war Hezbollah started.
The terror group could also fire at IDF positions within Israel with medium-range projectiles, as it did during its war with Israel following Hamas’s October 7, 2023, attacks.
However, ISW highlighted that this type of attack, likely leading to a significant response from Israel, would then create significant political repercussions for Hezbollah and lead to further support for the Lebanese government’s disarmament plan.
Finally, Hezbollah could attempt to target civilians across Israel in missile and drone attacks, using large salvoes as it did during the October 2024 attack on Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s home.
ISW stressed that such an approach would likely lead to an Israeli response that would deeply endanger Hezbollah and its Shia support base, triggering major aerial operations.
“It’s possible that they will try to attack one of the Israeli communities by the border; try to fire a few rockets or missiles on Israel’s North. All of those are possible,” Levornik confirmed. “We don’t know if they will do something symbolic and limited or if they’ll join in a more supportive role as they did after October 7.”
Out of the question now, Levornik said, would be the type of October 7-incursion Hezbollah had been planning in the last quarter of 2023.
“They don’t have the capability to do what they were planning before October 7 because of the attacks on the Radwan unit and their infrastructure, and the fact that Israel is in those five strategic locations [outposts in Lebanese territory] and has cleared the contact line on the border,” she clarified.
“They don’t have the capability to do something at the moment that is very extensive with many operatives invading Israel, but as far as a small operation, a few operatives, a kidnapping; something like that is still possible.”
The ISW assessment came only days before Saudi media outlet Al-Arabiya reported that Hezbollah is now being led by officers from Tehran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps.
Citing sources close to the terror group, the outlet claimed that IRGC officers already in Lebanon had joined Hezbollah’s senior ranks, along with new arrivals from the Islamic Republic, with plans to accelerate the rebuilding of Hezbollah’s military capabilities.
Levornik told the Post she had seen similar claims coming out of institutes in Beirut, adding that it was “very possible that Iran is taking a more active role at the moment.”
“We do know that they’re very active in the rehabilitation of Hezbollah’s capabilities. So it makes sense that they’re also involved in organization and in leadership. They are, of course, involved in the decision-making process,” she confirmed.
Levornik added that Iran has taken a “more active role in the decision-making” since Hassan Nasrallah was killed in September 2024. The death of Nasrallah, she said, also led to significantly less consensus within Hezbollah.
“He had more of a standing vis-à-vis Iran; he [Nasrallah] wasn’t just taking orders, he was someone that they consulted with,” Levornik explained. “The current leadership is a little bit weaker when it comes to Iran…”

Israel disqualifies own bobsleigh team from Winter Olympics for faking illness

Israel’s bobsleigh team was disqualified Saturday from the final day of competition at the Winter Olympics in Milan-Cortina, Italy, following a scandal involving one of the athletes falsely claiming illness in an attempt to allow a substitute to compete in his place, Israeli media reported Sunday.
According to reports, the team requested the substitution despite the fact that Olympic rules permit athlete replacements only in cases of injury or illness. To facilitate the switch, one athlete falsely declared himself unwell and obtained a medical certificate stating he was unfit to compete.
However, before the request was submitted to international officials, the athlete confessed to the delegation’s management that he had fabricated the illness and was fully capable of competing.
The Israel Olympic Committee condemned the athlete's actions and banned the Israeli team from competing further.
“The Israeli delegation received information that members of the Israeli bobsleigh team sought to replace one of the participants in an inappropriate manner, violating the standards expected of Olympic athletes and the core Olympic values," read a statement by the Israel Olympic Committee. "As a result, the decision was made not to allow the bobsleigh team to participate in tomorrow’s competition.”
The statement continued, “The decision to suspend the team was made with the agreement of the athletes themselves. The Israel Olympic Committee takes any deviation from the principles of fair play seriously and will not accept behavior that is unbecoming of Olympic standards. We strongly condemn such actions in every way.”
Decision to ban team made internally
The Israeli luge team had previously competed in two heats, finishing in last place. This marked Israel’s first-ever participation in the luge event at the Winter Olympics.
The decision to ban the team from further participation was made internally by the Israel Olympic Committee after the substitution attempt was found to violate Olympic regulations. The Israel Olympic Committee has confirmed that an investigation will take place once the team returns from the Olympics, ensuring that all protocols are followed in addressing the violation.
The disqualification follows a series of tense moments for the Israeli delegation at the Milan-Cortina games.
Last week, Swiss broadcaster RTS said it had pulled from its website the commentary on an Olympic bobsleigh run in which one reporter questioned at length the presence of an Israeli athlete in Milano Cortina because of his alleged support for Israel's actions in the Gaza war.
The commentary on Radio Television Suisse was aired throughout one of the runs of Israelis Adam Edelman and Chen Menachem in the two-man bobsleigh event that week.

Crisis-driver or Gaza stabilizer? Why Turkey believes it switched roles with Israel - analysis

In 2019 Turkey took delivery of an S-400 air defense system from Russia. This was the culmination of a deal dating from 2017. It also marked Ankara’s shift in strategy from being a NATO member to hedging its bets by working with Russia. A pipeline across the Black Sea to Russia, called TurkStream was completed in 2020.
It looked as if Ankara was shifting rapidly away from the West. Six years later Turkey is playing a role in the US-backed Board of Peace and Ankara is seeking to send personnel to Gaza. Turkey is friends again with Saudi Arabia and also meeting with Greek officials.
Ankara has shifted its policies from confrontation to dialogue. In Jerusalem some officials have said they view Turkey as a potential new threat, in a sense replacing Shi’ite Iran with a powerful Sunni power. Ankara recently condemned Israel's recognition of Somaliland, for instance. Turkey’s shift in policy should be understood against this backdrop.
The Turkish decisions between 2017 and 2020 were not just Russia-oriented. Ankara was also embroiled in a number of conflicts or simmering disputes. In 2018 Turkey had mobilized what it called the Syrian National Army, a number of small Syrian rebel groups, and asked them to invade the Kurdish area of Afrin in Syria.
It unleashed these groups as Turkey also invaded alongside them. The groups attacked Kurds and caused around 160,000 people to flee the area of Afrin in northwest Syria. The attack was devastating.
Why did Turkey invade Afrin? It was part of a campaign against the Syrian Democratic Forces, the mostly Kurdish group the US was backing in Syria. Turkey couldn’t confront the SDF directly and end up in a crisis with Washington, so it chose Afrin.
Afrin was defended by the Kurdish YPG, a group that also worked with the SDF. Afrin was one part of Turkey’s role in Syria. Ankara had also launched an operation back in 2016 aimed at stopping the SDF from moving past the city of Manbij near the Euphrates.
Turkey’s involvement in Syria developed over the years. By the time Ankara was acquiring S-400s, it was also setting its sights on dismantling the SDF completely.
The backdrop of this came amid Ankara’s discussions with the first Trump administration. Turkey’s president Recep Tayyip Erdogan pressured the US to approve an operation in an area called Serekaniya in northeastern Syria. This would push the SDF out of an area that the SDF had liberated from ISIS.
In 2019 Turkey launched the attack. With a NATO ally rolling into Syria the US felt it had to withdraw and the SDF was left alone to defend an area on the border. Sensing collapse, the SDF sent feelers to Damascus and the Assad regime.
Eventually a complex deal was worked out that saw Ankara take over an area of northern Syria, and saw Russia and the Syrian regime deploy to areas where the US had previously been patrolling with the SDF.
The crisis in 2019 almost led to US withdrawal from Syria. It’s worth recalling this today. The US is now actually withdrawing from Syria as the Syrian government takes over eastern Syria. However, back in 2018-2019 the first Trump administration weighed withdrawal.
If the US had withdrawn then, Syria would have been carved up into spheres of Iranian, Turkish and Russian influence. Instead, the US held on tenuously and the SDF remained.
This enabled the space for Hayat Tahrir al-Sham in Idlib, the last remaining independent rebel group, to train and prepare for the 2024 offensive against the Assad regime. Israel’s pounding of Hezbollah in 2024 enabled the offensive in late November 2024. Assad fell on December 8, 2024.
This has been a game changer for Turkey. It’s worth recalling that Turkey’s AKP party has been in power more than 20 years. Like Israel’s Prime Minister, Turkey’s Recep Tayyip Erdogan has become a mainstay of the region, a long serving leader who has dominated the region for 20 years.
When Erdogan and the AKP entered power their first goal was a domestic revolution in Turkey, pushing back against years of secular nationalist rule. They went to war with what they called the “deep state,” which mean going after what they assumed to be coup plotters in the army and also pursuing judicial reform to get rid of judges they viewed as hostile.
Having clipped the wings of the judiciary and weakened independent media in Turkey, cracking down on the 2013 Gezi park protests; the AKP then set about pushing a new foreign policy. Turkey went from a policy of “zero problems with neighbors” to an offensive doctrine of crisis.
Ankara’s shift to a crisis doctrine was accelerated by a 2016 coup attempt and also the breakdown in a ceasefire with the Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) in 2015.
The defeated coup attempt enabled the AKP to concentrate power. The PKK also launched an insurrection, apparently inspired by YPG successes against ISIS in 2015. The PKK badly miscalculated, leading to destruction in Kurdish areas as war spread. The Turkish state that emerged from the 2015-2016 crisis was emboldened.
By 2019 Turkey was also pursuing new policies in the Eastern Mediterranean. It reached out to Libya to sign a deal which essentially put Turkey astride Greek claims. This “blue homeland” concept envisions Ankara dominating the Eastern Mediterranean. It is no surprise that as Ankara was doing this, it provoked closer ties between Israel, Greece and Cyprus.
Turkey also confronted Israel over the US decision to move the Embassy to Jerusalem in 2018, and over the Abraham Accords in 2020. Although both these policies were actually due to Washington’s decisions and support; Ankara was angered and wanted to push back.
At the time Turkey was picking fights with everyone. It was almost clashing with Greece; and in Libya it was almost clashing with Egypt over influence. But quietly things were shifting behind the scenes. With the death of former Egyptian leader, and key Muslim Brotherhood leader member, Mohammed Morsi in 2019, Turkey could move on from its anger at Egypt regarding the 2013 overthrow of the Muslim Brotherhood.
The AKP has roots in the Brotherhood, but it also recognizes the realities of the region. Ankara’s war of words with Riyadh over the killing of Jamal Khashoggi in 2018 also faded with time.
The Biden administration’s failure to prevent the Ukraine war and failure to end the Gaza war led to Ankara shifting its policies. It sensed a weak US and saw that its time in the region was now or never. The victory of the Syrian revolution against Assad gave Ankara a chance to re-think Syria policy.
Now it could be a bit more forgiving with the SDF and PKK, agreeing to a deal with the PKK in Turkey which may see the PKK disarm and disband. Ankara also helped Damascus maneuver around the SDF and this may see it integrated into Damascus-backed security forces.
The war in Ukraine has made NATO rely on Turkey more. Turkey has been investing heavily in local defense industries for a decade and a half; a result in part of its alienation from Israel where it once had defense ties. As such, Turkey is now a rising military power.
NATO needs Turkey now. Ankara has also recognized this and is flirting slightly less with Russia. At the same time Ankara has reached out more to Saudi Arabia and Egypt. Riyadh is moving away from the UAE and as such it appears that Saudi and Turkey are no longer rivals for power in the Islamic world.
Turkey’s role in Gaza shifts Israel's regional concerns
For Israel, these shifting policies have led to concern in Jerusalem. Some see this as a one-way road moving from confronting Iran to confronting Turkey. Ankara has shifted its tone though. In the old days, Erdogan would slam Israel and compare it to Nazism.
Today, Turkey is more careful. It wants a role in Gaza. It has close ties to the Trump administration. Erdogan is trying to play elder statesman. Ankara views Israel as now lurching from crisis to crisis. In essence, Ankara thinks it has switched places with Israel in terms of being the crisis-driver.
Ankara now believes it is a stabilizing force. Israel is involved in conflicts in Gaza, Lebanon, the West Bank and potentially other places. Ankara feels that from the Horn of Africa to the Eastern Mediterranean and Syria and Iraq it has increased its influence greatly in the last years.

Iran has operationally tested a new naval air defense missile, known as “Sayyad 3-G,” during recent naval drills in the strategically sensitive Strait of Hormuz.
According to Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) Navy officials, the missile was launched for the first time during the “Smart Control of the Strait of Hormuz” exercise conducted in the region. The system represents the naval variant of Iran’s Sayyad family of air defense missiles and is designed to enhance the layered air defense umbrella of the country’s combat fleet.
The Sayyad 3-G is derived from the land-based Sayyad-3 air defense missile and has been adapted for maritime operations. It is intended to provide medium-range air defense coverage for warships and naval vessels.
The missile is launched from ships via a Vertical Launch System (VLS), enabling rapid response capability and 360-degree coverage against aerial threats.
Its operational range is reported to be approximately 150 kilometers, allowing naval vessels to establish a broader defensive perimeter at sea.
Designed to Counter Multiple Aerial Threats
The system is engineered to intercept a range of airborne targets, including:
Warplanes
Maritime patrol aircraft
High-altitude unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs)
The missile can operate within an integrated naval command-and-control network while utilizing onboard radar systems of the host vessel. It is also reported to retain independent target detection and tracking capability, enhancing operational flexibility in complex maritime environments.
Adapted for Maritime Conditions
The Sayyad missile family has previously been deployed in Iran’s ground-based air defense systems. The 3G naval variant incorporates technical modifications suited to maritime conditions, including operation from moving platforms in dynamic sea environments.
Deployment of the system on combat vessels — particularly ships of the Shahid (martyr) Soleimani-class warship— is expected to strengthen naval deterrence and expand air defense layers around Iranian maritime assets.
Strategic Significance of the Test
The missile test took place in the Strait of Hormuz, one of the world’s most critical energy transit corridors. Conducting the operational trial in this location underscores the strategic importance Iran assigns to maritime security and defense readiness in surrounding waters.
Iranian officials describe the Sayyad 3-G as another step in the development of a domestically produced, integrated air defense network — a system that has expanded in recent years to include both land-based and naval components.

Israel paves way for takeover of archaeology sites in West Bank

Israel 'paves the way' for takeover of thousands of Palestinian archaeological sites in West Bank
Israel’s recent decision to expropriate the archaeological site of Sebastia "for the public interest" has prompted warnings from Palestinian officials that thousands of heritage sites across the occupied West Bank are at risk.
On 17 February, the Israeli army issued the order targeting Sebastia, in what Palestinian officials describe as part of a broader shift to expand Israeli control over archaeological sites beyond Area C into Area B and potentially further.
Palestinian officials warn that around 7,000 archaeological, religious and tourist sites across the West Bank could face similar measures that would provide legal cover for settlement expansion and weaken Palestinian historical ties to the land.
Saleh Tawafsheh, undersecretary of the Palestinian Ministry of Tourism and Antiquities, told The New Arab's sister outlet Al-Araby Al-Jadeed: "This is the first time an Israeli government has dared to issue a public decision to take control of archaeological sites. The Israeli decision to expropriate the archaeological area in Sebastia is unprecedented and is a prelude to annexing the West Bank."
He said the current decision includes the confiscation of around 2,000 dunams (494 acres) and the creation of a park separating the archaeological site from the surrounding town, effectively isolating it.
Extending such measures into Area B, which falls under Palestinian civil administration but Israeli security control under the Oslo Accords, represents "a notable development in the mechanism of imposing control", he added.
According to Tawafsheh, about 60 percent of the West Bank’s 7,000 sites, roughly 3,800, are located in Area C, which is under full Israeli control, with around 1,800 in Area B and 1,300 in Area A, which is under Palestinian civil and security control. Sites in Areas C and B are considered most vulnerable to isolation or expropriation.
He said ministry teams face repeated obstruction in Areas B and C.
He cited an incident this week in the village of Jifna north of Ramallah, where ministry teams conducting excavation work were fired upon with live ammunition, sound bombs and tear gas by Israeli forces and expelled from the site, although the village is classified as Area B.
Asked what the Palestinian Authority could do, Tawafsheh said: "What can the Authority do in light of international complicity with the occupying state?"
He described efforts to save Palestinian heritage as facing "very great difficulties", adding that officials are documenting violations and trying to engage international institutions.
The expropriation order comes amid wider moves by Israel aimed at increasing its control of the West Bank.
In July 2024, the Knesset approved a draft law extending the authority of the Israel Antiquities Authority to archaeological sites across the occupied West Bank, without specifying particular areas. Earlier this month, a parliamentary committee advanced amendments to establish a "West Bank Heritage Authority" with an estimated annual budget of at least 30 million shekels (US$9.6 million).
Israel destroyed more than 316 archaeological sites in Gaza and the West Bank during the war on Gaza, according to previous statements by Palestinian Tourism and Antiquities Minister Hani Hayek, who described the destruction as war crimes aimed at erasing Palestinian history.
Dirgham al-Faris, director of the Tourism Ministry office in Nablus, told Al-Araby Al-Jadeed that "there are 59 archaeological and tourist sites in Nablus governorate threatened with the same fate as Sebastia in terms of annexation and seizure".
Mohammad Addarbeh, head of the Department of Archaeology and Heritage at Hebron University, said Israel has long used archaeology as a tool to serve political objectives by promoting narratives that "lack scientific basis in archaeology".
He argued that "the core of the conflict revolves around the land as a religious and civilisational heritage, which Israel seeks to instrumentalise politically through what it describes as archaeological evidence".
Addarbeh warned that control efforts have expanded from Hebron in the south to Sebastia in the north, extending beyond Areas C and B and reflecting what he described as a broader policy of settlement and expansion pursued under the pretext of protecting antiquities.

Private middlemen charge grieving families thousands to remove deceased loved ones

Private intermediaries and ambulance companies have been charging grieving families hundreds and even thousands of shekels to transport the deceased from their homes, despite Israeli law mandating that such removals within a local burial society’s jurisdiction be provided free of charge.
Following a wave of complaints, the national forum of burial societies and the National Insurance Institute announced new measures to regulate the process and prevent unauthorized fees.
Under Israeli law, transporting a deceased person within the jurisdiction of the local burial society is a basic service provided at no cost, and families are entitled to burial in their city of residence. The National Insurance Institute states that burial fees include transportation expenses. Volunteer organizations such as ZAKA also advise the public not to pay private parties for removal services covered by law.
Nevertheless, private intermediaries have been operating in recent months, presenting themselves as representatives of families or as “official services.” They contacted burial societies on families’ behalf and charged fees — in some cases around 2,500 shekels — for services that should have been free. According to the burial societies forum, more than five such incidents were reported over a single recent weekend, part of what officials described as a broader pattern exploiting families during moments of grief and confusion.
In response, the burial societies forum, in coordination with the Religious Services Ministry, said it will implement a uniform system to eliminate unauthorized charges. Beginning Monday at 4 p.m., all burial societies in the forum will accept removal requests only if they are submitted directly through a single national hotline.
Previously, third parties could obtain information from nursing homes or relatives, contact burial societies and act as intermediaries. Under the new system, burial societies will reject requests made by third parties. Only direct calls from family members to the official, free national hotline will be processed.
The Religious Services Ministry said it will conduct ongoing oversight of requests. Reports containing an address different from the deceased’s registered residence — a method officials say was used to bypass the system — will trigger a review.
Private ambulance companies continue to advertise removal services, with prices varying depending on distance and time of day. However, the burial societies forum stressed that when the removal takes place within the local jurisdiction, there is no legal basis for charging families privately.
“We will no longer allow unscrupulous actors to exploit grieving families at their most difficult hour,” the forum said in a statement. “The removal is free, and families are entitled to a dignified and transparent service.”
Authorities urged the public not to contact private ambulance services or commercial call centers in the event of a death. Families should call the official national hotline at *0120. Any demand for payment for a basic removal within the local jurisdiction is unlawful and should be reported, officials said.

Malaysia summons anti-corruption chief in stock ownership probe
Civil society groups and protesters are seeking an investigation into allegations surrounding abuse of power, unexplained wealth and regulatory extortion
Malaysia’s anti-corruption chief Azam Baki was summoned by a special committee set up to probe his stock ownership to explain the matter on Thursday, as authorities respond to calls for him to be investigated.
The committee is examining the compliance and regularity of Azam’s share ownership based on the initial report it received, Shamsul Azri Abu Bakar, chief secretary to the government, said in a statement on Sunday. It is still in the process of evaluating all evidence obtained and will call other relevant witnesses to complete the investigation, he said.
On February 10, it was reported that Azam, chief commissioner of the Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission, owned 17.7 million shares of Velocity Capital Partner Bhd, according to an annual filing by the financial services firm to the Companies Commission of Malaysia. That stake would have been worth almost 800,000 ringgit (US$205,000) at the time of the report.
A 2024 Malaysian government circular, which provides guidance on 1993 regulations stipulating the conduct of public officials, says a public servant may purchase shares in a company incorporated in Malaysia on the condition that they do not exceed 5 per cent of its paid-up capital or 100,000 ringgit in value, whichever is lower. They also must declare assets at least once every five years and at the time of purchase and sale of holdings.
Another news investigation also alleged collusion between MACC officers and businessmen who were attempting company takeovers. The reports triggered a backlash in Malaysia, drawing protesters to the capital and fuelling a broader debate over alleged abuse of power.
The nation’s leading civil society groups have urged the formation of a Royal Commission of Inquiry to investigate allegations surrounding abuse of power, unexplained wealth and regulatory extortion by the anti-corruption agency and its chief.

Supreme Court wades into US-Cuba business disputes, with billions at stake

Supreme Court wades into US-Cuba business disputes, with billions at stake
Sign up now: Get ST's newsletters delivered to your inbox
Feb 22 - The U.S. Supreme Court is set to explore legal questions arising from the fraught history of U.S.-Cuban relations when it considers the scope of a 1996 law that lets U.S. nationals seek compensation for property confiscated by the communist-led Cuban government.
The justices hear arguments on Monday in two cases centered on the federal law called the Helms-Burton Act, one involving U.S. oil major ExxonMobil and the other involving the cruise lines Carnival, Royal Caribbean, Norwegian Cruise Line and MSC Cruises.
One of the law's provisions, called Title III, allows for lawsuits in U.S. courts against entities that "traffic" in property confiscated by the Cuban government after the revolution that brought Fidel Castro to power in 1959.
While the two cases focus on distinct legal issues, both raise the question of just how powerful a remedy Congress intended Title III to be. In both cases, the Supreme Court has the opportunity to eliminate barriers that claimants face in bringing Helms-Burton Act lawsuits.
The justices have never before interpreted Title III, which Congress authorized the U.S. president to suspend if deemed "necessary to the national interests of the United States."
Title III was long dormant due to presidential decisions to suspend it. But President Donald Trump, who has taken a hard line toward Cuba, lifted that suspension during his first term in office, unleashing a wave of about 40 lawsuits filed in 2019 and 2020 that have slowly made their way through the courts.
Trump's administration has declared Cuba "an unusual and extraordinary threat" to U.S. national security, cutting off the flow of Venezuelan oil to the Caribbean island nation and threatening to slap tariffs on any country supplying it with fuel.
BILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN CLAIMS
Following the revolution, Cuba's new communist government nationalized U.S. property that now is worth billions of dollars, including factories, sugar mills, oil refineries and power plants.
The Helms-Burton Act formalized the U.S. trade embargo against Cuba that had been in effect by presidential order since President John Kennedy's administration in the 1960s.
Title III created a legal remedy for U.S. nationals whose property was confiscated. Such plaintiffs can seek enhanced damages in federal courts from entities that knowingly use the property, including both Cuban state-owned entities and multinational companies.
Presidents Bill Clinton, George W. Bush and Barack Obama all suspended Title III, seeking to avoid diplomatic conflicts with allies like Canada and Spain whose companies have invested in Cuba, before Trump lifted the suspension in 2019. The State Department said at the time that Trump's move would "ratchet up pressure on the Cuban government" and "penalize those who benefit from the rightful property of Americans."
In one of the Supreme Court cases, Exxon is seeking more than $1 billion in compensation from CIMEX, a Cuban state-owned firm, for oil and gas assets seized in 1960. In the other case, a small company that built docks in Havana's port prior to the revolution is seeking compensation from the four cruise lines, whose ships have used the terminal.
Exxon, which filed its suit in Washington in 2019, has asked the justices to reverse a lower court's 2024 decision finding that Cuban state-owned enterprises facing Helms-Burton Act claims can raise the defense of foreign sovereign immunity. That legal doctrine generally shields foreign governments and their agents from being sued in U.S. courts.
The lower court's decision "imposes yet another in a long line of barriers to recovery for victims of the Castro government's illegal confiscations," Exxon's lawyers said in a 2024 court filing.
CIMEX has argued in court filings that the 2024 decision should be upheld because it "both respects and safeguards congressional judgment in this sensitive area."
Legal experts said the 2024 decision and other rulings interpreting Helms-Burton have made it costly and time-consuming for U.S. businesses to seek compensation from Cuban entities.
"The amount of time and resources that has been required is overwhelming for a lot of claimants," said Washington lawyer Jared Butcher, who represents clients in commercial litigation.
CRUISE SHIP DISPUTE
The other case being argued on Monday does not implicate sovereign immunity because the cruise company defendants are private companies, rather than state-owned entities. At issue in that case is whether a Helms-Burton Act claimant must establish that it would have a present-day property interest in the assets at issue if they had not been nationalized.
Havana Docks Corporation, a U.S. firm that built docks in Havana's port prior to the revolution, sued the cruise lines in federal court in Florida in 2019. Castro revoked the company's legal right to the docks shortly after coming to power.
The four cruise operators used the docks from 2016 to 2019, after Obama eased travel restrictions on Cuba. In a joint court filing, the companies said it defies common sense that they "should pay hundreds of millions of dollars for following the executive branch's lead in reopening travel to Cuba."
A federal judge found the cruise companies liable for a combined $440 million, saying they had trafficked in confiscated property. An appeals court threw out those judgments last year, highlighting the difficulties Helms-Burton Act claimants face.
"Plaintiffs are having a hard time recovering under the Helms-Burton Act for a wide variety of reasons, and it's probably more difficult to recover than Congress had anticipated when it passed the act in 1996," said Vanderbilt Law School professor Ingrid Brunk. "But that's not an argument that means every plaintiff should win." REUTERS

Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor’s taxpayer funded Met bodyguards told to provide security for Epstein party, emails reveal
Two bodyguards for Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor were given instructions about a lavish dinner party during a 2010 visit to Epstein’s mansion, emails suggest
- Bookmark
Taxpayer-funded Metropolitan Police bodyguards assigned to Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor were instructed to provide door security for a lavish celebrity dinner party at Jeffrey Epstein’s New York home, emails suggest.
Two royal protection officers appear to have been told to act as doormen at the paedophile financier’s seven-floor Manhattan mansion in 2010, after he had been convicted of a child sex offence.
The officers, given the job of protecting the prince, were staying at the multimillion-pound townhouse on 71st Street during the royal’s trip to visit his friend, according to emails unearthed in the latest tranche of the Epstein files released by the US Department of Justice.
The emails, first reported in The Sunday Times, suggest those officers were also asked to provide security for a dinner party attended by the royal on 2 December. Celebrities named on the guestlist in the emails include Hollywood director Woody Allen, his wife Soon Yi Previn, as well as two US news anchors, Katie Couric and George Stephanopoulos, the comedian Chelsea Handler, and Charlie Rose, a talk show host.
In an email sent the night before the party, a member of staff wrote to Epstein: “The Duke’s 2 protection officers along with state security will all be here for tomorrow’s dinner party [sic]... Rich has given them instructions on the door.”
The reference to “state security” suggests that US diplomatic protection officers also attended. “Rich” is understood to be member of Epstein’s team.
Mr Mountbatten-Windsor told BBC Newsnight in 2019 that he had travelled to New York in 2010 solely to “cut ties” with Epstein. He was photographed with the financier in Central Park during the visit.
The findings come after the Met police urged the prince’s former close protection officers to “consider carefully whether anything they saw or heard” is relevant to their investigation into Epstein and his associates.
The force said it is contacting former and serving close protection officers who worked closely with Mr Mountbatten-Windsor amid growing questions over what they witnessed.
Dai Davies, the former head of the Royal Protection Command from 1994 to 1998, said on Friday it “beggars belief” that police and other officials working closely the royal never saw any “untoward” behaviour. He raised questions over a “culture of silence” around the former Duke of York’s conduct.
“Don’t forget, this is going back many years now, 20 years plus, in some instances, so many of them will have retired,” he told Channel 4.
“So, clearly they will have to decide with their conscience and their moral compass, what they did or didn't see.”
Mr Mountbatten-Windsor was last week arrested and released under investigation by a different police force on suspicion of misconduct in public office. The royal has consistently denied any wrongdoing.
Thames Valley Police confirmed the arrest on Thursday, the former prince’s 66th birthday, following allegations uncovered in the Epstein files, that Mr Mountbatten Windsorhad shared sensitive information with Epstein while serving as the UK’s trade envoy.
He was detained for 11 hours while being questioned, before he was pictured cowering in the back of a Range Rover as he was driven away from a police station in Aylesham, Norfolk.
Police also raided two addresses, with unmarked police cars and plainclothed police officers seen outside Wood Farm, where Mr Mountbatten-Windsor now lives on the King’s Sandringham Estate in Norfolk, on the morning of his arrest.
Searches are also entering their fourth day at his former home, the sprawling 30-room Royal Lodge in Windsor Great Park, Berkshire, that he shared with his ex-wife Sarah Ferguson until recently.
The government is understood to be considering bringing in a law to remove the disgraced royal, currently eighth in line to the throne, from the line of succession after police investigation concludes.
A group of MPs are also considering launching a parliamentary probe into the role of UK trade envoys following the allegations.
Mr Mountbatten-Windsor was stripped of his royal titles amid the ongoing scandal into friendship with Epstein.
In 2022, he paid a reported £12m to settle a civil sexual assault lawsuit brought by Virgina Giuffre, who said she was trafficked by Epstein and made to sleep with the royal on three occasions. He has consistently denied any wrongdoing.
In a statement, the Met said it was working with US officials to review whether Epstein may have trafficked victims on his private jet through London Stansted airport.
The force added: “Separately, the Met is identifying and contacting former and serving officers who may have worked closely, in a protection capacity, with Andrew Mountbatten‑Windsor.
“They have been asked to consider carefully whether anything they saw or heard during that period of service may be relevant to our ongoing reviews and to share any information that could assist us.”

Energy Charter modernisation splits Swiss politicians
The Swiss government's proposal to modernise the International Energy Charter Treaty has met with a mixed reception in Switzerland. The withdrawal of the EU and several key countries from the agreement has heightened tensions.
+Get the most important news from Switzerland in your inbox
In November 2024, the government announced its intention to modernise the international Energy Charter Treaty, which came into force in 1998. Binding under international law, the Energy Charter Treaty (ECT) was designed to protect investment in gas, oil and coal projects. It now needs to be adapted to meet environmental and sustainability challenges.
In the summer of 2024, the EU decided to withdraw from the treaty. Several countries, including Germany and France, have followed suit, while others plan to remain in the agreement.
While the right-wing Swiss People’s Party wants to maintain the status quo, the left-wing Social Democratic Party and the Green Party and environmental organisations are in favour of withdrawal. The cantons are divided.

Witkoff says Trump ‘curious’ why Iran hasn’t ‘capitulated’ under US pressure
Trump’s envoy says US president has ‘plenty of alternatives’ to a deal; Iranian official says sides aren’t on same page about sanctions relief, but talks could lead to interim agreement
US envoy Steve Witkoff said Saturday that US President Donald Trump is questioning why Iran has not “capitulated” in the face of Washington’s military build-up aimed at pressuring Tehran into a nuclear deal.
The United States and Iran last week resumed Oman-mediated talks in Geneva aimed at potentially reaching an agreement, after Washington dispatched two aircraft carriers, many jets and a large amount of weaponry to the region to back up its warnings.
In a Fox News interview with Trump’s daughter-in-law Lara, Witkoff said the president was “curious” about Tehran’s position after he had warned it of severe consequences in the event it failed to strike a deal.
“I don’t want to use the word ‘frustrated,’ because he understands he has plenty of alternatives, but he’s curious as to why they haven’t… I don’t want to use the word ‘capitulated,’ but why they haven’t capitulated,” he said.
“Why, under this pressure, with the amount of seapower and naval power over there, why haven’t they come to us and said, ‘We profess we don’t want a weapon, so here’s what we’re prepared to do’? And yet it’s sort of hard to get them to that place,” Witkoff continued.
Witkoff suggested that Washington expects Iran to formally state that it does not seek a nuclear weapon and outline concrete steps to prove it.
Witkoff on Iran: The president is curious as to why — I don’t want to use the word capitulated but why they haven't capitulated. Why under this pressure with the amount of naval power over there, why they haven't come to us and said we profess we don't want a weapon… pic.twitter.com/gdv9CXjwBW

The US envoy also confirmed in the interview that he had met with Reza Pahlavi, the exiled son of Iran’s last shah and a critic of the current authorities, who has not returned to the country since before the 1979 Islamic Revolution that ousted the monarchy.
“I met him at the direction of the president,” Witkoff said, without providing further details.
“I think he’s strong for his country, cares about his country. But this is going to be about President Trump’s policies.”
US-based Pahlavi last week told a crowd in Munich that he was ready to lead the country to a “secular democratic future” after Trump said regime change would be best for the country.
Witkoff’s remarks come as two rounds of US-Iran talks have stalled over major sticking points, including uranium enrichment levels, Iran’s missile program and the scope of sanctions relief.
After talks in Geneva on Tuesday, Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi said the sides had agreed on “guiding principles,” though the White House said significant gaps remained.
A senior unnamed Iranian official told Reuters on Sunday that Iran and the US have differing views on the scope and mechanism for lifting sanctions on Tehran, in exchange for curbs on its nuclear program.
The official added that renewed talks are scheduled for early March and posited that they could lead to an interim deal.
Trump on Thursday gave a 10- to 15-day timeline for an agreement.
Sanctions have battered Iran’s economy, contributing to a crisis that sparked protests in December that spiraled into calls for the fall of the regime.
Iran, flouting warnings by Trump, cracked down on the demonstrations with mass killings. Regime forces are confirmed to have taken the lives of some 7,000 protesters, but estimates of the total reach into the tens of thousands. Hundreds of regime forces were also believed killed amid the unrest.
Graham urges Trump to create ‘historic change’
Meanwhile, US Sen. Lindsey Graham is urging Trump to press ahead with military action against Iran, warning against the president’s advisers counseling restraint, the South Carolina Republican told Axios on Saturday.
“I understand concerns about major military operations in the Middle East, given past entanglements. However, the voices who counsel against getting entangled seem to ignore the consequences of letting evil go unchecked,” Graham told the news outlet.
Graham, who recently visited the Middle East and met with leaders in Israel, the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia, said he believes there is an opportunity “to bring about historic change” in Iran.
However, he added, “it’s increasingly clear to me that voices opposing entanglement and the risk associated with decisive action are getting louder. Time will tell as to how this plays out.”
“I have a lot of respect for President Trump. He is his own man,” Graham said. “And as with all presidents, he will be held responsible for his decisions on such weighty matters. As to me, history will be very clear as to where I stood, for better or worse.”
The remarks came as two US aircraft carriers and hundreds of warplanes are positioned in the region, and Trump has been presented with military options that include targeting Iran’s Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei and his son Mojtaba, according to Axios.
At the same time, senior US officials say the president has not yet made a final decision.
Graham indicated that some of Trump’s advisers are urging him to hold off on strikes and continue leveraging the military buildup to extract concessions from Tehran.
A senior official previously told Axios the US would consider an Iranian proposal allowing limited “token” uranium enrichment, provided it blocks any path to a nuclear bomb.
On Friday, Araghchi said that the US has not requested zero enrichment from Tehran, and that instead talks were on how its nuclear program — including enrichment — can be carried out peacefully.
Iran, which frequently threatens to destroy Israel and urges “death to America,” has consistently denied seeking to acquire nuclear weapons. However, it has enriched uranium to levels that have no peaceful application, obstructed international inspectors from checking its nuclear facilities, and expanded its ballistic missile capabilities.

Somaliland looking to lure US with minerals, military base offers

Separatist Somaliland, in an attempt to gain international legitimacy, is looking to lure the U.S. by granting it access to mineral resources and military bases.
Israel became the only country in the world to recognize Somaliland's independence in December – something the territory has been seeking since declaring its autonomy from Somalia in 1991.
The government in Mogadishu still considers and international organizations like the U.N., see Somaliland as an integral part of Somalia.
"We are willing to give exclusive (access to our minerals) to the United States. Also, we are open to offer military bases to the United States," Khadar Hussein Abdi, minister of the presidency, told AFP in an interview Saturday.
"We believe that we will agree on something with the United States."
Separatist Somaliland President Abdirahman Mohamed Abdullahi already suggested in recent weeks granting Israel privileged access to its mineral resources.
And Khadar Hussein Abdi said he could not rule out the possibility of also allowing Israel to set up a military presence.
Somaliland lies across the Gulf of Aden from Yemen, where Houthi rebels have targeted Israeli assets to show solidarity with Palestinians.
Somaliland officials have said their soil is rich in lithium, coltan and other sought-after resources, though independent studies are lacking.
Shortly after Israel's recognition at the end of December, social media was flooded with photos of men and women displaying the Israeli flag – one of them even using it as a hijab.
Somali President Hassan Sheikh Mohamud, on the other hand, denounced it as "the greatest violation of Somalia's sovereignty" and a "threat to the security and stability of the world and the region."
The African Union and most Arab countries threw their support behind Somalia and condemned the move.
The U.S., however, defended what it said was Israel's right to recognize Somaliland, although President Donald Trump said he was unlikely to follow suit, despite pressure from some within his Republican party.
Khadar Hussein Abdi reached out specifically to Türkiye, another country that objected to Israel's move, telling AFP that Turkish officials "must talk to us, not to Mogadishu" as Somalia had no functioning state.
"It is fragmented factions who sit in Mogadishu. They don't agree on anything," he said.
"So focusing on that does not help the security of the region."

ALBAWABA - As tension between Washington and Tehran increases, Senior Adviser Ali Larijani was permitted to lead the country and have effective control of Iran in case a war erupts.
A report released by The New York Times revealed that Larijani was entrusted by Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei with the day-to-day management of the country, along with President Masoud Pezeshkian, according to a report in The New York Times.
The American newspaper made the announcement about Ali Larijani's new powers in the Iranian government after talks with six senior Iranian officials, including one affiliated with Khamenei's office; three members of the Iranian army; two former Iranian diplomats; and reports in Iranian media.

According to sources, Khamenei instructed the senior advisor and several of his close allies in the political and military establishment to be prepared to counter possible US and Israeli bombing on Tehran and foil plans to assassinate its senior leadership, including the country's supreme leader.
U.S. President Donald Trump gave Tehran 10 days to accept the U.S. proposal to end their missile program and uranium enrichment program, in addition to ending Iran's support for groups in the Middle East, like Hamas, Hezbollah, and the Houthis.
Who is Ali Larijani?
It is worth noting that Ali Larijani is one of the Islamic Republic's most senior national security figures. He served earlier as Speaker of the Parliament from 2008 to 2020 and Secretary of the Supreme National Security Council from 2005 to 2007.
The 67-year-old politician was also a commander in the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC).

Casualties reported as Pakistan hits 'militant targets' in Afghanistan

Islamabad carried out pre-dawn strikes Sunday along the border with Afghanistan, targeting what it described as hideouts of Pakistani militants blamed for recent attacks, while the Afghan Red Crescent Society said the strikes killed more than a dozen people.
Pakistan didn't specify the locations targeted, but the Afghan Defense Ministry claimed in a statement that "various civilian areas" in the provinces of Nangarhar and Paktika in eastern Afghanistan were hit, including a religious madrassa and multiple civilian homes.
The statement called the strikes a violation of Afghanistan’s airspace and sovereignty.
Afghan government spokesperson Zabihullah Mujahid earlier on X said the attacks "killed and wounded dozens, including women and children."
Mawlawi Fazl Rahman Fayyaz, the provincial director of the Afghan Red Crescent Society in eastern Nangarhar province, said 18 people were killed and several others wounded.
Pakistan's Information Minister Attaullah Tarar wrote on X that the military conducted "intelligence-based, selective operations” against seven camps belonging to the Pakistani Taliban, also known as Tehrik-e-Taliban Pakistan, and its affiliates. He said an affiliate of the Daesh terrorist group was also targeted.
Tarar said Pakistan "has always strived to maintain peace and stability in the region," but added that the safety and security of Pakistani citizens remained a top priority.
Pakistan has seen a surge in militant violence in recent years, much of it blamed on the TTP and outlawed Baloch separatist groups.
The TTP is separate from but closely allied with Afghanistan’s Taliban. Islamabad accuses the TTP of operating from inside Afghanistan, a charge both the group and Kabul deny.
Hours before the Pakistani strikes, a suicide bomber targeted a security convoy in the border district of Bannu in Pakistan’s northwest, killing two soldiers, including a lieutenant colonel.
Pakistan’s military warned after the attack that it would not "exercise any restraint” and that operations against those responsible would press on.
Another suicide bomber, backed by gunmen, rammed an explosives-laden vehicle last week into the wall of a security post in Bajaur district in northwestern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, which borders Afghanistan, killing 11 soldiers and a child. Pakistani authorities later said the attacker was an Afghan national.
Tarar said Pakistan had "conclusive evidence" that the recent attacks, including a suicide bombing that targeted a Shiite mosque in Islamabad and killed 31 worshippers earlier this month, were carried out by terrorists acting on the "behest of their Afghanistan-based leadership and handlers."
He said Pakistan had repeatedly urged Afghanistan’s Taliban rulers to take verifiable steps to prevent militant groups from using Afghan territory to launch attacks in Pakistan, but alleged that no substantive action had been taken.
Tarar also asked the international community to press Afghanistan’s Taliban authorities to uphold their commitments under the Doha agreement not to allow their soil to be used against other countries.
The Qatari-mediated cease-fire between the two countries came about after deadly border clashes in October, killing dozens of soldiers, civilians and suspected militants.
The violence followed explosions in Kabul that Afghan officials blamed on Pakistan. Islamabad, at the time, conducted strikes deep inside Afghanistan to target terrorist hideouts.
The truce between Islamabad and Kabul has largely held, but several rounds of talks in Istanbul in November failed to produce a formal agreement and relations remain strained.

The most dangerous migrant routes in the world where deaths have surged

The most dangerous migrant routes in the world where deaths have surged
European countries including the UK are pushing through tougher measures to tackle immigration, but campaigners warn this just moves the problem elsewhere, Alex Croft reports
- Bookmark
- CommentsGo to comments
Three of the world’s most dangerous migration routes have seen a surge in deaths, figures show, as campaigners warn tough immigration policies are pushing desperate people towards riskier journeys.
The UN’s Missing Migrants Project (MMP) has recorded 81,540 deaths worldwide since 2014, hitting a peak in 2024 when 9,197 refugees and asylum seekers died trying to reach another country for a better life.
Despite a small decline in fatalities in 2025, the first month of 2026 was the deadliest January since records began, with 713 lives lost.
The deadliest single path is the Central Mediterranean route from North Africa to Southern Europe, with at least 26,416 people killed over the last decade. At least 501 have died trying to make the journey in the first weeks of 2026 already.
Two other routes have seen a particular surge in recent years. Deaths of migrants travelling overland from Afghanistan to Iran have risen by 1,900 per cent between 2019 and 2025 (65 to 1,323), with a particular increase since the Taliban retook control in 2021.
Lives lost between western Africa and Spain’s Canary Islands rose by 480 per cent during the same period (202 to 1,172).
[“These routes] are some of the most dangerous in the world, and certainly the ones where we’ve seen the greatest increases over time,” a spokesperson for the International Organisation for Migration (IOM), which runs the MMP, told The Independent.
The organisation believes that tougher policies merely move the problem elsewhere.
“We’re seeing that, because the counter-smuggling enforcement on a lot of the West and North African departure countries is getting stricter, people are leaving from as far south as the Gambia, an overseas journey of weeks, which is crazy when it’s often a fishing boat,” the spokesperson added.
Drowning during sea crossings is by far the leading cause of death (46,686), followed by transport accidents (7,188), lack of shelter, food or water (5,967), violent attacks (5,891) and illness (3,418).
European governments which have introduced strict policies to deter migrants claim this is the key to tackling the issue.
Downing Street insists its stringent set of asylum measures announced in November, will “dismantle the criminal networks profiting from human misery” while Italy’s prime minister Giorgia Meloni has said that “crushing the traffickers’ business” is the best method for reducing deaths.
However, while the Central Mediterranean route saw a steady fall in deaths in 2024 and 2025, campaigners warn that tougher migration policies are driving desperate migrants towards more remote routes, into the hands of criminal smugglers in regions with little humanitarian presence and where deaths are less well documented.
“The more you restrict border crossings, the more people use more remote routes,” she said. “If you’re already breaking the law, you’re more likely to engage with criminal actors. This really is putting people’s lives at risk.”
A spike in deaths in 2026 has seen 567 migrants killed across all three Mediterranean routes, including the eastern route from Turkey to Greece and the western route from North Africa to Spain.
The second closest year was 2015, when there were 427 deaths. IOM data shows that there were around 3,500 arrivals by sea in Italy in 2015, compared to less than 1,500 in January 2026, which suggests the rate of deaths per crossing has increased.
On 6 February, 53 people died when a migrant boat capsized near the Libyan coast. Weeks earlier, Italian authorities estimated that 380 people may have drowned in a single week while trying to make the crossing as Cyclone Harry was battering southern Italy and Malta.
Amnesty UK’s refugee and migrants’ rights programme director, Steve Valdez-Symonds, told The Independent that migration crackdowns have only increased the dependence of people on smugglers.
“Unworkable” deterrence policies will only cause more harm, he added, with campaigners arguing they do not stop people trying.
Greece is a case in point, says Lora Pappa, president of Greek NGO Metadrasi. Last July, Athens temporarily banned asylum access for arrivals from North Africa.
But boat arrivals, which averaged 3,182 during the first six months of 2025, jumped to an average of 4,058 during the ban.
“They stopped giving asylum... for people who are coming from Libya to Crete for three months. Did these people stop coming? No. They will take any risk,” Ms Pappa said. “I don’t think we can stop this kind of movement of people without being inhuman."
In the UK, the government is introducing new deterrent measures that include 20-year waits for indefinite leave to remain, restrictions on benefits and family members coming to join people already here.
Despite this, more than 41,470 people crossed the channel in 2025, the second highest since data collection began in 2018.
Labour party backbenchers have accused the government of “shamefully ripping up the rights and protections of people who have endured unimaginable trauma” with its tougher stance.
Veteran MP Diane Abbott, who previously criticised the government for not doing enough to tackle the “anti-migrant drift” in global debate on migration, told The Independent a different approach is needed.
In response to the death figures, she argued the high number is “a consequence of dehumanising migrants, so nobody really cares whether they drown”.
“Governments need to make it easier for migrants to get here,” she argued. “People are desperate and they are going to risk their lives.”
If anything, the MMP believes its figures on migrant deaths are a significant underestimate, warning that huge cuts to aid budgets that have limited the group’s presence in hard-to-reach areas could make accurate reporting even more of a challenge.
“Documenting irregular migration is really hard,” the MMP spokesperson said. “Bodies in remote areas may take days, weeks, months or never be found at all.
“There are a lot of what we call ‘invisible shipwrecks’, where we have no trace of what happened. We’ve had cases where whole boats of mummified remains are washing up in Brazil across the Atlantic.”
Ruvendrini Menikdiwela, the UNHCR’s assistant high commissioner for protection, told The Independent the figures were a “huge and growing concern”.
“We know that refugees and migrants continue to resort to dangerous journeys, often moving together,” she said.
“We urge states and partners to provide prompt search and rescue, to uphold their asylum commitments, to provide opportunities for refugees to rebuild their life in new countries, and facilitate the prompt return for those not in need of international protection.
“But we must also help people find safety and life-saving assistance closer to home, where – contrary to the perceptions of many – most refugees stay.”

Giant tortoises take first steps on Galápagos island after nearly 200 years
More than 150 giant tortoises have been reintroduced to Floreana Island in Ecuador’s famed Galápagos archipelago, where they disappeared more than a century ago.
It marks a major step in a reintroduction program aimed at restoring a lineage that disappeared locally in the 19th century.
According to the environment ministry, genetic research enabled the breeding programme and will allow a phased return of tortoises based on technical criteria.
The release is also intended to lay the groundwork for reintroducing up to 12 endemic species considered locally extinct on the island.

Russia, Ukraine accuse each other of overnight attacks killing 2, injuring 9
Russian Defense Ministry claims 86 Ukrainian drones shot down by air defenses
- Ukraine’s Air Force claims 274 out of 297 drones, 33 out of 46 missiles, launched by Russia, downed by air defenses
ISTANBUL
Russia and Ukraine on Sunday accused each other of overnight airstrikes that have killed two and injured nine others.
The Russian Defense Ministry claimed in a statement that its air defenses shot down 86 Ukrainian drones, of which 29 were downed over the country’s border region of Belgorod.
“As a result of further targeted strikes by the Ukrainian Armed Forces, one civilian was killed and another was injured,” Belgorod Governor Vyacheslav Gladkov said in a statement on Telegram.
Officials from other regions, mentioned by the Defense Ministry, including the Saratov, Voronezh, and Smolensk areas, reported no casualties or damage to local infrastructure, based on preliminary information.
Meanwhile, the Ukrainian Air Force claimed on Telegram that its air defenses shot down 274 out of 297 drones, as well as 33 out of 46 missiles, launched by Russia overnight.
Ukraine’s State Emergency Service reported that one person was killed and five others were injured in the village of Putrivka in the Kyiv region, noting that infrastructure facilities, and private residential and commercial buildings in the region were also damaged.
The statement added that energy infrastructure facilities in the southwestern Odesa region were also hit during the overnight attacks and sustained “significant” damage.
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said through US social media company X that a total of eight people were injured in the country due to the attacks, which also affected the Dnipropetrovsk, Kirovohrad, Mykolaiv, Poltava, and Sumy regions, stating that while the main target of the strikes was the energy sector, ordinary residential buildings and railway infrastructure were also damaged.
“This week alone, Russia launched more than 1,300 attack drones against Ukraine, over 1,400 guided aerial bombs, and 96 missiles of various types, including dozens of ballistic ones. That is why we must bolster our air defense. We need systems that effectively counter ballistic threats,” he added.
Commenting on the attacks, the Russian Defense Ministry said in a later statement that it launched attacks against military-industrial complex and energy infrastructure facilities used by the Ukrainian army.
Ukraine, meanwhile, has yet to comment on Moscow's claims.

Only several buildings in Kupiansk remain under Russian control – Ukrainian military
Viktor Trehubov, spokesperson for the Joint Forces Task Force, announced this on television, Ukrinform reports.
"If we talk about the percentage of territory still under Russian control, it's not even 3%. It's literally a few buildings where Russian troops stay. [...] They are simply trying to survive in these buildings. That's all they are capable of right now. And since there are only a few dozen of them, this isn't a combat-ready force. These are people trapped who are trying to survive," Trehubov said.
He added that to the north and east of Kupiansk, including across the Oskil River, Russian forces continue attempts to advance, but without significant success.
Additionally, he noted that most of Vovchansk is currently under Russian control, though Ukrainian forces maintain a presence in the south.

Palestinians granted 66 building permits in West Bank over 11 years, vs 22,000 for illegal Israeli settlers: Report

Palestinians granted 66 building permits in West Bank over 11 years, vs 22,000 for illegal Israeli settlers: Report
At least 2,461 Palestinian buildings demolished over past two years due to lack of Israeli building permits, Haaretz says
JERUSALEM
Israeli authorities granted only 66 building permits to Palestinians in the occupied West Bank over an 11-year period, while illegal settlers were given 22,000 permits, an Israeli newspaper reported Sunday.
According to Haaretz daily, only 66 building permits were issued to Palestinians between 2009 and 2020, while 22,000 permits were granted to illegal Israeli settlers during the same period.
“As most of the West Bank is off-limits to Palestinian development, residents are forced to build without permits,” the paper commented.
It cited widespread demolitions carried out by the Israeli authorities since January in the Taawun neighborhood, south of Nablus in the northern West Bank.
The neighborhood is located in Area C and “did not receive building permits from the Israeli authorities, despite being far from any settlement or access road,” said the daily.
Al-Taawun, it added, is “just one example of the accelerating pace of demolitions across the West Bank.”
In January alone, the Israeli army demolished a total of 24 Palestinian buildings in Area C due to the lack of building permits.
Rising demolitions
Haaretz, citing the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA), said at least 2,461 Palestinian buildings were demolished over the past two years due to the lack of building permits, up from 4,984 structures over the previous nine years.
As a result, around 3,500 people lost their homes during that two-year period, it added.
OCHA did not specify whether the demolitions took place exclusively in Area C or across the West Bank as a whole.
According to Haaretz, the demolition campaign over the past two years has coincided with the displacement of around 80 Palestinian communities due to the rapid expansion of illegal settler farms and outposts.
The 1995 Oslo II Accord divided the West Bank into three administrative areas: Area A under full Palestinian control; Area B under Palestinian civil administration and Israeli security control; and Area C under full Israeli civil and security control, which covers about 61 percent of the West Bank.
Palestinians say Israel rarely grants building permits in Area C, effectively preventing construction or land development.
Palestinians view the measures as a prelude to the formal annexation of the West Bank and a step toward the de facto annexation of large parts of the territory, moves they say would undermine the two-state solution framework endorsed by the UN.
In a landmark opinion in July 2024, the International Court of Justice declared Israel’s occupation of Palestinian territory illegal and called for the evacuation of all settlements in the West Bank and East Jerusalem.

US envoy's remarks on Israel and Middle East land draw condemnation in region
Sign up now: Get ST's newsletters delivered to your inbox
JERUSALEM, Feb 21 - Comments by U.S. Ambassador to Israel Mike Huckabee suggesting that Israel had a biblical right to much of the Middle East drew condemnation over the weekend from countries across the region, who called his remarks "dangerous and inflammatory".
Huckabee, an evangelical Christian, has been a staunch supporter of Israel throughout his political career and a longtime defender of Jewish settlements in the Israeli-occupied West Bank - land which the Palestinians seek for a state.
Most countries view the Israeli settlements in territories captured in the 1967 war as illegal. Israel disputes this view and cites biblical and historical ties to the land.
In an interview with Tucker Carlson that was conducted on Wednesday in Israel and aired on Friday, the conservative U.S. talk show host asked Huckabee about Israel's right to exist and about Jewish roots in the ancient land.
Citing the book of Genesis, Carlson asked whether the modern state of Israel had a right to the lands promised in the Bible by God to Abraham, stretching from the Euphrates River to the Nile, covering much of the Middle East. In response, Huckabee said:
"It would be fine if they took it all. But I don't think that's what we're talking about here today."
Huckabee added: "We're talking about this land that the state of Israel now lives in and wants to have peace in, they're not trying to take over Jordan, they're not trying to take over Syria, they're not trying to take over Iraq or anywhere else. They want to protect their people."
In response, a joint statement condemning Huckabee's comments was issued by the Palestinians and countries in the Middle East and beyond, including Jordan, the United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Turkey, Indonesia and Pakistan.
They said his comments were: "Dangerous and inflammatory remarks, which constitute a flagrant violation of the principles of international law and the Charter of the United Nations, and pose a grave threat to the security and stability of the region."
A U.S. Embassy spokesperson said Huckabee's comments did not reflect any change in U.S. policy and that his full remarks made clear that Israel has no desire to change its current boundaries.
Israeli officials did not immediately comment on the interview or the reaction from countries that signed the joint statement. REUTERS

UK government botched response to police ban on Maccabi fans, lawmakers’ report says

UK government botched response to police ban on Maccabi fans, lawmakers’ report says
MPs blast police for bogus research, failure to liaise with local Jewish community ahead of Aston Villa game last year, say government’s ‘clumsy’ response inflamed tensions further
A report released Sunday by a panel of UK lawmakers into the banning of Maccabi Tel Aviv fans from a soccer game in Birmingham last year found that police failed to perform basic due diligence or liaise effectively with the Jewish community, while the government’s intervention in the matter failed to improve the situation.
The committee of seven lawmakers said they found no evidence of a “conspiracy” to keep out the Israeli fans, but said they “cannot rule out the suggestion that political pressure played a part” in what one of the authors — Labour MP Joani Reid — called “among the most serious policing failures in recent years.”
According to the report, “evidence was selected partially in order to justify the ban, and West Midlands Police were overly reliant on inaccurate and unverified information about the Maccabi Tel Aviv fans.”
“This incident has caused serious damage to trust in West Midlands Police, particularly among the local Jewish community, as well as to public confidence in the effectiveness of the force,” the lawmakers said.
At the same time, the committee noted that by “intervening only after the decision to ban away fans was taken, the Government increased tension around the fixture but was ineffectual in enabling Maccabi Tel Aviv fans to attend.”
The findings came after an earlier report, published last month, found that police succumbed to “confirmation bias” in their risk assessments.
In the wake of the January report, local police chief Craig Guildford – who is the subject of two ongoing investigations into potential misconduct – stepped down in January, a move welcomed by the committee on Sunday.
British police used false information to justify the Maccabi ban, having relied for its research on an artificial intelligence program – Microsoft’s AI Copilot – that “hallucinated” a soccer match that had never taken place, in which Maccabi fans had ostensibly caused problems.
Guildford initially denied any use of AI by the force. The lawmakers’ report issued Sunday said he did not intentionally mislead lawmakers, but that “it demonstrates a remarkable lack of professional curiosity” that he did not get to the bottom of the matter once concerns were raised.
Additionally, police claimed that hundreds of Maccabi fans had targeted Muslim communities on the night preceding a 2024 game against Ajax in Amsterdam. Dutch police have since disputed that characterization of the confrontation, however, saying Maccabi supporters were targeted.
Following that game, a violent riot ensued during which local gangs — made up largely of local Muslims and Arabs — attacked Israeli fans, in what Dutch leadership described as an antisemitic act.
The committee on Sunday also criticized Guildford for poor communication with, and about, the local Jewish community, whom the police did not consult before announcing the ban.
“It is not just that West Midlands Police harmed their relations with the Jewish community; their failure to engage may have weakened the robustness of their decision-making,” the report argued, noting that the police were already exposed to the views of those who wanted the Israeli fans banned, and “missed an opportunity to hear any contrary views.”
The lawmakers said they found no evidence the ban was motivated by antisemitism, but said the gap between the police’s robust engagement with other communities and its comparatively meager engagement with local Jews “provided a basis for some to perceive” it as such.
The committee also criticized police representatives for seeming to indicate that the Jewish community had signed off on the ban, which was not true. The lawmakers said they saw no evidence that these misleading comments were deliberate, but that they were nevertheless “surprising and disappointing.”
UK government’s intervention came too late
Despite the problems with the police force’s actions, the UK government’s intervention – publicly denouncing the decision, once it had already been made – made things worse, the lawmakers said.
The UK’s Home Office and Department for Culture, Media, and Sport knew by October 8, 2025, that a ban of Maccabi fans was likely, the report said.
“If the Government had intervened privately at this point, to make its preference known, and to offer assurances that the Government was prepared to support with additional resources, a different outcome might have been achieved,” the lawmakers wrote.
Instead, comments like those from UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer, who called the ban the “wrong decision,” only drew more attention to the game, they said.
The chair of the committee, Dame Karen Bradley, told The Guardian that it “should have been obvious” to the government in advance that the game could be a flashpoint.
“Government intervention was clumsy and came too late, and we reject the government’s argument that it could only intervene once the decision was taken,” Bradley said. “Their intervention when it came did little more than inflame tensions.”
One way to avoid a situation like this in the future, the committee concluded, would be introduce a designation of some soccer matches as “of national significance,” allowing for stronger intervention in sensitive cases.

At least one killed in widescale Russian attacks on Ukraine’s energy sector
Main target was the energy sector, but residential buildings and a railway were also damaged, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy says.
Russia has launched dozens of missiles and hundreds of drones at Ukraine, killing at least one person, according to Ukrainian officials.
The most powerful attacks were reported in the regions of Kyiv, Odesa and Kharkiv, the officials said on Sunday.

Ukraine’s air force said Moscow launched 50 ballistic and cruise missiles and 297 drones overnight, the majority of which were intercepted.
“Moscow continues to invest in strikes more than in diplomacy,” Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said, adding that this past week alone, Russia launched more than 1,300 drones, more than 1,400 guided aerial bombs and 96 missiles against Ukraine.
The president added that Sunday’s attacks targeted the Dnipro, Kirovohrad, Mykolaiv, Poltava and Sumy regions.
The main target of the attack was the energy sector, but residential buildings and a railway were also damaged, he noted.
In a separate incident in the western city of Lviv, which has been largely spared the worst of the conflict, a policewoman was killed and 25 people were injured in the detonation of explosive devices inside a shop on a central shopping street.
Hours later, law enforcement said it had arrested a Ukrainian woman suspected of carrying out the bombing, without providing any further details and saying an investigation was ongoing.
Kyiv attack
Mykola Kalashnyk, head of Kyiv’s military administration, said on Telegram that Russian forces targeted five districts in the Kyiv region, injuring at least 15 people, including four children, and killing one person.
Russian attacks were also reported in the eastern region of Kharkiv, where Governor Oleh Syniehubov said at least 12 settlements were targeted and six people injured.
In southern Ukraine, fires broke out in the region of Odesa as Russian drones struck energy infrastructure, according to Governor Oleh Kiper.
“Fortunately, there were no deaths or injuries. An assessment of the state of energy facilities and elimination of the consequences is ongoing,” Kiper wrote on Telegram.
Attacks on Ukraine’s energy facilities have become a near-daily occurrence in winter during Russia’s war in Ukraine, which started almost four years ago when Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered a full-scale invasion of the neighbouring country.
These attacks deprive millions of Ukrainians of heat, power and running water as temperatures have dropped below minus 10 degrees Celsius (14 degrees Fahrenheit), causing thick ice to cover roads and the Dnipro, Europe’s fifth largest river.
Last week, Russia unleashed a barrage of nearly 400 drones and 29 missiles on Ukraine’s energy infrastructure on the first day of two days of peace negotiations in Geneva, its second large-scale blow in six days.
On February 12, another attack had left 100,000 families without electricity and 3,500 apartment buildings without heat in Kyiv alone.
Sunday’s attacks come as the United States is trying to reach a ceasefire between Kyiv and Moscow.
But these efforts – including the talks in Geneva last week and two earlier sessions in the United Arab Emirates – have failed to reach any breakthrough.
A core sticking point is territory. Russia wants Ukraine to pull out from the remaining 20 percent of its eastern region of Donetsk that the Kremlin’s forces have failed to capture – something firmly rejected by Kyiv.
Ukraine does not want to make territorial concessions and is demanding clear security guarantees that it will not be attacked by Russia again if a ceasefire is reached.

"Working with the fantastic Governor of Louisiana, Jeff Landry, we are going to send a great hospital boat to Greenland to take care of the many people who are sick, and not being taken care of there. It’s on the way!!!" the US president stated on his Truth Social network account.
On December 21, 2025, Trump appointed Louisiana Governor Jeff Landry as the US special envoy for Greenland. Following his appointment, Landry said on the X media platform that he would seek to bring the island under US control. The statement triggered a diplomatic scandal in Copenhagen that prompted the Danish Foreign Ministry to summon US Ambassador Kenneth Howery.
On March 13, 2025, Trump stated that the United States would annex Greenland, a self-ruling territory of Denmark. On March 4, he said he would approve a decision by the island’s people to join the United States.
The US leader has repeatedly said that Greenland should become part of the United States. He threatened to impose high tariffs on Denmark if it did not give up the island. Even during his first term, Trump offered to buy Greenland. Denmark and Greenland rejected the idea.

Hong Kong jewellery sales sparkle amid 13% jump in mainland Chinese visitors
Lawmaker Peter Shiu says ‘pleasant surprise’ came from cosmetics sector, which saw 40 to 50 per cent increase in sales over Lunar New Year break
Hong Kong recorded a 13 per cent increase in visitors from mainland China during the Lunar New Year holiday against a year ago, with the influx boosting jewellery sales by 10 per cent during the period despite a sharp rise in gold prices.
Industry representatives said on Sunday that overall business was better than last year, although the recovery remained uneven across sectors and was not always directly tied to the greater number of mainland visitors.
Immigration figures showed mainland visitors made 1.02 million trips to the city between February 15 and Saturday, a 13 per cent increase from the 909,628 logged during the corresponding period last year.
The holiday on the mainland runs from February 15 to Monday, spanning nine days from the 28th day of the last month of the lunar calendar to the seventh day after the new year.
Retail sector lawmaker Peter Shiu Ka-fai said market conditions had improved compared with last year, noting that the retail industry reported a general upturn in business.
He said that despite soaring gold prices, jewellery stores still recorded about 10 per cent growth in sales, largely driven by the influx of mainland tourists.

Pokemon cards worth HK$8,000 stolen in Hong Kong shop burglary
Police believe the suspect climbed scaffolding to reach a platform before forcing open window grilles to enter the Kwun Tong shop
Police said they received a report at about 2.50am on Sunday from a 25-year-old man that his 1,000 sq ft shop in Chung Mei Centre on Hing Yip Street, Kwun Tong, had been ransacked.
He also found that more than 10 security cameras had been sprayed with red paint.
An initial count indicated that about three boxes of Pokemon cards were missing.
Officers are searching for a suspect described as about 1.7 metres (5 feet, 7 inches) tall, of medium build, wearing a surgical mask, yellow safety helmet, black jacket and dark trousers.
Investigators believe the thief entered from a back alley on Hing Yip Street, climbed scaffolding set up for building repairs, reached a platform and then forced open window grilles to gain entry.
The shop’s main door showed no signs of tampering.

ALMATY, February 22. /TASS/. Central Asia’s population is likely to reach 96 million people by 2040, creating a huge burden on infrastructure, which is why the region needs a leap forward in energy efficiency, water, and transportation, Nikolay Podguzov, Chairman of the Management Board of the Eurasian Development Bank (EDB), said in an interview with TASS.
"By 2040, we estimate that Central Asia's population could reach 96 million. This should be a driver for the economy, but at the same time, such a large population places a huge strain on infrastructure. Sustainable development requires a leap forward in energy efficiency, modern mobility, and water resource management," he said.
Central Asia is one of the fastest-growing regions in the world, Podguzov said, adding that the EDB expects the combined economy of the region's five countries to reach $600 bln this year. "However, <...> to move forward and achieve greater results, we first need to understand how to address the challenges facing the region: demography, transportation, and water supply. These three challenges are closely interrelated," he stressed.

The number of new vehicle registrations in Finland has been declining year by year in the 2020s, and 2025 was another lacklustre year.
Fewer than 72,000 new passenger cars were registered, three percent less than the year before. The number was the lowest figure so far in this century, Statistics Finland said on Friday.
Imports of used vehicles decreased by four percent in 2025, totalling just over 41,000. The largest numbers were brought in from Sweden and Germany.
Meanwhile the number of new trucks and busses on the road fell by 15 and 25 percent respectively.
Nearly 60% of new cars are plug-ins
Last year, 37 percent of new passenger cars were fully electric cars, an increase of 22 percent from the year before. Meanwhile consumers shied away from plug-in hybrids, with new registrations slipping by two percent.
Overall, the number of plug-in passenger cars rose by 12 percent from 2024.
Meanwhile registrations of new petrol- and diesel-powered cars both fell by nearly one-fifth.
Nearly 60 percent of all new cars were rechargeable, with less than 40 percent petrol-powered and just four percent diesel-powered. The data does not include registrations in the autonomous Åland Islands.

Greenland does not need US hospital ship, Denmark says

Greenland does not need medical assistance from other countries, Denmark's defence minister said Sunday, after US President Donald Trump claimed he was sending a hospital ship to the autonomous Danish territory that he covets.
"The Greenlandic population receives the healthcare it needs. They receive it either in Greenland, or, if they require specialised treatment, they receive it in Denmark. So it's not as if there's a need for a special healthcare initiative in Greenland," Defence Minister Troels Lund Poulsen told Danish broadcaster DR.
In Greenland, as in Denmark, access to healthcare is free.
There are five regional hospitals across the vast Arctic island, with the Nuuk hospital serving patients from all over the territory.
The Greenlandic local government signed an agreement with Copenhagen in early February to improve the treatment of Greenlandic patients in Danish hospitals.
Trump on Saturday posted on his social media platform Truth Social that "we are going to send a great hospital boat to Greenland to take care of the many people who are sick, and not being taken care of there".
"It's on the way!!!" he added.
Trump has said the US must control Greenland to ensure its security, though he has backed off from earlier threats to seize it after striking a "framework" deal with NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte to ensure greater US influence.
Lund Poulsen told DR he was not aware of the hospital ship's possible arrival.
"Trump is constantly tweeting about Greenland. So this is undoubtedly an expression of the new normal that has taken hold in international politics," he said.
Earlier Saturday, Denmark's Arctic Command announced that it had evacuated a crew member of a US submarine off the coast of Nuuk after the sailor requested urgent medical attention.

Israeli prison authorities prevent Palestinian prisoners from Ramadan fasting ‘at right time’: Commission
Prison authorities refuse to alert detainees about times of dawn and sunset prayers to start and break fast, lawyer says
RAMALLAH, Palestine
A Palestinian commission has accused Israeli prison authorities of preventing detainees of observing fasting “at the right time” during the holy fasting month of Ramadan.
In a statement released Saturday night, the Palestinian Commission of Detainees’ Affairs said authorities at the Ofer Prison in the West Bank city of Ramallah refuse to alert detainees about the times of dawn and sunset prayers to allow prisoners to start and break their fast.
“Prisoners observe Ramadan without suhoor (a pre-dawn meal), while iftar (a fasting-breaking meal) turns into a long ordeal,” Khaled Mahajneh, a lawyer with the commission, told the official Voice of Palestine radio.
He said Palestinian detainees at Gilboa Prison in northern Israel were not alerted about the start of the fasting month of Ramadan, the holiest month in the Islamic lunar calendar.
He said one of the prisoners learned of the Ramadan start while attending an Israeli court session.
“For more than two years, Palestinian detainees are forced to eat only food scraps for iftar,” Mahajneh said.
"The occupation is trying to erase the joy of Palestinian prisoners of religious occasions, and deliberately makes the joy of their families incomplete and painful over the abuse and torture of their sons behind bars,” he added.
More than 9,300 Palestinians are currently held in Israeli prisons, including 350 children, and they face torture, starvation, and medical neglect that has led to the deaths of dozens, according to Palestinian and Israeli human rights organizations.

MOSCOW, February 22. /TASS/. Russian air defense systems shot down seven HIMARS multiple launch rockets, five guided aerial bombs, and 326 fixed-wing drones of the Ukrainian army in 24 hours, the Russian Defense Ministry reported.
"Air defense systems shot down five guided aerial bombs, seven rockets from the US-made HIMARS multiple launch rocket system, and 326 fixed-wing unmanned aerial vehicles," the report said.
Russian troops have launched a strike with long-range precision weapons against Ukrainian military-industrial complex and energy infrastructure facilities used in the interests of the Ukrainian army, with all designated objects affected, the ministry said.
"Over the past 24 hours, in response to the Kiev regime's terrorist attacks on civilian infrastructure in Russia, the Russian Armed Forces launched a massive strike using long-range, land-and air-based precision weapons, as well as unmanned aerial vehicles, against Ukrainian military-industrial complex and energy infrastructure facilities used by the Ukrainian army. The strike's objectives were achieved. All designated targets were hit," the report said.
Russian troops also destroyed a logistics center and a storage facility for the Ukrainian army’s UAVs and their components in 24 hours, the ministry said, adding that temporary deployment points for Ukrainian troops and foreign mercenaries in 144 districts were hit.
"Operational-tactical aviation, combat unmanned aerial vehicles, missile forces, and artillery of the Russian Armed Forces’ groups struck a logistics center and a storage site for unmanned aerial vehicles and components for them, as well as temporary deployment points for Ukrainian armed forces and foreign mercenaries in 144 districts," according to the report.
Units of Battlegroup Center inflicted losses on manpower and equipment of the Azov special forces brigade (recognized as terrorist and banned in Russia).
"Units of Battlegroup Center took more advantageous positions and lines. They defeated the personnel and equipment of five mechanized brigades, a jaeger [brigade], an airmobile [brigade], an assault brigade, an assault regiment of the Ukrainian army, a territorial defense brigade, the Azov special forces brigade, and four National Guard brigades," the report said.
In all, the Russian forces have destroyed 670 Ukrainian warplanes, 283 helicopters, 116,263 unmanned aerial vehicles, 650 anti-aircraft missile systems, 27,814 tanks and other armored combat vehicles, 1,670 multiple rocket launchers, 33,421 field artillery guns and mortars, and 55,005 special military motor vehicles since the beginning of the special military operation in Ukraine, according to the Defense Ministry.

Rescuers in California on Feb. 21 recovered the body of the ninth and final person missing in an avalanche in the Sierra Nevada mountains, the local sheriff's office said.
Teams had been searching for the skiers since Feb. 17, when disaster befell a backcountry trip on the 2,776-meter Castle Peak in the Lake Tahoe area.
Out of the four guides and 11 paying clients, six people survived the incident, one of the deadliest avalanches in modern U.S. history.
"Nine individuals who lost their lives in the Castle Peak avalanche on Feb. 17 have been safely recovered from the mountain," the Nevada County Sheriff's Office said in a statement.
"There are no words that truly capture the significance of this loss and our hearts mourn alongside the families of those affected by this catastrophic event," Sheriff Shannan Moon said.
The six who survived, five clients and a guide, managed to call for help shortly after disaster struck, but white-out conditions and the risk of further snow slides meant rescue teams could not reach them for several hours.
In a statement reported by U.S. media, families of six of the victims identified them as women who were "mothers, wives and friends, all of whom connected through the love of the outdoors."
"They were passionate, skilled skiers who cherished time together in the mountains," the families' statement said, adding "we have many unanswered questions."

China overtakes US as Germany’s top trading partner

China has overtaken the US as Germany’s top trading partner, figures have shown, as the chancellor, Friedrich Merz, prepares for his first visit to Beijing since taking office.
Merz will head to China on Tuesday and will be welcomed with military honours on Wednesday in Beijing by the prime minister, Li Qiang, before later meeting the president, Xi Jinping, for talks over dinner, his spokesperson Sebastian Hille said.
Germany’s Federal Statistical Office released figures on Friday showing that China was back on top as the country’s most important market with €251bn (£219bn) in trade in 2025, up 2.2% on 2024, when the US was the country’s leading export destination.
Germany imported goods worth about €170.6bn from China in 2025, more than double the value of exports from Germany to China, which stood at €81.3bn.
Trade with the US was worth €240bn, with Donald Trump’s controversial tariffs partly a potential factor in the 5% drop in trade.
Hill said that during the two-day trip to China Merz would also visit the Forbidden City, the Chinese company Unitree Robotics, the German car manufacturer Mercedes-Benz and the turbine maker Siemens Energy. He will also visit the city of Hangzhou in eastern China.
Merz is expected to raise a number of topics during his visit, including the war in Ukraine, human rights and trade.
The EU is struggling to limit China’s overheating manufacturing with tariffs on electric vehicles imported to the EU introduced in 2024 having little impact on sales and tariffs threatened on steel later this year through steel safeguards.
Germany’s relationship with China on trade is complex, with car companies having a significant manufacturing presence in the country. Volkswagen has referred to it as a “second home market” and BMW and Mercedes-Benz are also heavily reliant on sales in the country for their economic success.
The BMW chief executive, Oliver Zipse, will be one of 30 business representatives to accompany Merz on the trip. “Complex global challenges can only be solved by working together,” Zipse told Reuters. “With his trip to China, the chancellor is sending a strong signal for dialogue and cooperation.”
The EU wants to derisk and has introduced several initiatives to wean itself off China, which dominates supplies of rare earths, processed rare earths, critical minerals and refined critical minerals, including lithium needed for EV batteries, and permanent magnets used in everything from cars and fridges to military jets.
Germany’s need to support the car industry, one of the country’s biggest employers, has made its approach to barriers to Chinese imports less black and white.
It voted against an EU decision to introduce tariffs on Chinese EVs in 2024 and this month was spared EU tariffs on imports of the Chinese-built Volkswagen Cupra Tavascan SUV in exchange for undertakings on the minimum price of the vehicle.

UK Defence Secretary: I want to be the defence secretary who deploys British troops to Ukraine
UK Defence Secretary John Healey has said he hopes to become the first defence secretary to deploy British troops to Ukraine, as this would signal the end of the war.
Source: The Telegraph, as reported by European Pravda
Details: Healey said that "2026 must be the year this terrible war ends".
Quote: "There is no heavier burden on any defence secretary or any government than committing our Armed Forces on operations… I want to be the defence secretary who deploys British troops to Ukraine – because this will mean that this war is finally over. It will mean we have negotiated peace in Ukraine. And a secure Europe needs a strong, sovereign Ukraine."
Details: Healey also expressed gratitude for the military support and the generosity of the British people, who "opened their doors" to Ukrainian refugees in the first few weeks after the start of Russia's aggression.
"I am proud that the UK is united for Ukraine. I am proud of the highest-ever level of military support we're providing this year," he said.
Healey also praised Ukrainians, who continue to "fight with that same huge courage they showed on 24 February 2022".
Quote: "We are putting Ukraine in the strongest possible position to achieve a just and lasting peace on their terms. Ukrainians have shown they do not fear Russian aggression. The only thing Ukraine fears is Western fatigue. But as President Zelenskyy knows, Ukraine's friends will never tire."
Background:
- Former UK prime minister Boris Johnson believes the UK and its allies should send troops to Ukraine immediately to "flip a switch" in Russian leader Vladimir Putin's head.
- Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said earlier that the United States would take the lead in monitoring the cessation of hostilities after a peace deal with Russia is reached.

Catholic Italy's Olympic host cities offer different access for Muslims to observe Ramadan

Catholic Italy's Olympic host cities offer different access for Muslims to observe Ramadan
This year’s Olympic and Paralympic Games are located in Italy, a historically Catholic nation
- Bookmark
This year's Olympic and Paralympic Games are located in Italy, a historically Catholic nation. And they coincide with Ramadan, the Muslim holy month that’s a time for dawn-to-dusk fasting, religious reflection and communal celebration.
One of the two host cities, Milan, is multicultural and cosmopolitan, and there are Islamic centers and mosques spread around the city to gather and worship. At least one is welcoming people of other faiths wishing to partake in iftar dinners, when Muslims break their daily fast.
Up in the mountains, around the village of Cortina d'Ampezzo, prayer spaces are harder to come by. Still, Muslim residents in the area over recent years have been carving out their communities.
Here's how some Muslims are observing Ramadan in Milan and Cortina:
A mosque welcoming members of all faiths
Milan’s Al-Wahid mosque is opening its doors during Ramadan, inviting guests to share the breaking of the fast and evening prayers. Near Milan’s Navigli district, it has been officially recognized as a place of worship by the city since 2000.
Fridays — the weekly day of congregational prayer in Islam — draw larger crowds to mosques. On those days during Ramadan for the last few years, Al-Wahid welcomes guests from the municipality, local institutions, the Catholic Church and other religious communities. Interfaith iftars have become common in many parts of the world, including Muslim-majority countries such as Indonesia and Pakistan, and in Australia and the United States, where Muslims are a relatively small minority.
Al-Wahid's open gatherings aren't specifically for Olympic visitors, though they are scheduled weekly through March 14 — the day before the Paralympics end.
“The Olympics are a symbolic moment,” Imam Yahya Pallavicini, vice president of a national Islamic religious association known by its acronym COREIS, told The Associated Press. “Sport, culture and art can help reduce prejudice and fear toward a particular culture or religious identity.”
At sunset on Feb. 20, a few dozen Muslim worshippers stood shoulder to shoulder beneath a row of hanging lamps. They waited for the call to prayer before breaking their fast with dates offered on silver plates. Then they sat on the floor to share lentils, rice, meat and water before ending the evening with prayer.
A 2025 report by a Milan-based migration research institute, ISMU, estimates that almost 400,000 Muslims live in Lombardy, the Italian region with the biggest immigrant population and which includes Milan, Italy's second-most populous city. The largest groups come from Morocco and Egypt, it said.
Pallavicini said the community also includes people from Bangladesh, Pakistan and Bosnia, among others.
Mountain towns, not many mosques
In the other Olympic host city, Cortina, at an elevation of about 1,220 meters (4,000 feet), eight Muslim people told the AP that finding a place to pray has proven challenging.
The upscale mountain town, known as the Queen of the Dolomites, is home to a little over 5,000 people. About half its population is part of Italy’s Ladin minority, which settled the mountain hamlet of Anpezo a millennium ago.
Rabah Boubegtiten, who traveled to work in the Olympics as a driver with Qatari security, said his drive to Brunico — the location of the nearest mosque he could find — took over an hour on a bad road. He found it using social media, having failed to locate one using Google, he added.
“There are many nationalities here, many Muslims from various countries: Algerians, Tunisians, other Africans, and many Qataris, because we are working with them during the Winter Olympic Games. They look everywhere to find a place to pray, but it’s almost impossible,” Boubegtiten, 52, who lives in Paris and is originally from Algeria, said. "For us, it’s really difficult. Sometimes, even if we want to come, we simply can’t."
An interfaith prayer room is available at each residential village for athletes across the spread-out Games, but they are not accessible to the general public.
Elsewhere in the Dolomites, residents have been making their own spaces. They said there are sufficient places to worship around Brunico, which itself has about 17,000 people, as well as halal butchers and shops to accommodate the local Muslim population.
Around 120 people attended the Friday prayer in Brunico, sitting on the crowded floor in a room surrounded by curtains and listening to a sermon in Italian. Afterward, they were asked for donations to help cover the space's rent and utility bills.
“In Italy, Ramadan is not an impossible thing. It is possible to practice Ramadan, it’s possible to pray,” said Kreem Wardi, whose father is Muslim from Morocco and mother is from Italy and Catholic. "It is not easy to find a mosque everywhere in Italy. But in this area, we are fine for now, inshallah.”
Wardi, a 20-year-old student, noted that in Brunico it's uncommon to invite non-Muslims to iftar dinners or share Ramadan traditions.
“They maybe don’t want to talk about Islam. It’s not that they hate us Muslims, but it’s just that they are maybe not interested, so we don’t want to force it upon them,” he said.
A more diverse Italy
While the vast majority of Italy’s 59 million people are baptized Catholic, about three-quarters identify with the religion and far fewer regularly attend church. Muslims number 1.7 million, accounting for than 30% of the foreign resident population for the first time, ISMU, the migration research institute, said in July.
Migration over the past decade has stirred right-wing, anti-immigrant sentiment in some parts of Europe. Italian Premier Giorgia Meloni, who heads the far-right Brothers of Italy party, pledged a crackdown on migration after taking office in 2022, with the goal of deterring would-be refugees from paying smugglers to make the dangerous Mediterranean crossing.
A large portion of today's Muslim population in Italy are migrants, but there is a growing number of second-generation Italian Muslims, converts and people born in Italy, Pallavicini said in Milan.
When the call to prayer finally echoed through the Al-Wahid mosque close to 7 p.m., men and women bowed in unison, their foreheads close to the floor.
Amina Croce, 28, was one of them. Born to Italian Catholic parents who converted to Islam and raised her as a Muslim, she said the mosque "has been a very significant part of who I am.”
Beyond religious observance, Croce added, she sees the faith as part of Europe’s history.
“We believe this diversity is part of Italy’s broader cultural heritage,” said Croce, who leads the youth division of COREIS. “It may still be underappreciated, but we hope it will be recognized more in the future.”

US can access minerals, military bases in Somaliland: minister
Somaliland is willing to give the United States access to its minerals and military bases, a minister has told AFP, as the breakaway region of Somalia seeks international recognition.
Israel became the only country in the world to recognise Somaliland's independence in December - something the territory has been seeking since declaring its autonomy from Somalia in 1991.
The government in Mogadishu still considers Somaliland an integral part of Somalia even though the territory has run its own affairs since 1991, with its own passports, currency, army and police force.
"We are willing to give exclusive (access to our minerals) to the United States. Also, we are open to offer military bases to the United States," Khadar Hussein Abdi, minister of the presidency, told AFP in an interview on Saturday.
"We believe that we will agree on something with the United States."
Somaliland president Abdirahman Mohamed Abdullahi already suggested in recent weeks granting Israel privileged access to its mineral resources.
And Khadar Hussein Abdi said he could not rule out the possibility of also allowing Israel to set up a military presence.
Somaliland lies across the Gulf of Aden from Yemen, where Houthi rebels have often attacked Israeli assets to show solidarity with Palestinians.
Somaliland officials have said their soil is rich in lithium, coltan and other sought-after resources, though independent studies are lacking.
Turkey plea
Shortly after Israel's recognition at the end of December, social media was flooded with photos of men and women displaying the Israeli flag - one of them even using it as a hijab.
Somali President Hassan Sheikh Mohamud, on the other hand, denounced it as "the greatest violation of Somalia's sovereignty" and a "threat to the security and stability of the world and the region".
The African Union and most Arab countries threw their support behind Somalia and condemned the move.
The US, however, defended what it said was Israel's right to recognise Somaliland, although President Donald Trump said he was unlikely to follow suit, despite pressure from some within his Republican party.
Khadar Hussein Abdi reached out specifically to Turkey, another country that objected to Israel's move, telling AFP that Turkish officials "must talk to us, not to Mogadishu" as Somalia had no functioning state.
"It is fragmented factions who sit in Mogadishu. They don't agree on anything," he said.
"So focusing on that does not help the security of the region."

Ukrainians have lived through 1,461 days of the full-scale war. That is over 72,000 air alarms, almost 20,000 explosions, and countless bombardments and shellings. That is over 13,000 missiles and 142,000 drones of various types. That is more than 15,000 dead and more than 41,000 injured civilians. These are 4 years of losses and victories, pain and hope, ups and downs.
And these four years are absolutely enough to get rid of all illusions.

Ukraine’s drones are hitting deeper and deeper into the rear of the Russian Federation, but this is not enough. And Moscow has launched its Oreshnik, but did not force the Ukrainians to surrender.
It is quite clear that there is no magic agreement that would encourage Russia to withdraw its troops and stop terror either. Because complex issues cannot be resolved in a simple way.
And the negotiation track is just a way for the Russian Federation to stall for time as long as possible, to fool the West and postpone new sanctions. After all, Putin does not show any signs that he is ready for peace.
There will be no sensations
This war can no longer surprise. It has become a painful routine for both Ukrainians and the West, where the news is limited to the number of destroyed homes, energy infrastructure, and civilians killed.
There are no more sensations. At meetings with our partners, at all international forums, Ukraine cannot provide any new information. It has long been known that Russia kidnapped 20,000 Ukrainian children. The scale of the Russian Federation’s terror against Ukrainian energy is also known.
British Defence Intelligence Update Ukraine 20 February 2026
Everyone knows very well how many missiles the Kremlin can produce, and who helps with the details. The scale of the shadow fleet, how Moscow continues to export its oil, parallel imports, loopholes for circumventing sanctions, real export prices for Russian oil, and what the Russians are putting into their budget are known too.
And all our partners who are truly interested in ending the war understand perfectly well what needs to be done. The only way is to put systematic pressure on Russia and provide real support to Ukraine.
Sanctions should work in such a way that Russia has no resources for new weapons and payments to its own personnel and mercenaries. This should be a strong noose around the neck of Putin’s economy, not slow knots that they have time to adapt to.
Ukraine needs weapons and missiles for air defense systems, and the systems themselves. We are grateful for the support, for the praise for the Defense Forces, for the right words and statements of intent, but this cannot stop the Russian missiles and drones that fly into our cities every day and every night.
Words do not protect against Russian artillery at the front and bombers in the sky; they cannot be used to fire on enemy equipment or personnel.
To surrender means to die.
Russia considers time to be its ally in this war. Its strategy in Ukraine is to bite off a piece (sometimes a meter) of territory at the front and terrorize the rear with cold and darkness. It is stalling negotiations and arranging hybrid attacks in NATO countries, fueling populist movements in the West, and interfering in elections.
The Kremlin is playing to exhaust everyone so that Ukrainians surrender, so that partners get tired, so that the money to support Kyiv runs out.
And no matter how exhausted we are, surrender will not bring peace, not to us, not to Europe, not to the whole world. To understand what will happen the next day after Ukraine falls, it is enough to look at the territories that Russia occupied.
Forced mobilization of men, militarization of adolescents, and erasure of children’s identities. Banning of language, eradication of culture, rewriting of history, repression of religion, confiscation of property, and eviction to other regions of the Russian Federation. Torture, executions, terror.
Everyone shares our experience over the past four years of war in Ukraine. Everyone here has been to the funeral of a loved one who died at the hands of the Russians – from bombings or at the front.
We don’t need sympathy, we need action.
Everyone here spends the night in a shelter, basement, or subway during air raids. Everyone has property damaged by the strikes — whether it’s a home, a car, or an office. We know what a blackout is and how to survive with children in homes without electricity, water, and heating in the coldest winter in the last 20 years.
We know how to transfer drones, electronic warfare, and cars to the military (friends, colleagues, relatives who serve) because it is faster and easier. What “+” means in response to a message, and that the words “How are you?” often contain more love and care than an entire poem.
Now, little Ukrainians who have never seen peace and quiet in their lives are going to kindergarten.
Children for whom a plane means bombing, and hum is not about a motorcycle or an old car, but about a drone that brings death.
Children for whom a thunderstorm will never be a thunderstorm, but only the sound of a missile explosion.
Children who have not seen their fathers because they are at war.
So when you ask what Ukrainians have felt over these 4 years, the answer will be fatigue and pain, but not willingness to surrender. The question of surrender was not relevant for us in 2022, nor in 2023, nor in 2024, nor in 2025, and it certainly is not relevant now.
And if you ask Ukrainians what they want to tell the world, the answer will be — instead of sympathy, we need action.
Because the real end of the war, the real guarantee of peace on the continent is a weakened Russia and a strong Ukraine, which will be able to protect not only itself, but also all of Europe.

Johnson’s Ukraine comments typical of his attention-seeking, says Independent editor-in-chief
Boris Johnson's call for non-combat troops from the UK and Europe to be deployed immediately to Ukraine is "reckless and irresponsible," Geordie Greig told Sunday With Laura Kuenssberg.
The former prime minister said non-combat forces should be stationed in peaceful regions to send a firm message to Vladimir Putin, otherwise the Russian leader would “keep going” with the conflict.
Speaking on Sunday (22 February), The Independent editor-in-chief said of Mr Johnson's comments: "It's typical of attention-seeking stunts, which he's become known for.
"The idea that Johnson can flip a switch in Putin's mind is laughable."

Denmark evacuates US submarine crew member off coast of Greenland
It came as Trump announced plans to deploy a hospital ship to the island
- Bookmark
Denmark's military has conducted an urgent medical evacuation of a United States submarine crew member off the coast of Greenland.
The operation, confirmed by the Danish Joint Arctic Command on its Facebook page, took place on Saturday about seven nautical miles (13 kilometres) from Nuuk, the capital of the vast, ice-covered island.
A Danish Seahawk helicopter, deployed from an inspection ship, retrieved the individual.
The crew member was subsequently transferred to a hospital in Nuuk for urgent medical treatment.
Also late on Saturday, President Donald Trump announced plans to deploy a hospital ship to Greenland, an autonomous territory of Denmark, alleging that many people there are sick and not receiving care.
“Working with the fantastic Governor of Louisiana, Jeff Landry, we are going to send a great hospital boat to Greenland to take care of the many people who are sick, and not being taken care of there. It’s on the way!!!” Trump wrote on his Truth Social platform, referring to his special envoy for Greenland.
The historically strong bilateral ties forged after World War II between Nato allies Denmark and the United States have come under severe strain in recent months.
Trump has ratcheted up talk of a possible US takeover of the mineral-rich and strategically located Arctic island, while Greenlanders have repeatedly said that the territory is “not for sale”.
The president’s Truth Social post prompted a defence of Denmark's healthcare system from the country’s Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen.
She wrote on Facebook on Sunday, that she was “happy to live in a country where there is free and equal access to health for all. Where it’s not insurances and wealth that determine whether you get proper treatment”.
“You have the same approach in Greenland,” she wrote, before adding: “Happy Sunday to you all" in front of a blushing and smiling emoji.

South Korea's Unification Church leader returns to detention
Seoul Central District Court rejected Han's request to extend her suspension from detention on health grounds
ISTANBUL
A South Korean court has sent the country's Unification Church leader Han Hak-ja, who faces trial on bribery charges linked to former first lady Kim Keon Hee, back to detention, rejecting a request to extend her temporary release on health grounds, local media reports said Sunday.
The Seoul Central District Court on Friday rejected Han's request to extend her suspension from detention, placing her back behind bars the next day, Yonhap News reported.
The court suspended her detention on Feb. 11 through Saturday, after she requested that she stand trial without being detained due to health issues.
Han reportedly received treatment for a recent fall during her release.
It marked Han's second temporary release from detention following her arrest in September.
She underwent eye surgery in November, following a court order.
A special counsel team indicted Han in October on charges of violating the political fund law and other offenses.
In addition to multiple other allegations, she is suspected of being involved in gifting a luxury necklace and a Chanel bag to the former first lady.

Greenland does not need US hospital ship: Danish minister
Sign up now: Get ST's newsletters delivered to your inbox
COPENHAGEN – Greenland does not need medical assistance from other countries, Denmark’s Defence Minister said on Feb 22, after US President Donald Trump claimed he was sending a hospital ship
“The Greenlandic population receives the healthcare it needs. They receive it either in Greenland, or, if they require specialised treatment, they receive it in Denmark. So it’s not as if there’s a need for a special healthcare initiative in Greenland,” Defence Minister Troels Lund Poulsen told Danish broadcaster DR.
In Greenland, as in Denmark, access to healthcare is free. There are five regional hospitals across the vast Arctic island, with the Nuuk hospital serving patients from all over the territory.
The Greenlandic local government signed an agreement with Copenhagen in early February to improve the treatment of Greenlandic patients in Danish hospitals.
Mr Trump on Feb 21 posted on his social media platform Truth Social that “we are going to send a great hospital boat to Greenland to take care of the many people who are sick, and not being taken care of there”.
“It’s on the way!!!” he added.
Mr Trump has said the US must control Greenland to ensure its security, though he has backed off earlier threats to seize it after striking a “framework” deal with NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte to ensure greater US influence.
Mr Lund Poulsen told DR he was not aware of the hospital ship’s possible arrival.
“Trump is constantly tweeting about Greenland. So this is undoubtedly an expression of the new normal that has taken hold in international politics,” he said.
Earlier on Feb 21, Denmark’s Arctic Command announced that it had evacuated a crew member of a US submarine off the coast of Nuuk after the sailor requested urgent medical attention. AFP

Government seeking ‘best deal possible’ for UK firms over US tariffs – minister
Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson acknowledged businesses face ‘uncertainty’ after the move.
- Bookmark
High-level talks are ongoing after Donald Trump’s announcement of 15% global tariffs and the Government wants “the best possible deal” for UK firms, a Cabinet minister has said.
Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson admitted businesses face “uncertainty” after the move but insisted Britain expects its “preferential” trade arrangements with the US to continue.
The US president said on Saturday he would be imposing a 15% global tariff “effective immediately” after the Supreme Court overturned his previous import taxes policy in a ruling on Friday.
The UK’s biggest business organisation swiftly expressed dismay at the announcement and urged the Government to continue dialogue with US counterparts to keep Britain’s competitive advantage.
The British Chambers of Commerce warned the change would mean an extra 5% increase in tariffs on a “wide range” of exports to America, except those covered under a transatlantic trade deal.
Facing broadcasters on Sunday, Ms Phillipson was asked whether it was time to use the “steel fist” rather than the “velvet glove” in dealings with the White House.
She insisted the UK has a “really good relationship” with the US despite a period of strained tensions over the president’s ambitions to annex Greenland, which Britain and other European countries opposed.
“You talked about the approach in whether you take a hard approach or a more nuanced approach … it has to be a combination of all of those things,” the minister told Sky’s Sunday Morning With Trevor Phillips.
“In reality you get more done when you are prepared to have serious conversations, often not in front of cameras or out there in the public, but actually behind the scenes, working closely between governments, and we do have a really strong relationship with the US.
“That is something that is not about one president or one prime minister, it’s about that long-standing and enduring relationship that is right for our country and right for national security.”
Asked about the implications of the new tariff rate for Britain, she said: “So, we did secure a preferential deal.
“We, through the work that the Prime Minister has been leading in engaging with the US government and with President Trump, we would hope and expect that to continue, but these discussions are ongoing.
“This is an evolving situation. But, of course, we want to get the best possible deal for British businesses.
“I understand the uncertainty it does cause for them, but they can be assured that we will always be working to make sure they get everything that they need.”
Mr Trump signed an executive order on Friday night that enabled him to bypass Congress and impose a 10% tax on imports from around the world, after his “reciprocal tariffs”, introduced under an emergency powers law in April, were struck down by the Supreme Court.
In a post on Truth Social on Saturday, he then said he would raising this rate to 15% following “ridiculous, poorly written and extraordinarily anti-American decision on tariffs issued yesterday”.
Britain had received the lowest tariff rate of 10% and a subsequent agreement struck by Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer and Mr Trump saw further carve-outs for the country’s steel industry and car manufacturers.
Questions remain over the implications for the UK, although officials are understood to believe the changes will not have an impact on most of Britain’s trade with America.
Asked whether previous deals still stand, Ms Phillipson said there were “conversations right to the very, very highest levels” going on “to make sure that what we regard as being in our national interest is heard loud and clear”.
The BCC, a network representing 50,000 UK firms, swiftly expressed dismay at the president’s latest announcement.
“This will be bad for trade, bad for US consumers and businesses, and weaken global economic growth,” head of trade policy at the organisation, William Bain, said.
“Businesses on both sides of the Atlantic need a period of clarity and certainty. Higher tariffs are not the way to achieve that.”
Reform UK Treasury spokesman Robert Jenrick said the party opposed blanket tariffs “very strongly”, describing the move as “harmful for trade” at a time when we can “ill-afford it”.
Asked if he wants Nigel Farage to tell Donald Trump that he is wrong, Mr Jenrick said: “Yes, absolutely.
“And, look, Keir Starmer has tried his best, but I would bet that Nigel Farage will be better at negotiating with Donald Trump than Keir Starmer has been.”
He added: “If Keir Starmer is willing to swallow his pride and ask for Nigel’s help to try to resolve the situation, then I can assure you that Nigel would want to do that.”

'No thanks': Greenland rejects Trump's offer to send hospital ship to island
'President Trump’s idea to send a US hospital ship here to Greenland has been duly noted. But we have a public health system where care is free for citizens,” say Prime Minister Jens-Frederik Nielsen
ISTANBUL
Greenland on Sunday said that medical help is not needed from other countries, rejecting US President Donald Trump's offer to send a hospital ship to the region he desires to take over.
On his social media platform Truth Social, Trump said on Saturday that, working with Louisiana Governor Jeff Landry, whom he appointed special representative for Greenland, the US will dispatch a hospital ship to the island.
“Working with the fantastic Governor of Louisiana, Jeff Landry, we are going to send a great hospital boat to Greenland to take care of the many people who are sick and not being taken care of there,” says the US president. "It's on the way!!!"
“That will be ‘no thanks’ from us,” the Greenlandic prime minister said on his Facebook page.
“President Trump’s idea to send a US hospital ship here to Greenland has been duly noted. But we have a public health system where care is free for citizens,” Jens-Frederik Nielsen added.
In recent months, Trump has renewed his interest in US control over Greenland, citing national security concerns about Russia and China. He threatened sanctions against European countries that opposed the move.
Trump later withdrew the threats after his meeting with NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, saying they had established a framework for a potential agreement involving Greenland and the broader Arctic region, followed by talks between the US, Denmark, and Greenland.
He also said further discussions would be held on the US’ Golden Dome missile defense system in relation to Greenland.

Greenland does not need US hospital boat sent by Trump, says Denmark

Greenland has said it does not need medical assistance from other countries, after Donald Trump said he was sending a hospital ship to the autonomous Danish territory he wants to acquire.
The US president said he would dispatch the vessel in a social media post on Saturday, claiming that Greenlanders were not getting the healthcare they needed.
“Working with the fantastic Governor of Louisiana, Jeff Landry, we are going to send a great hospital boat to Greenland to take care of the many people who are sick, and not being taken care of there,” Trump wrote on his Truth Social platform.
“It’s on the way!!!” he added.
His offer, however, was politely rejected by Nuuk.
“That will be ‘no thanks’ from us,” Jens-Frederik Nielsen, the Greenlandic prime minister, wrote on his Facebook page on Sunday.
“President Trump’s idea to send a US hospital ship here to Greenland has been duly noted. But we have a public health system where care is free for citizens,” he said.
Trump has said repeatedly that the US needs to acquire Greenland for national security reasons, and appointed Landry as US special envoy to the vast, mineral-rich Arctic island in December.
In Greenland, as in Denmark, access to healthcare is free at the point of use and funded by the taxpayer. Mette Frederiksen, the Danish prime minister, responded to Trump’s social post by defending her country’s system.
Writing on Facebook, Frederiksen said she was “happy to live in a country where there is free and equal access to health for all. Where it’s not insurances and wealth that determine whether you get proper treatment.”
She added that Greenland had “the same approach” as Denmark.
Troels Lund Poulsen, the Danish defence minister, also rejected Trump’s claim that people in Greenland were being denied medical treatment.
“The Greenlandic population receives the healthcare it needs,” he told the Danish broadcaster DR. “They receive it either in Greenland, or, if they require specialised treatment, they receive it in Denmark. So it’s not as if there’s a need for a special healthcare initiative in Greenland.”
Lund Poulsen added: “Trump is constantly tweeting about Greenland. So this is undoubtedly an expression of the new normal that has taken hold in international politics.”
There are six hospitals in Greenland serving a population of fewer than 60,000 people. In early February, the territory’s government signed an agreement with Copenhagen to improve Greenlandic patients’ access to treatment in hospitals in Denmark.
Earlier on Saturday, Denmark’s military coastguard said it had evacuated a crew member of a US submarine off the coast of Greenland after the sailor requested urgent medical attention.
The Danish Joint Arctic Command said on its Facebook page the crew member had been retrieved by helicopter about 7 nautical miles off the coast of Greenland’s capital, Nuuk, and transferred to a hospital in the city.
Since returning to the White House last year, Trump’s repeatedly expressed desire to control Greenland has put the US relationship with Denmark and its other Nato allies under significant strain.
Last week, King Frederik of Denmark paid his second visit to Greenland in the space of 12 months in an attempt to demonstrate unity with the territory in the face of Trump’s overtures.
The US president backed down on earlier threats to seize Greenland unilaterally after striking a “framework” deal in January with the Nato secretary general, Mark Rutte, to ensure greater US influence.
However, Frederiksen and the Greenlandic prime minister, Jens-Frederik Nielsen, said at the Munich security conference this month they feared the US was still interested in taking control of the island.
Frederiksen said pressure from the US was “unacceptable” and “outrageous”, while Nielsen said his country had never before felt threatened in such a way.

Suspected perpetrator behind Lviv terror attack arrested
Ukrainian Interior Minister Ihor Klymenko announced this on Telegram, Ukrinform reports.
"We are identifying other individuals involved in committing this crime," he said.
The minister expressed condolences to the family and loved ones of patrol officer Viktoriia Shpylka, who was killed in the explosion.
He also reported that 11 of the 25 injured remain hospitalized, with six law enforcement officers in serious condition.
"Police officers respond to calls day and night without knowing what awaits them. Yet they rush to help because protecting people is their main mission. I am grateful to the entire law enforcement team working to solve and investigate this crime. The perpetrators must face justice and receive appropriate punishment," Klymenko said.
Explosions rocked Lviv in the early hours of Sunday, February 22. There was no air raid alert in the city at the time. Police stated that the explosions happened after patrol officers arrived at the scene.
Preliminary investigations indicate that improvised explosive devices were detonated. The attack killed 23-year-old patrol officer Viktoriia Shpylka.

A Cabinet minister has refused to rule out imposing retaliatory tariffs on the US, but insisted that it is better to negotiate with Donald Trump’s administration “behind the scenes”.
Bridget Phillipson also said the government would “hope and expect” its preferential tariff deal with the US to continue after the president announced 15 per cent global tariffs in the wake of a Supreme Court ruling which struck down his previous import levies.
The latest announcement from the US president has thrown the UK’s trade strategy into disarray, with questions arising over whether or not previous deals struck with the US still stand.
Asked whether UK plans to retaliate over Mr Trump’s latest tariff threat, Ms Phillipson told Sky News: "We always stand up for what's right for Britain. And I think the prime minister demonstrated that with the approach he took around Greenland.
“But the reality is that if you want to get things done, it's better to do that behind the scenes."
Pressed on whether we could respond with our own levies, the education secretary said: "In reality, you get more done when you have serious conversations, often not in front of cameras or out there in the public, but actually behind the scenes, working closely with between governments.
"And we do have a really strong relationship with the US, that is something that is not about one president or one prime minister.
"It's about that long standing and enduring relationship that is right for our country and is right for national security, and also really important at a time when we see significant global instability that we work together on those key questions like defence.”
She insisted that discussions are ongoing with the US, saying ministers want “the best possible deal for British businesses”.
Asked about the implications of the new rate for the UK, Ms Phillipson said: “We did secure a preferential deal.
“We, through the work that the prime minister has been leading in engaging with the US government and with President Trump, we would hope and expect that to continue, but these discussions are ongoing.
“This is an evolving situation. But of course, we want to get the best possible deal for British businesses.
“I understand the uncertainty it does cause for them, but they can be assured that we will always be working to make sure they get everything that they need.”
The US president’s “reciprocal tariffs”, imposed on most of the rest of the world last April under an emergency powers law were overturned by the US Supreme Court on Friday in a major blow to the president’s economic agenda.
On Friday, Mr Trump said he would replace the tariffs axed by the court with a 10 per cent tax on all goods entering the US. But in a post on Truth Social on Saturday he announced plans to increase this to 15 per cent.
But he doubled down on imposing levies following the decision, claiming the court “has been swayed by foreign interests” and other countries were “dancing in the streets, but they won’t be dancing for long, that I can assure you”.
The UK previously received the lowest tariff rate of 10 per cent, and a subsequent deal struck by Sir Keir Starmer and Mr Trump saw further carve-outs for Britain’s steel industry and car manufacturers.
But the US president’s latest tariff announcements raise questions over whether those deals still stand.
Officials are currently understood to believe it will not impact on most of Britain’s trade with America, including preferential deals on steel, cars and pharmaceuticals.
A UK government spokesperson said on Friday: “This is a matter for the US to determine but we will continue to support UK businesses as further details are announced.
“Under any scenario, we expect our privileged trading position with the US to continue and will work with the administration to understand how the ruling will affect tariffs for the UK and the rest of the world.”

The Nationalist Movement Party (MHP) has published a book compiling projects and institutional work carried out during the tenure of its leader Devlet Bahçeli, the party said in a written statement on Feb. 21.
Edited by MHP top member Büşra Cin, the book provides a comprehensive evaluation of initiatives implemented during Bahçeli’s leadership under five main headings.
"I express my deepest respect and gratitude to our Chairman Mr. Devlet Bahçeli... who resolutely carries the intellectual and institutional continuity of Turkish nationalism and who raised us with this consciousness," Cin said in the introduction.
The works included in the book, titled "Devlet Bahçeli Through His Works," are grouped under architectural and monumental works; education, culture and academic institutions; foundations, associations and institutional structures; social projects and solidarity efforts; and media and publishing.
MHP, a key partner in the ruling bloc, marked its 57th anniversary earlier this month with an event in Ankara.
The party was founded in 1969 under the leadership of Alparslan Türkeş as the successor to the Republican Peasants Nation Party. Following Türkeş’s death in 1997, Bahçeli assumed the party leadership.

Ukraine says 1 killed, 25 injured due to detonation of explosive devices in Lviv
Authorities define incident as ‘terrorist attack,’ none has yet taken responsibility
ISTANBUL
Ukraine said on Sunday that at least one person was killed, and 24 others were injured due to the detonation of explosive devices in the country’s western city of Lviv.
The Ukrainian National Police said in a statement that its hotline received a report of a break-in at a store in Lviv at around 12.30 am local time Sunday (2230GMT Saturday), and that an explosion occurred at the scene after a patrol crew arrived.
“It was previously established that improvised explosive devices detonated. A 23-year-old policewoman died as a result of the explosions,” the statement said, noting that 24 others were injured and another explosion was heard after a second patrol crew arrived at the scene.
The statement further said that an investigative group, as well as explosives technicians and other specialized services, worked at the scene and that those injured are being provided with the necessary medical assistance.
It defined the incident as a “terrorist attack,” adding that criminal proceedings have been initiated under the country’s Criminal Code and that a pre-trial investigation is being conducted by the regional anti-terrorism service.
Lviv Governor Maksym Kozytskyi wrote separately on Telegram that the perpetrators of the incident face up to 12 years in prison and confiscation of property, also defining the incident as a "terrorist attack."
Noting that some of those injured are in serious condition, he later reported that the number of injuries rose to 25.
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy later said through US social media company X that Interior Minister Ihor Klymenko reported to him on the detention of an individual suspected of carrying out the incident.
None has yet taken responsibility for the incident, and officials have not named a suspect.

A police officer was killed and dozens of other people were wounded after two blasts in Ukraine's major western city of Lviv, described by the authorities as a "terrorist act."
Early on February 22, Ukraine's national police said that an emergency call had been made shortly after midnight reporting a break-in at a local store.
It added that after a patrol unit arrived at the scene, an explosion occurred and was followed by a subsequent explosion when a second unit arrived.
"It has been preliminarily established that homemade explosive devices detonated," the police said on the Telegram.
Police said the blasts killed 23-year-old patrol officer Viktoria Shpylka, who began working in the region in 2023 and married another patrol officer in autumn 2025.
At least 25 other people were injured in the incident, 12 remain hospitalized. Speaking in a televised interview, Ukrainian Interior Minister Ihor Klymenko said three people were in "critical" condition.
Olha Pidtserkovna, an ER doctor at the local hospital, told RFE/RL's Ukrainian Service that these three people had been placed on ventilators.
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy called the incident a "terrorist attack" and said police had detained a couple of suspects. He later added that Ukrainian intelligence indicates "the Russians intend to continue carrying out such actions – attacks on Ukrainians," and called on local communities to be pro-active and vigilant against attempts by Russian agencies to recruit Ukrainians for acts against their country. According to Zelenskyy, "the perpetrators were recruited via Telegram."
Klymenko added that further "operational measures and investigative actions" were ongoing: "Authorities are identifying other individuals involved in committing this crime."
"Police officers respond to calls every day and night, never knowing what awaits them. But they rush to help because protecting people is their primary duty," Klymenko wrote on Telegram.
In later comments, he added there was "every reason to believe that the crime was carried out on Russia's orders."
Russia Attacks Ukraine With 50 Missiles
Meanwhile, the Russian military launched 50 missile and 297 drones in overnight attacks against Ukraine, the country's air force said on February 22.
Zelenskyy said seven regions were struck, adding attacks on the Kyiv region killed one person and injured at least 17 others, including four children.
According to rescuers, many injured people were pulled from under the rubble following the attack, while one man died from his injuries on the way to the hospital.
"The main target of the attack was the energy sector. Ordinary residential buildings were also damaged, and there is damage to the railway," Zelenskyy wrote on X.
Ukraine's power grid operator Ukrenergo reported Russian attacks have again prompted emergency power outages in a number of regions, including the capital.
Amid unusually cold winter temperatures, Russia has repeatedly hit power and heating facilities in Kyiv and throughout the country, leaving millions of Ukrainians struggling to stay warm and go about their lives.
The strikes came days after the latest round of US-brokered peace talks in Geneva ended with no breakthrough to end the Russian invasion, which on February 24 will reach the four-year mark.
While a new round of talks might happen again in the near future, Zelenskyy said that by massively attacking Ukraine Moscow continues "to invest in strikes more than in diplomacy."

Somaliland minister says US may access its minerals, military bases: Report
Minister of the presidency says the exclusive rights offered to the US are part of Somaliland’s push for global recognition.
Somaliland is prepared to grant the United States access to its mineral resources and military bases, a senior minister says, as the breakaway Somali region pursues international recognition.
“We are willing to give exclusive [access to our minerals] to the United States. Also, we are open to offer military bases to the United States,” Khadar Hussein Abdi, minister of the presidency, told the AFP news agency in an interview on Saturday.

“We believe that we will agree on something with the United States.”
Israel became the only country in the world to recognise Somaliland’s independence in December, something the territory has been seeking since declaring its autonomy from Somalia in 1991.
The region seceded from Somalia during a civil war that followed the more than two-decade hardline rule of President Siad Barre, whose forces devastated the north.
While large parts of Somalia descended into chaos, Somaliland stabilised by the late 1990s.
The US has yet to signal a major shift on the question of Somaliland.
But in August, US President Donald Trump, who had previously lobbed insults at Somalia and President Hassan Sheikh Mohamud, suggested he was preparing to move on the issue when asked about Somaliland during a White House news conference.
Somalia has denounced Israel’s recognition as an attack on its territorial integrity and unity, a position backed by most African and Arab leaders, and has urged Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to withdraw the recognition.
But Somaliland’s leader, Abdirahman Mohamed Abdullahi, known as Cirro, has welcomed Israel’s diplomatic move, praising Netanyahu for his “leadership and commitment to promoting stability and peace” in the region.
Cirro in recent weeks had already suggested granting Israel privileged access to its mineral resources. Meanwhile, Hussein Abdi said he could not rule out the possibility of also allowing Israel to set up a military presence.
Somaliland lies across the Gulf of Aden from Yemen, where Houthi rebels have often attacked Israeli assets to show solidarity with Palestinians.
Somaliland officials have said their natural resources include lithium, coltan and other sought-after materials although independent studies are lacking.

St Francis of Assisi’s bones go on public display for first time
The beloved medieval friar died 800 years ago
- Bookmark
- CommentsGo to comments
The bones of St Francis of Assisi, the revered medieval friar who inspired Pope Francis and generations of Christians, are going on public display for the first time.
But the month-long exhibition, organised by Franciscan friars to commemorate the 800th anniversary of the saint’s death, presents a “mixed blessing” for Assisi's Mayor Valter Stoppini and its residents.
Almost 400,000 have registered to venerate the relics; Mayor Stoppini anticipates the total could reach half a million before the bones return to their tomb on 22 March.
A dedicated force of 400 volunteers has been mobilised to guide visitors through the medieval city’s narrow, cobblestone streets to the Lower Basilica of St Francis, where the relics are housed in a bulletproof glass enclosure.
This influx will place immense strain on Assisi’s historic centre, with its confined, souvenir-lined thoroughfares and finite services.
While residents are accustomed to pilgrim surges, these are typically for shorter, more contained celebrations, making this extended period a test of local endurance.
“We’re used to this kind of event, but that lasts for one, two or three days,” Mayor Stoppini said.
“This is something prolonged, for a month, so I’m a bit worried, but calm.”
As it is, Assisi is one of the world’s most popular Christian pilgrimage destinations, located on a hill in the Umbrian countryside and built with a pink-tinged limestone that gives it its unique glow, especially at sunset.
Millions of pilgrims flock here each year thanks to the presence of St. Francis’ tomb and the spectacular basilica, decorated with Giotto’s frescoes illustrating the saint’s life, that rises over it.
St. Francis was born into a wealthy family in 1182, but renounced his wealth to live as a mendicant friar after receiving what he said was a vocation to rebuild and reform the church.
He is best known for his message of peace, his love of creation and attention to the poor -- teachings that strongly inspired Pope Francis, the first pope to name himself after the saint.
While St. Francis’ remains have been periodically inspected over the years by the Franciscan friars to ensure their conservation, this is the first time they are going on display publicly.
The decision to remove them from the crypt and welcome pilgrims for a month is a means to keep his message alive and give Christians a chance to pray before them, officials said.
Mayor Stoppini said a monthlong exhibition was the maximum he could ask of Assisi’s residents given the strain on the city that already saw a massive influx of pilgrims in 2025.
While Assisi is famous for St. Francis, a new saint is drawing a new generation of pilgrims: Carlo Acutis, who was canonised in 2025 by Pope Leo XIV as the Catholic Church’s first millennial saint.
Acutis, who died at age 15 of leukaemia, is buried in a different Assisi basilica, but his wild popularity, especially among young Latin Americans, has turned Assisi into a new religious destination for Catholic youth groups visiting Italy.
“When we go out onto the piazza, we find many people who ask us ‘Where’s Carlo? Where’s Carlo?'” said Brother Marco Moroni, the custodian of the convent of St. Francis.
Last year alone saw a 30 per cent increase in the number of pilgrims, though that was likely due to both Acutis’ canonisation and the Holy Year, which brought some 33 million pilgrims to Rome, many of whom also travelled on to Assisi.
“The beautiful thing is that saints don’t go to war against one another, thanks be to God,” he added.
“Many who come to the basilica go to see Carlo, and many who go to Carlo Acutis come to the basilica, creating an osmosis and a growing movement that does though create some problems for the city.”
For the souvenir merchants of Assisi, who make their living off religious tourists and pilgrims who flock to the picturesque town, a monthlong event is welcome.
“Other people will see what we see every day,” with Francis’ spirit imbuing the town, said shopkeeper Arianna Catarinelli, who works in a souvenir shop in the main drag of town leading to the basilica.
The shop features Assisi-emblazoned sweatshirts, pens featuring Acutis’ photo, St. Francis-themed coffee mugs and neon rosaries.
“For residents, finding parking isn’t easy. But for businesses, I think it’s positive that there are so many people,” she said.
To cope with the influx, city hall has created new parking lots outside the city center and runs a shuttle service to bring people into town.
Assisi resident Riccardo Bacconi, who works in a local bank branch, said he hoped the extra parking lots will be the legacy of the exposition that will continue to make life easier for locals.
Speaking after he went for a morning run Saturday, Mr Bacconi acknowledged the town lives from tourism and anyone who chooses to live here has to put up with it.
“I don’t judge it negatively, economically it’s important,” he said. “There are more advantages than disadvantages.”

US tax yo-yo blurs situation for Swiss companies

US tax yo-yo blurs situation for Swiss companies
US President Donald Trump's decision to impose a 15% global tariff is not fundamentally affecting Swiss exporters, according to some analysts. Others believe that companies are still in limbo.
+Get the most important news from Switzerland in your inbox
Economics Minister Guy Parmelin, who holds the rotating Swiss presidency this year, “takes note of the decision of the Supreme Court of the United States and the statements of the American President” and “does not comment on them”. The government said it was analysing the developments and their consequences and would communicate any decisions “in due course”.
The economics ministry told the Swiss News Agency Keystone-ATS on Saturday that the concrete consequences and developments of the next few days were being “analysed on an ongoing basis and as quickly as possible”. Asked whether the new rate would come into effect quickly, the department would not comment.
Bern maintains its line
On the substance, Bern has not changed its line in the current discussions with Washington. “The main objective of the current negotiations has always been, from the outset, to conclude a legally binding agreement designed to offer Swiss businesses the greatest possible legal certainty”, the economics ministry said.
+ Trump repeats claim that Switzerland ‘rips off the United States’
“Switzerland is taking account of current developments in the negotiations and is aiming for a result that achieves this objective, irrespective of legal and political developments in the United States”, it added. The authorities are not saying whether the talks could go beyond the end of March deadline.
After the Supreme Court invalidated the legal basis for the previous tariffs, Trump invoked another provision, section 122, to introduce a global tariff of up to 15% for 150 days, Rahul Sahgal, director of the Swiss-US Chamber of Commerce, told Keystone-ATS. Trump initially announced a 10% tariff, before raising it to 15% late on Saturday.
For Swiss companies, the practical effect would remain limited. “I don’t think it will fundamentally change things for most companies”, said Sahgal, referring to adjustments of “two or three percentage points” depending on the sector. The exceptions for pharmaceuticals and gold would remain in place.
In his view, the positive reaction of the markets was mainly due to the institutional signal sent out by the US courts. “The Supreme Court’s decision clearly shows that the rule of law and the separation of powers are working in the United States”, he said, referring to “very good news”.
The United States also remains a key market for Swiss companies. A survey carried out before the introduction of the new tariffs already indicated that almost $200 billion (CHF155 billion) of investment was planned across the Atlantic. For Rahul Sahgal, however, transatlantic trade is entering “a new period” marked by customs duties that are set to last.
“We saw this with the 50% tariffs on steel and aluminium introduced during Trump’s first term between 2017 and 2021. At the time, we had hoped that they would disappear with the arrival of Joe Biden, but they were maintained. So I think we’ve entered a new period.”
+ How US tariffs affected the Swiss economy
Blur on the effective rate
Other experts are more cautious. Swiss companies “don’t know what rate they will be charged”, said John Plassard, head of investment strategy at Cité Gestion, on Swiss public radio RTS. The announced 10% (15% by the end of Saturday) constitutes “a new general base”, but it is not clear whether it replaces the previous 15% or whether it is in addition to it.
Philippe Cordonnier, head of Swissmem in French-speaking Switzerland, was also interviewed by RTS and agreed that the Supreme Court had not given “all the keys” to interpretation. In his view, it is “absolutely essential” to reach a negotiated agreement between Bern and Washington that provides a stable basis for the long term.
In this context, a Swiss parliamentary delegation will visit the United States from Monday to Friday to discuss tariffs and trade policy. This trip has been planned for a long time, explained Andrea Anastasi, head of international affairs. The United States is Switzerland’s largest export market, with more than CHF1 billion ($1.28 billion) worth of goods being exported every week by 2025, according to the delegation.

LONDON, February 22. /TASS/. Iran will not hand over control of its oil and mineral resources to the United States, a senior Iranian official told Reuters.
He also stressed that American companies can always participate in the development of Iranian oil and gas fields as contractors.
Tehran’s right to enrich uranium under the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons should be recognized, the Iranian official noted.

Greenland does not need Trump’s ‘great hospital boat’, Denmark says
Greenland does not need healthcare assistance from foreign countries, Denmark's Defence Minister Troels Lund Poulsen said Sunday after President Donald Trump announced the US was sending a "great hospital boat" to tend to the "many" sick people "not being taken care of" in the autonomous Danish territory that Trump covets.
Greenland does not need medical assistance from other countries, Denmark's defence minister said Sunday, after US President Donald Trump claimed he was sending a hospital ship to the autonomous Danish territory that he covets.
"The Greenlandic population receives the healthcare it needs. They receive it either in Greenland, or, if they require specialised treatment, they receive it in Denmark. So it's not as if there's a need for a special healthcare initiative in Greenland," Defence Minister Troels Lund Poulsen told Danish broadcaster DR.
In Greenland as in Denmark access to healthcare is free. There are five regional hospitals across the vast Arctic island, with the Nuuk hospital serving patients from all over the territory.
The Greenlandic local government signed an agreement with Copenhagen in early February to improve the treatment of Greenlandic patients in Danish hospitals.
Trump on Saturday posted on his social media platform Truth Social that "we are going to send a great hospital boat to Greenland to take care of the many people who are sick, and not being taken care of there".
"It's on the way!!!" he added.

Trump has said the US must control Greenland to ensure its security, though he has backed off earlier threats to seize it after striking a "framework" deal with NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte to ensure greater US influence.
Lund Poulsen told DR he was not aware of the hospital ship's possible arrival.
"Trump is constantly tweeting about Greenland. So this is undoubtedly an expression of the new normal that has taken hold in international politics," he said.
Earlier Saturday, Denmark's Arctic Command announced that it had evacuated a crew member of a US submarine off the coast of Nuuk after the sailor requested urgent medical attention.

Iran and US views on sanctions relief differ, Iranian official tells Reuters

Tehran is ready for nuclear concessions if US meets demands, Iranian official says
Sign up now: Get ST's newsletters delivered to your inbox
DUBAI, Feb 22 - Iran has indicated it is prepared to make concessions on its nuclear programme in talks with the U.S. in return for the lifting of sanctions and recognition of its right to enrich uranium, as it seeks to avert a U.S. attack.
Both sides remain sharply divided -- even over the scope and sequencing of relief from crippling U.S. sanctions -- following two rounds of talks, a senior Iranian official told Reuters.
However, Reuters is reporting for the first time that Iran is offering fresh concessions since their talks ended last week, when the sides appeared far apart and heading closer to military conflict. Analysts say the move suggests Tehran is trying to keep diplomacy alive and stave off a major U.S. strike.
The official said Tehran would seriously consider a combination of sending half of its most highly enriched uranium abroad, diluting the rest and taking part in creating a regional enrichment consortium - an idea periodically raised in years of Iran-linked diplomacy.
Iran would do this in return for U.S. recognition of Iran's right to "peaceful nuclear enrichment" under a deal that would also include lifting economic sanctions, the official said.
In addition, Iran has offered openings for U.S. companies to participate as contractors in Iran's large oil and gas industries, the official said, in negotiations to resolve decades of dispute over Tehran's nuclear activities.
"Within the economic package under negotiation, the United States has also been offered opportunities for serious investment and tangible economic interests in Iran's oil industry," the official said.
The White House did not respond immediately to queries on the issue.
Washington views enrichment inside Iran as a potential pathway to nuclear weapons. Iran denies seeking nuclear weapons and wants its right to enrich uranium to be recognised.
Iran and the United States resumed negotiations earlier this month as the U.S. builds up its military capability in the Middle East. Iran has threatened to strike U.S. bases in the region if it is attacked.
The Iranian official said the most recent discussions underscored the gap between the two sides, but stressed that "the possibility of reaching an interim agreement exists" as negotiations continue.
IRAN SEEKS 'LOGICAL TIMETABLE' FOR LIFTING SANCTIONS
"The last round of talks showed that U.S. ideas regarding the scope and mechanism of sanctions relief differ from Iran's demands. Both sides need to reach a logical timetable for lifting sanctions," the official said.
"This roadmap must be reasonable and based on mutual interests."
Iran's Foreign Minister Abbas Araqchi said on Sunday he expects to meet with U.S. President Donald Trump's special envoy Steve Witkoff in Geneva on Thursday, adding there is still "a good chance" of a diplomatic solution.
Araqchi said on Friday that he expected to have a draft counterproposal ready within days, while Trump said he was considering limited military strikes.
Citing officials on both sides and diplomats across the Gulf and Europe, Reuters reported on Friday that Tehran and Washington are sliding rapidly towards military conflict as hopes fade for a diplomatic settlement.
On Sunday, Witkoff said the president was curious as to why Iran has not yet "capitulated" and agreed to curb its nuclear programme.
"Why, under this pressure, with the amount of seapower and naval power over there, why haven't they come to us and said, 'We profess we don't want a weapon, so here's what we're prepared to do'? And yet it's sort of hard to get them to that place," Witkoff said on Fox News.
READINESS TO COMPROMISE ON NUCLEAR WORK
Behnam Ben Taleblu, senior director of the Iran program at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, said Iran's leadership is seeking to buy time via the talks.
"Iran will use that time for various reasons, including to avoid a strike and to harden nuclear, missile, and military facilities," he said.
While rejecting a U.S. demand for "zero enrichment" - a major sticking point in past negotiations - Tehran has signalled its readiness to compromise on its nuclear work.
Washington has also demanded that Iran relinquish its stockpile of highly enriched uranium (HEU). The International Atomic Energy Agency last year estimated that stockpile at more than 440 kg of uranium enriched to up to 60% fissile purity, a small step away from the 90% that is considered weapons grade.
Ali Larijani, a close adviser to Iran's supreme leader, told Al Jazeera TV that Iran was ready to allow extensive IAEA monitoring to prove it is not seeking nuclear weapons.
The agency has been calling on Iran for months to allow for inspection of three nuclear sites that were struck by the U.S. in June last year at the close of a 12-day Israeli bombing campaign. Since then, Tehran has said its uranium enrichment work has stopped.
Satellite images show that Iran has advanced work at a location reportedly bombed by Israel last year, recently building a concrete shield over a new facility at a sensitive military site and covering it in soil, experts say.
BENEFITS FOR BOTH SIDES
Among U.S. demands are restrictions on Tehran's long-range ballistic missiles and an end to its support for regional proxy groups.
Iran has flatly rejected discussing its missiles, while sources have told Reuters, without elaborating, that "the issue of regional proxies is not a red line for Tehran".
Iranian authorities have said that a diplomatic solution would provide economic benefits for both Tehran and Washington.
The Iranian official said Tehran would not hand over control of its oil and mineral resources.
"Ultimately, the U.S. can be an economic partner for Iran, nothing more. American companies can always participate as contractors in Iran's oil and gas fields." REUTERS

Türkiye introduces controlled mooring to protect Göcek’s fragile bays

19:30:54 KST

Authorities have launched a new, reservation-based mooring system in Göcek, one of the country’s most popular yachting destinations in the southwestern province of Muğla, aiming to reduce pressure on fragile marine ecosystems caused by heavy summer boat traffic.
Acting on the instructions of the Environment Minister Murat Kurum, the Türkiye Environment Agency (TÜÇA) has introduced a mooring buoy system project, ending the long-standing “first come, first anchor” practice.
Under the new system, yachts and boats must reserve mooring points in advance via a formal website or mobile app.
Vessels will be allowed to stay a maximum of three days in a single bay and 11 days across all Göcek bays combined.
Daily mooring fees will range from 500 to 3,000 Turkish Liras ($11 to $68), depending on vessel size.
TÜÇA President Nurullah Öztürk emphasized that the project is non-profit and ecosystem-focused, noting that all revenue will be reinvested into protecting Türkiye’s seas and coastal environments.
Officials say the mooring buoy management system is set to expand to other high-traffic coastal areas in the future.
Göcek hosts six marinas with a total capacity of around 850 yachts, yet during peak summer months the number of boats in the area can reach nearly 2,000 per day.
Despite having a permanent population of only about 6,500 residents, the neighborhood plays a key role in Türkiye’s tourism sector, drawing around 3.7 million foreign visitors annually.
The area is home to around 1,500 marine species, including the endangered Mediterranean monk seal, groupers and vital Posidonia oceanica seagrass meadows.
Scientists emphasize that the system must be closely monitored, particularly to ensure the protection of these seagrass meadows.

Gordon Ramsay brutally shut down by Charli xcx on The Graham Norton Show
Chef met his match in ‘Brat’ star on BBC series

Gordon Ramsay got a taste of his own medicine after being brutally shut down by Charli xcx during an appearance on The Graham Norton Show.
The hot-headed chef, 59, was on the BBC series to promote his new Netflix documentary, when he revealed how singer and actor Charli xcx’s hit record Brat had affected the behaviour of his daughters.
When Norton asked how Megan, 27, Holly, 26, and Tilly, 24, had channelled the energy of the anarchic album, Ramsay said they developed “attitude in abundance” as well as “loud volume”.
He added: “I think the older you get, the lower you want the volume.”
Charli xcx, real name Charlotte Aitchison, replied to the chef, known for his sweary behaviour on reality shows Hell’s Kitchen and Ramsay’s Kitchen Nightmares: “I mean, I feel like they could have got that from you, though, let’s be honest.”
Ramsay burst into laughter, saying: “You’re right,” with Norton quipping: “It’s been Brat kitchen, for some time.”
Brat was a worldwide success upon its release in June 2024, with the acclaim surrounding it spawning the viral cultural movement “Brat Summer”.
It garnered nine Grammy nominations, winning three, with Charli xcx winning five Brits, including songwriter of the year, album of the year, artist of the year, dance act, and song of the year for a version of her track “Guess” featuring Billie Eilish.
However, the 33-year-old star, who appears in new film The Moment, believed the album would mark the end of her career. She told Gwyneth Paltrow on the actor’s Goop podcast in November 2025: "I actually made this record being like, ‘OK, I’m just going to do this one for me. Maybe I’m going to get dropped by my label and that’s fine’. That was kind of the headspace that I was in."
Her follow-up record, the soundtrack to Emerald Fennell’s film Wuthering Heights, is currently No 1 in the album charts.
Meanwhile, Ramsay is the centre of Netflix documentary Being Gordon Ramsay, a six-part series following his family life as he opens a new restaurant in London.
Reviews have been lukewarm for the show, with The Independent's Nick Hilton criticising it for functioning largely as an advertisement for his new venture, rather than a career retrospective.
“Ramsay is one of Britain’s best telly exports, and he deserves to be making something better than his own propaganda,” Hilton wrote. “Being Gordon Ramsay is an easy watch, but it has little to say about food, little to say about the restaurant business, and little to say about the man himself.”

Geordie Greig: Labour’s SEND reforms are ‘really about money’
Bridget Phillipson speaks passionately about her desire to improve support for children with special educational needs and disabilities (SEND), but her proposed reforms are "really about money," Geordie Greig told Laura Kuennsberg on Sunday (22 February).
This week, Labour is due to publish its plans to reform the SEND system. Children will reportedly have plans setting out their right to support reviewed under changes to be set out by the education secretary.
When asked whether Ms Phillipson would be able to get her plans past Labour MPs, who have "inboxes pouring with messages from families desperately worried about the situation," The Independent editor-in-chief said: "Is she really going to guarantee that these children are not going to be left without the necessary help?
"That is a crucial question for Labour MPs who will be circling this. Are we going to see another U-turn?"

Greenland says 'no thanks' to Trump's 'great hospital boat'
February 22, 2026US President Donald Trump said Saturday he was sending a hospital boat to Greenland, a semi-autonomous Danish territory.
He said the boat would treat many "sick" people in the island.
Trump did not provide any additional details about which people he was referring to or how many people the boat would help.
"We are going to send a great hospital boat to Greenland to take care of the many people who are sick, and not being taken care of there," Trump wrote on his Truth Social platform.
"It's on the way!!!" he added.
What did Greenland and Denmark say about the boat?
Greenlandic Prime Minister Jens-Frederik Nielsen said "no thanks" in response to Trump's statement on Sunday.
"President Trump's idea of sending an American hospital ship here to Greenland has been noted. But we have a public health care system where treatment is free for citizens. It is a deliberate choice," Greenland's premier said in a social media post.
Nielsen said Greenland was open to cooperation with the United States, but criticized the US president's chosen means of communication.
"Talk to us instead of just making more or less random outbursts on social media," Nielsen said.
Meanwhile, Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen said in an Instagram post she was "happy to live in a country where access to health care is free and equal for all. Where insurance or wealth does not determine whether one receives dignified treatment."
There are five regional hospitals in Greenland, with a hospital in the capital, Nuuk, serving patients from across the territory.
Access to health care is free in Greenland and in Denmark.
Denmark's defense minister also stressed that Greenland does not need medical assistance from other countries in response to Trump's statement.
"The Greenlandic population receives the health care it needs. They receive it either in Greenland, or, if they require specialized treatment, they receive it in Denmark," Defense Minister Troels Lund Poulsen told Danish broadcaster DR. "So it's not as if there's a need for a special health care initiative in Greenland."
Lund Poulsen told DR he was not aware of the US hospital ship's possible arrival.
"Trump is constantly tweeting about Greenland. So this is undoubtedly an expression of the new normal that has taken hold in international politics," he said.
Danish Arctic Command evacuates US submariner
Trump's post on Saturday came after Denmark's Joint Arctic Command said it had evacuated a US submarine crew member who required urgent medical attention.
The submarine was in Greenland's waters, seven nautical miles outside of Nuuk.
It was not clear if Trump's post about sending a hospital ship was connected in any way to the evacuation.
Trump's Greenland push ratchets up tensions
The announcement, however, gains significance amid a deep rift between the Trump administration and Europe over control of the territory.
Greenland, the world's largest island, is a mineral-rich, strategically important Arctic territory. It is self-governing but remains part of the Kingdom of Denmark.
Trump says the island is crucial for US national security and that he wants to acquire it. He previously even threatened to seize it by force if necessary.
The rhetoric has ratcheted up tensions between Washington and its European NATO allies.
Greenland, Denmark and the US have engaged in talks to resolve the situation.
Trump dialed back his threats after reaching a "framework" deal with NATO chief Mark Rutte to ensure greater US influence over Greenland.
Earlier this week, Denmark's King Frederik X visited Greenland.
It was his second visit to the island in a year, an attempt to demonstrate unity with the territory in the face of Trump's push to acquire control of the vast island.

US ambassador’s remarks on Israel cause uproar among regional states

Arab and Islamic countries issued a joint condemnation on Feb. 22 of remarks by U.S. ambassador to Israel Mike Huckabee, who suggested Israel had a biblical right to a vast swath of the Middle East.
Huckabee, a former Baptist minister and a fervent Israel supporter, was speaking on the podcast of far-right commentator and Israel critic Tucker Carlson.
In an episode released on Feb. 20, Carlson pushed Huckabee on the meaning of a biblical verse sometimes interpreted as saying that Israel is entitled to the land between the river Nile in Egypt and the Euphrates in Syria and Iraq.
In response, Huckabee said, "It would be fine if they took it all."
When pressed, however, he continued that Israel was "not asking to take all of that", adding: "It was somewhat of a hyperbolic statement."
The backlash widened sharply on Feb. 22 as more than a dozen Arab and Islamic governments, alongside three major regional organizations, issued a joint statement denouncing the US diplomat's comments as "dangerous and inflammatory.”
The statement, released by the United Arab Emirates' Foreign Ministry, was signed by Türkiye, Egypt, Jordan, Indonesia, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Kuwait, Oman, Bahrain, Lebanon, Syria and the State of Palestine, as well as the Organization of Islamic Cooperation, the Arab League and the Gulf Cooperation Council.
They said the comments contravene the U.N. Charter and efforts to de-escalate the Gaza war and advance a political horizon for a comprehensive settlement.
Iran joined the chorus with its Foreign Ministry accusing Huckabee on X of revealing "American active complicity" in what it called Israel's "expansionist wars of aggression" against Palestinians.
Earlier, several Arab states had issued unilateral condemnations.
On Feb. 21, Huckabee published two posts on X further clarifying his position on other topics touched upon in the interview, but did not address his remark about the biblical verse.
The speaker of the Israeli parliament, Amir Ohana, praised Huckabee on X for his general pro-Israel stance in the interview, and accused Carlson of "falsehoods and manipulations.”
Carlson has recently found himself facing accusations of antisemitism, particularly following a lengthy, uncritical interview with self-described white nationalist Nick Fuentes, a figure who has praised Hitler, denied the Holocaust and branded American Jews as disloyal.

France’s Macron asks Trump to lift sanctions on European officials
Sign up now: Get ST's newsletters delivered to your inbox
PARIS – French President Emmanuel Macron has written to Mr Donald Trump asking his US counterpart to lift sanctions imposed on officials, including former European Union commissioner Thierry Breton.
The United States placed visa bans on Mr Breton
“The sanctions adopted against Thierry Breton undermine European regulatory autonomy and are, moreover, based on erroneous analysis: European digital regulation has no extraterritorial reach and applies without discrimination, within European territory, to all companies concerned,” Mr Macron said, according to extracts of the letter published on Feb 22 by La Tribune Dimanche.
A spokesman for the Elysee palace confirmed the letter.
Mr Macron is preparing to challenge Mr Trump over social media and free speech by making it a central priority for the French presidency of the Group of Seven in 2026. He is pushing for restrictions on children accessing social media, saying last week he will discuss the issue directly with US president.
In the letter to Mr Trump, Mr Macron also asked for the lifting of sanctions on a French magistrate over the International Criminal Court (ICC) issuing arrest warrants for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and the nation’s former defence minister.
“The sanctions adopted against Nicolas Guillou undermine the principle of judicial independence and the mandate of the ICC,” Mr Macron said in the letter. BLOOMBERG

Russian missile and drone barrage hits Kyiv suburbs, killing 1
Russian missile and drone barrage hits Kyiv suburbs, killing 1
KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — Russia attacked Ukraine with a barrage of missiles and drones, killing one person in the Kyiv region, Ukraine’s Emergency Service said on Sunday.
Another eight people, including a child, were rescued from under the rubble of destroyed buildings, the service said.
The attack caused damage and fires to erupt in five districts in the suburbs of Kyiv. In the village of Putrivka in the Fastiv district, emergency first responders worked on saving people buried under debris.
Russia also struck energy infrastructure in Ukraine’s southern Odesa region, resulting in significant fires, which were later extinguished, the emergency service said.
During the four years since Russia launched an all-out war on its neighbor, and despite a new push over the past year in U.S.-led peace efforts, Ukrainian civilians have endured constant aerial attacks. Russia has also ramped up attacks targeting the country’s energy grid, leaving Ukrainian civilians without electricity and heating amid harsh winter conditions.
Ukraine’s Air Force said Sunday that Russia’s overnight barrage had included 297 drones and 50 missiles of various types, of which 274 drones and 33 missiles were shot down or neutralized. Of those remaining, 14 missiles and 23 drones struck 14 locations, it said. Three missiles were unaccounted for.
Separately, an explosion in Ukraine’s western city of Lviv killed one person and injured 25, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said in a Telegram post on Sunday. One person has been arrested over the incident, which is unrelated to Russia’s aerial attack on Ukraine.
Meanwhile, Russian air defenses destroyed 86 Ukrainian drones overnight, Russia’s Ministry of Defense said Sunday.
A security guard was injured and a fuel tank set alight when two Ukrainian drones hit an oil depot in the Russian-occupied Ukrainian city of Luhansk, Moscow-installed leader Leonid Pasechnik said.

Austrian climber convicted after girlfriend froze to death on Alps peak

19:22:24 KST

An Austrian court has convicted mountaineer Thomas Plamberger of aggravated negligent homicide in the death of his partner, Kerstin Gärtner, who died of hypothermia after being left near the summit of Austria’s highest mountain last year.
The verdict, delivered over the weekend, brings at least a temporary close to a case that has stirred debate in the climbing community and could influence future rulings on criminal responsibility for decisions made in extreme alpine conditions.
The tragedy occurred on Jan. 18-19, 2025, on Grossglockner, which rises 3,798 meters (12,461 feet) above sea level. Prosecutors argued that Plamberger, 39, the more experienced climber who planned the ascent, acted as the “responsible guide” and committed a series of fatal errors.
According to the prosecution, Gärtner, 33, had never undertaken such a long, difficult and high-altitude winter climb. Despite harsh weather conditions, the pair continued the ascent. Grossglockner is considered one of the most challenging climbs in the Austrian Alps and requires advanced equipment, including gear suitable for glacier travel.
Prosecutors said the couple set out two hours later than recommended, did not carry sufficient emergency overnight gear and that Plamberger allowed Gärtner to wear soft snowboard boots, which are not suitable for high-altitude mixed terrain.
When they encountered winds of 74 kph (46 mph) and temperatures of −8°C (17.6°F) — with wind chill making it feel closer to −20°C (−4°F) — prosecutors argued they should have turned back. Instead, they pressed on.
By 1:30 p.m., they had passed the route’s “point of no return,” beyond which retreat becomes extremely difficult. According to the timeline presented in court, the couple became stranded around 8:50 p.m. Prosecutors said Plamberger did not call police or send a distress signal even as a helicopter circled the area around 10:50 p.m. Webcams monitoring the route captured the lights from their headlamps during the ascent.
Plamberger rejected the allegations, saying the trip was planned jointly and that both had sufficient experience and proper equipment. He said that even in the early night hours they felt strong and did not sense distress.
He testified that only close to midnight did Gärtner’s condition deteriorate dramatically, showing signs of severe exhaustion, at which point it was too late to turn back. At 12:35 a.m., they called the police station responsible for mountain rescue. His lawyer said he requested assistance, but police stated that after the call, Plamberger switched his phone to silent mode and did not answer further calls.
According to prosecutors, the pair continued upward, but about 50 meters (164 feet) below the summit Gärtner could no longer move. At around 2 a.m., Plamberger left her alone and headed to the nearest hut to seek help, without moving her to shelter from the wind, covering her with an emergency blanket or using other equipment to protect her from the cold.
By then, she was reportedly suffering from hypothermia and disorientation. Webcams captured him descending alone. It was not until 3:30 a.m. that he again contacted emergency services to report the situation. By that time, prosecutors said, Gärtner had died of hypothermia.
Given the severe winds, no helicopter could have landed on the mountain that night, meaning staying with her may have been the safer course, authorities said. Plamberger returned to the spot about six and a half hours later and found her dead.
Investigators examined the couple’s mobile phones, sports watches and photographs from the climb, which helped them conclude that Plamberger bore responsibility for her death.
The court opted not to impose the maximum sentence of up to three years in prison. Instead, it handed down a five-month suspended sentence and a fine of 9,600 euros ($10,400). In a statement to the BBC, which followed the case, the court said it took into account that Plamberger had no prior criminal record and had lost someone close to him. It also cited the intense public debate surrounding the case.
Judge Norbert Hofer, himself an experienced mountaineer who works with Tyrol mountain rescue teams, said Plamberger was an excellent climber, while Gärtner was far less experienced. He ruled that the climb should have been canceled given her limited winter experience and that Plamberger’s judgment was flawed.
However, Hofer stressed that he did not believe Plamberger abandoned her intentionally. “I do not see you as a murderer. I do not see you as a cold-hearted person,” he said.
During the trial, Plamberger’s former partner, Andrea, testified that he had left her alone during a climb on the same mountain in 2023. She said she reached her physical limit, felt dizzy and that her headlamp went out, and that she cried and screamed after he disappeared from view while walking ahead.
Judge Hofer questioned Plamberger’s claim that he left Gärtner lying on the slope, noting that rescue photographs suggested she may have fallen. According to testimony, her body was found hanging upside down from a cliff.
“We were stunned that she remained in that position,” one rescuer told the court. “If the wind had been just slightly stronger, she would have fallen over the southern slope.”
Plamberger told the court he deeply regretted what happened and said he loved Gärtner. He described her as very athletic and said they had planned the trip together.
Gärtner’s parents also testified that she had been active in mountaineering since 2020. Her mother, Gertrud, defended Plamberger before the trial, saying it angered her that her daughter was portrayed as naive.
“They always made decisions together,” she told the German newspaper Die Zeit. “If Kerstin had not agreed, they would not have gone on the climb, or her boyfriend would have gone alone. I do not want to accuse him. Many people blaming him have never been in such a situation. It is easy to be a hero from your comfortable home.”
Describing her daughter, Gertrud said: “Kerstin loved to test her limits. But above all, she was a responsible person who loved nature. For her, the mountains were not a place of recklessness but of calm, mindfulness and respect. The fact that she lost her life in the place where she felt most alive is almost incomprehensible to me. I miss her terribly.”

Iranian students stage protests as Khamenei drafts emergency plans

Iranian students chanted anti-government slogans and scuffled with counter-protesters on the first day of the new academic term, with Iranian Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei reportedly preparing for assassination scenarios and naming multiple layers of successors for key military and political posts.
The gatherings at universities, which were reported by both local and diaspora media outlets, followed a mass protest movement that was met with a government crackdown last month that left thousands of dead.
Videos geolocated by AFP to Tehran's top engineering university showed fights breaking out in a crowd on Saturday as people shouted "bi sharaf,” or "disgraceful" in Farsi.
Footage posted by the Persian-language TV channel Iran International also showed a large crowd chanting anti-government slogans at Sharif University of Technology.
The Fars news agency later said there were reports of injuries in scuffles at the institution.
The unrest first broke out in December 2025 over prolonged financial strain, but exploded into mass anti-government protests that were suppressed in a violent crackdown by security forces.
Ever since the initial wave of protests, the United States and Iran have been trading threats of military action.
U.S. President Donald Trump sent the aircraft carrier USS Abraham Lincoln to the region, while a second, the USS Gerald R Ford, is en route via the Mediterranean.
Meanwhile, the New York Times reported that Khamenei has instructed top aides on how to proceed if he is killed in possible strikes by United States or Israel
Khamenei promoted Ali Larijani — a longtime loyalist, former Revolutionary Guards commander and veteran political figure — into a pivotal governing position, effectively putting him in charge of day-to-day state management, the report stated.
Khamenei also designated several backup successors for key political and military roles and granted a close inner circle authority to act if communications collapse or he is assassinated.
Although Larijani is not viewed as a likely future supreme leader because he is not a senior Shiite cleric, he is described as one of Khamenei’s most trusted crisis operators.
Trump questioning why Iran has not 'capitulated'
Meanwhile, U.S. envoy Steve Witkoff said that Trump is questioning why Iran has not "capitulated" in the face of Washington's military build-up aimed at pressuring them into a nuclear deal.
The United States and Iran this week resumed Oman-mediated talks in Geneva aimed at averting the possibility of military action.
In a Fox News interview, Witkoff said the president was "curious" about Iran's position after he had warned them of severe consequences in the event they failed to strike a deal.
"I don't want to use the word 'frustrated,' because he understands he has plenty of alternatives, but he's curious as to why they haven't... I don't want to use the word 'capitulated,' but why they haven't capitulated," he said.
"Why, under this pressure, with the amount of seapower and naval power over there, why haven't they come to us and said, 'We profess we don't want a weapon, so here's what we're prepared to do'? And yet it's sort of hard to get them to that place."

Russian missile barrage slams Ukraine ahead of war anniversary

Russia launched a barrage of missiles and drones at targets across Ukraine Sunday, striking energy and rail infrastructure as well as residential buildings just two days before the fourth anniversary of the invasion.
There were reports of a series of blasts in Kyiv starting at around 4 a.m. (2 a.m. GMT), shortly after an air raid alert was issued, with the air force later widening the alert nationwide, citing the threat of missiles.
"Moscow continues to invest in strikes more than in diplomacy," Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy commented on the attack on social media, saying that Russia launched about 50 missiles and 300 drones overnight.
"The main target of the attack was the energy sector. Ordinary residential buildings were also damaged, and there is damage to the railway."
One man was killed and a dozen more people were wounded, among them four children, in and around Kyiv, Ukraine's national police said.
The Agence France-Presse (AFP) reported rescuers sifting through the debris of a largely destroyed two-storey house in Sofiivska Borshchagivka in the Kyiv region.
Temperatures had plunged to nearly minus 10 degrees Celsius (14 degrees Fahrenheit) when the capital was struck, with emergency services deployed across the city.
The Ukrainian capital, regularly targeted by Russian missile and drone attacks since the start of the invasion on Feb. 24, 2022, has faced waves of overnight strikes in recent weeks as Moscow has intensified its winter assaults.
The Russian army said it had carried out a mass strike targeting facilities used by Ukraine's military, saying all targets were hit, in a standard comment for such attacks.
Authorities in Russia's western Belgorod region said one man died after a Ukrainian drone strike.
The bombardment, which included ballistic and cruise missiles, prompted heightened vigilance across Ukraine, all the way to the western border.
Ukraine's Energy Ministry said consumers in six eastern and southeastern regions were without power after the strikes.
Poland's Operational Command said early Sunday it was scrambling jets after detecting "long-range aviation of the Russian Federation conducting strikes on the territory of Ukraine."
In a separate attack, an explosion rocked a store in central Lviv, a western city near the Polish border, far from the front line that is largely spared the worst of the conflict.
Explosions ripped through a central shopping street at around midnight, killing a policewoman and wounding 25 people after officers responded to a reported break-in.
Hours later, law enforcement said it had detained a Ukrainian woman suspected of carrying out the bomb attack, without providing any further details and saying that an investigation was ongoing.
"This is clearly an act of terrorism," Mayor Andriy Sadovyi said of the nighttime assault.
Ukraine will mark four years since Russia's assault on Feb. 24, 2022, a war that has shattered towns, uprooted millions and killed large numbers on both sides.
Moscow occupies close to a fifth of Ukrainian territory and continues to grind forward, especially in the eastern Donbas region, despite heavy losses and repeated Ukrainian strikes on logistics.
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky told AFP on Friday that Ukraine was "definitely not losing" the war and that victory remained the goal.
He said Ukrainian forces had clawed back about 300 square kilometers (116 square miles) of territory in recent counterattacks, gains AFP could not immediately verify.
If confirmed, they would be Kyiv's most significant advances since 2023.
The United States is pushing both sides to end the war, brokering several rounds of talks in recent weeks without a clear breakthrough.

Flexible EV charging pricing to cut costs and boost investment

19:14:26 KST

Türkiye's shift to flexible pricing in electric vehicle charging services is set to lower user costs, following regulatory changes adopted by the Energy Market Regulatory Authority (EPDK).
Under amendments to the Electric Vehicle Charging Service Regulation, operators will be allowed to introduce dynamic pricing models aimed at encouraging consumption during off-peak hours and improving infrastructure efficiency.
The move is designed to boost competition in the EV charging market while ensuring more efficient use of existing grid capacity. A draft of the regulation had been announced on Dec. 9, 2025.
The updated framework requires operators to apply a single price for AC (slow) and DC (fast) charging units, simplifying tariff structures and making fees more transparent and comparable for users.
From July 1, all new DC charging units installed on highways and state roads will be required to integrate credit card payment systems, a step aimed at easing access and streamlining transactions.
The regulation also allows operators to offer discounts at specific hours or locations, enabling lower prices during periods of weak demand.
While a price cap is not currently on the agenda and market-based pricing remains the principle, authorities signaled that a ceiling could be considered if market stability or service continuity were threatened.
Berkan Bayram, head of the Electric and Hybrid Vehicles Association of Türkiye (TEHAD), said flexible pricing would play a decisive role as EV adoption accelerates.
Dynamic pricing is also expected to support new investments, Bayram said, noting that clearly defined regulatory frameworks tend to attract capital. Allowing operators to boost utilization during idle hours through discounts and campaigns would shorten payback periods and improve returns on investment.

‘This is the final battle’: Iranian activist says campus protests signal revolution’s return
Unknown
Unknown Publisher
2026-02-22
10:11:46 UTC
19:11:46 KST

Protests have resumed across Iran in recent days, driven by university reopenings and traditional 40-day mourning ceremonies for those killed in earlier crackdowns, according to Iranian activist Armin Navabi.
In an interview, Navabi said the demonstrations are not yet on the same scale seen earlier this year, when millions reportedly took to the streets, but argued they show that dissent remains strong despite what he described as a “mass slaughter” by the regime. His claims about the scale of killings could not be independently verified.
Navabi said two main factors are fueling the renewed unrest. The first is the 40th-day memorial tradition, in which mourners gather to mark 40 days since a death. Such commemorations have historically served as flashpoints for fresh protests in Iran.
The second factor is the reopening of universities across the country.
“As soon as the universities opened, the students came out and they’re protesting again,” Navabi said, adding that campus demonstrations are particularly significant because they suggest what he called “the revolution is alive.”
He said students are chanting slogans in support of Reza Pahlavi, the exiled son of Iran’s last shah. According to Navabi, chants heard on campuses include “This is the final battle, Pahlavi will return” and “Long live the king.”
Navabi described the pro-Pahlavi slogans as notable given that Iranian universities have historically been associated with leftist and anti-monarchy activism. During the 1979 Islamic Revolution, campuses were centers of opposition to the shah, whose father, Reza Shah, founded Iran’s first modern universities.
Now, Navabi said, many students are openly expressing pro-Western and pro-Israel views. He argued that being pro-Israel is “the norm” in Iran rather than the exception, though that assertion could not be independently confirmed.
Navabi said he remains in contact with family members and a network of activists inside Iran and continues to receive videos and updates through messaging apps.
The activist also addressed expectations among some Iranians regarding potential U.S. or Israeli military action against the Islamic Republic.
He said that after President Donald Trump and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu voiced support for Iranian protesters earlier this year, some opposition supporters were disappointed when no immediate action followed large-scale demonstrations.
However, he said some now believe any delay may indicate preparation for a more significant move.
“If the attacks that are coming are significant and take out the leaders of the Islamic Republic and especially the forces that are responsible for suppressing the people, then the Iranian people will have the upper hand,” Navabi said.
He specifically mentioned senior Iranian leaders and the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps and the Basij militia as key pillars of the regime’s suppression apparatus. If those structures were weakened, he argued, protesters would return to the streets in even greater numbers.
“As soon as they notice that the regime cannot oppress them in the way that they did before, they will come out,” he said.
Navabi contended that regime change would require coordination between Iranian protesters and outside powers, with Iranians serving as “the boots on the ground” while the United States and Israel provide support.
Neither U.S. nor Israeli officials have publicly endorsed military action aimed at toppling Iran’s leadership. Tehran has repeatedly accused Washington and Jerusalem of interfering in its internal affairs, accusations both governments deny.
Despite uncertainty over whether outside intervention will occur, Navabi said he believes many Iranians remain determined to continue protesting if they sense the regime’s grip has weakened.

Hungary to block EU loan to Ukraine over Russian oil

Hungary will block a planned 90-billion-euro ($106-billion) European Union loan to Ukraine until the flow of Russian oil through the Druzhba pipeline resumes, Hungary's foreign minister said.
Russian oil shipments to Hungary and Slovakia have been interrupted since Jan. 27, after Ukrainian officials said a Russian drone attack damaged the Druzhba pipeline, which carries Russian crude across Ukrainian territory and into Central Europe.
Hungary and Slovakia, which have both received a temporary exemption from an EU policy prohibiting imports of Russian oil , have accused Ukraine — without providing evidence — of deliberately holding up supplies.
Foreign Minister Péter Szijjártó accused Ukraine of “blackmailing” Hungary by failing to restart oil shipments. He said his government would block a massive interest-free loan the EU approved in December to help Kiev to meet its military and economic needs for the next two years.
“We will not give in to this blackmail. We do not support Ukraine’s war, we will not pay for it,” Szijjártó said. “As long as Ukraine blocks the resumption of oil supplies to Hungary, Hungary will block European Union decisions that are important and favorable for Ukraine.”
Hungary's decision to block the key funding for Ukraine came two days after it suspended shipments of diesel to its embattled neighbor until oil flows through the Druzhba were resumed, and only days before the fourth anniversary of Russia's full-scale invasion.
Nearly every country in Europe has significantly reduced or entirely ceased Russian energy imports since Moscow launched its war in Ukraine on Feb. 24, 2022. Yet Hungary — an EU and NATO member — has maintained and even increased its supply of Russian oil and gas.

Munich Airport: Snow strands 500 passangers in planes overnight
Some 500 people had to spend the night in airplanes at Munich Airport after flights were canceled due to snowfall late on Thursday.
A Lufthansa spokesperson was cited by DPA news agency on Sunday as saying that the flights were canceled after all passengers were already on board and the planes were ready for takeoff.
According to Munich Airport, the travelers could not return to the airport's terminals until the morning due to a lack of buses and parking facilities.
According to the airport, 100 flights were canceled overnight from Thursday to Friday.
Affected in the incident were three Lufthansa flights to Singapore, Copenhagen and Gdansk and two Air Dolomiti flights to Graz and Venice, according to Lufthansa.
German Jewish leader calls for 'decisive political action' against antisemitism
Josef Schuster, who heads the Central Council of Jews in Germany, on Sunday called for "decisive political action" against antisemitism.
"Since [October 7. 2023], we have seen an explosive rise in antisemitism," he said while speaking at an event commemorating the council's 75th anniversary in Braunschweig, in the state of Lower Saxony.
"If we want to stand up to antisemitism, then decisive political action is needed," he said.
Schuster stressed that political action alone would not be enough, saying, "Decency and democratic culture cannot be imposed by political decree."
He said he was proud that the council was seen as a guardian of the German constitution and its achievements and as a champion of an open society.
The Central Council of Jews in Germany was founded in 1950 in Frankfurt.
The Braunschweig exhibition commemorating the founding of the council is to run from February 24 until September 30.
German authorities and monitoring groups have registered an increase in antisemitic incidents since the Hamas-led attacks on Israel on October 7, 2023, and Israel's ensuing offensive in the Gaza Strip.
Conservative CSU crticizes plan to ban social media for children under 14
The Bavarian conservative Christian Social Union (CSU) has criticized a plan by its larger sister party, the Christian Democratic Union (CDU), to ban social media for children under the age of 14.
"This debate about bans is out of touch with reality," Alexander Hoffmann, who leads the CSU in the lower house of German parliament, the Bundestag, said in comments to regional daily Augsburger Allgemeine.
He said that the government should hold social media platforms accountable rather than imposing a blanket ban.
Hoffmann's comments come after the CDU passed a motion to impose an age limit of 14 for social media at a party conference in Stuttgart on Saturday.
The motion was welcomed by the CDU/CSU's junior federal coalition partner, the center-left Social Democrats (SPD).
Court lifts ban on Austrian far-right extremist Sellner's participation at AfD event
Far-right extremist Martin Sellner may speak at a campaign event for the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) in the city of Ettlingen in Baden-Württemberg, a regional court ruled.
City authorities initially withdrew from the rental agreement for the venue of the AfD event, which was to center on the concept of "remigration," citing the topic and the participation of AfD lawmaker Lena Kotre from the eastern state of Brandenburg.
The Brandenburg wing of the party has been classified as right-wing extremist by German federal security authorities, and Kotre has called for mass deportations of immigrants in Germany.
A Karlsruhe court ruled on Saturday that the city must provide the AfD with space for its campaign event but imposed a precautionary ban on Sellner's appearance.
An AfD city councilor then appealed the decision and Branden-Württemberg's state appeals court lifted the ban on Sellner's participation at the event.
Who is Austrian far-right extremist Martin Sellner?
Sellner is a leader of Austria's Identitarian Movement, an organization that agitates against migration and Islam.
He joined the neo-Nazi scene in Austria as a teenager and was mentored by Holocaust denier Gottfried Küssel.
Early in 2024, the state of Brandenburg's capital city of Potsdam secured an entry ban against Sellner after he was scheduled to speak at a far-right event, which was later lifted by a regional court.
Germany's Lochner wins second gold medal in four-man bobsled
Germany's Johannes Lochner has won gold in the four-man bobsled in the Winter Olympics in Cortina d'Ampezzo in northern Italy, marking his third Olympic medal and his second medal this season.
This was the fourth gold medal for the German bobsled team at the Winter Olympics.
Lochner won his first Olympic medal on Tuesday in the two-man bobsled.
The 35-year-old Bavarian announced in September that he would retire from the sport following the Winter Olympics.
Lochner reached first place alongside his push athletes Thorsten Margis, Jörn Wenzel and Georg Fleischhauer.
Germany's Francesco Friedrich, who also won silver in the two-man bobsled race on Tuesday, took second place.
Switzerland's Michael Vogt took the bronze, edging out Germany's Adam Ammour, who took third place in the two-man bobsled race.
Germany dominated the men's bobsled events at the Olympics, with the final medal tally: Germany 8, USA 3, Switzerland 1, rest of the world: 0.
Germany to speed up asylum-seeker access to job market
German Interior Minister Alexander Dobrindt says he wants to speed up the integration of asylum-seekers into the workforce.
In an interview with the Sunday edition of the tabloid Bild newspaper, he said he had drawn up an "immediate employment plan" that would allow asylum-seekers to get a job after three months in Germany.
"Anyone who comes here should be able to work — and quickly," Dobrindt said. "The best form of integration is into the world of work."
According to the report, migrants would be able to start working even if their asylum applications were still being processed.
A spokeswoman for Dobrindt told Bild that whether an asylum-seeker chose to work or not would have no influence on the outcome of their asylum claim. She added that those who did work would generally be able to keep their earnings, and that any income would be offset against social benefits received.
Asylum-seekers who have already been rejected or do not cooperate with authorities, for example by providing false information, would be excluded from the plan, the newspaper reported.
German chamber of commerce warns of rising risks in China business
The German Chamber of Industry and Commerce (DIHK) says doing business with China comes with increasing risks, as the country expands its position in global markets.
"This presents opportunities for German companies, for example through strong technological progress and local innovation," DIHK President Peter Adrian told the German news agency dpa. "However, this is offset by growing risks, such as government intervention and unequal competitive conditions."
The warning comes ahead of German Chancellor Friedrich Merz's planned trip to Beijing on Tuesday.
Last year, China was Germany's most important trading partner, with the volume of imports and exports totalling €251.8 billion ($296.6 billion), according to the latest German government data.
At the same time, German companies have complained of increasing barriers in the Chinese market.
Beijing has also restricted exports of rare earths — critical raw materials used in products such as mobile phones and electric motors.
"I am counting on the Chancellor to represent the interests of the German economy in Beijing," said Adrian, noting that the Chinese market still offers German companies opportunities when it comes to "renewable energies, the circular economy, medical technology and large infrastructure projects."
SPD calls for swift action on social media ban for kids
Germany's Social Democrats (SPD) have welcomed a decision by coalition partner the conservative Christian Democrats (CDU) to ban social media for children under the age of 14.
At a party conference in Stuttgart on Saturday, the CDU passed a motion to implement a ban for the age group, as well as introduce more stringent checks for teens and fines for online platforms that fail to comply.
SPD Secretary General Tim Klüssendorf told the newspapers of the Redaktionsnetzwerk Deutschland on Sunday that the ruling coalition should now move swiftly to make the ban a reality.
"We finally need clear rules on digital platforms. Addiction-inducing algorithms, hate, and bullying are a massive problem for our entire society and can be particularly dangerous and harmful to children and young people," he said.
The SPD has previously called for social media platforms to be banned for children under 14, and for children under 16 to only be able to access versions of platforms free from algorithm-controlled reward and recommendation systems.
Speaking to the tabloid Bild on Sunday, SPD parliamentary secretary Dirk Wiese also welcomed the CDU's support for the measure.
"Now we should work together to pass a concrete law in the German Bundestag very soon," he said.
Norway, Greece, the UK, Denmark, Italy and the Netherlands are among a host of European countries discussing a similar form of ban, while the EU has increasingly moved toward supporting the principle.
Australia last year enforced a law that blocks minors under the age of 16 from having social media accounts on platforms like TikTok, Instagram, YouTube, Facebook and Reddit.
German filmmaker wins Golden Bear at Berlinale
The Berlin International Film Festival’s top prize, the Golden Bear, has gone to the political drama "Yellow Letters," by German director Ilker Catak.
The Turkish-language film follows a married couple whose relationship is tested as it comes under extraordinary political pressure.
"Yellow Letters" was decidedly the most political of all 22 works in the main competition, an apt conclusion to an event overshadowed by political debates.

The aftermath of Pakistan’s air strikes in Afghanistan
Attacks kill civilians, deepen border dispute and prompt threat of retaliation from Kabul.
Pakistan says it has launched strikes on armed groups in Afghanistan after blaming recent suicide bombings, including attacks during the Muslim holy month of Ramadan, on fighters it says are operating from its neighbour’s territory.
Kabul has repeatedly denied allowing armed groups to use Afghan territory to stage attacks in Pakistan.
Afghanistan’s Ministry of Defence on Sunday said “dozens of innocent civilians, including women and children, were martyred and wounded” when strikes hit a school and homes in the eastern provinces of Nangarhar and Paktika.
Nangarhar police told the AFP news agency the bombardment started about midnight (19:30 GMT on Saturday) and hit three districts.
“Civilians were killed. In one house, there were 23 family members. Five wounded people were taken out,” police spokesperson Sayed Tayeeb Hammad said.
The Afghan Defence Ministry said it will “deliver an appropriate and calculated response” to the Pakistani strikes.
The two countries have been locked in an increasingly bitter dispute since the Taliban authorities retook control of Afghanistan in 2021.
Pakistani military action killed 70 Afghan civilians from October to December, according to the United Nations mission in Afghanistan.
Several rounds of negotiations followed an initial ceasefire brokered by Qatar and Turkiye, but they have failed to produce a lasting agreement.
Saudi Arabia intervened this month, mediating the release of three Pakistani soldiers captured by Afghanistan in October.
The deteriorating relationship has had repercussions for people in both countries with the land border largely closed for months.

Russian barrage strikes Ukrainian infrastructure as war drags on
Kyiv has faced waves of overnight strikes in recent weeks as Moscow has intensified its winter assaults
Russia fired scores of missiles and drones at targets across Ukraine on Sunday, crashing into energy and rail infrastructure and residential buildings, just two days before the fourth anniversary of Russia’s invasion.
Journalists in Kyiv heard a series of blasts starting at around 4.00am, shortly after an air raid alert was issued, with the air force later widening the alert nationwide, citing the threat of missiles.
“Moscow continues to invest in strikes more than in diplomacy,” Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky commented on the attack on social media, saying that Russia launched about 50 missiles and 300 drones overnight.
“The main target of the attack was the energy sector. Ordinary residential buildings were also damaged, and there is damage to the railway.”
One man was killed and a dozen more people were wounded, among them four children, in and around Kyiv, Ukraine’s national police said.
Journalists saw rescuers sifting through debris of a largely destroyed two-storey house in Sofiivska Borshchagivka in the Kyiv region.

Saint Francis of Assisi’s skeleton goes on public display for first time

Saint Francis of Assisi’s skeleton is going on full public display from Sunday for the first time, in a move that is expected to draw hundreds of thousands of visitors.
Inside a nitrogen-filled case with the Latin inscription “Corpus Sancti Francisci” (the body of Saint Francis), the remains are being shown in the Italian hillside town’s Basilica of Saint Francis of Assisi.
St Francis, who died on 3 October 1226, founded the Franciscan order after renouncing his wealth and devoting his life to the poor.
Giulio Cesareo, the director of communications for the Franciscan convent in Assisi, said he hoped the display could be “a meaningful experience” for believers and non-believers alike.
Cesareo, a Franciscan friar, said the “damaged” and “consumed” state of the bones showed that St Francis “gave himself completely” to his life’s work.
His remains, which will be on display until 22 March, were transferred to the basilica built in the saint’s honour in 1230. But it was only in 1818, after excavations carried out in utmost secrecy, that his tomb was rediscovered.
Apart from previous exhumations for inspection and scientific examination, the bones of Saint Francis have only been displayed once, in 1978, to a very limited audience and for only one day.
Usually hidden from view, the transparent case containing the relics since 1978 was brought out on Saturday from the metal coffer in which it is kept inside his stone tomb in the crypt of the basilica. The case is itself inside another bulletproof and anti-burglary glass case.
Surveillance cameras will operate 24 hours a day for added protection of the remains.
Saint Francis is Italy’s patron saint and a public holiday is to be reinstated on 4 October to mark the 800th anniversary commemorations of his death.
Reservations to see the saint’s remains already number “almost 400,000 [people] coming from all parts of the world, with of course a clear predominance from Italy”, said Marco Moroni, the guardian of the Franciscan convent. “But we also have Brazilians, North Americans, Africans,” he added.
During this time of year, the basilica usually has 1,000 visitors a day on weekdays, rising to 4,000 at weekends, but the Franciscans said they were expecting this to rise to 15,000 visitors on weekdays and up to 19,000 on Saturdays and Sundays for the month-long display of the remains.
Cesareo said: “From the very beginning, since the time of the catacombs, Christians have venerated the bones of martyrs, the relics of martyrs, and they have never really experienced it as something macabre.”
Experts said the extended display of Saint Francis’s remains should not affect their state of preservation. “The display case is sealed, so there is no contact with the outside air. In reality, it remains in the same conditions as when it was in the tomb,” Cesareo said.
The light, which will remain subdued in the church, should also not have an effect. “The basilica will not be lit up like a stadium,” Cesareo said. “This is not a movie set.”

Russian missile and drone barrage hits Kyiv suburbs, killing 1
Russia launched a major overnight missile and drone attack on Ukraine, killing one person near Kyiv and damaging homes and energy sites
- Bookmark
Russia attacked Ukraine with a barrage of missiles and drones, killing one person in the Kyiv region, Ukraine's Emergency Service said on Sunday.
Another eight people, including a child, were rescued from under the rubble of destroyed buildings, the service said.
The attack caused damage and fires to erupt in five districts in the suburbs of Kyiv. In the village of Putrivka in the Fastiv district, emergency first responders worked on saving people buried under debris.
Russia also struck energy infrastructure in Ukraine's southern Odesa region, resulting in significant fires, which were later extinguished, the emergency service said.
During the four years since Russia launched an all-out war on its neighbor, and despite a new push over the past year in U.S.-led peace efforts, Ukrainian civilians have endured constant aerial attacks. Russia has also ramped up attacks targeting the country's energy grid, leaving Ukrainian civilians without electricity and heating amid harsh winter conditions.
Ukraine’s Air Force said Sunday that Russia's overnight barrage had included 297 drones and 50 missiles of various types, of which 274 drones and 33 missiles were shot down or neutralized. Of those remaining, 14 missiles and 23 drones struck 14 locations, it said. Three missiles were unaccounted for.
Separately, an explosion in Ukraine's western city of Lviv killed one person and injured 25, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said in a Telegram post on Sunday. One person has been arrested over the incident, which is unrelated to Russia’s aerial attack on Ukraine.
Meanwhile, Russian air defenses destroyed 86 Ukrainian drones overnight, Russia’s Ministry of Defense said Sunday.
A security guard was injured and a fuel tank set alight when two Ukrainian drones hit an oil depot in the Russian-occupied Ukrainian city of Luhansk, Moscow-installed leader Leonid Pasechnik said.

‘I just want a fresh start’: Vulnerable young people forced to the streets by ‘unfair’ rental market
Exclusive: Charity services warn that young people could suffer more after Renters’ Rights Act
- Bookmark
- CommentsGo to comments
Many young people are finding themselves trapped in homelessness, unsafe conditions or relying on crisis services due to the “unfair” rental sector, charities have warned.
Vulnerable young people are being rejected by landlords due to their age, profession, lack of guarantor or connection to a homelessness service, charity EveryYouth has found.
The group organises a network of 21 youth homelessness charities across the UK. A survey of some of these services showed young people are mainly facing discrimination due to not having a family member who can be a guarantor (90 per cent), followed by their income level (70 per cent) despite being able to afford rent.
Kalvin, 18, said he struggled to find a landlord who would accept him, eventually leading him to a homelessness charity in Devon after a period of rough sleeping while being in work.
Originally from Glasgow, Kalvin says he moved to Devon for a “fresh start”, working for two years as an apprentice in the motor trade.
Although not earning much – an under-18 apprentice wage in the UK is £7.55 an hour – he was making at least £1,000 a month. This would be enough for a one-bedroom flat in North Devon, at an average of £597, or to live in a houseshare. Despite this, Kalvin says finding a place to rent proved impossible.
He said: “There have been multiple occasions where I’d see a place I really, really liked and they wouldn’t accept me because I was too young. It was very difficult to get somewhere that I could stay and call home.
“Places say ‘you’re too young’, or ‘you get paid a certain way’ or ‘you do not get paid enough’, and they question your income. It put a lot of stress on me.”
Kalvin added he is unable to rely on family for money. Now staying in supported accommodation provided by the Amber Foundation, part of the EveryYouth network, the 18-year-old said he’s “actually now interested in college, and they’re helping me go for that”, adding he will be doing his GCSEs so he can pursue a course in IT.
From May this year, new protections will come into effect for renters as part of the Renters’ Rights Act. This will tackle discrimination by making it illegal for landlords to refuse tenants in receipt of benefits or with children, and by ensuring they give a legal reason for eviction.
But there is “real concern” that this won’t benefit young renters and could even have a knock-on effect, said Nicholas Connolly, EveryYouth CEO.
He said: “It’ll put greater obligations on landlords, and ultimately they will try harder to avoid those obligations. And there are so many ways that they can discriminate legally.
“The young people that we support have no savings, very little or zero familial support, they’ve got nothing to fall back on. The ones we support are in homelessness services, but they have to leave that at some point. There isn’t social housing for most of them.
“So the only option is the private rented sector, and unless there is some additional support that recognises that they don’t have the social or economic capital that other people in society have, they will just not be able to get anywhere to live.”
Rosie, 19, works full-time, 35 to 45 hours a week, at a pub in Hampshire. She left a “toxic and abusive” family household when she was 17 and moved into supported accommodation provided by EveryYouth partner charity, Step by Step.
When she was ready for independent living, Rosie started looking for a private rental with the help of her support worker. It took eight months for a landlord to accept her.
Rosie said: “I was consistently turned down because of my age or because Step by Step was put on my application [as my current address]. One [landlord] did outright tell me they didn’t want to take me because ‘they know what kind of people end up in Step by Step’ and other landlords beat around the bush and say, ‘We don’t think this house share is for you’.
“I have been fully employed, full-time, since I was 17. It does feel quite condescending. I can’t help the situation I’m in. Landlords should be considering how much you earn and if you can pay the rent. Instead they’re just considering the fact that I’m under the age of 20.”
EveryYouth said it is calling on the government to strengthen protections against discrimination linked to age by introducing meaningful penalties for landlords who discriminate.
At the same time, it calls for greater incentives for landlords to provide tenancies to vulnerable young people, like council-backed guarantors or deposit help schemes, which could help them leave supported or temporary accommodation faster.
A spokesperson from the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government said: “Discrimination against anyone based on their age is completely unacceptable.
“Through the Renters’ Rights Act we’ve already taken action to stop discrimination against people who are receiving benefits or have young children.
“We will keep action under review to extend these powers so we can make sure everyone has a safe and decent home.”

This week alone, Russia launched more than 1,300 attack drones against Ukraine, over 1,400 guided aerial bombs, and 96 missiles of various types, including dozens of ballistic ones.
That is why we must bolster our air defence. We need systems that effectively counter ballistic threats."
Background: On the night of 21-22 February, Russian forces carried out a combined strike on critical infrastructure facilities across Ukraine. The Ukrainian Air Force recorded 345 aerial attack assets, including 33 missiles and 274 UAVs that were shot down or jammed.

Türkiye, Saudi Arabia to sign 2nd phase of 5-GW renewable energy deal at COP31

Türkiye and the Saudi Arabian company Acwa Power are set to sign the second phase of a 5-gigawatt renewable energy cooperation deal at the U.N. climate summit COP31 to be held in Antalya, Türkiye, later this year, Acwa chairman Mohammad Abunayyan said.
The planned signing would cover the remaining 3 gigawatts of capacity under a government-to-government agreement between the two countries, following this week’s deal for the first 2 gigawatts of solar projects in Türkiye's central provinces of Sivas and Karaman.
“We are going to sign 3 gigawatts in renewable and storage by COP31,” Abunayyan told Anadolu Agency in an interview on Feb. 20 on the sidelines of the signing ceremony in Istanbul for the Sivas and Taseli solar power plant projects.
The new phase “will be a mix between solar and wind and storage,” he added, noting that the company is also considering integrating storage into the initial 2-gigawatt solar projects.
The first phase, signed this week, is part of a broader 5-gigawatt framework agreed during Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan’s visit to Saudi Arabia on Feb. 3. Abunayyan said that the construction on the 2 gigawatts of solar capacity is expected to begin next year after permits and environmental approvals are completed, with the first electricity targeted for early 2028.
“We are going to start our dispatch of the first electricity of this 2 gigawatts by the beginning of 2028, and we will be able to produce it all in 2028,” he said, describing it as a “very fast-track project.”
COP31, scheduled for Nov. 9-20 this year will be held in the Mediterranean city of Antalya, with a leaders’ summit expected in Istanbul. Nearly 200 countries are anticipated to participate in the U.N. climate talks, which are set to focus on implementing the Paris Agreement, including emissions reduction targets, adaptation efforts, climate finance and carbon market mechanisms.
Abunayyan said the first projects would deliver what he called the most competitive electricity prices in Türkiye while incorporating local content and Turkish contractors. “It will deliver the most competitive cost that you could imagine in Türkiye,” he said. “It’s going to deliver local content.”
He praised Türkiye’s renewable energy strategy, calling it “a great strategy” and “ambitious,” and noted the country’s goal to add 80 gigawatts of renewable capacity by 2035.
“This project … is really a starting of this 80 gigawatts,” he said.
Türkiye aims to increase its total installed solar and wind capacity to 120 gigawatts by 2035, which implies adding about 80 gigawatts to current levels. To achieve that target, the country would need to install roughly 9 gigawatts of new capacity each year.

Silent suffering: how a domestic helper’s Hong Kong dream became a nightmare
Nepalese helper came to city in search of better life, only to find exploitation, exhaustion and abuse behind closed doors
Sanju*, a foreign domestic helper of Nepalese ethnicity, never imagined her Hong Kong dream would turn into a nightmare.
The 34-year-old arrived in Hong Kong in 2023, driven by a simple wish to work in the city of her dreams. But she said her first employer paid her 30 per cent below the statutory minimum wage, allowed her only two hours of sleep a day, and gave her just three rest days over six months, during which she was only paid two months’ salary.
After six months, she was dismissed and thrown out of the flat in the middle of the night because she could not speak English.
Sanju found a new employer three months later, but that was only the start of another ordeal, she said.
“I had to sleep on the floor in a small room where I could not stretch my legs. There was no fan, no air conditioning, no breakfast for me, and I was not allowed to open the window,” Sanju said through an interpreter.
Once, she bought her own food and tried to cook in the kitchen, but she said the employer told her, “It’s my gas, my kitchen,” and threw the food away.

Ukraine can counter Russian propaganda asymmetrically – expert
Liubov Tsybulska, a strategic communications expert and director of the NGO Join Ukraine, said this in an interview with Ukrinform.
"Russia has been steadily increasing its propaganda budgets over the past 12 years. They may cut spending on education or healthcare, but they will always increase expenditures on war and propaganda. Obviously, we do not have the same resources, but in reality, we do not face the same task. We must defend ourselves asymmetrically. For example, Russia has powerful aviation, but then the Security Service of Ukraine appears with Operation Spiderweb and small, cheap drones destroy more than 30% of Russian missile carriers. This is exactly what we must do – and are doing – in the information sphere as well," she said.
Tsybulska noted that Ukrainians working in the field of information warfare are more motivated because the issue concerns survival.
"The Russian propaganda machine operates only thanks to the use of enormous resources," she added.
Earlier reports said that Russia's state budget spending on state television channels in 2026 would reach 106.4 billion rubles (about $1.27 billion), which is 54% higher than previously planned and exceeds this year's figures.

14 Muslim nations slam US envoy's Israeli land rights claims

Fourteen Muslim-majority countries and three regional organizations condemned Sunday remarks by Mike Huckabee, the U.S. ambassador to Israel, after he said it would be acceptable for Israel to exert control over territory belonging to Arab states, including the occupied West Bank.
In a joint statement, the foreign ministries of Türkiye, Egypt, Jordan, Lebanon, Indonesia, Kuwait, Palestine, Qatar, Oman, Pakistan, Bahrain, Saudi Arabia, Syria, and the United Arab Emirates expressed "strong condemnation and profound concern" over the comments.
The statement was also issued with the participation of the secretariats of the Organization of Islamic Cooperation, the League of Arab States, and the Gulf Cooperation Council.
The ministries described the U.S. envoy’s remarks as "dangerous and inflammatory," saying they constitute "a flagrant violation of the principles of international law and the Charter of the United Nations" and pose a grave threat to regional security and stability.
They said the comments directly contradict the vision put forward by U.S. President Donald Trump and the Comprehensive Plan to End the Gaza Conflict, which is based on containing escalation and creating a political horizon for a comprehensive settlement that ensures the Palestinian people have their own independent state.
The signatories said "the plan is grounded in promoting tolerance and peaceful coexistence," warning that attempts "to legitimize control over the lands of others undermine these objectives, fuel tensions," and amount to incitement rather than advancing peace.
The ministries "reaffirmed that Israel has no sovereignty over the Occupied Palestinian Territory or any other occupied Arab lands," the statement noted.
"They reiterated their firm rejection of any attempts to annex the West Bank or separate it from the Gaza Strip, their strong opposition to the expansion of settlement activities in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, and their categorical rejection of any threat to the sovereignty of Arab states," it added.
The statement warned that "the continuation of Israel’s expansionist policies and unlawful measures will only inflame violence and conflict in the region and undermine prospects for peace."
The signatories called for an end to what they termed "incendiary statements" and reiterated their "commitment to the inalienable right of the Palestinian people to self-determination and to the establishment of an independent state" along the June 4, 1967, lines, as well as to ending the occupation of all Arab lands.
Mike Huckabee, named U.S. ambassador to Israel in April 2025, is an evangelical Christian who has previously spoken of expansionist claims based on what he described as a "divine right" for Israel in the West Bank.
He argued that Israel has a "biblical right" to the land stretching from the Nile to the Euphrates rivers, saying on a podcast released Friday: "It would be fine if they (Israel) took it all."
Huckabee made the remarks in an interview with U.S. journalist Tucker Carlson, during which he defended Israel’s actions in the Gaza Strip and voiced support for the idea of "divine providence" giving control of the region to Israel.
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu told news channel i24 last August that he feels "very attached" to the vision of a Greater Israel.
He said he considers himself "on a historic and spiritual mission," including "generations of Jews that dreamt of coming here and generations of Jews who will come after us."
Greater Israel is a term used in Israeli politics to refer to the expansion of Israel’s territory to include the West Bank, Gaza, and Syria’s Golan Heights, with some interpretations also including Egypt’s Sinai Peninsula and parts of Jordan.

Trump questioning why Iran has not 'capitulated' yet

US envoy Steve Witkoff said on Saturday that President Donald Trump is questioning why Iran has not "capitulated" in the face of Washington's military build-up aimed at pressuring them into a nuclear deal.
In a Fox News interview with Trump's daughter-in-law Lara, Witkoff said the president was "curious" about Iran's position after he had warned them of severe consequences in the event they failed to strike a deal.
"I don't want to use the word 'frustrated,' because he understands he has plenty of alternatives, but he's curious as to why they haven't... I don't want to use the word 'capitulated,' but why they haven't capitulated," he said.
"Why, under this pressure, with the amount of seapower and naval power over there, why haven't they come to us and said, 'We profess we don't want a weapon, so here's what we're prepared to do'? And yet it's sort of hard to get them to that place."
Witkoff's comments came after the United States and Iran this week resumed Oman-mediated talks in Geneva aimed at averting the possibility of military action, after Washington dispatched two aircraft carriers, jets and weaponry to the region to back its warnings.
Iran has been under threat of a US military attacks over the months, in response to the crackdown on anti-government protesters and a lack of agreement to a nuclear deal.
Meanwhile, in the Gaza Strip, Israel continued to violate the ceasefire which came into effect on 10 October.
Israeli warplanes targeted the eastern areas of Rafah, in the southern Gaza Strip, while army vehicles also opened fire on the eastern areas of Khan Younis.
In Gaza City, Israeli warplanes launched airstrikes on the eastern areas, coinciding with sporadic artillery shelling of the same areas. This also comes as Palestinians in the enclave observe the holy month of Ramadan - their third under Israeli war.

Speaker: Anti-terror panel's report marks 'vital threshold'

Parliament Speaker Numan Kurtulmuş on Feb. 21 described the delivery of a final report by a commission overseeing the government’s anti-terror project as a "vital threshold."
"This report is certainly not everything, but it is a milestone for what needs to be done next. Within this framework, the necessary steps must be pursued with good faith, patience and determination," Kurtulmuş told journalists during a gathering in Istanbul.
The National Solidarity, Brotherhood and Democracy Commission concluded its work on Feb. 18, presenting a 60-page final report outlining proposed “democratization” steps and legal reforms under the government’s “terror-free Türkiye” initiative.
"From now on, political parties will come together to discuss what can be done, especially regarding legal regulations. Ultimately, I hope that regulations that all parties will sign off on will be implemented," Kurtulmuş said. "This was a vital threshold for Türkiye, and we have crossed it. This doesn't mean everything is over. A period of intensive work is needed."
Momentum behind the initiative increased after jailed PKK leader Abdullah Öcalan issued a call that prompted the terror group to begin disarming. A first batch of members publicly destroyed weapons in July, and PKK later announced it would withdraw from Turkish territory in October.
The İYİ (Good) Party remains the only major political party boycotting the initiative and declined to send representatives to the commission.

Tired but unbroken: Zelenskyy's war enters 5th year

"And how are you feeling, psychologically?" a journalist suddenly asked Ukraine's president. "Me? I'm fine," replied a surprised Volodymyr Zelenskyy, who up to that point had been fielding questions on political and diplomatic matters. "And how do I look to you?" he asked. "You look tired," the journalist said.
"Then don't look at me," Zelenskyy laughed, before turning serious. "But thank you. All of us in Ukraine are tired, but we have to do our work to save the country and protect our people and our rights. We're all in the same boat. We're tired, but we're strong."
The brief exchange – on the sidelines of the Munich Security Conference a few days ago – revealed far more than just the president's mood. On February 24, Ukraine will mark the start of the fifth year of the Russian invasion. Looking back across four years of war, Zelenskyy and his citizens can recognize something almost improbable: despite the carnage, the bombardment, and the bone-chilling cold, Russia failed to achieve either of its two stated objectives for the past year. Kyiv's army did not collapse. Washington did not cut off aid – it only changed the format, from grants to sales.
According to American analyst Michael Kofman, one of the world's foremost experts on the conflict, Ukraine is actually closing out year four in better shape than it entered it. "The situation today is far from dire, even though Kyiv entered 2026 in a complicated position," he wrote last week in an extensive piece for Foreign Affairs.
The goal: Persuade Trump
Those achievements – modest-sounding as they are – look almost miraculous when measured against a specific turning point: the meeting between Trump and Zelenskyy in the Oval Office on the final day of February last year. The meeting imploded fast. Vice President JD Vance accused the Ukrainian leader of ingratitude toward Trump; the president himself told his European guest that he "had no cards." The planned dinner was canceled. In an extraordinary and humiliating scene captured on camera, the Ukrainian delegation was shown the door.
Rather than the end of a relationship, that low point handed Zelenskyy a masterclass. He emerged from the debacle with a clearer understanding of how Trump operates and, crucially, how to navigate his psychological architecture. The formula he landed on was deceptively simple: thank Trump at every available opportunity, never refuse him to his face, and always convey that Ukraine is willing to make painful compromises. At the same time, he could not abandon his backbone entirely – Trump not only projects strength, but he also respects it in others, and firmness on truly critical issues had to be maintained.
The approach worked. Tactically, Zelenskyy learned to weather Trump's mood swings – the alternating attacks and praise. Strategically, it opened space for negotiating progress and agreement on every available point, even as Kyiv held firm on the non-negotiables: the status of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant (Europe's largest nuclear facility, under Russian control since 2022), control of the Donbas (the eastern Ukrainian industrial region partially occupied by Russia), and binding security guarantees.
"The US and Europe must provide guarantees that will protect Ukraine from future Russian attacks, otherwise the deal won't hold," Zelenskyy told The Atlantic a few days ago. "We would rather fight than sign an agreement on terms that won't serve our country."
The end of the all-powerful aide
The diplomatic high-wire act with Trump played out against a backdrop of internal turbulence, making the past year the most politically punishing of Zelenskyy's wartime tenure. Last July, he pushed legislation designed to curtail the independence of Ukraine's two anti-corruption agencies, NABU and SAP (Ukraine's National Anti-Corruption Bureau and Specialized Anti-Corruption Prosecutor's Office). The backlash was fierce – street protests, displeasure from European allies – and Zelenskyy retreated. The episode left a sour aftertaste.
Then came November's body blow: NABU and SAP cracked open an entire bribery and money-laundering network inside the state energy corporation Energoatom. The central figure was Timur Mindich, a friend and former business partner of Zelenskyy's, who had allegedly been extracting between 10% and 15% from every subcontractor's contract in exchange for "maintaining their status" and "preventing suspension of payments."
Mindich and his associates pocketed $100 million – much of it from projects meant to protect energy infrastructure – while Russian missiles were targeting that same infrastructure on the eve of winter. Mindich fled to Israel when the scandal broke. But the truly seismic event came next: Andriy Yermak – the man without whose approval, it was widely understood, nothing moved in Zelenskyy's circle – was ousted.
From intelligence to the presidential office
Ukrainian analysts say the dismissal gave Zelenskyy rare room to maneuver. Two appointments illustrate the shift: Yermak's replacement was Kyrylo Budanov, the head of Ukraine's Defense Intelligence, who now leads Kyiv's negotiating effort. Budanov carries unusual weight: though until recently he was personally involved in special operations, he has kept an open back-channel with Moscow on prisoner swaps throughout the war while simultaneously deepening his relationship with the CIA. He is highly regarded at Langley and accepted across the competing factions of the Trump administration.
"At the most senior level, he is among the handful of figures in Ukraine capable of thinking several steps ahead," former Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba said of him recently. "Yermak was more of an opportunist." The appointment, Kuleba added, also shed light on Zelenskyy himself. "He has undergone an internal transformation. You cannot run a country by the same model for six years," said the former minister, who was himself dismissed in 2022 – apparently under Yermak's influence.
Budanov's partner in reshaping Ukraine's war effort is set to be the new Defense Minister Mykhailo Fedorov, a tech entrepreneur with a background in defense-sector innovation. Fedorov is tasked with reforming military command, improving the conscription process – and with it troop rotation at the front (in his first address to parliament, he revealed that roughly 200,000 soldiers, about a third of the fighting force, had left their units without authorization) – and further scaling the Ukrainian defense industry, which in four years has grown into a major manufacturer supplying nearly 50% of all weapons and munitions needed at the front, with enormous emphasis on drones produced by the millions.
On two early tests, Fedorov has already delivered: at the recent Ramstein summit, Ukraine's allies committed $38 billion in military assistance. And he managed to find common ground with billionaire Elon Musk, quickly disconnecting Starlink terminals that had been smuggled into Russia over the course of the war – a step that dealt a tangible, if temporary, blow to Russian battlefield effectiveness.
A year of decision?
The appointments of Budanov and Fedorov point to a president who views 2026 as a potentially war-ending year – whether through diplomatic breakthrough or, more likely, by driving up the cost of war for Moscow to an unsustainable level. While Russia is counting on grinding Ukraine down, Kyiv is betting on making the conflict too expensive – in human lives and economic terms – for its neighbor-enemy to sustain.
Entering year five, both Zelenskyy and the broader Ukrainian public carry what might be described as cautious optimism. Russia's economy holds, but stress fractures are multiplying: growth of just 0.6%, a draining national wealth fund, industrial output contracting at its sharpest pace since March 2022, major companies seeking government bailouts, and a VAT hike to plug the gap left by falling oil revenues.
Around 40% of the Russian budget goes to defense, yet Moscow's frontline advances remain glacially slow. Despite its demographic edge, Russia is failing to recruit fast enough to offset its battlefield losses – let alone build meaningful reserves. Compounding the problem are the falling quality of new conscripts and widespread organized crime inside military units, further corroding an already-strained force.
Ukraine, meanwhile, is steadily widening the reach of its strikes deep into Russian territory – drones are hitting targets 2,000 kilometers (1,240 miles) away – and has already partly neutralized Moscow's strategic depth. It continues to demonstrate a capacity for surprise, as in Operation Spider Web (the Ukrainian operation that destroyed Russian strategic bombers on the ground). And it is becoming increasingly embedded in European security architecture through a growing web of joint defense production initiatives.
As for Zelenskyy himself, he is also preparing for the possibility of elections, a Russian demand the Americans have accepted. "Nobody is clinging to power, but elections require a ceasefire and security guarantees," he told The Atlantic. He is also open to a referendum on a fair deal, if one is brokered through Trump. "I don't think a bad deal should be put to a referendum. We will continue the fight. Ukraine will not lose."

‘A global hero’: Jesse Jackson’s legacy of activism around the world

When Jesse Jackson called for the Democratic party platform to include Palestinian statehood, the pushback was fierce. “While we had strong support from delegates at the convention, there was still a fear factor that the issue couldn’t be discussed,” recalls James Zogby, who was deputy manager of Jackson’s presidential campaign. “I was told by the [nominee Michael] Dukakis negotiators, if you even say the P-word, you’ll destroy the Democratic party.”
Jackson’s effort did not succeed at the 1988 Democratic National Convention in Atlanta. But 10 Democratic state parties had already passed resolutions in favour of Palestinian self-determination. And as the decades rolled by, more and more progressives came to share Jackson’s stance. Zogby, founder of the Arab American Institute, reflects: “He was way ahead of the base. Even the activists who supported Palestinians did not have the same depth of understanding.”
When Jackson died on Tuesday at the age of 84, many tributes understandably focused on his contribution to the domestic civil rights struggle and how he bridged generations between Martin Luther King and Barack Obama. But perhaps uniquely for a non-president, his passing was also mourned around the world, from Havana to Johannesburg to Ramallah.
Jackson was a man ahead of his time who blazed a trail for the progressives of today. He was a true internationalist, a trenchant critic of US imperialism and believer in the solidarity of oppressed people everywhere. He was an advocate of normalising relations with Cuba, a scourge of racial apartheid in South Africa and a prominent voice for Palestinian rights. He also embarked on missions to Syria, Iraq and Serbia to free US prisoners.
Martha Biondi, a professor of Black studies and of history at Northwestern University, said: “Jesse Jackson is described typically as a civil rights leader, as somebody who helped pave the way for the election of Barack Obama, and, while all of that is true, in some ways it’s more helpful and illuminating to see Jesse Jackson as one of the most prominent figures of the American left in the 20th century and into the 21st century.
“In that sense, he paved the way not only for Barack Obama but he was a precursor to Bernie Sanders. He’s very much in that very progressive, economic, populist mould. If you see him in that light, then it’s not confusing that he was an early advocate of Palestinian rights.”
When Andrew Young, the US ambassador to the United Nations, was forced from his post in 1979, the row reverberated far beyond Washington. Young had held a clandestine meeting with a representative of the Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO) – then regarded by the US government as beyond the pale. Under intense pressure, he resigned.
Among Young’s most ardent champions was Jackson. In the immediate aftermath of the controversy, Jackson led a delegation to the Middle East, where he met Israeli officials as well as figures from the PLO, including its leader, Yasser Arafat.
Jackson argued that Washington should abandon its policy of isolation and negotiate directly with the organisation. At the same time, he drew careful – if unmistakable – parallels between the Palestinian cause and the African American struggle. “We understand the cycle of terror, the cycle of pain,” he said.
Sam Klug, an assistant teaching professor of history at Loyola University, Maryland, noted: “He said, when he was visiting essentially a Palestinian refugee camp outside Beirut, that it reminded him of some of the conditions that he had grown up in under Jim Crow. It was clear that he saw a link between his work in the civil rights movement, his work against racial oppression in the United States and his support for the Palestinian people.”
Some Jewish people in the US were appalled by Jackson’s embrace of Arafat. But he played a vital role in mainstreaming the Palestinian cause among African American leaders, shifting the perspective from a purely nationalistic dispute to a profound issue of human rights.
For Zogby, it was about humanity and bridging the gap between the established civil rights movement and the anti-colonial liberation struggles of the global south. He said: “Watching him in the West Bank or Egypt or Kuwait, he was as comfortable with people there as he was in Chicago.
“It was because he didn’t look down on Arabs. He saw himself as part of a global community. It was a third world mindset. We’re people of colour. We have human needs. These were one struggle, one fight, and he was part of it and he saw himself in that context. South Africa obviously fed into that.”
Omar Barghouti, a co-founder of the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS) movement for Palestinian rights, said in an email: “Palestinians have eulogized this towering Black American leader’s departure with grief and with profound appreciation for his exceptional role in catapulting Palestinian liberation into the US mainstream political discourse when hardly any politician dared to.
“Building on Dr Martin Luther King’s late-life intersectional call for resisting the ‘triple evils of racism, economic exploitation and militarism’, Rev Jackson believed that freedom for the Palestinian people must be part of that global resistance. Despite the obvious differences, his advocacy for Palestinian rights must be seen in the context of a decades-long tradition of Black-Palestinian mutual solidarity, from Malcolm X to Angela Davis.”
Jackson first travelled to South Africa in July 1979, two years after the death of Black consciousness founder Steve Biko. He drew massive crowds at rallies in Soweto, a township near Johannesburg. In 1984 he was the most prominent presidential candidate to voice support for the imprisoned Nelson Mandela; his two White House campaigns gave him a platform to amplify the message.
When Ronald Reagan was moving US policy sharply to the right and giving the apartheid regime in South Africa a new lease on life, Jackson provided a clarion call to conscience. He vigorously pushed for sanctions against the apartheid state, characterising it as a moral disgrace rather than a mere pawn in the cold war. His relentless organising and voter mobilisation helped pressure Congress to overturn Reagan’s veto and pass historic anti-apartheid sanctions in 1986.
Jackson was motivated by parallels with the fight for racial justice in the US. He wrote in the Guardian in 2013: “As a young civil rights activist, I knew how raw and ugly and violent the apartheid regime was. They were being jailed, we were being jailed. We were being killed, and they were being massacred.”
William Gumede, 55, founder and executive chairperson of the Democracy Works Foundation in South Africa, recalled: “Jesse Jackson stood out as a beacon because the perception in the 1980s was the US government of the time was much more in favour of protecting the apartheid government. That made Jesse Jackson, in our eyes in South Africa, an important larger-than-life hero of the anti-apartheid movement.”
Jackson was a Black man with global interests and global reach, noted Gumede, an associate professor at Wits University in Johannesburg. “The kind of heroes that we would have would be dealing with our issues. He was dealing with his issues and many other world issues and that made him an extraordinary person.
“In the 80s and the anti-apartheid movement, there was a lot of focus, particularly in my generation, with looking at people through colour lenses and looking around the world for Black heroes. He was a Black hero in the US but he was also a global hero in not only Black issues but many other issues beyond race.”
Barbara Masekela, 84, a South African poet, educator, diplomat and anti-apartheid activist, added: “For me the most remarkable thing was that he was one of the first Black activists to link the struggles of people all over the world, including South Africa.
“We come from a generation that had a lot of innovative thoughts about human rights all over the world. We are also a generation that benefited from the explosion of information. He was one of the few activists that took advantage of that knowledge and continued the line of solidarity between African populations all over the world. He cared about the soul of Black folks.”
Jackson routinely criticised US military interventions and the financing of rightwing counterinsurgencies in countries such as Nicaragua and Angola, calling instead for diplomacy and equitable economic development in the global south.
But perhaps Jackson’s greatest international achievements were the hostage and political prisoner negotiations that he successfully conducted, often with countries that the US declared enemies and therefore refused to do business with. These included Syria (freeing navy lieutenant Robert Goodman), Cuba (freeing 48 political prisoners), Iraq (freeing hostages before the Gulf war) and Serbia (freeing three US soldiers).
David Masciotra, author of I Am Somebody: Why Jesse Jackson Matters, notes that after the successful mission to Syria, Jackson was invited by Reagan to the White House. “Reagan asked Jackson, ‘What can I do for you in return?’ Jackson said, ‘I want you to get on the phone and call [Syrian president Hafez al-]Assad and thank him.
“Reagan said, ‘Well, we have a no-talk policy with Syria.’ Jackson said, ‘Yeah, I know, and that’s why that’s what I’m asking you to do; I want you to break that policy.’ To his credit, Reagan did it, and Reagan and Assad spoke for the rest of his administration. Jackson was a believer in diplomacy and cooperation and democracy promotion through conversation, as simple as it sounds, rather than aggression and other forms of brinkmanship.”
It was a worldview shaped by Jackson’s own experience growing up Black in America. Masciotra added: “He said that’s how he learned to become a good negotiator because growing up in the Jim Crow south as a poor Black man, every day was a negotiation and his life was at stake. He had a life that was formed by pain very early on and he identified with the pain of others and those who were despised and demeaned and he sought to speak for them.
“Being an American icon gave him a credibility with these regimes in which he could speak to them as an American but also as an American who could relate to their experience with American policy. He was a victim of a certain kind of domestic form of colonialism, so therefore he could relate to countries that had suffered from colonialism beyond American shores.
“It was connecting with those people on a very deep personal level because of the source of their pain but it was also connecting politically because he could say, ‘I’m an American but I’m very well acquainted with the dark side of the American experience and that’s something that you know about too; you’re just going about your resistance the wrong way by taking hostages and political prisoners.’”
More than four decades since the Democratic National Convention in Atlanta, many of Jackson’s policy positions have aged well and into the centre-left consensus. Yet as he neared the sunset of his life, he was the first to recognise that the struggle was far from over. At the 2024 convention in Chicago, the party explicitly refused to allow a Palestinian American speaker on stage amid the devastating war in Gaza.
Earlier that year, again in Chicago, Zogby had attended a summit at Jackson’s Rainbow Push Coalition. He recalled: “As I left at the end of the summit, I went over to him and I said, ‘Reverend, I’m going to go,’ and he just looked at me and he said, ‘Remember the babies. They’re dying every day. Do something.’
“Gaza moved him and, even that early in January 2024, he got it. By the time we got to the convention, he wasn’t able to speak, but I’m fully confident of the fact that he would have said: let Palestinian voices be heard.”

‘I’m going to fight’: freed Venezuelan activist on life after Maduro’s downfall
Unknown
Unknown Publisher
2026-02-22
10:00:34 UTC
19:00:34 KST

Jesús Armas was asleep inside Venezuela’s most infamous political prison at the start of January when a thunderous explosion and a blackout announced the start of a new era.
The activist remembers roars of excitement rippling through the jail’s cells as befuddled guards scurried around “like something really big was happening”. Prisoners began to belt out Venezuela’s national anthem, a stirring battle cry against tyranny: “Glory to the brave people! … Down with the chains! … Death to oppression!”
Armas and his fellow inmates had no idea what had caused the pre-dawn commotion on 3 January, although some suspected it was connected to the United States.
Only three days later, during a rare family visit, did the 39-year-old learn that Venezuela’s authoritarian president, Nicolás Maduro, had been captured during a nocturnal assault ordered by Donald Trump.
“In that moment I realised … we had a real opportunity to have a transition to democracy,” Armas said last week after being allowed to leave the El Helicoide prison after 14 months – one of more than 440 political prisoners freed after Maduro’s demise.
Four days after his release, Armas was still trying to comprehend the most startling twist in Venezuela’s turbulent recent history and how it might shape the country’s future.
“It’s weird,” he said, while preparing to head to the latest pro-democracy protest since Maduro’s downfall. “We are not totally in a transition, but I think we are a few steps in that direction.”
Just two months earlier, at the denouement of Maduro’s increasingly despotic rule, such displays of public defiance were inconceivable and would probably have been crushed by security forces. In 2024, more than 2,400 people – including Armas, who was abducted and tortured by men with machine guns – were imprisoned as Venezuela’s dictator tried to silence claims he had stolen the presidential election.
But since Maduro’s removal the mood has shifted, with one recent poll showing a surge in optimism among Venezuelans after years of repression, privation and despair. Last week, Armas was one of thousands of mostly young demonstrators who gathered in cities across Venezuela to demand a full transition to democracy and the complete emptying of political jails.
“I have the right to be in the streets and that’s why I’m here,” said María Fernández, 21, who joined a rally on the palm-dotted campus of the Central University of Venezuela (UCV).
Agustín González, a 20-year-old law student, said he was marching because he wanted neither “imperialist tutelage nor continued authoritarianism” for his homeland.
The fact that Venezuela’s return to democracy was not fully sealed by Maduro’s toppling is explained by the fact that his vice-president, a UCV alumna called Delcy Rodríguez, took the reins immediately after his departure. Trump officials concluded that leaving Venezuela in Rodríguez’s hands, rather than installing the Nobel-winning opposition leader, María Corina Machado, was the best way to avoid violence – and secure access to Venezuela’s vast oil reserves – after its surgical strike on Maduro’s military base.
“Delcy has done a very, very good job and the relationship is strong. The oil is coming out and a lot of money is being made,” Trump said on Friday after his energy secretary, Chris Wright, flew to Caracas – the most senior US official to do so in years.
Six weeks after Maduro’s abduction, Rodríguez remains in power – as do many of his regime’s key figures, including the interior minister, Diosdado Cabello, and the defence minister, Vladimir Padrino López. Last week, in a rare interview with NBC News, Rodríguez insisted free and fair elections would “absolutely” be held – but declined to say when. Her brother, the national assembly chief, Jorge Rodríguez, dashed hopes a vote might be held in the “immediate” future.
Armas understands better than most the bewildering disconnect between the unquestionable changes brought about by Maduro’s overthrow and the simultaneous maintenance of Venezuela’s undemocratic status quo.
On 8 February, he remembers El Helicoide’s director approaching him with news that his prison nightmare was over: “Jesús, come with me … you’re getting out.”
A few hours later intelligence agents were driving Armas to his family home to see his 90-year-old father, who he feared might die while he was incarcerated. “He didn’t say anything. He just cried,” the opposition leader recalled of their first hug in months.
Soon after, Armas was cruising through Caracas’s streets in a convoy of motorbikes alongside colleagues including Juan Pablo Guanipa, a well-known opposition politician who had also just been released. “It was amazing … People were screaming [with] excitement,” he said.
The elation was shortlived. As night fell, a group of armed heavies grabbed Guanipa and disappeared with him before he reappeared under house arrest, wearing an ankle tag. “I was in shock,” said Armas, who immediately grasped the limits of Venezuela’s incipient political thaw. “I thought: ‘OK, if this is happening to Juan Pablo, it’s going to happen to me too.’”
Armas suspected senior officials had been spooked by the outpouring of emotion prompted by Guanipa’s release and feared demands for democracy might spiral out of control if a ceiling was not set.
“They must be worried this could grow as people lose their fear … that this could be like a snowball that will grow and grow and grow,” said the activist, who returned to Caracas to continue his political struggle in 2021 after a spell studying at the University of Bristol as a recipient of the UK’s Chevening scholarship and living in London.
Armas believed regime efforts to thwart a South American glasnost by targeting figures such as Guanipa, who was released on Thursday after the national assembly approved a limited amnesty law, might slow the march towards democracy, but would not halt it.
“Right now my role is to lead the reorganisation of the opposition movement in Caracas and to try to be the voice of the political prisoners,” he said. “I’m going to fight until every political prisoner is free … And I will try to fight until we have a transition to democracy.”

We conduct affairs of state in a building that’s riddled with asbestos and mice. Can’t Britain do any better? | Rupa Huq

Kemi Badenoch, mid-TV interview with Robert Peston at the House of Commons recently, was embarrassingly upstaged by a mouse. Just another day in a parliament building not fit for purpose.
Last week, a critical meeting between the prime minister and his more than 400 MPs plus assorted peers (who total another 800) happened in a room only big enough to accommodate 170. Consider that the Commons chamber itself seats only 430 of the total 650 MPs. That same day, exhibition boards went up around parliament explaining the “restoration and renewal” options for the Palace of Westminster. They are expected to be voted on as early as March.
Consider them and ponder whether this is how you want the nation’s most pressing affairs of state to be organised. One scenario has MPs relocating to different bits of parliament’s footprint while the works are executed, occupying the House of Lords during the redoing of the Commons chamber. There is precedent for this during the blitz when the House of Commons was bombed; many a Churchillian line such as “we will fight them on the beaches” was uttered from the red benches of the Lords rather than the Commons’ green benches.
Then there is the “full decant” option, in which both houses would move while the job is done. Neither option comes cheap. It would be an estimated £8.4-£11.5bn and take 19 to 24 years for the full decant, whereas staying put would come at a whopping £11.8-£18.7bn and take somewhere between 38 and a staggering 61 years.
The Palace of Westminster has been my workplace for 11 years. I love it dearly. But it desperately needs an urgent upgrade. ITV viewers may have been surprised by the sight of Badenoch and a mouse but we 650 honourable members were not. Nor were the few thousand parliamentary pass holders encompassing clerks, journalists and cleaners. Parliament is overrun with vermin – our furry friends can often be seen in parliament’s various dining rooms. We watch as they laugh at the bait boxes laid out for them.
The quantity of repairs needed to bring the place up to scratch is immense. Even the modern part of the parliamentary estate – the 1990s Portcullis House with its glass-topped atrium – has not weathered well. The lack of mobility-friendly features confirms that this is not a place suitable for disabled people – only 12% of the estate floor space has step-free access, which would never be allowed in a contemporary building.
Parliament is awe-inspiring (it’s not many people who get to work under Big Ben), but it’s visibly falling apart – 19 stonemasonry incidents have occurred since 2016. The magnificent gold leaf-finished ceiling of central lobby, which gave the world the verb “to lobby”, has visible gaps and reportedly sheds tiny invisible fragments of asbestos, a hazard to health. The cavernous, ancient Westminster Hall, dating to 1097, where the late Queen Elizabeth II lay in state, is resolutely immune to getting any internet or mobile phone reception; highly impractical if you are arranging to meet people there who are running late and messaging you to say so.
In my 11 years in the job, I have now seen many iterations of the proposals for improvements – including Boris Johnson and Michael Gove’s unpopular wheeze to move parliament to York.
After my third election (I’ve done four), I signed up for the MPs’ parliamentary basement tour and it was like travelling through time to some sort of illicit bat cave. Among the grisly sights were the rusting pipes (14 miles of Bakelite-looking tubing that caused 80 leaks in the archaic steam heating system in 2024-25), the ropey-looking electrics (roughly 250 miles of cabling past its prime) and ample evidence of the rodents that obviously keep busy when not fulfilling supporting roles on television.
We have a prime minister keen to expel political rats out of No 10, but he faces an even more difficult job driving rodents out of the Hogwarts-like parliamentary estate, and making it fit for a thriving, modern democracy.
Whether an upgrade happens because we have all moved into the Lords or because we have temporarily headed off somewhere else altogether, it must happen. If the state of parliament reflects the state of the nation, both need to see better days.

How Trump’s Beijing bargaining could derail Taiwan’s multibillion-dollar defence budget
US leader’s talk of consulting Xi Jinping on arms sales could hand Taiwan’s opposition a ‘lifeline’ to reshape spending bill, experts say

Taiwan’s parliament is set to prioritise review of a disputed NT$1.25 trillion (US$40 billion) special defence budget bill when its new session begins on Tuesday, as pressure mounts from Washington.
But US President Donald Trump’s recent remarks about consulting Chinese President Xi Jinping on arms sales could complicate the debate, potentially giving Taipei’s opposition parties greater room to manoeuvre and reshape the final version of the bill, according to analysts.
The renewed push follows an unusual bipartisan letter from 37 US lawmakers on February 12 urging Taiwan’s legislature to fully fund the eight-year package.

The lawmakers warned that Beijing’s “military pressure is intensifying” and that approving only part of the budget proposed by Taiwanese leader William Lai Ching-te in November “could weaken deterrence”.
They stressed that Taipei “must demonstrate resolve by increasing defence spending” in line with Lai’s proposal.

In response, Taiwan’s legislative speaker Han Kuo-yu said the bill would be “given top priority” once lawmakers returned to work on February 24 after the Lunar New Year recess.
He described Taiwan-US ties as “grounded in shared democratic values and a joint commitment to maintaining stability in the Indo-Pacific”.

US software company OpenMind, according to founder and CEO Jan Liphardt, caused a commotion last year at a park in San Francisco where the firm shot a promotional video.
“A crowd of people came, children came running, cars stopped and the police came,” he said, because “there was a robot in the park”.
In an interview, Liphardt told the South China Morning Post that such a scenario would have been treated differently on the other side of the world. “If a [Unitree] G1 walked across the street in Shanghai, people do not stop. They’ve seen this before.”

That contrast highlighted the opportunity for OpenMind – developer of the OM1 open-source and artificial intelligence-native operating system for robots – to serve as a bridge to the rest of the world for China’s humanoid robot makers.
China is “unquestionably ahead” of the US in robotics hardware, according to Liphardt, citing its mature integrated supply chain and intense domestic competition.

He said OpenMind already worked with several Chinese companies – including Unitree Robotics, UBTech Robotics, AgiBot, LimX Dynamics, Booster Robotics and Engine AI – as these firms turned their attention to overseas markets.

A sketchy recollection
“Trevor Dallen’s mention of Emile Mercier (C8) brought back memories of the books of his cartoons which my older sister collected,” writes Ann Clydsdale of Bathurst. “He had a way with street signs, breaking up words in unconventional ways. Hence, ‘Bus Stop’ became ‘Bust Op’, and ‘No Smoking’ became ‘Nosmo King’. There was also a little old man in a deer stalker hat and with a long beard depicted in most cartoons. Someone told me that it represented Mercer himself. Not sure if that was true or not, though.”
“Nosmo King is still around isn’t he?” inquires Peter Gibbs of Yass. “Signs everywhere. Very popular person.”
Suzanne Saunders of Wadeville has some unwelcome news for Nick Bencsik regarding jingle earworms (C8): “You can’t switch it off, Nick. Actually, you ought to be congratulated.”
“At 76 years, I have decided that my occasional memory loss is due to my hard drive being full, and I would like a way to shed unnecessary data,” says Alan Nicholas of Sandringham. “Like the full lyrics of Itsy Bitsy Teenie Weenie Yellow Polkadot Bikini.”
Paul Fergus of Croydon sympathises with Gail Grogan (C8) over the recent “language abomination” that came in the form of “premise” (singular for a building instead of premises), but has a theory: “I wonder whether the Health official called to task by Gail was laying the foundations for an edifice.”
It makes sense for Eric Scott of Bondi Junction: “Two academics in adjacent apartment blocks used to argue across the gap between their balconies but could never agree because they were arguing from different premises.”
“Listening to a radio news report on the passing of actor Robert Duvall they mentioned one of his early roles was in How To Kill a Mockingbird,” notes Bret White of Sanctuary Point. “It left me wondering if the finches were spared.” Indeed, but it might explain why he agreed to star in Lonesome Dove.
Chris Wilmott of Austinmer says that “the ubiquitous American letter box with the little red flag solves Geoff Bartlett’s ‘do I or don’t I need to look’ problem (C8). No bells or whistles needed. I have been told some are being painted orange of late.” Greg King of Springwood says his parents had one in the 1960s for “their brand new triple-fronted red brick veneer house in Parramatta”, and describes it as “an analogue solution for the times”.

Erdoğan rolls out incentives to expand small livestock farming

President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan on Feb. 21 unveiled a new support package aimed at boosting small livestock farming, saying the government will distribute animals, provide financial assistance and expand agricultural support programs.
Under the project, producers will initially be given 150,000 small livestock animals under favorable conditions. Each producer will receive 95 female and five male animals, while the state will provide annual maintenance and feeding support of 180,000 Turkish Liras ($4,100) for the livestock.
Producers will be able to finance the project through interest-free loans, with repayment options including a grace period of up to two years followed by repayment over as long as seven years.
"We will cover the insurance of the small livestock animals received by our producers benefiting from the project for one year," Erdoğan said at an event with farmers at the Haliç Congress Center in Istanbul.
He also said animals with superior genetics raised on farms of the General Directorate of Agricultural Enterprises (TİGEM) will be distributed according to breeds suited to different regions.
"In this project, we will prioritize women and young producers. We will also give priority to young graduates from veterinary medicine, agriculture and food engineering who apply to this project. In this way, our young people will both establish their own businesses in their homeland and contribute to production and employment," he said.
"We will deliver the first animals to our breeders this year. I invite all young and female producers who want to engage in small ruminant farming to apply to this project."
Erdoğan said the government paid a total of 47 billion liras ($1.07 billion) last year to producers affected by agricultural frost in April, warning that changing climate conditions and global warming mean similar events are likely to continue and urging farmers to take out agricultural insurance.
He added that following livestock support payments made last year under a production plan launched in 2024, as well as payments for plant production will begin next month.
"Starting from March 6, we will transfer 81 billion liras [$1.84 billion] in basic and planned production support payments to our farmers' accounts within one month," he said.
Erdoğan said production has started in 14 "organized agricultural regions" and will begin for the first time in five additional areas this year.
He said total support provided to the sector in 2025 — including direct aid, credit support, investment allocations, intervention purchases and export support — reached 706 billion liras ($16.1 billion), while the amount allocated to agriculture directly and indirectly for 2026 is 939 billion liras ($21.4 billion).

- On 06 February 2026, the Commander in Chief of the Ukrainian Armed Forces (UAF), General Syrskyi, confirmed Ukraine had initiated a counterattack near Huliaipole in Zaporizhzhia oblast. Since the start of this counterattack, Ukraine has taken over 100 sq km of territory, mostly to the north of Huliaipole. In addition, Ukrainian forces also made limited gains to the north of this sector, most notably in the vicinity of Verbove, 14 km southeast of Pokrovske.
- It is likely these efforts have disrupted Russian momentum and delayed Russian offensive operations towards Orikhiv city from the east. Orikhiv is an important fortified logistics hub, underpinning the defence of central Zaporizhzhia.
- Further north, Ukrainian forces maintain control of the city of Kupiansk, a former rail logistics hub in Kharkiv oblast, securing the boundaries to mitigate against continued Russian infiltration attempts. Limited numbers of Russian infiltrators are reported to remain in the city, occupying high rise buildings. Ukrainian forces commenced their counter-attack in the northwest quadrant of Kupiansk in mid-December 2025.

Ben-Gvir's National Guard operating without formal legal approval or clear authority, report shows
Unknown
Unknown Publisher
2026-02-22
09:52:16 UTC
18:52:16 KST

A new report by the Knesset Research and Information Center has found that Israel’s National Guard is recruiting fighters, establishing brigades, receiving budget allocations and conducting operational activities despite the absence of formal legislation or publicly approved regulations governing its authority.
The report, published this week, states that the government has yet to release the official committee report on the guard’s establishment or formally approve its activation. Nevertheless, the operational body is already functioning.
The National Guard is one of the flagship initiatives of National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir. A formal inauguration ceremony was held in January 2025, and designated budget lines were included in the 2026 state budget. Fighters are actively being recruited to “Southern” and “Central” brigades, and the unit has reportedly taken part in operational activities, including dispersing demonstrators during protests against the government.
According to the Knesset report, the National Guard is operating without clear legal authority. The Knesset research center said the National Security Ministry did not respond to repeated requests for information. “The ministry did not respond to our inquiry, despite several repeated reminders,” wrote Dr. Nurit Yachimovich-Cohen, a senior researcher at the center. As a result, the report said, the Knesset, which oversees the government’s work, does not have full information regarding the guard’s powers, chain of command or binding procedures.
The report also highlights the establishment in August 2025 of the “National Guard and Civil Defense Administration,” operating under the National Security Ministry. The administration oversees the National Guard alongside civilian emergency response units and protective infrastructure budgets.
Despite its broad responsibilities and resources, the report states: “We did not find regulation or procedures for the activity of the National Guard or for the activity of the administration.” A government committee that was meant to convene to formulate procedures for the guard has not met, the report said. No dedicated legislation has been enacted to establish the guard as an independent body, nor have comprehensive public procedures been issued clarifying its status.
At the same time, the report notes that the National Guard has been established and is operating in practice. An official inauguration ceremony was held, budgets were allocated through the National Security Ministry, recruitment and training efforts have taken place, and the unit operates on the ground under the Border Police, a branch of the Israel Police.
The guard exists, is funded and carries out operational activity, but without a comprehensive legislative framework clearly defining its status. It remains unclear whether the National Guard is an independent body, a unit within the police or a separate branch within the National Security Ministry. In practice, it operates through the Border Police and the Israel Police, but without explicit legislation defining the lines of authority and subordination among the police commissioner, the minister and professional command ranks. The report also states there is no clear public delineation of powers distinguishing the National Guard from existing forces, nor formal regulation of professional boundaries between the Border Police and the National Guard.
At the inauguration ceremony early last year, Ben-Gvir said: “Our future requires not only relying on existing forces, but developing more and more forces to ensure the stability of the state. The guard is the flagship program — it is a symbol and proof that if you will it, it is no dream. I believe the National Guard will be an integral part of our security system and will provide Israel’s citizens with the sense of security they deserve.”
Police Commissioner Kobi Shabtai’s successor, Commissioner Danny Levy, also welcomed the move at the time, calling the National Guard brigades a “dedicated game-changing force” that would strengthen public security and governance and wage an uncompromising fight against terrorism and serious crime.
Concerns over professional independence
The Israel Democracy Institute, a Jerusalem-based research organization, has expressed opposition to the creation of the body and warned of potential harm to professional independence.
In a legal opinion published by the institute, it said professional independence is a fundamental condition for any body vested with law enforcement authority, as such powers may infringe on human rights including liberty, privacy, freedom of expression and freedom of movement. “Infringement of these rights must be carried out sparingly and only when there is no other way to achieve the purpose of the law,” the opinion said.
The institute also warned that without maintaining professional independence from the supervising minister, there is a risk of selective enforcement, political exploitation of authority or excessive use of powers against political opponents and minorities.
In response, the National Security Ministry and the Israel Police said: “A governmental dialogue is currently taking place between the National Security Ministry, the Defense Ministry and other ministries in order to advance a government decision that will adopt the conclusions of the committee regulating the National Guard.”

Pro-Palestinian activists intimidate Jewish residents in UK, push for Israel boycott

Pro-Palestinian activists in the UK have been accused of intimidating Jewish residents during a door-to-door campaign calling for a boycott of Israeli goods, The Telegraph reported Saturday.
The activists, associated with the Apartheid-Free Zone (AFZ) movement, have been canvassing neighborhoods in Hackney, Bristol, Sheffield, and Brighton, urging residents to shun products made in Israel, the report said.
The campaign, which has sparked significant concern, was criticized on Friday by Jewish groups and politicians, who described the actions as crossing a line of acceptable activism and urged police to take note of allegations of harassment and violence.
The Community Security Trust (CST), a charity dedicated to protecting British Jews from antisemitism, condemned the door-knocking efforts, stating that “turning up uninvited at homes in an area with a large Jewish community to push a political agenda of this nature is intimidating and crosses a serious line.”
The controversy deepened after an alleged incident in Sheffield, where a woman claimed to have been headbutted by an activist associated with the AFZ. The report said the woman was counter-protesting with her partner when she was allegedly assaulted.
Another round of protests is expected over the weekend
Politicians, including Labour MP Peter Kyle, have also raised concerns, with Kyle reporting the activities to local police for possible hate crime investigations.
“My immediate thought was for the appalling scenario of a vulnerable Jewish resident being door-knocked by a gang of people wanting to harangue them,” Kyle told Sky News.
Police said no arrests have been made.
Despite these allegations, anti-Israel campaigners in Bristol and Hackney were preparing for another round of protests over the weekend, while concerns about the safety of Jewish residents continue to grow.
Hackney is home to one of the largest ultra-Orthodox (haredi) Jewish communities outside New York and Israel.

Iran and the United States have differing views over the scope and mechanism to lift sanctions on Tehran in exchange for curbs on its nuclear program, a senior Iranian official told Reuters on Sunday, adding that new talks were planned in early March.
The official said Tehran could seriously consider a combination of exporting part of its highly enriched uranium (HEU) stockpile, diluting the purity of its HEU, and a regional consortium for enriching uranium, but in return, Iran's right to "peaceful nuclear enrichment" must be recognized.
"The negotiations continue, and the possibility of reaching an interim agreement exists," the official said.
Iran's Araghchi to present counterproposal amid nuclear talks
Iran's Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi said on Friday that he expected to have a draft counterproposal ready within days following nuclear talks with the United States this week, while US President Donald Trump said he was considering limited military strikes.
The senior official said Tehran will not hand over control of its oil and mineral resources, but US companies can always participate as contractors in Iran’s oil and gas fields.

Carnival draws thousands to Bern
Thousands of spectators attended the Bern carnival procession and the giant concert on Parliament Square on Saturday.
+Get the most important news from Switzerland in your inbox
The carnival bear, the sacrosanct emblem that was locked up on November 11 and reappeared on Thursday, led the procession through the old town. Dozens of costumed groups and musicians braved the drizzle and set the mood. The procession ended in front of the Federal Palace, where the brass bands gave a “monster concert”.
The Bern Carnival was revived in the 1980s and is currently battling a growing lack in interest. According to the organising committee, the number of musicians taking part in the procession has almost halved. The number of visitors is also down.
+ Why do some Swiss dress up as Japanese during carnival?
The future is uncertain. “We’ll be reassessing the situation every year,” Michelle Uetz, president of the Berner Fasnacht association, told Swiss public broadcaster SRF this week. She added: “We may have to reduce the size of the event in future and adapt the programme.” The financial situation is already a little tight, she said.

Arab, Muslim nations slam ‘inflammatory’ remarks by US ambassador to Israel
Several members of the Arab League, the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) and the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) on Sunday issued a joint statement condemning remarks by the US ambassador to Israel, Mike Huckabee, that it “would be fine” if Israel took over a huge swath of the Middle East.
Arab and Islamic countries issued a joint condemnation on Sunday of remarks by US Ambassador to Israel Mike Huckabee, who suggested Israel had a biblical right to a vast swath of the Middle East.
Huckabee, a former Baptist minister and a fervent Israel supporter, was speaking on the podcast of far-right commentator and Israel critic Tucker Carlson.
In an episode released Friday, Carlson pushed Huckabee on the meaning of a biblical verse sometimes interpreted as saying that Israel is entitled to the land between the river Nile in Egypt and the Euphrates in Syria and Iraq.
In response, Huckabee said: "It would be fine if they took it all."
When pressed, however, he continued that Israel was "not asking to take all of that", adding: "It was somewhat of a hyperbolic statement."
The backlash widened sharply on Sunday as more than a dozen Arab and Islamic governments – alongside three major regional organisations – issued a joint statement denouncing the US diplomat's comments as "dangerous and inflammatory".
The statement, released by the United Arab Emirates' foreign ministry, was signed by the UAE, Egypt, Jordan, Indonesia, Pakistan, Turkey, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Kuwait, Oman, Bahrain, Lebanon, Syria and the State of Palestine, as well as the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation, the Arab League and the Gulf Cooperation Council.
The joint statement affirmed their “categorical rejection of such dangerous and inflammatory remarks”, which contravene the UN Charter and efforts to de-escalate the Gaza war and advance a political horizon for a comprehensive settlement.
The statement noted that "Israel has no sovereignty whatsoever over the Occupied Palestinian Territory or any other occupied Arab lands”, And reaffirmed a “categorical rejection of any threat to the sovereignty of Arab states".

Iran joined the chorus with its foreign ministry accusing Huckabee on X of revealing "American active complicity" in what it called Israel's "expansionist wars of aggression" against Palestinians.
Earlier, several Arab states had issued unilateral condemnations.
Saudi Arabia described the ambassador's words as "reckless" and "irresponsible", while Jordan said it was "an assault on the sovereignty of the countries of the region".
Kuwait decried what it called a "flagrant violation of the principles of international law", while Oman said the comments "threatened the prospects for peace" and stability in the region.
Egypt's foreign ministry reaffirmed "that Israel has no sovereignty over the occupied Palestinian territory or any other Arab lands".
The Palestinian Authority said on X that Huckabee's words "contradict US President Donald Trump's rejection of (Israel) annexing the West Bank".
On Saturday, Huckabee published two posts on X further clarifying his position on other topics touched upon in the interview, but did not address his remark about the biblical verse.
The speaker of the Israeli parliament, Amir Ohana, praised Huckabee on X for his general pro-Israel stance in the interview, and accused Carlson of "falsehoods and manipulations".
Carlson has recently found himself facing accusations of anti-Semitism, particularly following a lengthy, uncritical interview with self-described white nationalist Nick Fuentes – a figure who has praised Hitler, denied the Holocaust and branded American Jews as disloyal.

Government unveils sweeping reforms to cut achievement gap in schools
- The government plans to reform education in England, aiming to halve the achievement gap between disadvantaged and more affluent pupils by the time children born under this government finish secondary school.
- Targeted disadvantage funding for schools will be reformed, moving away from Free School Meal eligibility to consider factors like family income, its duration, and location.
- Two new programmes, Mission North East and Mission Coastal, will be introduced to address the poorer performance of disadvantaged pupils in specific regions.
- Reforms to special educational needs and disabilities (SEND) provision include reassessing Education, Health and Care Plans (EHCPs) at the end of primary school from 2029 and introducing legally binding Individual Support Plans (ISPs).
- There will also be incentives of up to £15,000 for new headteachers in areas needing them most.

Relics of Italy’s patron saint, St Francis of Assisi, to go on public show for first time

ASSISI, Italy – St Francis of Assisi’s skeleton is going on public display from Feb 22 for the first time for the 800th anniversary of his death, drawing hundreds of thousands of visitors.
Inside a nitrogen-filled plexiglass case with the Latin inscription “Corpus Sancti Francisci” (The Body of St Francis), the remains are being shown in the Italian hill town’s Basilica of St Francis of Assisi.
St Francis, who died on Oct 3, 1226, founded the Franciscan order after renouncing his wealth and devoting his life to the poor.
Mr Giulio Cesareo, director of communications for the Franciscan convent in Assisi said he hoped the display could be “a meaningful experience” for believers and non-believers alike.
Mr Cesareo, a Franciscan friar, said the “damaged” and “consumed” state of the bones showed that St Francis “gave himself completely” to his life’s work.
His remains, which will be on display until March 22, were transferred to the basilica built in the saint’s honour in 1230.
But it was only in 1818, after excavations carried out in utmost secrecy, that his tomb was rediscovered.
Apart from previous exhumations for inspection and scientific examination, the bones of St Francis have only been displayed once, in 1978, to a very limited public and for just one day.
Usually hidden from view, the transparent case containing the relics since 1978 was brought out on Feb 21 from the metal coffer in which it is kept, inside his stone tomb in the crypt of the basilica.
The case is itself inside another bullet-proof and anti-burglary glass case.
Surveillance cameras will operate 24 hours a day for added protection of the remains.
St Francis is Italy’s patron saint and the 800th anniversary commemorations of his death will also see the restoration of an Oct 4 public holiday in his honour.
The holiday had been scrapped nearly 50 years ago for budget reasons.
Its revival is also a tribute to late Pope Francis who took on the saint’s name.
Pope Francis died in 2025
‘Not a movie set’
Reservations to see the saint’s remains already amount to “almost 400,000 (people) coming from all parts of the world, with of course a clear predominance from Italy,” said Mr Marco Moroni, guardian of the Franciscan convent.
“But we also have Brazilians, North Americans, Africans,” he added.
During this rather quiet time of year, the basilica usually sees 1,000 visitors per day on weekdays, rising to 4,000 on weekends.
The Franciscans said they were expecting 15,000 visitors per day on weekdays and up to 19,000 on Saturdays and Sundays for the month-long display of the remains.
“From the very beginning, since the time of the catacombs, Christians have venerated the bones of martyrs, the relics of martyrs, and they have never really experienced it as something macabre,” Mr Cesareo said.
What “Christians still venerate today, in 2026, in the relics of a saint is the presence of the Holy Spirit,” he said.
Another church in Assisi holds the remains of Carlo Acutis, an Italian teenager who died in 2006 and who was canonised in September by Pope Leo XIV.
Experts said the extended display of St Francis’s remains should not affect their state of preservation.
“The display case is sealed, so there is no contact with the outside air. In reality, it remains in the same conditions as when it was in the tomb,” Mr Cesareo said.
The light, which will remain subdued in the church, should also not have an effect.
“The basilica will not be lit up like a stadium,” Mr Cesareo said. “This is not a movie set.” AFP

Russia has lost around 1,259,780 troops in Ukraine since the beginning of its full-scale invasion on Feb. 24, 2022, the General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine reported on Feb. 22.
The number includes 890 casualties that Russian forces suffered over the past day.
According to the report, Russia has lost 11,694 tanks, 24,069 armored combat vehicles, 79,500 vehicles and fuel tanks, 37,470 artillery systems, 1,652 multiple launch rocket systems, 1,303 air defense systems, 435 aircraft, 348 helicopters, 142,113 operational-tactical drones, 29 ships and boats, and two submarines.
Ukraine’s General Staff has not revealed its own losses during the full-scale invasion, citing operational secrecy.
While Ukrainian officials rarely disclose figures, President Volodymyr Zelensky told France TV on Feb. 4 that at least 55,000 Ukrainian soldiers have been killed in action since the beginning of the full-scale war, in addition to many more classified as missing in action (MIA).
The intensity of Russian drones and fighting has made it difficult for Ukraine to retrieve the bodies of fallen soldiers, which are needed for DNA confirmation.
Independent Western think-tank reports agree that the Russian casualties significantly surpass Ukraine’s losses, with the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) estimating the ratio to be "roughly 2.5:1 or 2:1."
A January 2026 CSIS report said Ukraine has likely suffered between 500,000 and 600,000 casualties from February 2022 to December 2025, of which between 100,000 to 140,000 are thought to be killed in action (KIA).

Türkiye and Saudi Arabia to sign 5GW renewable deal phase two at COP31

Türkiye and the Saudi Arabian company Acwa are set to sign the second phase of a 5-gigawatt renewable energy cooperation deal at the UN climate summit COP31 to be held in Antalya, Türkiye, later this year, Acwa chairman Mohammad Abunayyan told Anadolu.
The planned signing would cover the remaining 3 gigawatts of capacity under a government-to-government agreement between the two countries, following this week’s deal for the first 2 gigawatts of solar projects in Türkiye's central provinces of Sivas and Karaman.
“We are going to sign 3 gigawatts in renewable and storage by COP31,” Abunayyan told Anadolu in an interview on Friday on the sidelines of the signing ceremony in Istanbul for the Sivas and Taseli solar power plant projects.
The new phase “will be a mix between solar and wind and storage,” he added, noting that the company is also considering integrating storage into the initial 2-gigawatt solar projects.
The first phase, signed this week, is part of a broader 5-gigawatt framework agreed during Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan’s visit to Saudi Arabia on February 3. Abunayyan said that the construction of the 2 gigawatts of solar capacity is expected to begin next year after permits and environmental approvals are completed, with the first electricity targeted for early 2028.
“We are going to start our dispatch of the first electricity of this 2 gigawatts by the beginning of 2028, and we will be able to produce it all in 2028,” he said, describing it as a “very fast track project.”
COP31, scheduled for November 9-20 this year, will be held in the Mediterranean city of Antalya, with a leaders’ summit expected in Istanbul. Nearly 200 countries are anticipated to participate in the UN climate talks, which are set to focus on implementing the Paris Agreement, including emissions reduction targets, adaptation efforts, climate finance, and carbon market mechanisms.
Türkiye's 120-gigawatt renewable capacity target
Abunayyan said the first projects would deliver what he called the most competitive electricity prices in Türkiye while incorporating local content and Turkish contractors. “It will deliver the most competitive cost that you could imagine in Türkiye,” he said. “It’s going to deliver local content.”
He praised Türkiye’s renewable energy strategy, calling it “a great strategy” and “ambitious,” and noted the country’s goal to add 80 gigawatts of renewable capacity by 2035.
“This project … is really a start of this 80 gigawatts,” he said.
Türkiye aims to increase its total installed solar and wind capacity to 120 gigawatts by 2035, which implies adding about 80 gigawatts to current levels. To achieve that target, the country would need to install roughly 9 gigawatts of new capacity each year.
Abunayyan also linked the next phase to the diplomatic visibility of the climate summit.
“We cannot find a better occasion than this great COP31 to demonstrate to the whole world the partnership between Türkiye and Saudi Arabia,” he said. “Türkiye and Saudi Arabia, they are not only giving promises or talks, but they are also implementing.”
The total investment under the 5-gigawatt framework is expected to reach $4-$5 billion, he said, adding that the cooperation would “bring our economic relationship with Türkiye much stronger.”
On financing, Abunayyan said the projects would follow a project finance structure combining equity and international debt.
“Many financial institutions will be behind it and will make it happen,” he said, citing improved economic conditions and credit ratings in Türkiye. Financial close is targeted for 2027.
Beyond solar and wind, Abunayyan said Acwa is also exploring opportunities in green hydrogen and desalination in Türkiye, arguing that renewable energy combined with storage and hydrogen will be central to long-term decarbonization.
“When you have renewable, when you have a very efficient cost of renewable, then you need to think about green hydrogen,” he said, and added: “The green hydrogen is the energy of the future.”

Ahmed Al Ahmed reveals what he said to Bondi gunman when he turned his weapon on him

Ahmed Al Ahmed reveals what he said to Bondi gunman when he turned his weapon on him
From suburban businessman to global hero, Ahmed Al Ahmed says he will never forget the moment he stared evil in the eye and he says it was the sound of women and children screaming for help that gave him the courage to take on a terrorist.
In an Australian first interview with 60 Minutes, the 44-year-old revealed what he said to gunman Sajid Akram after he tackled him to the ground, and how he is still living with two bullets from the December 14 terror attack at Bondi lodged in his shoulder.
He also detailed his snap decision to tackle Sajid Akram and wrestle a high-powered gun from the shooter’s hands.
“He didn’t say anything. Only I can see with his teeth, showing anger, as a devil, you know?” he told 60 Minutes.
The former tobacco shop owner from Sydney’s south visited Bondi Beach that Sunday evening almost by accident, searching for an afternoon coffee with his cousin Hothefa, when they came across the Chanukah by the Sea gathering at Archer Park.
As Ahmed retraced his steps through the park for the first time since that fateful summer evening, he recalled the sound of happy families celebrating the Jewish tradition of light over darkness.
Ahmed can also vividly remember the moment when joy turned to terror, as rapid gunfire erupted.
“I’m hearing heavy, heavy shooting, like a war. I can hear all the kids, women, everyone crying, you know, screaming,” he said.
As Sajid Akram and his son Naveed Akram carried out their lethal attack from the footbridge, Ahmed took cover between two parked cars, metres from the armed men.
Trying to shield himself from relentless bullets being aimed directly at the crowd, Ahmed says it was the harrowing sound of cries for help that propelled him into action.
Footage from that day captured the chilling twist when Sajid Akram left the footbridge and crept along the park’s edge towards hundreds of terrified and helpless people cowering nearby.
Ahmed said he couldn’t see the attacker approaching, but that another innocent bystander crouching nearby mouthed to him that the gunman was on his way.
“This guy kept telling me, ‘he’s coming, he’s coming’ and then he said, ‘he’s here’.”
“I asked God, ‘help me’. I didn’t think, I just saw it, do it.”
Ahmed can still feel Sajid Akram’s “strong and muscular” frame when he leapt onto his back and forced him to the ground.
“I run into him and hit him with my hand, right hand in his head and grab him into my arm, you know, his, his face, his neck, try to hold him, you know, with my arm,” Ahmed said.
Ahmed reveals for the first time what he said to Sajid Akram as he snatched the weapon out of the terrorist’s hands and turned it back on the shooter.
“Motherf---er, stop what you doing … You motherf---er, piece of shit,” Ahmed said.
Ahmed said he does not regret not shooting at the terrorist himself.
“Because I’m a human being, and I don’t wanna put my hand in blood,” he said. “My target was just to take the gun and stop him from killing a human being.”
Fifteen people were killed and 40 more were injured, including Ahmed, who was shot five times in his left shoulder, which he said was payback for trying to stop the atrocity and save lives.
“In this moment, I start screaming, ‘help’ and then asking my God, ‘Give me power, give me patience’,” he said. “I start feeling hot, my heart starts pumping, and then I start feeling sweaty. I was thinking I’m gonna die.”
Still recovering from his critical gunshot wounds, the reality of what Ahmed survived that day is only starting to set in for him. The murder of 10-year-old Matilda, the youngest of the 15 innocent victims, haunts him the most.
“I think all the time about this girl, I cry. Why? Why to the little girl, an angel like her,” Ahmed said.
Two months on from Australia’s deadliest terror attack, Ahmed is still in a lot of pain, two of the five bullets remain lodged within his shoulder and his left hand has little to no feeling.
Medical tests can’t detect any nerve activity yet, adding to Ahmed’s fear that he might never get full use of his hand back.
But asked if he would do it again, the ordinary man who did something extraordinary doesn’t falter.
“I will do it again and again and again. And anywhere in the world. If I have power and I have a life, I will do it.“

Iranian students clash with militia as fresh protests erupt
Marchers condemned Ayatollah Ali Khamenei as a ‘murderous leader’
- Bookmark

Students staged protests at several Iranian universities on Saturday, marking the start of a new semester with clashes between demonstrators and pro-government factions, according to local news agencies and posts on social media.
The unrest coincided with mourning ceremonies, traditionally held after 40 days, for those killed during January’s anti-government demonstrations.
They saw thousands lose their lives in the most severe domestic upheaval since Iran's 1979 Islamic Revolution.
A video, reportedly from Tehran's Sharif University of Technology, showed marchers condemning Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei as a “murderous leader” and advocating for Reza Pahlavi, the exiled son of Iran's deposed shah, to assume a new monarchical role.
State-affiliated news agencies such as SNN carried videos of clashes, with protesters allegedly injuring volunteer student Basij militia by throwing rocks at Iran's top engineering university.
Pro-government Basij members often assist security forces in quelling protests.
Protests were also held in Beheshti and Amir Kabir universities in the capital Tehran and Mashhad University in the northeast, according to videos published by rights group HAALVSH, which Reuters could not verify.
In the western town of Abdanan, a hotspot for protests, demonstrators chanted "Death to Khamenei" and "Death to the dictator" after the arrest of an activist teacher, according to rights group Hengaw and social media posts.
The January protests saw US President Donald Trump slap a new tariff on Iran’s trading partners and move the nuclear-powered USS Abraham Lincoln aircraft carrier to the Middle East.
Mr Pahlavi accused the Tehran regime of killing an Iranian protester “every 14 seconds” amid a brutal crackdown.
However, Mr Trump said he had received assurances that planned executions were not taking place.
January 8 and 9 were the most deadly 48 hours of the protests, when security forces began firing lethal rounds on protesters under the cover of an internet blackout.
A network of doctors inside Iran estimates the national death toll could exceed 30,000 people. This far outstrips the regime’s figure of 3,117 dead reported on Iranian state TV.

Garcia is the new world champion after a unanimous points decision victory against title holder.
Ryan Garcia has won the WBC welterweight title with a dominant unanimous decision over Mario Barrios.
Garcia dropped Barrios in the opening seconds on Saturday night in Las Vegas, Nevada, and controlled the fight with sharp combinations. The 27-year-old stayed patient after the early knockdown and turned more conservative late with a big lead.

At the Paris Agricultural Show, Macron visits in relative calm

The 62nd Paris International Agricultural Show opened without cattle and with a president kept at arm's length. A strange atmosphere filled the aisles of the Parc des Expositions at Porte de Versailles in Paris's 15th arrondissement on Saturday, February 21. For the inauguration of his eighth show as president, Emmanuel Macron found himself at the crossroads of urgent domestic and international issues, as well as facing fierce criticism from agricultural unions deeply dissatisfied with his leadership, all under a tight police presence.
Arriving at around 8:30 am, Macron made a beeline for the show's mascot cow, Biguine, a Brahman from Martinique. But this year, it was only a hologram. An outbreak of lumpy skin disease had forced the cancellation of this emblematic section of the show, where cows and oxen usually mingle with throngs of curious visitors. Fearing contagion, breeders had opted out of the parade.
"It's dismal – there's no smell of cows, no sounds," lamented Stéphane Travert, centrist chair of the Assemblée Nationale's Economic Affairs Committee. President Macron had urged the show's organizers to maintain the presence of cattle in order to preserve the event's agricultural spirit. To no avail. "We can be pleased that we are winning the fight against lumpy skin disease for good. Since the beginning of the year, there have been no new cases," he said.

Palestinian woman killed as Israeli army shells Gaza despite ceasefire
Israeli forces committed hundreds of violations, killing 614, injuring 1,643 others since Oct. 10, Gaza’s Health Ministry says
RAMALLAH, Palestine
A Palestinian woman was killed by Israeli gunfire on Sunday in the northern Gaza Strip, despite a ceasefire agreement in force since Oct. 10, 2025, medical sources said.
The sources said that the 27-year-old lost her life in the town of Beit Lahia.
According to witnesses, the Israeli attack targeted an area outside the army’s deployment and control zone under the ceasefire agreement.
Israeli warplanes also targeted eastern areas of the city of Rafah in the southern Gaza Strip, they added.
Israeli military vehicles also opened fire on the eastern areas of Khan Younis in the south, while naval forces fired toward the city’s coastline, according to the witnesses.
In Gaza City, Israeli fighter jets carried out airstrikes on eastern areas, accompanied by sporadic artillery shelling on the same locations.
The US-backed ceasefire has been in place in Gaza since Oct. 10, halting Israel’s two-year offensive that has killed more than 72,000 people, most of them women and children, and injured over 171,000 others since October 2023.
Despite the truce, Israeli forces have committed hundreds of violations through shelling and gunfire, killing 614 Palestinians and injuring 1,643 others, according to Gaza’s Health Ministry.

UK’s new passport rules for dual citizens are result of border control in digital age
Sweden
Unknown Publisher

From February 2026, most dual British citizens will need to use a British passport to travel to the UK. Presenting only a non-British passport will no longer be sufficient for boarding flights or ferries, unless it carries a certificate (costing £589) that confirms right of abode.
The rule was introduced to align dual nationals with the UK’s new electronic travel authorisation (ETA) system and to prevent confusion in border checks.
In legal terms, nothing fundamental has changed. British citizens still have the right to enter and live in the UK. But in practice, the way that right must be demonstrated has shifted. And that shift tells us something important about how citizenship is being reshaped in the digital age.
Over the past three decades, dual citizenship has become widely accepted internationally. In 1990, fewer than a third of countries allowed dual nationality in cases of naturalisation. By 2016, roughly three-quarters did.
This change reflected globalisation. As populations became more mobile, states adapted. Migrants often maintain attachments to more than one country. Dual citizenship is a pragmatic recognition of that reality, allowing people to belong in more than one place without forcing an exclusive choice.
According to the 2021 census, 1.2% of UK-born residents (587,600) were dual citizens with another country, rising from 0.5% in 2011 (231,600). For non-UK-born residents, 6.5% were dual citizens with the UK in 2021 (648,700), up from 5.1% in 2011 (381,200).
The rise reflects broader demographic change, but it also coincided with Brexit. The number of people holding both British and EU passports increased significantly between 2011 and 2021, suggesting that many UK residents sought to retain EU citizenship protections as the UK left the EU, while some EU residents acquired British citizenship to preserve unrestricted access to the UK.
In other words, dual citizenship in the UK today includes longstanding migrant and diasporic communities, but also a growing cohort shaped by recent geopolitical change.
Digital borders
The UK’s new passport rule does not mean the country is less tolerant of dual citizens. But it is a consequence of borders becoming more digitised in recent years.
Borders today are not confined to passport control desks. They operate through airline check-in systems, pre-travel authorisations, biometric databases and algorithmic risk assessments. Airlines are required to confirm eligibility before boarding. Digital systems match names, dates of birth and passport numbers against centralised records. Such systems prioritise coherence and consistency, aiming to eliminate ambiguity.
But dual citizenship, and transnational life more broadly, produce precisely the kind of complexity that digital systems struggle to accommodate. Names may differ across jurisdictions. Marriage can produce surname changes in one country but not another. Accent marks may appear in one passport and not in its transliteration. Children born abroad may be citizens by descent but have never held a British passport.
There is little room for discretion when border checks are digitised. The administrative solution is to use the British passport when entering Britain. Yet this is not always straightforward. Some dual citizens born abroad have never needed a British passport and must now apply for one in order to travel. Others may consider renouncing British citizenship to avoid the administrative burden — but this option is not available to underage dual citizens.
Dual citizens are not a homogeneous group. They include naturalised migrants who have retained their original nationality; British-born citizens who later acquired another citizenship through residence or marriage; children of mixed-nationality families; foreign-born children of British emigrants who are citizens by descent; and members of long-established Commonwealth communities whose plural affiliations are a result of British imperial history.
For some, the new rule simply means ensuring that their British passport is valid. For others — particularly families living abroad who have never needed a British passport for their children — it introduces an unexpected bureaucratic step.
This is where borders intersect with inequality. Families with easy access to consular services, financial resources and familiarity with UK administrative systems can adapt quickly. Those living further from British bureaucratic infrastructure face greater friction.
The UK’s passport requirement is being introduced during a wider political moment in which states are exerting tighter control over citizenship. In the US, Donald Trump’s administration pledged to restrict birthright citizenship and expand the state’s power to remove citizenship.
In a number of countries, citizenship revocation powers have disproportionately targeted dual nationals, precisely because removing citizenship from mono-nationals would breach international law by rendering them stateless.
What we may be witnessing is not the retreat of dual citizenship, but its transformation. It remains widely tolerated. Yet it is increasingly bureaucratically policed.
The cumulative effect is subtle but significant. Citizenship is no longer just a legal status secured once and for all. It must remain legible to digital border systems and be continuously probed through interconnected databases.
Dual citizenship emerged as recognition that identities and attachments can be layered. Digital borders, by contrast, favour clarity and singular representation. This tension is unlikely to disappear.
The UK’s move signals how, in an era of digital borders and geopolitical uncertainty, the lived experience of citizenship is being reshaped — not through headline constitutional change, but through the quiet reorganisation of administrative systems.

Tributes paid to 6 firefighters killed in central China after truck veers off cliff
Emergency workers were returning from putting out blaze at a hillside home in Hunan province
Relatives, colleagues and residents gathered in a county in central China on the weekend to pay tribute to six firefighters who died after putting out a blaze during the Chinese New Year holidays.
The firefighters were killed on Thursday afternoon when their truck ran off a cliff in Xinhua county, Hunan province, as they were returning from extinguishing a house fire in the hills.
A seventh firefighter in the truck was injured and transferred to a hospital in the capital city of Changsha that evening for further treatment, according to local media reports. The condition of the 29-year-old was reported to be stable before the transfer.
The men were among 10 or so firefighters sent in two vehicles to the scene of the burning timber home along a winding hillside road.
After putting out the blaze, which started at about 1pm, the crew were driving back down the road. One truck went over the edge as it was about to reach the main road at the foot of the mountain, according to media reports.
The crash occurred about 2km (1.2 miles) from the fire site and on a steep section of the hillside road, the reports said.

Iran slams US ambassador’s claim of Israel’s right to all Middle East
Huckabee claims Israel has biblical right to land stretching from Nile to Euphrates rivers, saying ‘It would be fine if they took it all’
TEHRAN, Iran
Iran condemned Sunday remarks by US Ambassador to Israel Mike Huckabee in which he openly accepted Israel’s control over the entire Middle East, including the occupied West Bank.
Foreign Ministry spokesman Esmaeil Baghaei said on the US social media company X that Huckabee’s statements are “a bold testament to American active complicity in Israeli regime's expansionist wars of aggression as well as its colonial genocide of Palestinians.”
Iran decries “‘such extremist ideological rhetoric’ that would only further embolden the occupying regime to persist in its atrocity crimes and illegal measures against Palestinians as well as its constant aggression against the nations of the region,” he added.
Huckabee argued on Friday that Israel has a biblical right to the land stretching from the Nile to the Euphrates rivers, saying on a podcast released Friday: “It would be fine if they (Israel) took it all.”
Huckabee made the remarks in an interview with US journalist Tucker Carlson, during which he defended Israel’s actions in the Gaza Strip and voiced support for the idea of “divine providence” giving control of the region to Israel.
After Huckabee claimed Israel had a divine right to vast portions of the Middle East, Carlson asked him: “What land are you talking about?” Interpretations of the biblical phrase “river of Egypt” vary, with some scholars identifying it as a riverbed in the Sinai Peninsula and others as the Nile.
“It would be fine if they took it all,” Huckabee replied, referring to Israel’s alleged right to the territory stretching from the Nile River to the Euphrates.
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu told news channel i24 last August that he feels “very attached” to the vision of a Greater Israel. He said he considers himself “on a historic and spiritual mission,” including “generations of Jews that dreamt of coming here and generations of Jews who will come after us.”
Greater Israel is a term used in Israeli politics to refer to the expansion of Israel’s territory to include the West Bank, Gaza, and Syria’s Golan Heights, with some interpretations also including Egypt’s Sinai Peninsula and parts of Jordan.

Trump's envoy Witkoff: Putin has never been anything other than straight with me
US President Donald Trump's Special Envoy Steve Witkoff has said that Russian ruler Vladimir Putin has always been straightforward with him during meetings on the Russo-Ukrainian war.
Source: Witkoff in an interview with Fox News, as reported by European Pravda
Details: Speaking about his one-on-one talks with Putin, Witkoff said he had faced criticism over his meetings with the Russian leader.
"He has never been anything other than straight with me. And I say that, and I get attacked. But that's an accurate statement. He has told me that this is what his red lines are. You know, I got attacked for going to meet him eight times," the envoy said.
However, he insisted the meetings were necessary in order to strike a deal and could not have been avoided.
Quote: "How would you make a deal with someone on the other side unless you knew where the other person was coming from? I needed to understand what his motivations were, his goals and so forth. And I actually think that a lot of those meetings now are becoming very relevant. We understand where they [the Russians] are. And I don't think the Ukrainians disagree with us in our assessment. So I think those meetings were important, and hopefully we are going to consummate this whole thing [the war – ed.]."
Background:
- Witkoff also suggested that "good news" on ending Russia's war against Ukraine could emerge in the coming weeks and did not rule out a summit between Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and Putin.
- Following trilateral meetings in Geneva on 17-18 February, Zelenskyy said he sees progress in the military area of the talks but not in the political one.
- On 20 February, Zelenskyy said another round of talks with Russia and the US on ending the war could take place before the end of the month.

14 countries, including Türkiye, condemn US envoy’s remarks on Israeli control over Arab lands
US envoy to Israel argues Israel has 'biblical right' to land stretching from Nile to Euphrates rivers, saying ‘It would be fine if they took it all’
- 14 countries, including Türkiye, Egypt, Jordan, Lebanon, Saudi Arabia, voice 'strong condemnation and profound concern'
ISTANBUL
Fourteen countries and three regional organizations on Sunday condemned remarks by Mike Huckabee, the US ambassador to Israel, who said "it would be acceptable for Israel to exercise control over territories belonging to Arab states, including the occupied West Bank."
In a joint statement, the foreign ministries of Türkiye, Egypt, Jordan, Lebanon, Indonesia, Kuwait, Palestine, Qatar, Oman, Pakistan, Bahrain, Saudi Arabia, Syria, and the United Arab Emirates expressed “strong condemnation and profound concern” over the comments.
The statement was also issued with the participation of the secretariats of the Organization of Islamic Cooperation, the League of Arab States, and the Gulf Cooperation Council.
The ministries described the US envoy’s remarks as “dangerous and inflammatory,” saying they constitute “a flagrant violation of the principles of international law and the Charter of the United Nations” and pose a grave threat to regional security and stability.
They said the comments directly contradict the vision put forward by US President Donald Trump and the Comprehensive Plan to End the Gaza Conflict, which is based on containing escalation and creating a political horizon for a comprehensive settlement that ensures the Palestinian people have their own independent state.
The signatories said "the plan is grounded in promoting tolerance and peaceful coexistence," warning that attempts "to legitimize control over the lands of others undermine these objectives, fuel tensions," and amount to incitement rather than advancing peace.
The ministries "reaffirmed that Israel has no sovereignty over the Occupied Palestinian Territory or any other occupied Arab lands," the statement noted. "They reiterated their firm rejection of any attempts to annex the West Bank or separate it from the Gaza Strip, their strong opposition to the expansion of settlement activities in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, and their categorical rejection of any threat to the sovereignty of Arab states."
The statement warned that "the continuation of Israel’s expansionist policies and unlawful measures will only inflame violence and conflict in the region and undermine prospects for peace."
The signatories called for an end to what they termed "incendiary statements" and reiterated their "commitment to the inalienable right of the Palestinian people to self-determination and to the establishment of an independent state" along the June 4, 1967 lines, as well as to ending the occupation of all Arab lands.
US envoy defends expansive Israeli territorial claims
Mike Huckabee, named US ambassador to Israel in April 2025, is an evangelical Christian who has previously spoken of expansionist claims based on what he described as a “divine right” for Israel in the West Bank.
He argued that Israel has a "biblical right" to the land stretching from the Nile to the Euphrates rivers, saying on a podcast released Friday: "It would be fine if they (Israel) took it all.”
Huckabee made the remarks in an interview with US journalist Tucker Carlson, during which he defended Israel’s actions in the Gaza Strip and voiced support for the idea of “divine providence” giving control of the region to Israel.

Sean Strickland ends Anthony Hernandez’s win streak with TKO victory
The third-ranked Strickland hands Hernandez his first UFC defeat in more than five years.
Former Ultimate Fighting Championship middleweight champion Sean Strickland delivered a knee to the body, followed by punches, to finish Anthony Hernandez with a technical knockout (TKO) victory at 2:23 of the third round in the main event of Saturday’s UFC Fight Night event in Houston, Texas.
After a slow-paced start to the all-American bout, Strickland picked up the pace at the halfway point of the fight as Hernandez retreated.

Tensions rise in the Middle East after US Ambassador to Israel Mike Huckabee suggested Israel could control Arab territories, prompting strong condemnation from Arab and Islamic countries and regional organisations.
A coalition of 14 Arab and Islamic countries, along with the Gulf Cooperation Council, the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) and the Arab League, condemned US Ambassador Mike Huckabee’s comments suggesting Israel could control Arab territories.
The countries said the remarks were reckless, inflaming tensions and undermining peace efforts in the region.
Joint statement and condemnation
The foreign ministries of Qatar, Egypt, Jordan, the United Arab Emirates, Indonesia, Pakistan, Turkey, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Oman, Bahrain, Lebanon, Syria and Palestine issued a joint statement together with the GCC, Arab League and OIC.
They expressed deep concern over Huckabee’s remarks, saying they threaten regional security and violate international law and the United Nations Charter.
The statement emphasised that Israel has no sovereignty over the occupied Palestinian territory or other Arab lands.
The countries called for an end to annexation plans and settlement expansion and reaffirmed support for the Palestinian people’s right to self-determination and the creation of an independent state along the 1967 borders.
Huckabee’s remarks and regional impact
Huckabee’s comments came during an interview where he suggested it would be acceptable for Israel to take control of lands claimed by Arab states, including the West Bank.
The countries warned the remarks could worsen tensions in an already volatile region and undermine efforts toward a two-state solution. Several states called on the US to clarify its official position and reaffirm its commitment to international law.
Diplomatic engagement
Separately, Qatar’s Prime Minister and Minister of Foreign Affairs Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman bin Jassim Al‑Thani spoke by phone with Iran’s Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi, Qatar News Agency wrote on X.
They discussed efforts to de‑escalate tensions and support continued negotiations between the United States and Iran. The call highlights ongoing diplomatic engagement amid wider Middle East tensions.
The incident comes amid ongoing disputes over Israeli policies in the West Bank and Gaza and stalled peace negotiations. Regional leaders warned that remarks legitimising control over Arab lands only inflame violence and make peace harder to achieve.

Russian attacks across Ukraine killed at least 11 civilians and injured at least 38 over the past day, regional authorities reported early on Feb. 22.
Russia launched a large-scale combined drone and missile attack in the early hours of Sunday, firing 50 missiles and 297 long-range kamikaze drones, predominantly towards Kyiv and its suburbs. The Ukrainian Air Force reported downing 33 missiles and 274 drones.
The attack caused a building to collapse in the town of Fastiv, 60 kilometers southwest of Kyiv, killing a 49-year-old man and injuring seven others, according to Kyiv Oblast governor Mykola Kalashnyk. A total of fifteen people were injured across the oblast as a result of the attack, including four children, he said.
Kyiv city mayor Vitalii Klitschko earlier said that two people, a woman and a child, were hospitalized with injuries in the capital.
In Sumy Oblast, a drone strike on an emergency response vehicle killed four people, including a 17-year-old boy, according to regional authorities. The attack injured another passenger. In a similar attack also in the last 24 hours, one man was killed and two others severely injured after a drone struck their car. Four other civilians were also injured across the oblast due to drone and missile attacks in the last day.
In Donetsk Oblast, Russian attacks killed three civilians and injured one other, according to governor Vadym Filashkin.
Russia shelled populated areas at least 596 times in Zaporizhzhia Oblast in the last day, according to regional authorities. Two people died as a result.

Trump says US is sending hospital boat to Greenland
France

18:26:04 KST

Denmark and its territory Greenland on Sunday, February 22, rejected Donald Trump's offer to send a naval hospital ship to the Arctic island coveted by the US leader. A day earlier, Trump said he was sending "a great hospital boat to Greenland to take care of the many people who are sick, and not being taken care of there." But Greenlandic Prime Minister Jens-Frederik Nielsen, who heads the autonomous territory's government, wrote on his Facebook page: "That will be 'no thanks' from us."
"President Trump's idea to send a US hospital ship here to Greenland has been duly noted. But we have a public health system where care is free for citizens," Nielsen said.
Danish Defense Minister Troels Lund Poulsen likewise told Danish broadcaster DR: "The Greenlandic population receives the healthcare it needs. They receive it either in Greenland, or, if they require specialised treatment, they receive it in Denmark." He added: "It's not as if there's a need for a special healthcare initiative in Greenland."
On the day that Trump made his proposal, Danish forces evacuated a crew member of a US submarine off the coast of Greenland's capital Nuuk after the sailor requested urgent medical attention. Denmark's Joint Arctic Command said in a post on Facebook the crew member was flown to a hospital in Nuuk after an unspecified medical emergency on board the vessel.
AI-generated hospital ship
In Greenland, as in Denmark, access to healthcare is free. There are five regional hospitals across the vast Arctic island, with the one in the capital Nuuk serving patients from all over the territory. Without explicitly mentioning the US proposal, Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen said she was "happy to live in a country where access to healthcare is free and equal for all. Where insurance or wealth does not determine whether one receives dignified treatment."
Trump, in his Truth Social message on Saturday proposing a hospital ship, posted an AI-generated image of a US Navy medical vessel, USNS Mercy. It was not immediately clear if that meant he was deploying that ship to Greenland. "We are going to send a great hospital boat to Greenland to take care of the many people who are sick, and not being taken care of there," Trump wrote. "It's on the way!!!" he added.
The US president indicated the deployment was being carried out in coordination with Jeff Landry, appointed in December as the US Special Envoy to the Arctic island.
Aaja Chemnitz, who represents Greenland in the Danish Parliament, wrote on Facebook that while Greenland's health system had its share of problems, they were best resolved through cooperation with Denmark – "which is one of the wealthiest and most educated countries, for example in the field of healthcare. Not with the United States, which has its own healthcare system problems."
Trump has repeatedly said he believes the United States must control Greenland to ensure US national security. Earlier threats he made to seize the territory, by force if necessary, have ebbed since he struck a "framework" deal with NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte to ensure greater US influence.
The defense minister, Lund Poulsen, told DR he was not aware of a possible arrival of the suggested US hospital ship. "Trump is constantly tweeting about Greenland. So this is undoubtedly an expression of the new normal that has taken hold in international politics," he said.

British nuclear-powered attack submarine arrives in Australia for training drill
318-foot-long HMS Anson with 100-member crew, armed with torpedoes, land-attack missiles, anchored at naval base near Perth
ISTANBUL
A British nuclear-powered attack submarine arrived at a naval base in Western Australia on Sunday for a month-long visit, which London hailed as proof of its "unwavering" and "water-tight" commitment to the AUKUS pact, local media reports said.
The 97-meter-long (318-foot) HMS Anson, which has a crew of about 100 and is armed with both torpedoes and land-attack missiles, anchored at a naval base near the city of Perth, the Australian Broadcasting Corporation reported.
It is the first British nuclear-powered submarine to arrive at Australia's west coast since the US, UK, and Australia unveiled the full AUKUS pathway in San Diego, California, in 2023.
According to UK Deputy High Commissioner to Australia Brian Jones, the submarine will undergo maintenance and undertake joint exercises, providing an "invaluable opportunity" to help Canberra develop more experience with nuclear-powered submarines.
Australia's Defense Minister Richard Marles, in a statement, described the visit as a "historic step in our nation’s readiness to operate and maintain conventionally‑armed, nuclear‑powered submarines."
The two countries are also expected to conduct AUKUS Pillar 2 tests while HMS Anson is within Australian waters.
Under the trilateral agreement inked in 2021, the Australian Navy will acquire eight nuclear-powered submarines over the next decade from the US and the UK. The first deliveries are expected to begin in 2032.
Last week, Australia announced that at least $21.2 billion will be spent building a construction yard to eventually build nuclear submarines for Canberra under the AUKUS agreement.

Alcaraz stays perfect in 2026 with dominant Doha title run

World No. 1 Carlos Alcaraz improved to 12–0 in 2026, defeating Arthur Fils 6–2, 6–1 to win the Qatar Open, while Fils capped a breakthrough week with a runner-up finish in Doha.
World No. 1 Carlos Alcaraz extended his unbeaten start to the 2026 season on Saturday, defeating France’s Arthur Fils 6–2, 6–1 to lift the trophy at the Qatar ExxonMobil Open in Doha.
The win improves the 22-year-old Spaniard’s record to 12–0 on the year, continuing the red-hot form he showed in January when he captured the Australian Open title.
“I just played great today and I was really focused,” Alcaraz said afterward. “The finals are where you have to show your best level. I think Arthur started the match… making a lot of mistakes, and that gave me the confidence to play relaxed and calm. He let me dominate the game, dominated every point so I was in a good position almost every time.”
From the first few games, Alcaraz dictated the tempo and kept Fils under constant pressure. Speaking to media in his post-match press conference, the Spaniard struck a more reflective tone when asked about his recent run.
“For me, success is more than getting trophies,” Alcaraz said. “I learn from every match, on and off the court, and from every experience that I am having in my life. I am a totally different person and player since 2022 when I got to No. 1 and won my first Grand Slam.
"I am trying to be a better person and a better player. I am getting more mature and I like the position I am in. That is real success for me. That is why I am proud and enjoying every time I step on the court.”
A breakthrough week for Fils
For Fils, though, this week in Doha was about much more than the final score.
The 21-year-old, now ranked World No. 33, enjoyed one of the best tournaments of his young career. His run included a stunning semifinal victory over 16th-ranked Jakub Mensik.
It marked a significant step forward for Fils, especially considering that just eight months ago, he was sidelined with a stress fracture in his back at last year’s French Open.
“Well, of course, a good week,” Fils told Euronews. “I won four matches in a row. I’m in the final. Of course today, Carlos was on another level, playing way better than me, so he deserves completely the win and the whole tournament. That’s why he’s number one in the world right now. But yeah, I still have to feel the positive and move forward.”
Three meetings, same result
Saturday’s final marked the third career meeting between Alcaraz and Fils, and for the third time, it was the Spaniard who walked away with the win.
The Qatar Open is one of only two ATP Tour stops in the Middle East. Attention now shifts to the Dubai Tennis Championships, which gets underway on Monday.

Türkiye, Saudi Arabia to sign 2nd phase of 5-GW renewable energy deal at COP31
'We are going to sign 3 gigawatts in renewable and storage by COP31,' Abunayyan tells Anadolu in an interview on the sidelines of the signing ceremony in Istanbul for Sivas and Taseli solar power plant projects
ISTANBUL
Türkiye and the Saudi Arabian company Acwa are set to sign the second phase of a 5-gigawatt renewable energy cooperation deal at the UN climate summit COP31 to be held in Antalya, Türkiye, later this year, Acwa chairman Mohammad Abunayyan told Anadolu.
The planned signing would cover the remaining 3 gigawatts of capacity under a government-to-government agreement between the two countries, following this week’s deal for the first 2 gigawatts of solar projects in Türkiye's central provinces of Sivas and Karaman.
“We are going to sign 3 gigawatts in renewable and storage by COP31,” Abunayyan told Anadolu in an interview on Friday on the sidelines of the signing ceremony in Istanbul for the Sivas and Taseli solar power plant projects.
The new phase “will be a mix between solar and wind and storage,” he added, noting that the company is also considering integrating storage into the initial 2-gigawatt solar projects.
The first phase, signed this week, is part of a broader 5-gigawatt framework agreed during Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan’s visit to Saudi Arabia on Feb. 3. Abunayyan said that the construction on the 2 gigawatts of solar capacity is expected to begin next year after permits and environmental approvals are completed, with the first electricity targeted for early 2028.
“We are going to start our dispatch of the first electricity of this 2 gigawatts by the beginning of 2028, and we will be able to produce it all in 2028,” he said, describing it as a “very fast track project.”
COP31, scheduled for Nov. 9-20 this year will be held in the Mediterranean city of Antalya, with a leaders’ summit expected in Istanbul. Nearly 200 countries are anticipated to participate in the UN climate talks, which are set to focus on implementing the Paris Agreement, including emissions reduction targets, adaptation efforts, climate finance, and carbon market mechanisms.
Türkiye's 120-gigawatt renewable capacity target
Abunayyan said the first projects would deliver what he called the most competitive electricity prices in Türkiye while incorporating local content and Turkish contractors. “It will deliver the most competitive cost that you could imagine in Türkiye,” he said. “It’s going to deliver local content.”
He praised Türkiye’s renewable energy strategy, calling it “a great strategy” and “ambitious,” and noted the country’s goal to add 80 gigawatts of renewable capacity by 2035.
“This project … is really a starting of this 80 gigawatts,” he said.
Türkiye aims to increase its total installed solar and wind capacity to 120 gigawatts by 2035, which implies adding about 80 gigawatts to current levels. To achieve that target, the country would need to install roughly 9 gigawatts of new capacity each year.
Abunayyan also linked the next phase to the diplomatic visibility of the climate summit.
“We cannot find better than this great occasion of COP31 to demonstrate to the whole world the partnership between Türkiye and Saudi Arabia,” he said. “Türkiye and Saudi Arabia, they are not only giving promises or talks, they are implementing.”
The total investment under the 5-gigawatt framework is expected to reach $4-$5 billion, he said, adding that the cooperation would “bring our economic relationship with Türkiye much stronger.”
On financing, Abunayyan said the projects would follow a project finance structure combining equity and international debt.
“Many financial institutions will be behind it and will make it happen,” he said, citing improved economic conditions and credit ratings in Türkiye. Financial close is targeted for 2027.
Beyond solar and wind, Abunayyan said Acwa is also exploring opportunities in green hydrogen and desalination in Türkiye, arguing that renewable energy combined with storage and hydrogen will be central to long-term decarbonization.
“When you have renewable, when you have a very efficient cost of renewable, then you need to think about green hydrogen,” he said, and added: “The green hydrogen is the energy of the future.”

MOSCOW, February 22. /TASS/. Russia does not threaten Estonia or other countries, but it will always do what is necessary to ensure its own security. If Estonia has nuclear weapons aimed at Russia, Moscow will aim its own nuclear weapons at Estonia, Kremlin Spokesman Dmitry Peskov said in an interview with Pavel Zarubin, a journalist from Vesti.
"Estonia is very close to us, and we don't threaten Estonia, just like any other European country. However, if there are nuclear weapons on Estonian territory aimed at us, our nuclear weapons will be aimed at Estonian territory, and Estonia must clearly understand it. Russia will always do what it must to ensure its own security, especially when it comes to nuclear deterrence issues," he said when asked a respective question.
Earlier, the Baltic republic's Foreign Minister, Margus Tsahkna, stated that Estonian authorities did not rule out the deployment of nuclear weapons on the country's territory if such a decision was made within the framework of NATO defense plans.

The Israeli army carried out air strikes and artillery shelling across various parts of Gaza early on Sunday, despite a ceasefire agreement in force.
Israeli warplanes targeted eastern areas of the city of Rafah in southern Gaza, eyewitnesses told Anadolu.
Israeli military vehicles also opened fire on the eastern areas of Khan Younis in the south, while naval forces fired toward the city’s coastline, according to the witnesses.
In Gaza City, Israeli fighter jets carried out air strikes on eastern areas, accompanied by sporadic artillery shelling on the same locations, eyewitnesses said.
A US-backed ceasefire has been in place in Gaza since October 10, halting Israel’s two-year offensive that has killed more than 72,000 people, most of them women and children, and injured over 171,000 others since October 2023.
Despite the truce, Israeli forces have committed hundreds of violations through shelling and gunfire, killing 612 Palestinians and injuring 1,640 others, according to Gaza’s Health Ministry.

Iran targets doctors and lawyers for helping protesters
Iranian medics and lawyers tell Caspar Barnes and Moha Tahery about the persecution they face from the Islamic regime for helping anti-government protesters during the deadly crackdown
- Bookmark
- CommentsGo to comments
In the days after Iran’s deadly crackdown on anti-government protesters, Amir*, a doctor in a private clinic outside Tehran, came face to face with one of the Islamic regime’s spies.
According to Amir, the man had entered the clinic during a night shift posing as a patient. Once the time of his appointment came, the man began interrogating the doctor.
He asked whether Amir had been working on the nights of 8 and 9 January – the most deadly 48 hours of the protests, when security forces began firing lethal rounds on protesters under the cover of an internet blackout.
“I dodged the questions as much as I could,” Amir says. “I think he was there to scare me, more than to gather information, because I think they have the information.”
Although he did not disclose this to his interrogator, Amir wasn’t supposed to be working on that now infamous 8 January: a bloodstained date that will likely be etched into the Iranian national psyche for generations.
A network of doctors inside Iran estimates the national death toll could exceed 30,000 people. This far outstrips the regime’s figure of 3,117 dead reported on Iranian state TV.
At around 9pm that Thursday night, Amir tells how he heard that regime forces were firing on protesters with live ammunition. He headed straight to his clinic to support his colleagues: one doctor and five nurses.
Over the course of that deadly weekend, Amir watched 30 people die in his clinic and patched up “between 120 to 150 gunshot wounds”, he says, losing track of the exact number in a muddle of blood and bullet holes.
Amir works in a small general practitioner’s clinic and does not have suitable equipment to treat the type of injuries more often seen on the front line of a war zone.
“There’s nothing I can do for a punctured lung or a gunshot that has broken the forehead,” he says. He and his colleagues were seeing multiple shots to the neck, abdomen and hands.
His patients that weekend ranged from a 12-year-old boy shot in the testicles to a 77-year-old man hit in the chest.
While this was happening, the clinic was also under attack by security forces. “They shot teargas at us. They shot at the doorway of the clinic repeatedly both nights,” Amir says.
Outside the clinic, Amir saw the bodies of two people who had been shot. They may have been alive, but the medical staff were unable to help for fear of being hit by snipers or gunmen. This scene continues to haunt Amir.
Based on conversations with colleagues at other hospitals, he estimates that 400 to 500 people were killed in his city alone over the two deadliest nights of the protests.
At great personal risk, Amir has been handing his mobile number out to friends and colleagues he trusts so the injured can get in touch.
The regime has been tracking down those who attended anti-regime protests. Iran has some of the most advanced surveillance technology imported from China and Russia, according to reports by the British human rights organisation Article 19.
This includes facial recognition tools trained on Uyghurs in western China and censorship hardware which Iran used to entirely cut off its 93 million population from the internet.
A radiologist in the country told The Independent: “Many of the injured people did not go to hospitals out of fear.” He knew of at least one person who had died of their injuries at home.
As well as working in a private clinic, this radiologist works in a military hospital in one of the major cities in Iran.
“All doctors who have not completed their mandatory military service must serve in military medical centres,” he says.
Civilians completely avoid the military hospitals in times of crisis, as security forces are treated there. According to the radiologist, there were no deaths of security forces at the military hospital, although there were severe injuries.
The regime does not allow any independent lawyers to represent the estimated 42,000 people arrested during the protests, according to exiled Iranian lawyer Marzieh Mohebbi.
A prisoner who is lucky enough to survive will face judicial proceedings in which “virtually all principles of fair trial have been eliminated”, Mohebbi says.
Legal professionals have been targeted, too. At least one lawyer has died in police custody, according to the Iran Human Rights Documentation Center.
At the inaugural Board of Peace meeting on Thursday, 19 February, Donald Trump said that he will decide within 10 days if the US will strike Iran.
In June 2025, the US president made a similar statement before joining Israel’s bombing campaign against Iranian nuclear sites during its 12-day war.
In the days following the protests, Amir experienced another spine-chilling appointment – this time coming face to face with a regime gunman.
“He asked me for a day off, to give him a sick note to go home and rest because his finger was tremoring on the trigger,” Amir recalls, his own voice trembling and then trailing off.
“What I could see in front of me wasn’t a fascist, orthodox Islamist, or defender of the Iranian government. I saw a hollow person, and this scares me a lot,” he says.
Amir is no longer afraid of the consequences of disobeying the regime though, even if it costs him his life, he says, adding: “Our problem is not fear. Our problem is hope. People are already dead and are dying now. The question is: for what?”

In Lyon, the far right pays tribute to activist and tries to avoid controversy

The instructions had been clear and supposedly strict: to join the march organized on Saturday, February 21, by far right in Lyon, in memory of one of their own – Quentin Deranque, who died a week earlier from injuries sustained during clashes with far-left activists – participants were required to avoid any distinctive signs associated with this political group.
The task was a tough one. No flags other than that of France, no visible significant tattoos, no insults, no provocative behavior, and not even a balaclava or neck gaiter to cover one's face. The local prefecture had set this last condition in order to authorize the march in memory of the 23-year-old man, whose death is still under investigation, with seven people charged.
These dramatic circumstances did not quieten the far right's desire to turn Deranque into a martyr, quite the contrary. To do so, it was essential to avoid any disturbances, any violence. As one of the organizers put it during the march, half-joking and half-serious: "We're the good guys."
In the early afternoon, several hundred activists from the radical sphere were the first to gather at Place Jean-Jaurès, in lyon 7th arrondissement, about one kilometer as the crow flies from the spot where, nine days earlier, Deranque, separated from his group after clashes, was beaten with horrific violence while he was on the ground, the blows resulting in his death two days later.

Report: amid threat of US war and protests, Khamenei hands Iran’s reins to top adviser

Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei turned in early January to longtime ally Ali Larijani to steer the country amid nationwide protests and the threat of U.S. military strikes, The New York Times reported Sunday, citing interviews with senior Iranian officials and members of the Revolutionary Guards.
According to the report, Larijani, 67, a former Revolutionary Guards commander and veteran politician who now heads the Supreme National Security Council, has effectively been running the country in recent months. His rise has sidelined President Masoud Pezeshkian, a heart surgeon turned politician who has publicly downplayed his political role, saying, “I’m a doctor, not a politician,” and cautioning that he cannot solve all of Iran’s problems.
The Times report is based on interviews with six senior Iranian officials, including one affiliated with Khamenei’s office; three members of the Revolutionary Guards; and two former Iranian diplomats, as well as Iranian media accounts. The officials and Guards members spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss internal deliberations.
According to those sources, Khamenei instructed Larijani and a small circle of political and military confidants to ensure that the Islamic Republic could survive not only potential U.S. and Israeli airstrikes, but also the possible assassination of its top leadership, including Khamenei himself.
Nasser Imani, a conservative analyst close to the government, told the newspaper that Khamenei has a long and close relationship with Larijani.
“The supreme leader fully trusts Larijani,” Imani said in a telephone interview from Tehran. “He believes Larijani is the man for this sensitive juncture because of his political track record, sharp mind and knowledge. He relies on him for reports on the situation and pragmatic advice. Larijani’s role will be very pronounced during war.”
The report said Iran’s leadership is operating on the assumption that U.S. military strikes are inevitable, even as diplomatic contacts over a possible nuclear deal continue. Iran has placed its armed forces on the highest state of alert and is preparing to resist any attack, according to the officials and Guards members cited.
Iran has positioned ballistic missile launchers along its western border with Iraq, within range of Israel, and along its southern coast on the Persian Gulf, within range of U.S. bases and other regional targets, the report said. In recent weeks, Iran has periodically closed its airspace to test missiles and conducted military exercises in the Persian Gulf, briefly shutting the Strait of Hormuz, a critical global energy corridor.
Khamenei has also issued a series of internal directives aimed at ensuring continuity of governance. According to the report, he has designated four layers of succession for military and government posts he personally appoints, instructed senior officials to name up to four replacements and delegated authority to a tight circle of aides in case communications are disrupted or he is killed.
While in hiding during the 12-day war with Israel last summer, Khamenei named three potential successors, though their identities were not made public. Larijani is almost certainly not among them because he is not a senior Shiite cleric, a requirement for the role of supreme leader, the report said.
Still, Larijani is part of Khamenei’s inner circle, which includes Maj. Gen. Yahya Rahim Safavi, the supreme leader’s top military adviser and former commander of the Revolutionary Guards; Parliament Speaker Mohammad Bagher Ghalibaf, designated to lead Iran’s armed forces in wartime; and Ali Asghar Hejazi, Khamenei’s chief of staff.
Some of the planning reflects lessons drawn from Israel’s surprise strike in June that killed senior members of Iran’s military command in the opening hours of the conflict, according to the report. After the ceasefire, Khamenei appointed Larijani to his current post and established a new National Defense Council to oversee wartime military affairs.
“Khamenei is dealing with the reality in front of him,” Vali Nasr, an Iran expert at Johns Hopkins University, told the newspaper. “He is expecting to be a martyr and thinking this is my system and legacy, and I will stand until the end. He is distributing power and preparing the state for the next big thing, both succession and war, aware that succession may come as a consequence of war.”
In the event of war with the United States and Israel, special police units, intelligence agents and Basij militia forces would be deployed in major cities to prevent domestic unrest and identify suspected foreign operatives, according to the officials cited.
The report also said Iranian leaders are weighing contingency plans for political survival if senior figures are killed, including who would manage the country in such a scenario. Larijani is said to top that list, followed by Ghalibaf and former President Hassan Rouhani.
Larijani’s public profile has risen sharply in recent weeks. He has traveled to Moscow for talks with President Vladimir Putin, met regional leaders and overseen nuclear negotiations with Washington. He has also appeared frequently in Iranian media and on social platforms, often more prominently than the president.
Meanwhile, Pezeshkian has appeared to defer to Larijani. According to Iranian media cited by the Times, the president told a cabinet meeting that he had to appeal to Larijani to lift internet restrictions that were harming e-commerce.
The report also described contacts between Washington and Tehran during the unrest. In January, U.S. Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff sought to reach Iran’s foreign minister, Abbas Araghchi, after President Donald Trump warned that the United States would strike Iran if it executed protesters. Araghchi reportedly sought authorization from Pezeshkian to engage, but the president directed him to obtain approval from Larijani instead, underscoring Larijani’s central role.
Iran’s leadership has publicly denied seeking war but has vowed to respond forcefully to any attack. “We are not looking for war, and we won’t start the war,” Larijani said in an interview with Al Jazeera during a visit to Doha. “But if they force it on us, we will respond.”

Defence secretary says he hopes to deploy British troops to Ukraine
The UK’s defence secretary, John Healey, has written in the Sunday Telegraph saying he wants to deploy British troops to Ukraine as it would signal an end to Russia’s war, days before the fourth anniversary of the full-scale invasion. Here is an extract from what he wrote:
There is no heavier burden on any defence secretary or any government than committing our armed forces on operations.
I want to be the defence secretary who deploys British troops to Ukraine – because this will mean that this war is finally over.
It will mean we have negotiated peace in Ukraine. And a secure Europe needs a strong, sovereign Ukraine.
European leaders said in December that Europe was ready to lead a “multinational force” in Ukraine as part of a US proposal for a peace agreement, which has so far appeared elusive due to Moscow sticking to its maximalist demands.
The leaders of the UK, France, Germany and eight other European countries said troops from a “coalition of the willing” with US support could “assist in the regeneration of Ukraine’s forces, in securing Ukraine’s skies, and in supporting safer seas, including through operating inside Ukraine”.
The UK government is currently working alongside allies to establish the so-called “coalition of the willing” which is hoped to deter future Russian aggression once a deal has been agreed to between Moscow and Kyiv.
The UK’s defence secretary, John Healey, said he wants to deploy British troops to Ukraine as it would signal an end to Russia’s war.
Shadow education secretary Laura Trott said the Conservatives wanted funding to be scrapped for “dead-end university courses”, such as creative art courses, which she said were leaving graduates with weaker job prospects.
Trott also said the Tories would oppose any special educational needs and disabilities (Send) support being withdrawn amid reports that under school reforms for England children with education, health and care plans (EHCPs) will be reassessed after primary school from 2029.
The education secretary, Bridget Phillipson, vowed that Send reforms will “transform support for children and families” and said the government would not be withdrawing “effective support” from children with special educational needs and disabilities under its proposals, which will be unveiled in full tomorrow in the schools white paper.
Phillipson pledged that under the government’s overhaul of the Send system it will take weeks for children to get access to support, not months or years.
The schools white paper, which could face major opposition from Labour MPs, is also expected to set a target to halve the disadvantage gap by the time children born in this parliament finish secondary school.
The government is under growing pressure to alter what is widely seen as unfair system regarding “plan 2 loans” affecting millions of people who took out the loans between 2012 and 2023 and are now saddled with huge interest-laden debts. Bridget Phillipson insisted she wanted “fairer” arrangements for graduates but warned the government was dealing with “a question of priorities” when asked whether the burden would be eased.
Searches are continuing at Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor’s previous home as the government did not rule out a judge-led inquiry into the former prince’s links with Jeffrey Epstein following police investigations.
UK in talks with US over ‘best possible deal’ for British firms amid higher tariffs threat
Lisa O’Carroll
High-level talks with the US administration over the threat of increased tariffs are under way as the UK government says it wants “the best possible deal” for UK companies.
Business leaders said they expected the UK to “double down” on the existing Economic Prosperity Deal (EPD) – announced by Donald Trump and Keir Starmer in May last year – rather than walk away.
Trump’s deals with about 20 countries, including the UK, the EU, Switzerland, Japan, Lesotho and others, were put in doubt on Friday after the US supreme court ruled that the president’s existing “reciprocal” tariffs were illegal.
It would potentially mean a 5% increase in the existing 10% tariff for UK exporters and a possible rise for EU exporters, too, as the 15% deal it secured was “inclusive” of previous tariffs and the new tariff is not.
The UK education secretary, Bridget Phillipson, admitted on Sunday that UK businesses faced “uncertainty” after the latest developments but insisted in an interview on Sky News that the UK expected its “preferential” trade arrangements with the US to continue. You can read the full story here:
In an interview with the Russian state news agency Tass, Russia’s foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, previously said any European troop contingents sent to Ukraine would be considered by Russian forces as legitimate military targets.
Lavrov said:
These ambitions (of European officials) have literally blinded them. Not only do they not care about the Ukrainians but they do not care about their people either.
This is the only way to explain the fact that there is still talk in Europe about sending military forces to Ukraine as part of the so-called coalition of the willing. We have said many times that in this case our armed forces would view them as a legitimate target.

Tories would scrap ‘debt trap’ of high interest student loans, says Kemi Badenoch
Jessica Elgot
Jessica Elgot is the Guardian’s deputy political editor
Kemi Badenoch has said the Conservatives would scrap the “unfair debt trap” of high interest rates on student loans, piling pressure on Labour ministers to tackle the growing outrage over the high costs.
The education secretary, Bridget Phillipson, admitted the system of plan 2 loans had “problems” but suggested the government’s priority would be maintenance grants for poorer students, rather than tackling the high interest rates …
“Britain’s young people are facing a worse deal under Labour,” Badenoch said. “Youth unemployment is at its highest level in a decade, graduate recruitment is at the lowest level on record, and too many are going straight from education to welfare. Leaving university has become a moment of despair. Not just for young people but their parents too.
“In particular, the plan 2 student loans are an unfair debt trap: millions of graduates are doing the right thing, paying every month, yet watching the balance they owe growing bigger because interest piles on faster than repayments. If Labour had any sense, Rachel Reeves would act now and use her spring statement to adopt this plan.”
Tories would stop the government funding 'dead-end university courses', shadow education secretary says
We can bring you some more comments from the BBC interview with shadow education secretary, Laura Trott, this morning.
Trott said the Conservatives wanted funding to be scrapped for “dead-end university courses”, which she said were leaving graduates with weaker job prospects amid high youth unemployment and a university funding crisis.
Drawing on evidence from a 2020 report from the Institute for Fiscal Studies, which found up to 30% of young people going to university have “negative returns”,Trott said she would like to close 100,000 university places to “alleviate the debt issue” and in order to “increase apprenticeships”.
Trott refused, however, to list examples of the “dead-end” courses when pressed, only pointing to “creative arts courses”. “75% of the loans that are given out on those are not paid back,” Trott said.
Many degrees that are derided as low-value or soft often are meaningful for the students who study them and have valuable economic and cultural impacts that are not always easily quantifiable.
Under Conservative plans, young people starting their first full-time job would also see the first £5,000 of national insurance they pay put into a personal savings account, which could be used to buy a home, the party says.
In other news, former Conservative prime minister Boris Johnson was interviewed by the BBC’s Laura Kuenssberg on Friday, alongside former head of the armed forces Adm Sir Tony Radakin. Both were in their posts when Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. Here are some of the key lines from the interview, which was broadcast in full this morning:
Radakin said getting the early-morning call on 24 February 2022 was “almost like a relief” because it had been “really clear” Moscow was going to invade and confirmation meant the UK could get on with the task of responding.
Johnson said there was a “weird sense” among some countries at the Munich Security Conference (Feb 18-20 2022) that it may be better – from a “humanitarian perspective” – that Ukraine “folded” so that the war ended “rapidly” – a position he describes as “completely alien” to his way of thinking.
Johnson said his first call was to Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenksyy. “I said to him look the key thing is that you protect yourself. And you are the focus of resistance. If you go then it will be a disaster for Ukraine.”
Radakin said it was always “up for debate” whether “Kyiv would fall within days”.
Johnson agreed the UK and its western allies were naive/enabled the full-scale invasion by allowing Russia to annex the strategic Crimean peninsula from Ukraine in 2014, a move seen by many countries as illegal. He said the west’s failure to properly respond “was tragic” and emboldened Russian President Vladimir Putin.
“We could have solved this problem if we had been clear about what Ukraine was. We continually said to them you can join Nato and you are on the path to the west. But we never made good that promise. I think if we had clarity and simplicity about Ukraine, rather than endless fudge and obscurity, we could have prevented that invasion,” Johnson said.
Radakin said that from the Ukrainian perspective the west’s (military/financial) response to the war – which has often been sluggish – feels like “incrementalism” and is “deeply frustrating”.
Johnson said the UK and its allies should deploy non-combat troops to Ukraine right now (in non-fighting roles) to“flip a switch” in Putin’s head.
“There is no logical reason that I could see why we shouldn’t send some peaceful ground forces there to show our constitutional support for a free, independent Ukraine,” the former prime minister said. For context: Britain and France declared last month they were ready to deploy troops to Ukraine in the aftermath of a peace deal.
Gordon Brown calls for Andrew's use of taxpayer-funded jets while trade envoy to be investigated - report
Former prime minister Gordon Brown has written to six police forces calling for investigations into whether Andrew Mountbatten-Windsorused jets, funded by the taxpayer, and RAF bases during his time as trade envoy to meet up with Jeffrey Epstein, the Sunday Telegraph reported.
Brown’s letters were sent to police in London, Surrey, Sussex, Thames Valley, Norfolk and Bedfordshire this week. Brown – who was Labour prime minister between 2007 and 2010 – reportedly suggested that civil servants be questioned about Andrew’s time as a trade envoy between 2001 and 2011, during which time the former prince had privileged access to government and business contacts.
According to the Sunday Telegraph, the letters sent to the police reflect Brown’s concern that Andrew may have used chartered RAF flights to transport him to personal engagements that could have involved Epstein, and that the former prince may have also leaked confidential information from trips.
Brown wants police to interview officials at the Ministry of Defence, the Department for Transport, the Foreign Office and the Treasury over Andrew’s trade envoy role, according to the report, the contents of which we have not been able to independently verify. Andrew has denied any wrongdoing.
Searches are expected to continue today at Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor’s previous home – Royal Lodge, in Windsor – as calls grow for a probe into the former prince’s links with Jeffrey Epstein.
Lucy Hough speaks to the Guardian’s police and crime correspondent, Vikram Dodd, about what could be next for Andrew here:
Reform supports removing Andrew from line of succession if bill is brought forward, Jenrick says
Reform UK’s new economy spokesperson, Robert Jenrick, said his party would support legislation to remove Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor from the line of succession.
If the government bring forward this bill with the support of the King then we will back it. We have to be realistic. Andrew is the eighth in line to the throne, so there’s no chance of him becoming our monarch.
And so parliament really should be focused on things that are of more importance to the public, whether that’s the economy, crime, the health service, immigration. But if the bill does come before parliament, then we’ll support it.
My main feeling today… emotion is sadness, really for the King and the royal family because they’ve been let down so badly as, of course, have the victims of Jeffrey Epstein.
The King serves this country extremely well and Andrew has disgraced the royal family, and he’s disgraced our country in the process. And whatever happens, whether he’s ultimately prosecuted or not, he should now just go off, lead a private life and allowthe King and the rest of the royal family to continue doing the good job that they do do for us.
'No one is above the law', education secretary says
Trevor Phillips then asks Bridget Phillipson if the government would be open to an “independent, judge-led inquiry”.
The education secretary said:
We’ll look at any sensible proposals that do come forward. But it’s premature at the moment because we do have the police doing their work.
They need to have the time and space to do so. As the king set out, no one is above the law, and it’s right that the police go wherever the evidence takes them. So that has to be the focus at the moment.
King Charles said on Thursday that “the law must take its course” after detectives took the unprecedented step of arresting his brother Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor on suspicion of misconduct in public office.
“What now follows is the full, fair and proper process by which this issue is investigated in the appropriate manner and by the appropriate authorities,” Charles said in a statement. “In this, as I have said before, they have our full and wholehearted support and cooperation.” Andrew has denied any wrongdoing.
Ministers 'not ruling anything out' on Andrew, education secretary says
The government is considering introducing legislation to remove Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor, King Charles’s brother,from the line of royal succession.
Andrew was arrested on Thursday on suspicion of misconduct in public office. Police took him to Aylsham police station in Norfolk for questioning about allegations he shared confidential material with the convicted child sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.
Despite being stripped of his title last year, Andrew is still eighth in line to the throne and an act of parliament would be required to remove him and prevent him from ever becoming king.
Asked by Sky News’ Trevor Phillips when the public can expect to see draft legislation excluding Andrew from the line of succession, the education secretary, Bridget Phillipson,said:
So we’re not ruling anything out around this. But we have obviously got a live police investigation under way, so we’ll not be setting out further steps until the police have been able to do their work. And wherever that investigation, wherever the evidence takes them.
Asked if the government is advising King Charles to remove Andrew from the privy council, she said:
So we’ve said that we have to keep all of these options available to us, but you’ll appreciate that because we have a live police investigation under way it’s right that the police are allowed to do their job. Once that is concluded, then of course we’ll consider in discussion with the royal family, with the King what further action is needed.
But I do just think as well, in all of this, we really shouldn’t lose sight of where this began. And where this began was with young women and girls being exploited over an extended period of time by a network of very powerful men. And we can’t ever forget that.
Parents find prospect of reassessment of educational support 'genuinely frightening', shadow education secretary says
The shadow education secretary, Laura Trott, told the BBC that the Conservatives would oppose any special educational needs and disabilities (Send) support being withdrawn after children’s needs are reviewed.
Trott said:
I think that we want to be really constructive where it comes to this. But I do have some big concerns about what is being floated. Obviously, we’ll see the detail tomorrow. But for too many parents … they’ve had to fight for the support and the idea that they’re going to be reassessed will be genuinely frightening. And I do worry about that …
It hasbeen way too hard for many parents to get that support. But oncethat support is in place for many young people that has actually been very effective. So it’s important that that is not taken away.
And the stress that this system has meant for so many parents up and down the country, they’ve been worried for about a year now because there was a leak that EHCP’s were going to be taken away. Now we’ve got the education secretary on here saying that they might be reviewed. I mean, it’s just too much for parents. They need to just take away this anxiety. And we would absolutely oppose any support being withdrawn.
As we have been reporting, one of the key pillars of the government’s school reforms will be reducing the reliance of children with Send on education, health and care plans (EHCP), which are legal documents that enshrine support for children and young adults up to the age of 25. Councils and charities that provide Send support are struggling with staffing and funding as demand has spiralled upwards.
The provision across the country is extremely patchy, with some parents having to battle local authorities through protracted tribunals to get the right support for their child’s needs. Some have voiced fears about plans to test those who hold ECHPs according to tougher criteria when they move up to secondary school.
What send reforms are expected to be brought in by the government - and will Labour MPs back them?
A total overhaul of the special educational needs and disabilities (Send) system is due to be unveiled on Monday in a schools white paper that could face major opposition from Labour MPs.
The changes will raise the bar at which children in England qualify for an education, health and care plan (EHCP), which legally entitles children with Send to get support. EHCPs will be reserved for children with the most severe and complex needs, but new plans for children on lower tiers will still confer additional support and legal rights.
Parents would have legal avenues for appeals under existing equalities legislation and through the tribunal, said sources with knowledge of the proposed new system.
The Send system overhaul is seen as the most high-stakes policy change the government has taken on since welfare, when plans had to be abandoned after a Labour backbench rebellion. Bridget Phillipson, the education secretary, has been leading a year-long lobbying offensive of hundreds of MPs, with many expressing support and recognition that the system has to change.
But some in government are worried that Labour MPs could vote the plans down in the next parliamentary session if MPs are bombarded with opposition from parents.
Phillipson has said children with Send would “always have a legal right to support”, and Labour would “not just protect but improve that support”. Sources said the old system was broken and, if legislation is successful, those children currently in year 2 with an EHCP would be assessed by schools to decide if they need to remain on a EHCP or their needs could be met “in a more flexible way”. You can read the full story by my colleagues, Alexandra ToppingandRichard Adams,here:
Speaking to the BBC’s Laura Kuenssberg on her Sunday politics programme, the education secretary Bridget Phillipson claimed that Send reforms will “transform support for children and families”.
Phillipson was pressed over whether any child who currently receives support will lose it under the reforms due to be set out in the white paper tomorrow morning (see opening post for more details).
“We are not going to be taking away effective support from children, and what I’ll be setting out tomorrow is a decade long, very careful transition from the system that we have, which everyone recognises isn’t working.”
Kuenssberg questioned the term “effective support”, pointing out that this isn’t the same as saying no child who receives support won’t lose it under the government reforms, something many parents fear. Phillipson said:
Children will be reviewed in terms of their needs assessed. That should be happening at the moment. We’re meant to have a system where every year an EHCP is reviewed. That doesn’t always happen, and where it does, it doesn’t always work well.
But what parents will see when we set out our vision tomorrow is a system where if, for example, your child needs speech and language support, the school will be better able to provide that than is the case right now.
The education secretary is asked about the growing anger of the cost of student loans which has escalated since the chancellor’s decision last November to freeze the salary threshold for “plan 2” student loan repayments for three years.
Rachel Reeves said the salary at which plan 2 student loans must be paid back would be frozen at £29,385 for three years starting from next April. It means borrowers will have to pay even more towards their student loans as they benefit from pay rises.
Interest on the loans is charged at the rate of RPI inflation plus up to 3%, depending on how much a graduate earns. The Tories, which introduced the loans in the coalition government, have now promised to limit the rate on the loans to the retail price index (RPI) in a move that will heap further pressure on the Treasury.
Asked on Sky News how she will help loan 2 graduates saddled with huge amounts of debts, Phillipson said:
Now I get the problem. I see the issue. In reality, as a government, you have to look at a question of priorities and what you can do and how fast you can do it. Given the shape of what we have in the public finances, this is really hard.
Phillipson said she is bringing in maintenance grants for less well-off students. “The threshold for repayment is going up this year. It will then, in future years, be frozen.”
Parents will get educational support for their child within 'weeks', not months or years, education secretary says
Bridget Phillipson is asked about the government’s school reforms, namely around those concerning children with special educational needs and disabilities (Send) in England.
Trevor Phillips points out to her that there are 1.7 million children with special educational needs, nearly 500,000 of whom are school pupils. He says the proportion of children with education, health and care (EHCP) plans – which identify a child’s needs and set out the support they should receive – has been increasing. He asks why this may be and Phillipson replies:
Part of what we’ve seen is that support for children with Send has been treated almost as an entirely separate issue, rather than it being integral to our school system. Lots of children at some point during their school lives will experience some form of challenge, will need extra support.
But the system that we have at the moment… is one that has made it the case that in order to get the support that children need, parents have to fight really hard to get that education, health and care plan. I’ve heard from so many parents just how difficult, how devastating that has been. It can take years. It’s really adversarial.
Pressed by Trevor Phillips if the government is promising that an EHCP determination will be delivered within weeks, not months or years, Phillipson said:
Yes. We will make sure that children get support much, much more quickly than is the case right now. And the commitment that I give to parents is that when they see all of the documents published tomorrow what they will see is a government that is focused on delivering better outcomes for their children. I am fiercely ambitious for every child in our country.
Phillipson later confirmed it will become “a question of weeks, not a question of months and years”. Many EHCPS are issued by local authorities beyond the 20 week deadline.
Education secretary to face questions as government sets out plans to halve attainment gap in England’s schools
Good morning and welcome to our live coverage of UK politics. The education secretary, Bridget Phillipson, will be speaking to the BBC and Sky News shortly and will likely be asked about government plans to halve the attainment gap between the poorest pupils in England and their more affluent peers.
The schools white paper, set to be published in full tomorrow, will set a target to halve the disadvantage gap by the time children born in this parliament finish secondary school.
It will detail proposals to change the criteria under which schools receive funding to support the most disadvantaged students, and will set out two new programmes to tackle performance of disadvantaged pupils locally in the North East and on the coast.
In the latest GCSE results, the disadvantage gap index for year 11s stood at 3.92, according to the Department for Education (DfE).
It had previously narrowed from 4.07 in 2011 to a low of 3.66 in 2019/20 with some small fluctuations in between. It then widened again post-pandemic to the highest it had been in a decade at 3.94 in 2022/23.
Phillipson, a Sunderland MP who grew up in the north-east, said the reforms will help end the “one-size-fits-all system” and present a “golden opportunity to cut the link between background and success”.
The schools white paper will also reportedly set out proposals to transform the special educational needs and disabilities (Send) system, in what could be one of the defining policy challenges of Keir Starmer’s fragile administration.
Children with a legal right to special needs support will face a review when they move to secondary school, my colleagues Alexandra Topping andRichard Adams report.
The reforms will raise the bar at which children in England qualify for an education, health and care plan (EHCP), which legally entitles children with Send to get support.

Swiss pop art pioneer Peter Stämpfli dies
Swiss artist Peter Stämpfli died on Friday at the age of 88. This was announced by his Parisian gallery Georges-Philippe & Nathalie Vallois.
+Get the most important news from Switzerland in your inbox
Born in Deisswil, canton Bern, in 1937, Stämpfli was known in particular for his works with car tyres, the French news agency AFP wrote on Saturday.
Stämpfli trained at the Biel School of Applied Arts and began exhibiting in numerous galleries in the 1960s. He left Switzerland for France in 1959 and later lived in Switzerland several times.
Over the years, his works have been included in the collections of the Museum of Modern Art (MoMA) in New York and the Centre Pompidou in Paris. “What characterised me was the desire to isolate the object against a white background. To remove it from its history, from its context,” he explained in 2018 on the occasion of an exhibition at Galerie Vallois.

Peter Stämpfli: the tyre as a life’s work
In addition to sculpting, Stämpfli also devoted himself to filmmaking, in particular making short films. According to the SIKART encyclopaedia of art in Switzerland, Stämpfli belongs to the generation of artists closely associated with pop art on the one hand and minimal art and conceptual art on the other. However, despite all the similarities, it is obvious that Stämpfli is not at home in any of these art movements, but rather moves in a border area in which he develops his ideas of object, structure and space, it said.
In 1967, Stämpfli represented Switzerland at the 9th São Paulo Biennale in Brazil and in 1970 at the 35th Venice Biennale.

Thousands march in France for slain far-right activist, blame hard left for his death

Thousands march in France for slain far-right activist, blame hard left for his death
1 detained; officials say more arrests possible as police investigate Nazi salutes, racist slurs and homophobic insults
LYON, France (AFP) — Thousands of people marched in southeastern France on Saturday under heavy security in tribute to a far-right activist whose killing, blamed on the hard left, has put the country on edge.
The crowd — many wearing black and some covering their lower faces with masks — marched through the city of Lyon carrying flowers and placards bearing pictures of Quentin Deranque and the words, “Justice for Quentin” and “The extreme left kills.”
The 23-year-old died from head injuries following clashes between radical left and far-right supporters on the sidelines of a demonstration against a politician from the left-wing France Unbowed (LFI) party in Lyon last week.
The authorities had deployed heavy security, including drones, fearing further clashes at the event that saw at least 3,200 people attend, according to local officials.
Hours before the gathering, French President Emmanuel Macron had urged “everyone to remain” calm.
He said the government would meet next week to discuss “violent action groups” in the wake of the fatal beating, which has ignited tensions between the left and right ahead of the 2027 presidential vote.
“In the Republic, no violence is legitimate,” said Macron, who will be unable to contest next year’s election after hitting the two-term limit.
The march went ahead without clashes, although one person threw an egg from a building, and police said another person was detained for carrying a knife and hammer.
More arrests are possible as police investigate suspects behind Nazi salutes, racist slurs and homophobic insults made during the procession and caught on video shared online, the local prefecture said.
Some residents living along the route hung signs from their windows reading “Lyon is antifa” or “Love is greater than hate.”
‘Defend his memory’
Mourners had first gathered in the church frequented by Deranque before his death and his portrait was hung from the facade of the administrative headquarters of the Auvergne–Rhône-Alpes region.
Laurent, a friend of Deranque, attended “to defend his memory” in the setting “where Quentin expressed himself most intensely, namely the Catholic Church and the traditional rite,” he said.
One of the rally’s organizers, Aliette Espieux, former spokesperson for the anti-abortion movement, told AFP she wished for a “peaceful tribute.”
She hit out, however, at Jordan Bardella, the president of the far-right National Rally party, which senses its best chance ever of scoring the presidency in next year’s vote.
Bardella had urged his supporters not to attend the rally, with Espieux saying, “I don’t find that very honorable.”
According to the Deranque family’s lawyer, Fabien Rajon, his parents would not take part in the rally, adding they hoped would go ahead “without violence” and “without political statements.”
Several ultra-right-wing groups, including Deranque’s nationalist Allobroges Bourgoin faction, had nonetheless heavily publicized the march on social media, stoking authorities’ concerns of unrest.
Calls to ban rally
Ahead of the rally, some residents barricaded the ground floor windows of their apartments in fear.
“At my age, I’m not going to play the tough guy. If I have to go out somewhere, I’ll avoid the places where they’re marching,” said Lyon local Jean Echeverria, 87.
“They’ll just keep fighting each other, it’ll never end. Between the extreme of this and the extreme of that, it’s non-stop,” he added.
The event went ahead despite calls from Lyon’s left-wing green mayor, Gregory Doucet, and LFI coordinator Manuel Bompard for the state to ban it.
But Interior Minister Laurent Nunez declined to ban the rally, arguing that he had to “strike a balance between maintaining public order and freedom of expression”.
Deranque’s death has provoked a reaction from US President Donald Trump’s administration, with State Department official Sarah Rogers on Friday branding the killing “terrorism” and claiming that “violent radical leftism is on the rise.”
That came a day after Macron pushed back at comments by Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni on the death, suggesting she refrain from commenting on France’s internal affairs.
Six men suspected of involvement in the fatal assault have been charged over the killing, while a parliamentary assistant to a radical left-wing MP has also been charged with complicity.

SIA flights to and from New York cancelled as ‘super bomb’ blizzard aims heavy snow at US north-east
Sign up now: Get ST's newsletters delivered to your inbox
Across New York City and the north-east, 30 million people in the US are under blizzard warnings from a powerful winter storm that threatens to drop heavy, wet wind-blown snow starting from Feb 22 and has already grounded more than 1,000 flights.
All kinds of travel are expected to be near impossible, and the system may lead to widespread power cuts.
The National Weather Service updated its forecast on the afternoon of Feb 21, calling for a long stretch along the East Coast to get up to nearly 51cm. Mayor Zohran Mamdani warned New Yorkers the blizzard may be more dangerous than a storm that hit the city in late January
“I am asking all New Yorkers to stay inside and stay off the roads for your safety,” Mr Mamdani said at a news conference on Feb 21. “These have the potential to be even more hazardous conditions than we faced the last time around.”
New York subway trains may run with delays and the Long Island Railroad will run on a weekend schedule on Feb 23, Metropolitan Transportation Authority chairman Janno Lieber said.
New Jersey also declared a state of emergency and Connecticut Governor Ned Lamont urged people to stay off the roads from the night of Feb 22 to the morning of Feb 23.
The blizzard warning stretches from Virginia to Massachusetts, including New York, Newark, Providence and Boston.
More than 1,097 flights for Feb 22 and 23 have been cancelled, according to FlightAware, an airline tracking service. The majority are at New York’s airports, along with Boston, Newark and Atlanta.
Singapore Airlines flights to and from New York airports from Feb 22 to Feb 24 are among those that have been cancelled.
The storm is forecast to strengthen so quickly on Feb 22 – with its central pressure, a measure of strength, dropping 24 millibars in 12 hours – that the US Weather Prediction Center is calling it “a super bomb”, said Mr Brian Hurley, a senior branch forecaster at the agency.
Mr Hurley said: “It is going to stay awhile, too. It is going to hang around for much of Monday.”
NYC infrastructure
New York City officials will deploy 2,600 sanitation workers in 12-hour shifts as snowfall begins on the morning of Feb 22, though there “will be no clean-ups over the course of this storm”, Mr Mamdani said.
“Our focus over the course of this storm is not going to be on physical infrastructure,” he said. “It’s going to be on people getting homeless New Yorkers inside.”
With temperatures near freezing, the snow will be wet and heavy. Combined with winds gusting as high as nearly 89kmh, they are almost certain to topple power lines and trees, causing power cuts.
Ground travel will be dangerous, and the Weather Service warns anyone venturing out to take a survival kit with them.
Passenger-rail carrier Amtrak said on Feb 21 that it will make service adjustments to some routes in the North-east Corridor on Feb 22 and 23.
The storm will start as rain in Washington early on Feb 22, before changing to snow there and in Baltimore and Philadelphia. Washington may get about 7.5cm. Snow will start falling in New York late on the morning of Feb 22, and build with intensity with the worst coming overnight into Feb 23.
“Everything will be closed on Monday,” said Mr Frank Pereira, a senior branch forecaster at the Weather Prediction Center. “There will be no Monday morning commute for New York City, Boston and along that whole I-95 corridor.”
Singapore Airlines flight cancellations
Singapore Airlines said in an advisory published on Feb 21 that these flights would be cancelled (all times local):
SQ24 departing Singapore for New York (John F. Kennedy) on Feb 22 at 12.10pm
SQ23 departing New York (John F. Kennedy) for Singapore on Feb 22 at 10.05pm
SQ26 departing Frankfurt for New York (John F. Kennedy) on Feb 22 at 8.35am
SQ25 departing New York (John F. Kennedy) for Frankfurt on Feb 22 at 8.15pm
SQ24 departing Singapore for New York (John F. Kennedy) on Feb 23 at 12.10pm
SQ23 departing New York (John F. Kennedy) for Singapore on Feb 23 at 10.05pm
SQ26 departing Frankfurt for New York (John F. Kennedy) on Feb 23 at 8.35am
SQ25 departing New York (John F. Kennedy) for Frankfurt on Feb 23 at 8.15pm
SQ22 departing Singapore for New York (Newark) on Feb 23 at 12.40am
SQ21 departing New York (Newark) for Singapore on Feb 23 at 9.35am
SQ22 departing Singapore for New York (Newark) on Feb 24 at 12.40am
SQ21 departing New York (Newark) for Singapore on Feb 24 at 9.35am
The national carrier said it will contact all affected customers to inform them about the flight cancellations.
As the situation remains fluid, other flights may be affected, it said, advising customers to visit its flight status page for the latest flight information.
Those who have been affected by the flight cancellations will be rebooked on alternative flights, or they can seek a full refund of the unused portion of their ticket.
People who booked directly with SIA may use its assistance request form
The airline apologised to all affected customers for the inconvenience caused. BLOOMBERG

20,000 troops to patrol Gaza under Trump’s ‘board of peace’ plan
- President Donald Trump has revealed details of his Gaza reconstruction plan, featuring a "board of peace" and an initial $7bn (£5.2bn) fund from various nations.
- A key element is the deployment of an International Stabilisation Force, led by a US general, with Indonesia pledging 8,000 troops out of a total 20,000 soldiers.
- The plan's success relies on the disarmament of Hamas, which Trump said he group had agreed to.
- The "board of peace" comprises numerous Middle Eastern and other nations, but notably excludes Palestinian representatives and major Western allies such as the UK, EU, France, and Germany.
- Concerns include the board's perceived colonial structure, the lack of Palestinian input, and the significant shortfall in funding compared to the estimated $70bn required for Gaza's full reconstruction.

Ruth Langsford shares nightmare Strictly experience that caused panic attack
‘I had a deep sense of dread in the pit of my stomach,’ the ‘Loose Women’ star said of nerve-inducing moment
- Bookmark
- CommentsGo to comments
Ruth Langsford has opened up about a nightmare Strictly Come Dancing experience that left her suffering a panic attack on live television.
The former This Morning host was a contestant on the BBC competition in 2017, performing with former professional-turned-judge Anton Du Beke.
But Langsford developed an intense case of stage fright in the first live show, which prompted Du Beke to take her to the studio canteen to assure her she would be OK.
”As time passed, my nerves got worse and worse, and I had a deep sense of dread in the pit of my stomach,” she explained in an extract from her new memoir, obtained by MailOnline.
Langsford said her “brain seemed to detach” from her body” as she walked down the stairs to get on the dance floor to perform a waltz to “This Nearly Was Mine" from the musical South Pacific.
“I was aware of just how many people were in the studio. I live and breathe live television so that wasn’t a problem, but I had never performed in front of a big audience before and I swear I could see the whites of their eyes.”
She continued: “I couldn’t move and I felt dizzy. I had no saliva in my mouth, so my smile was more of a grimace with my lips stuck to my teeth. My heart was beating so loudly I could hear it in my ears, and I was convinced the audience would be able to hear it, too.
At this stage, Langsford thought: “I am going to faint. Right here, on Strictly. A live show. Nobody has ever done that before. Maybe they’ll cut the cameras or focus on the judges?”
Her then-husband Eamonn Holmes was in the audience, and he realised something was wrong. “Unbeknownst to me, at that moment Eamonn turned to Jack and said: ‘I think she’s in trouble.’ He could tell from my wide-eyed stare.”
Langsford described the dance as “an out-of-body experience” and said that Du Beke carried her around “like a rag doll”. She said it was much later that she realised she’d had a panic attack.
“If that was my first time and I was convinced I was going to die of nerves, how could I do this every week? Anton was going to hate me. I was going to hate me,” she said.
“What I realised in hindsight was that I had suffered a panic attack, not something I’d ever experienced before.”
Langsford, who received 16 out of 40 points for the dance, made it through to week eight of that year’s series, which saw Holby City actor Joe McFadden lift the Glitterball trophy. Du Beke replaced Bruno Toniolo as a full-time judge on the series in 2021.
In 2025, reality star Vicky Pattinson admitted she almost let her nerves about taking part on the show prevent her from becoming a contestant.
She told her fans: “I knew before Strictly even started I was going to struggle with my nerves and anxiety... so much so, that I almost said no to this incredible opportunity. I almost let my fear stop me from doing something amazing.”
“But I absolutely don't want that nasty little inner critic to dictate my life.. I don't want it to convince me that I'm not capable of doing brilliant things once in a while.”
Pattinson finished in eighth place on the show, which was ultimately won by Lioness Karen Carney.

According to Astra, citing regional authorities and police, the first explosion occurred after patrol officers arrived at a store on Danylyshyna Street following a report of unlawful entry. A second explosion followed when another patrol unit reached the scene.
Mayor calls incident a terrorist attack
Lviv Mayor Andriy Sadovy described the incident as a terrorist act in a statement issued shortly after midnight.
“Lviv. This was a terrorist attack. At present, 14 injured have been hospitalized. Doctors are providing all necessary assistance. Law enforcement and all relevant services are working,” Sadovyi wrote.
He urged residents to remain calm and rely only on official information.
Regional prosecutors said that at approximately 12:30 am, police received a call to the emergency number reporting a break-in at a store located at 20 Danylyshyna Street. Upon arrival of the first patrol unit, an explosion occurred. A second blast followed after the arrival of another crew.
Authorities confirmed that a patrol vehicle and a civilian vehicle were damaged in the explosions.

Israeli army launches airstrikes, artillery shelling on Gaza despite ceasefire
Israeli forces committed hundreds of violations, killing 612, injuring 1,640 others since Oct. 10, 2025, Gaza’s Health Ministry says
GAZA CITY, Palestine
The Israeli army carried out airstrikes and artillery shelling across various parts of the Gaza Strip early Sunday, despite a ceasefire agreement in force.
Israeli warplanes targeted eastern areas of the city of Rafah in the southern Gaza Strip, eyewitnesses told Anadolu.
Israeli military vehicles also opened fire on the eastern areas of Khan Younis in the south, while naval forces fired toward the city’s coastline, according to the witnesses.
In Gaza City, Israeli fighter jets carried out airstrikes on eastern areas, accompanied by sporadic artillery shelling on the same locations, eyewitnesses said.
A US-backed ceasefire has been in place in Gaza since Oct. 10, halting Israel’s two-year offensive that has killed more than 72,000 people, most of them women and children, and injured over 171,000 others since October 2023.
Despite the truce, Israeli forces have committed hundreds of violations through shelling and gunfire, killing 612 Palestinians and injuring 1,640 others, according to Gaza’s Health Ministry.

Report: Khamenei hands effective control of Iran to Ali Larijani
Unknown
Unknown Publisher

18:01:05 KST

In early January, as Iran grappled with nationwide protests, Khamenei turned to a trusted deputy to steer the country through the crisis: Ali Larijani, one of the Islamic Republic's most senior national security figures.
Since then, Larijani, 67, a veteran politician and former commander in the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, has been effectively running the country. He currently heads the Supreme National Security Council. His rise has pushed aside Pezeshkian, a heart surgeon turned politician, who has endured a challenging first year in office and has publicly remarked, "I am a doctor, not a politician," saying he should not be expected to solve Iran's many problems.
The account of Larijani's ascent and of the deliberations within Iran's leadership, as President Donald Trump's administration threatens war, is based on interviews with six senior Iranian officials, including one affiliated with Khamenei's office; three members of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps; two former Iranian diplomats; and reports in Iranian media.
Khamenei instructed Larijani and several of his close allies in the political and military establishment to ensure that the Islamic Republic survives not only potential US and Israeli bombing, but also any attempt to assassinate its senior leadership, including Khamenei himself, the six officials and Guard members said.
Nasser Imani, a conservative analyst close to the government, said in a telephone interview from Tehran that Khamenei has maintained a long and close relationship with Larijani and turned to him at this critical moment of military and security crisis.
"The Supreme Leader has no doubt in his complete trust in Larijani. He believes Larijani is the right man for this sensitive juncture because of his political record, sharp intellect and knowledge," Imani said. "He relies on him for situation reports and pragmatic advice. Larijani's role will be especially prominent in wartime."
According to six senior Iranian officials, Khamenei has issued a series of directives in the event that any top-ranking official is harmed. He has designated four layers of successors for every military and governmental position that he personally appoints. He has also instructed all senior officeholders to name up to four replacements and has delegated authority to a small circle of trusted loyalists to make decisions should contact with him be severed or if he is killed.
While in hiding during the 12-day war with Israel last June, Khamenei selected three candidates who could succeed him. Their names have never been made public. However, it can be said with certainty that Ali Larijani is not among them, as he is not a senior Shiite cleric, a basic requirement for any potential successor.
Nevertheless, Larijani has for years been considered part of Khamenei's inner circle of loyal supporters. That circle includes his senior military adviser and former commander of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, Yahya Rahim Safavi; Mohammad Bagher Ghalibaf, a former Guards commander and current parliament speaker, whom Khamenei appointed as a kind of deputy to command the armed forces during the war; and his chief of staff, cleric Ali Asghar Hejazi.
Part of this planning stems from lessons learned from the 12-day war, which wiped out Iran's senior military chain of command in its opening hours. After the ceasefire, Khamenei appointed Larijani as secretary of the Supreme National Security Council and established a new national security council, headed by Ali Shamkhani, to manage military affairs during the war.

'Always there for us': Jewish-Kurdish alliance grows in Europe
Unknown
Unknown Publisher

09:00:46 UTC
18:00:46 KST

An extraordinary alliance between Jews and Kurds has been taking shape across Europe in recent months. Since the October 7 massacre, joint initiatives began emerging in several countries – congresses, solidarity demonstrations, and cultural events. "The Kurds were there for us after October 7," said Rebecca Laes-Kushner, one of the founders of the Jewish-Kurdish Alliance in Switzerland, known as the KJA. "I don't have to hide my identity from them. They actually encourage me to shout even louder that I'm Jewish and that I support Israel."
The emergence of such initiatives simultaneously in several countries led to the organization of the first Jewish-Kurdish Congress in Berlin last September. The congress drew attention from Kurds worldwide, including from Syria and Iraq. "We looked into whether there had been any meaningful cooperation between Jews and Kurds in Europe in recent years and found nothing of the kind," said Elio Adler, founder of WerteInitiative (a German civil society organization promoting democratic values) and one of the congress's organizers.
"We had three messages: to show German society that two minorities with strong identities are loyal to Germany and to democracy, to show Jews that there are people from the Middle East who stand with them, and to show Kurds that Jews see their pain and appreciate their support."
The congress drew sharp reactions from opponents. "Our enemies called it the second Zionist conference in Berlin," said Cahit Basar, secretary-general of the Kurdish Community in Germany. "But we received an excellent response from the Kurdish community. We have a saying that Jews and Kurds are partners in fate – our right to self-determination has been denied, and we share the same enemies: radical Islam, the extreme right, the extreme left, and enemies of democracy." Following its success, a follow-up conference was held in London with representatives from across the continent to build a coordinated European network. "If our communities work only for themselves, we will always be weak," Basar explained. "We have the same enemies – we need to act together."
Basar himself visited Israel in 2007 and the experience deepened his connection to the cause. "I found an open, democratic, tolerant society," he recalled. "I met a huge number of Kurdish Jews – there are about 200,000 to 300,000 in Israel. Seeing them dance and speak Kurdish freely without feeling threatened – that impressed me. Israel is the only country in the Middle East where Kurds can express themselves freely, without torture and death." Adler added, "The Kurds have always been there for the Jews. They have never let us down. There were groups whose support came and went, but the Kurds were always there."
Yet despite the Israeli government's declaration that Kurds are "our natural allies," many Kurds have been disappointed by the absence of direct help during the massacres of Kurds in northeastern Syria. "Because of their love for Israel, they were hurt by the current government," said Laes-Kushner. "They ask why Israel does nothing for them and does not stand by their side."
Basar, too, expressed disappointment – though he directed his criticism at the world as a whole rather than at Israel specifically. "Our brothers and sisters are being slaughtered, and world public opinion couldn't care less," he said. "When it comes to Israel, everyone takes to the streets and talks about it in parliament and in the media, but when it comes to the Kurds – complete silence." He nonetheless underscored Israel's strategic interest. "Kurdish lives in Syria are an insurance policy for Israel's existence. In the Kurdish cities of northern Syria, hatred of Israel does not exist. Abandoning the only democrats in Syria to the Islamists would mean a defeat for the entire West."
Beyond politics, the alliance also offers a sense of belonging. "As a Jew, when I move to a new place and see a Jewish family name on a mailbox, it gives me a sense of security – that Jews can live here," said Adler. "It turns out Kurds feel the same way – that if a Kurd lives in the building, there's an ally who can understand you. I pray that if Jews see a Kurdish flag on a building, or if Kurds see an Israeli flag, they will feel brotherhood. I hope Israel does not forget them. We are doing everything we can to build this alliance in an institutionalized and organized way."
In Switzerland, the alliance has already made its mark on the ground – with joint Nowruz (the Kurdish New Year) celebrations, shared demonstrations and cultural events. The plans include a congress in Israel at the end of 2026.
"As far as I'm concerned, it's not only the 300,000 Kurdish Jews in Israel who represent 300,000 reasons to fight for Israel," Basar concluded. "It's also the need to fight for the survival of the Jewish homeland and the only liberal society in the Middle East."

Less snow, or more risk? What you need to know about avalanches and climate change
Unknown
Unknown Publisher

09:00:33 UTC
18:00:33 KST

Avalanches kill about 100 people in Europe each year, with vast masses of ice, snow and rock regularly crashing down on hikers and skiers who have been caught unawares.
The structure of the snow, angle of the slope and variation of the weather can dictate whether a gentle disturbance – like a gust of wind or the glide of a snowboard – can trigger a deadly shift in the mountain.
How dangerous are avalanches? Experts say the risks of an avalanche should be thought of like a flood: you have to consider both the chance of the hazard and the damage it will do.
“Avalanche risk in the European Alps is nowadays mostly for mountain practitioners who trigger avalanches themselves,” said Nicolas Eckert, a climatologist specialising in mountain risk at Université Grenoble Alpes. “However, such accidental avalanches are only a small portion of the total number of avalanches.”
Avalanche hazard levels are particularly high after heavy snowfall, and weather conditions earlier in the winter can prove decisive to the strength of the snow.
“Limited early‑season snowfall can lead to the formation of persistent weak layers within the snowpack,” said Giacomo Strapazzon, a medical doctor and director of the Mountain Clinic at the Institute of Mountain Emergency Medicine. “Once these weak layers become buried under subsequent snowfalls, they can create highly unstable conditions that favour human‑triggered avalanches.”
Experts say the danger is compounded because many people engaging in winter sports recreationally are unfamiliar with warning bulletins and fail to adjust their behaviour accordingly.
Are avalanches getting more deadly? Each year, about 100 people die in avalanches in Europe – a trend that scientists have found to have stayed broadly steady over the last four decades. Fatalities fell slightly in 2023-24, when 87 people died, and again in 2024-25, when 70 people died. European Avalanche Warning Services (EAWS) had already recorded 99 deaths by the middle of February 2026.
Experts say exposure to avalanches has been rising with an increase in the number of off-track skiers, who are exposed to greater danger than those on controlled tracks. But this shift has not resulted in a rise in deaths because it has been compensated by better warnings, safety equipment and – in recent years – stable snow conditions.
“Overall, we have seen a slight decline in the annual number of fatalities, despite a massive increase in the number of ski touring days undertaken in Switzerland,” said Kurt Winkler, a scientist at the Institute for Snow and Avalanche Research in Switzerland. “This massive decrease in risk cannot be explained by climate change. Other factors, such as faster rescue operations and better avalanche forecasts, appear to be far more important.”
Is climate change making avalanches worse? Ski resorts across the continent have begun to close due to a lack of snow, with half of Europe’s 2,200 ski resorts projected to suffer “very high risk” to snow supply if global warming hits 2C above pre-industrial levels. Studies suggest climate change will make avalanches smaller and less common, as rising temperatures melt snow and shorten the season.
“However, due to the higher water-holding capacity of warmer air, heavy snowfall events might increase in magnitude – especially at high elevations,” said Elias Zubler from Switzerland’s Federal Office of Meteorology and Climatology. “The model projections show a general decrease in the frequency of heavy snowfall events, but an intensification of events is possible, especially at high elevations and in the core winter season.”
Such a rise in high-elevation avalanches could pose a serious risk to skiers, who make up most of the deaths, and mountaineers. Climate change is also likely to result in a higher share of avalanches with snow that is wet and dense, allowing them to pack more punch.

Listen on
In der rheinland-pfälzischen Landeshauptstadt Mainz bereitet sich Alexander Schweitzer auf seine erste Bewährungsprobe als gewählter Regierungschef vor. Es ist ein Spiel gegen die Zeit und gegen den Bundestrend, bei dem der SPD-Ministerpräsident auf die Karte des regionalen Pragmatismus setzt. Während die Bundespolitik in Berlin oft von schrillen Tönen geprägt ist, kultiviert Schweitzer auch im Wahlkampf bis zum 22. März das Image einer soliden, fast schon demonstrativ unaufgeregten Regierungsarbeit als Markenkern. Um die jahrzehntelange Vorherrschaft seiner Partei an Rhein und Mosel gegen eine erstarkende CDU zu verteidigen.
Im Gespräch mit Alexander Schweitzer geht es um das Spannungsfeld zwischen sozialdemokratischen Gerechtigkeitsfragen und der notwendigen Nähe zum Mittelstand. Er skizziert seine Vision einer Erbschaftsteuer, die extrem vermögende Dynastien stärker in die Pflicht nimmt, ohne dabei das Rückgrat der heimischen Wirtschaft zu gefährden. Dabei wird deutlich, wie sehr der „rheinland-pfälzische Weg“ auf persönlichem Vertrauen und einer bewussten Abgrenzung vom Berliner Polit-Chaos fußt, wobei Schweitzer auch für unkonventionellen Allianzen und um liberale Wähler wirbt.

Swiss chosen to develop four museums in Benin

Swiss chosen to develop four museums in Benin
Swiss palaeontologist Jacques Ayer has been appointed by the government of Benin as managing director of four new public museums that will showcase Beninese art, culture and history.
Jacques Ayer, a palaeontologist from canton Fribourg, couldn’t have been more surprised by his appointment as managing director of the Réunion des Musées publics (RMP, a consortium of public museums) in Benin, West Africa.
This monumental project involves four museums currently under construction in four cities: the Musée international de la Mémoire de l’Esclavage (international museum of the memory of slavery) in Ouidah, dedicated to the history of the slave trade in the 17th and 18th centuries; the Musée des Rois et des Amazones du Dahomey (museum of kings and Amazons of Dahomey) in Abomey, which will restore the city’s royal palaces; the Musée international du Vodun (international Vodun museum) in Porto-Novo, which will focus on Benin’s religious heritage and Africa’s Vodun communities; and the Musée d’art contemporain (contemporary art museum) in Cotonou, to promote Beninese and other African artists working today.
Ayer was appointed by Benin’s council of ministers at the recommendation of the country’s president, Patrice Talon. Now based in Cotonou, the country’s economic capital, Ayer began his new job in January. He has until 2029 to complete his ambitious work on the museums.
Eclectic background
Ayer comes well prepared for the job ahead. A palaeontologist by training, with a master’s degree in geology from the University of Neuchâtel, he has “been around the block a few times”, as he puts it.
From 1994 to 2004, he was the curator of the Earth sciences department at the Muséum d’histoire naturelle (museum of natural history) in Neuchâtel. He then ran the Jurassica Museum in Porrentruy, canton Jura, before directing the Muséum d’histoire naturelle in Geneva from 2012 to 2020.
Just over four years ago, he established his own consulting firm called Muséolis, based in Geneva. This allows him to develop museum projects, for which he can draw on 30 years of experience and contacts.
“My eclectic profile worked in my favour with the Beninese government,” Ayer says. “In addition, there’s my personal interest in Africa. My wife is originally from Nigeria. She’s not involved in setting up the RMP, but she opened my eyes to the question of African heritage quite a while ago.”

Africa’s relevance is growing – and everyone wants in
Ayer’s passion for African art is a huge asset. But he is not from Benin. It was unclear whether the Beninese would approve of a European at the head of a national project focused on the country’s heritage.
“I have to admit that I received a very warm welcome,” Ayer says. “But the reactions online were mixed. Some people were surprised by my appointment, but never opposed.” He adds that “these four institutions must be established rapidly, under optimal conditions. And Benin does not yet have much experience in this area. With this large-scale project, the country is acting as a pioneer in Africa. It therefore needed technical assistance and practical skills to ensure that the museums are developed in a way that is lasting”.
A pioneering project
That said, Ayer does not intend to import a Western model of museum science to Benin, which, as he points out, would not necessarily meet the expectations of the local population. “My goal,” he says, “is to create a model here that incorporates African artistic sensibilities”.
He cites the future Musée international du Vodun as an example. “It will allow us to highlight art used mainly for religious or social rituals and therefore deeply rooted in local traditions. I plan to restore the original function of these works. So there’s no question of enclosing them in glass cases, as is the custom in Europe. You could imagine, for example, creating historical tours for the public through certain villages in the country where these items are still used in ceremonies.”

Looted colonial art: ‘There are no limits to restitution’
Before Ayer arrived in Cotonou, Beninese religious institutions, historians, and scientists had already started examining how to promote the country’s heritage. “What I can add to this,” Ayer says, “is my experience in strategy and operations. In short, establishing an organisational framework”.
As he is eager to strengthen cultural programmes and foster interaction with the public, he is planning educational workshops for museum staff that provide suitable training in the arts. Ayer believes that knowledge transfer is essential. “It’s very important to think of my mission as transitional. The field of museum science is complex, so I want to prepare the future management personnel, to train them so they can take full ownership of the artistic projects after I leave,” he explains.
Creating partnerships
Ayer believes cultural exchange is another important element of this training. He sees in Benin an admirable openness and flexibility. “It’s an asset that will allow me to create partnerships with Swiss museums and even to consider university exchanges,” he says. These would allow Swiss art students to benefit from organised programmes in Benin. In turn, Beninese students wishing to enrich their education could spend time in Switzerland. “We mustn’t forget that our country has some great innovative institutions,” Ayer says.
The RMP will also create new opportunities for the restitution of Beninese art stolen during the colonial era. “Switzerland is a springboard for my contacts with Europe. I will apply all of my expertise in the service of cultural cooperation between the ‘old continent’ and Benin,” he says.
In 2021, France returned 26 of Abomey’s royal treasures to Benin. “They represent only a tiny fraction of the Beninese and African heritage still held in Europe. The 26 treasures will be exhibited in the future Musée des Rois et des Amazones du Dahomey,” Ayer says. “The RMP will, I hope, give European countries a sense of security when they recognise the capacity of Benin’s institutions to house works of art under excellent conditions.”

Dog abandoned at airport check-in finds forever home
A dog that was abandoned at an airport check-in counter has been adopted by the police officer who rescued him.
The pooch, nicknamed "Jet Blue," was found tied to a baggage sizer at Harry Reid International Airport on 2 February.
Police said the owner had not completed the required paperwork to travel with the dog as a service animal and was denied a boarding pass before leaving the dog behind and going to the departure gate.
The woman was subsequently arrested and booked for animal abandonment and resisting arrest, authorities added.
Animal Protective Services took in Jet Blue, but his owner never returned. A rescue charity then stepped in.
In an update on 21 February, Las Vegas police said Officer Skeeter Black's family was selected as Jet Blue's new forever home, having already been approved months ago.

UK Should Send Non-Combat Troops to Ukraine ‘Now’ – Boris Johnson

Former UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson has called for UK and allied troops to be deployed to Ukraine in non-combat roles “now.”
Interviewed by the BBC’s Laura Kuenssberg alongside Admiral Sir Tony Radakin, Johnson also remarked that Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine could have been prevented if Western allies had paid closer attention to Russian President Vladimir Putin’s increasing aggression, and the precedent set by the Kremlin’s annexation of Crimea in 2014.

“If we can have boots on the ground after the war, after Putin has condescended to have a ceasefire, then why not do it now?” Johnson said.
“If we are willing to do it in the context of a ceasefire, which of course puts all the initiative, all the power in Putin’s hands, why not do it now?” he emphasized, warning that if Ukraine were to become a “vassal state of Russia,” it would become Putin’s decision who comes to the country, but that – right not – “it’s up to the Ukrainians.”
The former UK prime minister’s comments come in the wake of UK Defence Secretary John Healey saying he would send British troops to Ukraine once the warring countries had reached a peace deal.
Johnson and Radakin agreed that the West had been too slow and cautious in providing support to Ukraine, including supplies of vital weapons, with Radakin describing the approach taken as “incrementalism” and acknowledging frustration on the part of Kyiv.
No Illusions: What Will Really Stop the War?
Johnson referred to “needless” delays in providing Ukraine with what it needed, pointing out that when Kyiv received what it asked for, it was ultimately to the country’s advantage, putting pressure on Putin.
Responding to the latest comments, a UK Ministry of Defence spokesperson said: “We are proud of UK leadership on Ukraine – supporting the fight today and working to secure the peace tomorrow.”
The spokesperson added: “It’s why this government is providing the highest ever level of military support, including a recent half-billion-pound air defence package just last week, accelerating £200 million for the UK military to prepare for any Ukraine deployment, and working with over 30 nations through the UK-led Coalition of the Willing.”
“Tragic”
On whether the full-scale invasion of Ukraine could have been prevented, Johnson made clear his view that the West did not take Putin’s machinery of aggression seriously enough and that “the failure to do anything in Crimea was tragic.”
“If we’d had clarity and simplicity about Ukraine, rather than endless fudge and obscurity, we could have saved that, we could have prevented that invasion,” Johnson remarked.
He also cited the West’s “failure in Syria to punish Bashar al-Assad for using chemical weapons” as a key factor emboldening Putin.
“If we’d had clarity and simplicity about Ukraine, rather than endless fudge and obscurity, we could have saved that, we could have prevented that invasion,” Johnson remarked.
Radakin called on the UK government to “resolve” its promise to spend 3.5% of national income on defense by 2035, noting that while Russia is “weak,” it remains “dangerous.”

Mum issues vaccine plea after daughter’s death from rare measles complication
- Sarah Walton died at 45 from subacute sclerosing pan-encephalitis (SSPE), a rare and devastating brain condition caused by a mutated measles virus.
- She caught measles at 11 months old – too young for the MMR vaccine – and developed SSPE at 25, which gradually robbed her of the ability to walk, talk, and swallow.
- Her mother, Jo Walton, is now urging parents to get their children vaccinated with the MMR jab, stressing that SSPE is a preventable illness that should not be happening in the 21st century.
- Ms Walton said that measles can cause fatal complications, including encephalitis and severe neurological illnesses, and that vaccination can prevent such tragedies.
- This plea comes amidst national concern in the UK over decreased measles vaccine uptake, which has led to a recent outbreak in northeast London.

DHS suspends PreCheck and Global Entry amid government shutdown

A grouping of major US airlines said the US Department of Homeland Security gave travelers scant warning ahead of the temporary suspension of its PreCheck and Global Entry programs from Sunday, amid a shutdown of much of the agency.
The halt in the programs run by the DHS will begin from 6 a.m. ET, after the partial shutdown began last week, following the failure of Republicans and Democrats to clinch a deal on immigration enforcement reforms.
"Airlines for America is deeply concerned that ... the traveling public will be, once again, used as a political football amid another government shutdown," Chief Executive Chris Sununu said.
News of the suspensions came at "extremely short notice to travelers, giving them little time to plan accordingly," he added in a statement, urging Congress to "get a deal done."
A similar shutdown last fall caused losses of $6.1 billion across the travel industry and related sectors, he said.
"TSA and Customs and Border Protection are prioritizing the general traveling population at our airports and ports of entry and suspending courtesy and special privilege escorts," Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said.
"We are making tough but necessary workforce and resource decisions to mitigate the damage," she added in a DHS statement to Reuters.
DHS redirects staff as programs paused over funding gaps
The pause in programs is among the emergency measures DHS is taking to redirect staffing more than a week after Congress failed to send it more money, the Washington Post said.
PreCheck had more than 20 million active members, the TSA said in 2024, while total vetted airline passengers in the DHS' traveler programs, including Global Entry, exceeded 40 million.
The PreCheck program allows approved passengers through a dedicated, faster security lane at US airports and is designed to reduce wait times and streamline screening.
Global Entry expedites US customs and immigration clearance for pre‑approved, low‑risk international travelers entering the United States.
Sunday's moves follow orders from the Trump administration last week to another constituent of the DHS, the Federal Emergency Management Agency, to suspend deployment of aid workers to disaster-affected areas due to the shutdown.

NASA is taking steps to potentially roll back the Artemis II rocket and Orion spacecraft to its Vehicle Assembly Building after observing an interrupted flow of helium, the space agency said on Saturday. "This will almost assuredly impact the March launch window," NASA said.
NASA said it is taking steps to roll back the Artemis II rocket and Orion spacecraft to the Vehicle Assembly Building at the agency’s Kennedy Space Center in Florida.
The agency observed overnight an interrupted flow of helium in the Space Launch System rocket’s interim cryogenic propulsion stage. Helium flow is required for launch.

NASA said on Friday it was targeting March 6 for the launch of four astronauts around the moon and back as part of its Artemis II mission.
The planned Artemis II crew includes three US astronauts - Reid Wiseman, Victor Glover and Christina Koch - and a Canadian astronaut, Jeremy Hansen. The mission is poised to be the farthest human flight into space ever, and the first crewed moon mission since the US Apollo program more than half a century ago.
Artemis II is a precursor to NASA's planned astronaut moon landing with Artemis III, which is scheduled for 2028.

Boxing legend Floyd Mayweather Jr. is coming out of retirement after his spring exhibition bout with Mike Tyson.
Mayweather, who turns 49 on Tuesday, retired with a perfect 50-0 record after beating MMA star Conor McGregor in August 2017. The fight against Tyson will be his ninth exhibition match since his retirement at age 40.
"I still have what it takes to set more records in the sport of boxing," Mayweather said Friday in a written statement to ESPN. "From my upcoming Mike Tyson event to my next professional fight afterwards, no one will generate a bigger gate, have a larger global broadcast audience and generate more money with each event than my events. And I plan to keep doing it with my global media partner, CSI Sports/FIGHT SPORTS."
The April 25 exhibition with Tyson reportedly will take place in Africa in the Democratic Republic of Congo.
Tyson (50-7), 59, last fought against Jake Paul on Netflix in a global phenomenon on Nov. 15, 2024. Tyson lost the eight-round bout by unanimous decision and hasn't won a fight since Feb. 22, 2003, against Clifford Etienne.
Mayweather comes out of retirement for a new fight
Mayweather won 15 major world championships across five weight classes, with 27 of his 50 wins by knockout.
Richard and Craig Miele, co-founders of promoter CSI Sports/FIGHT SPORTS, released a written statement on the return of "Money" Mayweather.
"Signing Floyd Mayweather to un-retire after he captures another worldwide audience with his Mike Tyson match-up, highlights our commitment to providing our global audience with the most high-profile fighters in the sport," they said.
"Floyd will once again continue to dominate boxing with the biggest audience and highest gross events of all time, and we are proud and privileged to be able to do so with our global team at CSI Sports/FIGHT SPORTS. We look forward to even more announcements that will excite fans and continue to build the sport in 2026!"

Seven bodies have been found in Lake Baikal in Russia's Siberia after a tour bus carrying eight Chinese tourists plunged into the water when the ice broke as it crossed the frozen lake on Friday, the Russian emergency ministry said.
One of the Chinese tourists who had been on the bus managed to escape, Irkutsk regional governor Igor Kobzev said on the Telegram app, and the region's prosecutor's office said a criminal case had been opened over the incident.

The ministry said rescuers had conducted an inspection of the scene using an underwater camera and that diving operations were planned.
"The depth at the site of the accident is 18 meters (59 feet)," it said in a statement.
Lake Baikal, the world's deepest freshwater lake, located north of Mongolia, is a popular destination for tourists.
Chinese tourism in Russia has soared in recent years amid closer ties between the two neighbors and the introduction of a mutual visa-free travel regime.

Iran may be capable of producing industrial-grade bombs in 'probably a week,' Witkoff says
Unknown
Unknown Publisher

17:55:20 KST

US Special Envoy to the Middle East Steve Witkoff told Fox News on Saturday that Iran could theoretically be about a week away from being able to enrich its existing uranium to a weaponized level, though the envoy left out that Iran currently has no access to its material, no machines to enrich it, and no weapons program to use it for any operational purpose.
“They’re probably a week away from having industrial-grade bomb-making material. And that’s really dangerous. So they can’t have that,” Witkoff said on Fox News’s My View with Lara Trump, clearly wanting to highlight the severity of the potential future nuclear issues should Iran rebuild all the other elements of its nuclear program, which were bombed in June 2025.
In June 2025, Israel and the US destroyed Iran’s entire fleet of around 20,000 nuclear centrifuges, its entire multifaceted weaponization program, most of its three major nuclear sites, and dozens of minor nuclear sites. It also killed most of its leading nuclear scientists, and it caved in portions of its nuclear facilities, making it hard for the Islamic Republic to access its existing enriched uranium.
Prior to June 2025, Iran had been a week away from weaponizing its uranium – if it chose to do so – and would then have been around three to six months away from the ability to implant the uranium in a missile, where it would have assembled the components for a nuclear weapon.
That tiny window was deemed so small (and it had shrunk fast from an original two-year window) that Israeli intelligence no longer believed it would necessarily catch when Iran crossed the threshold for a nuclear bomb if it did not attack.
Currently, Israel and the US believe that the Islamic Republic is at least two years away from being able to produce a nuclear weapon, given all of the many items it must rebuild.
However, Witkoff seemed to be focusing on the fact that Iran has shown it can get quite close to the weaponized uranium level, to explain why the Trump administration does not want to let it enrich uranium anymore going forward, as Washington starts to lay out more of its potential case for going to war with Tehran.
In the candid interview, Witkoff also said that President Donald Trump wasn’t exactly upset about Tehran’s unwillingness to reach a deal, but more “curious.”
“I don’t want to use the word frustrated,” the envoy said, offering a rare glimpse into Trump’s decision-making process on the issue.
“It’s curious. He’s curious as to why they haven’t capitulated... under this sort of pressure, with the amount of sea power, naval power, that we have over there.”
Witkoff restated Trump’s previous commitment to “zero enrichment” by Tehran in any future deal. “There have been some very hard red lines drawn,” he said.
Trump, however, is reportedly considering an Iranian proposal that would allow so-called “token” uranium enrichment.
According to the report, the Trump administration is open to a limited compromise, as long as it can be verified that any uranium enrichment is purely civilian and cannot be used as a stepping-stone toward nuclear weapons development.
The special envoy also pointed to domestic pressure in Iran as another factor in the administration’s decision-making process on Iran.
Protests resurfaced on Iranian streets on Saturday, as students from several universities across the country rallied against the Islamic regime.
Addressing the exiled crown prince, Reza Pahlavi, and his potential role in a new regime in Iran, Witkoff said that Pahlavi “cares about his country” but that at the end of the day, the country’s future will depend on “President Trump’s policies, not Mr. Pahlavi’s policies.”
Witkoff added that Trump “is interested in hearing everyone’s views.”
BoP funds to get Gaza 'ready for a renaissance'
He went on to reveal ambitious plans for Gaza’s reconstruction, highlighting the Trump administration’s commitment to transform the region with a massive $17 billion investment.
Reflecting on Thursday’s inaugural meeting of the Gaza Board of Peace in Washington, Witkoff said it was “uplifting” to see such progress made on Gaza. “Who would ever have thought that we’d get to this place a year ago?” he said in his conversation with host Lara Trump.
The special envoy expressed optimism about the future of the Palestinian enclave following the US-backed ceasefire that took effect on October 10, 2025, and stressed the potential impact that President Trump’s vision could have on the socio-economic recovery of the entire region.
Asked where the newly pledged funds would be directed, Witkoff said they would be used to launch mass housing and transportation projects.
“We’re going to be able to clear and demolish all the areas there and get it ready for a renaissance. And I think this is just the beginning, Lara,” Witkoff said. “I think today it’s 17 [billion], tomorrow it could be 34 [billion].”
He noted that the future of the Middle East would largely depend on the unfolding situation in Iran.
'It’s a silly war'
Regarding the war in Ukraine, Witkoff emphasized the leadership challenges and territorial disputes that continue to hinder peace talks.
“It’s a silly war,” he said, referring to the conflict’s focus on territory, despite the significant human toll.
He identified the major holdup in the negotiations as territory and security guarantees, as both sides grapple with what Witkoff called “dignity,” a term he questioned in light of the ongoing violence.
Despite these hurdles, the US envoy expressed cautious optimism, noting that efforts to bring the two sides together had yielded positive results.
“They don’t seem like they really want to fight with one another,” he said, adding that he hopes upcoming proposals could finally bridge the gap, potentially leading to a summit between Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
'I saw a tear in [Trump's] eye'
Trump’s envoy and close friend highlighted the significant role the president has played in shifting international diplomacy. He attributed much of the success of the US peace initiatives to the president’s personal leadership.
“What presidency has ever done this much in four years, or even eight years? But he’s done it in 11 months,” Witkoff said.
Finally, he spoke about the return of the Israeli hostages held by Hamas in Gaza and the impact that had on the president.
“None of them were going to come home without him,” Witkoff insisted. “I told this story... about how the 20 hostage families came in, and I saw a tear in your father-in-law’s eye,” he added, referencing the family connection between the Fox News show’s host and the president.

Two men charged, weapon seized over fatal Bruce Highway crash
Two men have been charged with multiple offences, including firearm possession, as the investigation into a fatal crash on the Bruce Highway at Burpengary last week continues.
The crash killed 26-year-old man Andre Roberts, who was travelling on the highway when his car was struck by an allegedly stolen truck that was travelling southbound on the wrong side of the highway about 10.30pm on Tuesday.
Footage showed several other vehicles were also driving behind the truck at high speed, also on the wrong side. The Hino flat-bed truck crashed into a Honda Accord driven by Roberts – travelling in the correct lane – and caught fire, tragically killing him instantly.
The 46-year-old man driving the Hino remains in a critical condition in hospital.
On Sunday, police also confirmed the Hino truck – initially believed to be an Isuzu – was bearing false numberplates belonging to a different vehicle.
Police said that as part of the investigation, detectives from the Moreton District Criminal Investigation Branch and Homicide Investigation Unit searched a property at Redcliffe on Friday where they found stolen property and a firearm linked to the stolen truck.
“Two men, a 49-year-old and 36-year-old, both from Redcliffe have been charged man with enter premises, unlawful use of a motor vehicle and weapons offences are assisting police with their inquiries,” they said in a statement.
“They are expected to appear in Redcliffe Magistrates Court on 16 March 2026 and continue to assist police with their inquiries.
“Detectives have identified all vehicles involved in the incident and a number of people are assisting police with their inquiries.”
A Ford Ranger had already been identified as the vehicle following the Hino. It was located at a business on Magnesium Street in Narangba about 5.30pm on Wednesday.
A Narangba man was arrested that day in relation to the discovery.
Sections of the highway were closed until about 5am on Wednesday after the devastating crash.

Pakistan launches airstrikes on Afghanistan killing and wounding dozens
Taliban vows to give ‘measured response’ after cross-border firing
- Bookmark
- CommentsGo to comments
Pakistan has carried out airstrikes on what it described as militant hideouts inside Afghanistan, saying it was a response to cross-border attacks that have killed members of its security forces and civilians.
Afghanistan’s Taliban authorities said the strikes hit a religious school and several residential homes, killing and wounding dozens of civilians.
The Taliban-run defence ministry described the action as a “blatant violation of national sovereignty” and said an “appropriate and measured response will be taken at a suitable time”.
They added that they considered the act a “a clear breach of international law, the principles of good neighbourliness, and Islamic values”.
Pakistan said it had targeted hideouts belonging to the Tehrik-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), an outlawed militant network responsible for a surge in attacks in Pakistan’s north-west. The military described the operation as “intelligence-based” and said it was aimed at camps used to plan and launch assaults across the border.
The strikes followed a suicide vehicle bombing in Bajaur district on Tuesday that killed 11 Pakistani security personnel and a child, an attack claimed by the Tehrik-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP).
A statement from Pakistan's ministry of information and broadcasting said the country had “conclusive evidence” that militants behind the recent attacks were operating under the direction of “Afghanistan-based leadership and handlers”.
It said the operation targeted seven militant camps and that the Taliban regime “failed to undertake any substantive action” despite Pakistan’s urging.
Pakistan “has always strived to maintain peace and stability in the region”, it added, but said the safety and security of its citizens was its priority.
Issuing a strong condemnation of the strikes, Taliban spokesperson Zabihullah Mujahid wrote in a post on X: “Pakistani special military circles have once again trespassed into Afghan territory.”
He said dozens of “civilian compatriots” were injured and killed, including women and children, in Nangarhar and Paktika provinces.
“Pakistani generals compensate for their country's security weaknesses through such crimes,” he wrote.
Since the Taliban forcibly seized control of Kabul in August 2021, Pakistan has repeatedly accused it of failing to curb TTP fighters who use Afghan territory as a base to organise and launch attacks. Kabul has consistently denied allowing any group to use its soil to threaten other countries.
Hours before the strikes, a suicide bomber targeted a security convoy in the nearby Bannu district in Pakistan's northwest, killing two soldiers, including a lieutenant colonel.
Pakistan's military warned after Saturday’s attack that it would not “exercise any restraint” and operations against those responsible would continue “irrespective of their location”.
Relations between the two neighbours have been strained since October, when clashes along the border left dozens of soldiers, civilians and suspected militants dead. The escalation came after explosions in Kabul that Afghan officials attributed to Pakistan.
Although a ceasefire brokered by Qatar has largely held, negotiations held in Istanbul in November 2025 failed to produce a formal settlement, leaving ties fragile and tensions unresolved.

Succession rumours swirl as Kim Jong Un’s daughter misses major event
- Kim Jong Un's daughter, Kim Ju Ae, was notably absent from North Korea's key Workers' Party of Korea congress, prolonging uncertainty over the state's succession plans.
- Her non-appearance was significant as South Korea's National Intelligence Service had recently suggested she had entered a “successor-designate stage”.
- Kim Ju Ae, believed to be around 13, has frequently appeared alongside her father at major military parades and public events since November 2022, fuelling succession speculation.
- The South Korean spy agency, initially sceptical, now views her numerous high-profile appearances as an effort to build a narrative for the country to accept its first female leader.
- The congress, North Korea's most important political gathering, opened with Kim Jong-un declaring a “proud period” for the nation, despite the ongoing ambiguity regarding his successor.

Winter Olympics 2026: USA beats Canada for men's ice hockey gold, Indra Brown fifth in halfpipe as Eileen Gu wins on last day of Milano Cortina Games
Team USA has beaten Canada 2-1 in overtime to win the country's first men's ice hockey gold medal since 1980 in the last event of the 2026 Milano Cortina Winter Olympic Games.
The victory was identical to that of the US women's team on Friday, which was also a 2-1 overtime victory against their North American rivals.
But for the women, the win marked their third gold medal since 1998, while the men's team had not won gold at the Winter Olympics since the 1980 Miracle on Ice at Lake Placid.
Matt Boldy opened the scoring for Team USA in a frantic first period, before Cale Makar levelled for Canada shortly before the end of the second.
The teams could not be split through the third and final regulation period, thanks largely to US goalie Connor Hellebuyck, who made 41 saves on the night.
He was also aided by a late open-goal miss from Nathan MacKinnon, before the game went to overtime and Jack Hughes sealed the win.
Earlier on the last day of competition, Australian 16-year-old Indra Brown finished fifth in the freeski halfpipe final.
Brown earned praise from back-to-back gold medallist Eileen Gu, who was the first to embrace Brown after her third and final run, when she landed her first 1080 in competition.
"It was a really special moment to have someone I idolise give me a hug after I land my third run at the Olympics," Brown told Channel Nine.
Rosie Fordham was the only other Australian in action, finishing 30th in the women's 50km mass start cross-country skiing.

An emotional tribute from Team USA
The American team quickly found a "GAUDREAU" jersey and skated around the ice holding it up.
Johnny Gaudreau played 11 seasons with the Calgary Flames and Columbus Blue Jackets in the NHL and was a national and club teammate to many players in this US team.
He and his brother were hit by a car while riding their bikes on a New Jersey highway in 2024.
Both brothers died.
Johnny was 31.
His number 13 jersey has been hanging in the US locker room all tournament long.
TEAM USA HAS WON THE GOLD MEDAL!!
For the first time since 1980, the United States has won the men's ice hockey gold medal at the Winter Olympics!
And they've done it in the most dramatic circumstances, under the pump all night against rivals Canada and eventually winning in overtime.
Jack Hughes is the hero, slotting under the legs of Jordan Binnington after just 101 seconds of three-on-three hockey.
USA and Canada are going to overtime!
And these Winter Olympics just don't want to end as the men's ice hockey gold medal match goes into extra periods with the score tied at 1-1.
And now USA loses a man
It's Jack Hughes, the man who copped a high stick earlier.
He's given one back, but he's only in the penalty box for two minutes.
AND THE US SURVIVES!
We're back to five on five for the final minute.
USA with the extra man for four of the last six minutes
Canada's Sam Bennett is sent to the penalty box for smacking Jack Hughes in the mouth with a high stick.
He's pinged for a double minor (basically a serious offence) which means he's off the ice for four minutes.
And there's only six-and-a-half minutes remaining!
US goalkeeper the difference
As is so often the case in these games, the goaltending is proving the difference and Team USA's Connor Hellebuyck is keeping his team in this gold medal match.
Canada have had more than twice as many shots on goal (36-17) as we approach the halfway mark of the third period but 2025 NHL MVP Hellebuyck has been immense.
In this period he's saved in a one-on-one with Macklin Celebrini and somehow reached behind himself to deny a poke home inside the crease.
And he's just been aided by a really bad miss from Nathan MacKinnon in a rare moment when Hellebuyck was out of position.
CANADA SQUARES IT UP
There were questions about Canada's ability to win face-offs without injured captain Sidney Crosby, but they win a big one after an icing call and get the puck to Cale Makar, who fires a bullet of a shot past Connor Hellebuyck.
The pressure finally tells after a pretty dominant period for the Canadians.
USA goes up the other end and Jake Guentzel almost deflects a goal in, but it goes across the face into the far post and away. So close to a magic moment for the Americans.
Instead, it's 1-1 heading into the third and final period (although we feel destined for overtime).
A little dust-up as the hooter sounds, but nothing too dramatic.
Great escape from Team USA
The fastest and arguably best ice hockey player in the world, Connor McDavid, got into the open ice and was bearing down on USA goalie Connor Hellebuyck, but somehow Hellebuyck shut down the angles and came up with the save.
Then the US had not one, but two players sent to the penalty box, but still Canada can't break through.
Hellebuyck is a brick wall back there for the red, white and blue.
Somehow, it remains 1-0 to the United States with eight minutes left in the second period.
First period: USA 1-0 Canada
Only Matt Boldy's goal separates the men's ice hockey gold medal contenders after one period.
It's been a frantic start to the match, with both teams making uncharacteristic errors, but they feel like forced errors simply because the intensity is so high.
Credit to Canada, though, for surviving the first powerplay of the game with Shea Theodore in the penalty box.
Team USA hits the front
The United States are up 1-0 after six minutes thanks to a phenomenal, scrambling solo effort by Matt Boldy.
He won the puck around centre ice, almost lost it a few times but eventually is able to control it and tuck it low past Canada goalie Jordan Binnington.
Two minutes in and we've got our first dust-up
It's been a hectic start to this gold medal match with USA on the attack, but after Canada's first real raid ends, Jake Sanderson and Brandon Hagel get tangled up and there's a bit of a wrestle.
Nothing to write home about really, and nothing like the Four Nations debacle from a year ago.
It's time for the final event of the 2026 Winter Olympics
There is one last event at the Milano Cortina Games and, as is tradition, it's the men's ice hockey gold medal match.
And it's the blockbuster clash between the United States and Canada.
Expect some fireworks.
Indra Brown wasn't supposed to be here
Indra Brown was already supposed to be out of Italy by now. The fact she wasn't tells you everything you a lot about her rapid rise.
Simon Smale can tell you the rest:
A tearful revelation from gold medallist Eileen Gu
Women's freeski halfpipe gold medallist Eileen Gu was a little late to her post-final press conference, and at the end of her remarks she's revealed why.
"I just found out that my grandma passed away," Gu says through tears.
"She was a really big part of my life growing up and someone I looked up to immensely.
"Some people cruise through life, but she was a steamship."
The Chinese superstar says she knew she was sick and "this was a possibility", saying she went to see her before the Games and didn't promise to win, but promised to be brave.
"I'm really happy I was able to uphold that and hopefully do her proud. I really apologise for being late."
Sweden wins women's curling gold
It ultimately comes down to the final stone of the women's gold medal match and Sweden beats Switzerland 6-5 as Anna Hasselborg takes out the last Swiss rock and secures the final point.
Clutch curling from Switzerland
Switzerland was down 5-3 in the ninth end of the women's gold-medal match against Sweden but Alina Paetz pulls out a two-pointer and we're off to the 10th (and final?) end all square.
Australia's final place in the medal tally
Zoe Atkin down in bronze and now Britain cannot medal in the 4-man bobsleigh means Australia just sealed the Ashes at these Winter Olympics, by a single silver. 3 Gold, 6 medals - AND covered Britain, again. Superb. Nervy final day waiting for that!
- John
You're not wrong, John.
With only Sweden and Switzerland in the women's curling, and USA and Canada in the men's ice hockey still hunting medals, we now know where Australia will finish in the medal tally.
Australia is 14th with three golds, two silvers and a bronze.
Great Britain is 15th with a 3-1-1 split.
Remarkably, it's not Australia's highest finish on the tally, having finished 13th in Vancouver 2010 despite only winning two golds and a silver.

Why Harry and Meghan are staying quiet over Andrew’s arrest

Why Harry and Meghan are staying quiet over Andrew’s arrest
London: Amid the noise, the regret and the recriminations, one branch of the royal family has remained uncharacteristically silent.
The Duke and Duchess of Sussex have opted not to add their voices to the many who seemingly feel obliged to chime in on Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor’s cataclysmic arrest and period in police custody.
Why? Because for all of Prince Harry’s simmering anger and frustration at being endlessly “lumped together” with his errant uncle, he recognises that, for once, no good can come of pitching in on his family’s shame.
The duke made his views on Andrew all too clear in his memoir, Spare.
It was, he indicated, astonishing to him that while he and Meghan were being stripped of their taxpayer-funded security for simply opting out of the institution and choosing to live abroad, Andrew, who had been accused of sexually assaulting a teenager, faced no such ramifications.
“He was embroiled in a shameful scandal, accused of the sexual assault of a young woman, and no one had so much as suggested that he lose his security,” Harry wrote.
“Whatever grievances people had against us, sex crimes weren’t on the list.”
Those two short paragraphs do a lot of heavy lifting. Those bitter rivers run deep.
Harry has long grappled with the fact that Buckingham Palace – both the family and the wider institution – “circled the wagons” on Andrew despite year upon year of tawdry revelations and accusations concerning his relationship with Jeffrey Epstein.
By comparison, Harry believes he was unceremoniously cut loose before being torn to shreds for airing the family’s dirty laundry in a slew of extraordinary television interviews.
Since then, the propensity to lump Harry and Andrew under one umbrella as “the Dukes of Hazard” has only served to deepen divisions.
The Duke of Sussex had spent 10 years serving his country with distinction. His biggest crimes amounted to little more than an ill-advised fancy dress costume and a few drunken nights out. Why, then, did the family move so swiftly to cut off his funding and his security while Andrew remained protected by the institution for years?
It is hardly a secret that Harry, like his brother William, had never been much of a fan of his uncle, despite his fondness for his cousins Princesses Beatrice and Eugenie.
But he vehemently denied a report that he gave the former Duke of York “a bloody nose” during a fight at a family gathering in 2013.
According to historian Andrew Lownie’s book, Entitled, Andrew also once told his nephew that his marriage to Meghan would “not last more than a month”.
He allegedly “accused Meghan of being an opportunist and thought she was too old for Harry, adding that his nephew was making the biggest mistake ever”.
Andrew is said to have told his nephew he had gone “bonkers”, accusing him of not doing “any due diligence into her past” before proposing in 2017.
In a carefully worded response to the allegations, made last year, the Sussexes’ spokesman said Andrew and Harry had “never had a physical fight, nor did Andrew ever make the comments he is alleged to have made about the Duchess of Sussex to Prince Harry”.
Whatever has gone before, the Sussexes are under no illusion about the enormity of Andrew’s arrest and what it means for the monarchy’s reputation.
Harry has long railed against injustice. His personal desire for accountability was illustrated by his decision to pursue legal cases against the tabloid press.
His opinions, therefore, speak for themselves.
There is little love lost for Harry and Meghan in Britain. But whichever side of the fence one sits, it will surely come as a relief that they finally recognise there are occasions when it is better to simply say nothing at all.

Can Putin, Trump meet in Budapest? Expert assesses likelihood of new Russia-USA summit

News of the story
"On Point"
MINSK, 22 February (BelTA) - A meeting between Russian President Vladimir Putin and U.S President Donald Trump can still take place in Budapest if negotiators from Moscow and Washington reach certain framework agreements, participant in the Other Ukraine movement and former member of Ukraine’s Verkhovna Rada Spiridon Kilinkarov said in a new episode of the V Teme [On Point] project on BelTA’s YouTube channel.
“Zelensky understands perfectly well that despite all his resistance, the pressure on him to engage in negotiations will increase. Obviously, the need for an additional meeting between Putin and Trump will arise. This is because the negotiating groups can only solve certain technical tasks,” said Spiridon Kilinkarov. “Of course, this is very important and meticulous work that someone has to carry out. But ultimately, these negotiations could reach an impasse from which only the leaders of the United States or Russia can extract them. And a platform will be needed for that.”
The former MP believes that Budapest could serve as such a platform. Previously, Vladimir Putin and Donald Trump had planned to meet in the Hungarian capital, but that meeting was canceled. Spiridon Kilinkarov does not rule out that the regular attacks on Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban by Vladimir Zelensky are precisely related to Kiev’s attempt to hinder such processes in Budapest.
“Relatively speaking, if they manage to reach some kind of framework agreement that would allow the two leaders to meet, then I do not rule out that at the end of March, for example, this meeting could still take place in Budapest. Trump openly declares his support for Orban, and I do not rule out that such a world-scale meeting could yield a certain result,” the former Verkhovna Rada member said.
According to him, the reason a Russia-USA summit in Budapest did not happen before was the lack of a specific topic for Vladimir Putin and Donald Trump to negotiate. However, Spiridon Kilinkarov believes that such a topic could be developed during trilateral talks between Russia, the USA, and Ukraine.

Injury toll from Russian attack on Kyiv region rises, one person killed
Ukraine's State Emergency Service said this in a post on Telegram, Ukrinform reports.
Emergency workers also rescued another man while dealing with the aftermath of the Russian strike in a residential area in Sofiivska Borshchahivka.
"The enemy will certainly answer for every life taken. We are working to support the victims and provide assistance to everyone who needs it," said Mykola Kalashnyk, head of the regional military administration.
In the early hours of Sunday, February 22, Russian forces launched a massive attack on Ukraine using drones and missiles. Kyiv city and the Kyiv region were among the targets.
In the Kyiv region, the consequences of the attack were recorded in the Boryspil, Brovary, Fastiv, Bucha, and Obukhiv districts.
Kyiv Mayor Vitalii Klitschko also said that two people injured in the attack – a woman and a child – had been taken to Kyiv hospitals from the city's suburbs.

Iran says US talks coming in March, interim nuclear deal possible

A senior Iranian official said indirect talks between Iran and the United States are expected in early March and that the possibility of reaching an interim agreement exists, even as significant gaps remain between the two sides over sanctions relief and uranium enrichment.
In comments to Reuters, the official said Tehran and Washington differ over the scope and mechanism of sanctions relief. Iran maintains that its right to uranium enrichment under the framework of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty must be recognized.
Tehran could seriously consider a mix of exporting part of its highly enriched uranium stockpile, reducing its enrichment purity level and participating in a regional consortium, the official said.
At the same time, the official stressed that Iran would not hand over control of its oil and mineral resources to the United States. However, U.S. companies could participate as contractors in Iran’s oil and gas fields, the official said.
The remarks came as Steve Witkoff, President Donald Trump’s special envoy to the Middle East, said Saturday that the president is questioning why Iran has not agreed to a deal on its nuclear program.
In an interview with Fox News, Witkoff told Lara Trump, the president’s daughter-in-law, that Trump is “curious” about Iran’s position.
“He's curious as to why they haven't ... I don't want to use the word capitulated, but why they haven't capitulated,” Witkoff said.
Witkoff said Trump is asking why, “under this sort of pressure with the amount of naval power that we have over there,” Iran has not approached the United States to state it does not seek a nuclear weapon and outline what it is prepared to do.
According to Witkoff, Trump’s red lines require Iran to maintain “zero enrichment” of uranium. He said Iran has enriched uranium beyond levels required for civilian purposes.
Trump has called on Iran to reach a nuclear agreement while maintaining a U.S. military presence in the Middle East in case diplomacy fails.
On Friday, Trump urged Iran to “better negotiate a fair deal.” He also cited a figure of 32,000 protesters killed in Iran, a number advanced by Iranian opposition groups that is significantly higher than other estimates.

US airlines warn over pause in two key travel programmes amid Homeland Security shutdown
Sign up now: Get ST's newsletters delivered to your inbox
A grouping of major US airlines said the US Department of Homeland Security (DHS) gave travellers scant warning ahead of the temporary suspension of its PreCheck and Global Entry programmes from Feb 22, amid a shutdown of much of the agency.
The halt in the programmes run by the DHS will begin from 6am eastern time (7pm in Singapore), after the partial shutdown began last week following the failure of Republicans and Democrats to clinch a deal on immigration enforcement reforms.
“Airlines for America is deeply concerned that ... the travelling public will be, once again, used as a political football amid another government shutdown,” chief executive Chris Sununu said.
News of the suspensions came at “extremely short notice to travellers, giving them little time to plan accordingly,” he added in a statement, urging Congress to “get a deal done”.
A similar shutdown last autumn caused losses of US$6.1 billion (S$7.7 billion) across the travel industry and related sectors, he said.
“TSA and Customs and Border Protection are prioritising the general travelling population at our airports and ports of entry and suspending courtesy and special privilege escorts,” Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said.
“We are making tough but necessary workforce and resource decisions to mitigate the damage,” she added in a DHS statement to Reuters.
The pause in programmes is among the emergency measures DHS is taking to redirect staffing more than a week after Congress failed to send it more money, the Washington Post said.
PreCheck had more than 20 million active members, the TSA said in 2024, while total vetted airline passengers in the DHS’ traveller programmes, including Global Entry, exceeded 40 million.
The PreCheck programme allows approved passengers through a dedicated, faster security lane at US airports and is designed to reduce wait times and streamline screening.
Global Entry expedites US customs and immigration clearance for pre-approved, low-risk international travellers entering the United States.
The Feb 22 move follows orders from the Trump administration last week to another constituent of the DHS, the Federal Emergency Management Agency, to suspend deployment of aid workers to disaster-affected areas due to the shutdown. REUTERS

Ukraine claims blackmail by Hungary and Slovakia over energy

Ukraine's Foreign Ministry condemned what it described as "ultimatums and blackmail" by the governments of Hungary and Slovakia on Saturday, after they threatened to stop electricity supplies to Ukraine unless Kyiv restarts flows of Russian oil.
Shipments of Russian oil to Hungary and Slovakia have been cut off since January 27, when Kyiv says a Russian drone strike hit pipeline equipment in Western Ukraine. Slovakia and Hungary say Ukraine is to blame for the prolonged outage.
Slovakia's Prime Minister Robert Fico said on Saturday that he would cut off emergency electricity supplies to Ukraine within two days unless Kyiv resumes Russian oil transit to Slovakia over Ukraine's territory. Hungary's Viktor Orban made a similar threat days earlier.
The issue has become one of the angriest disputes yet between Ukraine and two neighbors that are members of the EU and NATO but whose leaders have bucked the largely pro-Ukrainian consensus in Europe to cultivate warm ties with Moscow.
Slovakia and Hungary are the only two EU countries that still rely on significant amounts of Russian oil shipped via the Soviet-era Druzhba pipeline over Ukraine.
"Ukraine rejects and condemns the ultimatums and blackmail by the governments of Hungary and the Slovak Republic regarding energy supplies between our countries," the Ukrainian Foreign Ministry said in a statement. "Ultimatums should be sent to the Kremlin, and certainly not to Kyiv."
Hungary, Slovakia are key for Ukraine's electricity imports
Between them, Hungary and Slovakia have been providing around half of European emergency electricity exports to Ukraine, which Kyiv increasingly relies on as Russian attacks have damaged its grid.
"If oil supplies to Slovakia are not resumed on Monday, I will ask SEPS, the state-owned joint-stock company, to stop emergency electricity supplies to Ukraine," Fico said in a post on X.
Kyiv said that such actions were "provocative, irresponsible, and threaten the energy security of the entire region."
Throughout the war that began with the full-scale Russian invasion whose fourth anniversary falls on Tuesday, Ukraine has allowed its territory to be used for Russian energy exports to Europe, which have been sharply curtailed but not halted.
Ukraine has proposed alternative transit routes to ship oil to Europe while emergency pipeline repair works are under way.
In a letter seen by Reuters, the Ukrainian mission to the EU proposed shipments through Ukraine's oil transportation system or a maritime route, potentially including the Odesa-Brody pipeline linking Ukraine's main Black Sea port to the EU.
Since October last year, Russia has intensified its drone and missile attacks on the Ukrainian energy system, knocking out electricity and heat and plunging millions of Ukrainians into long blackouts during bitterly cold winter temperatures.

One police officer was killed, and 24 other people were injured after several explosive devices detonated at midnight in Lviv in western Ukraine, the National Police said on Sunday.
"It has been preliminarily established that homemade explosive devices detonated," the police said on the Telegram messaging service.
The police said that the first explosion occurred after a patrol crew arrived at the suspected scene of a shop break-in, while the second explosion occurred a little later.
The mayor of Lviv, Andriy Sadovyi, called the incident a terrorist act.
Further on, it was also announced on Sunday that Russia attacked Ukraine with dozens of strike drones and ballistic and cruise missiles overnight, focusing on energy infrastructure, as said by Ukrainian military and local officials.
Overnight strikes hit Kyiv, region around the capital
The overnight strikes hit Kyiv and the region around the capital, the Black Sea port Odesa and central Ukraine, they said.
At least one person was injured in the Kyiv region, with damage reported in five districts where more than a dozen houses were damaged, regional Governor Mykola Kalashnyk said on the Telegram messaging app.
Odesa Governor Oleh Kiper wrote on Telegram that a nighttime drone attack on the energy infrastructure of the region caused fires that had been extinguished.
Russia attacks the Ukrainian energy system almost daily, striking thermal power plants and electrical substations.
Attacks on power stations, the energy transmission system and the gas sector are important elements of the full-scale invasion of Ukraine launched by Russia in February 2022. Moscow says it is seeking to undermine Ukraine's ability to fight.

New documents show JPMorgan cut ties with Trump businesses

JPMorgan Chase told President Donald Trump and his hospitality business in February 2021 it was closing their accounts at the bank, according to new documents released Friday as part of a $5 billion lawsuit Trump has filed against the bank and CEO Jamie Dimon.
Several businesses cut ties with Trump after the January 6, 2021, attack on the US Capitol by his supporters, including two law firms that represented him and the Trump Organization, and the PGA of America, which stripped Trump's club in Bedminster, New Jersey, of the 2022 PGA Championship.
The bank did not list any specific reason for the account closures in its Feb. 19, 2021 letters to Trump and the Trump Organization. In one letter, the bank said it can sometimes "determine that a client’s interests are no longer served by maintaining a relationship with J.P. Morgan Private Bank."
A spokesperson for JPMorgan did not immediately respond to a request for comment, nor did the bank's attorneys at Jones Day. The bank has previously said that Trump's suit is meritless.
A spokesperson for Trump's legal team said the disclosure of the letters are "a devastating concession that proves President Trump's entire claim."
Trump says bank intentionally de-banked family
The bank has "admitted to unlawfully and intentionally de-banking President Trump, his family, and his businesses, causing overwhelming financial harm," the Trump legal team spokesperson said.
Trump has accused JPMorgan, the largest US bank, of violating its own policies by singling him out to ride the "political tide."
The account closure letters were filed on Friday as part of a motion JPMorgan is seeking to move Trump's lawsuit from Miami federal court to New York.
"The overwhelming connections this dispute has to New York reinforce this result," the bank said in its motion.

DHS agent killed US citizen in March last year, records reveal
Texas shooting appears to be the first known instance of a US citizen being killed during Trump’s immigration crackdown.
A federal immigration agent shot dead a citizen of the United States in March 2025, months before the Trump administration began its deportation surge in Minnesota that led to the shooting deaths of Renee Nicole Good and Alex Pretti.
According to records released this week, Ruben Ray Martinez, 23, was killed by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) agents, lawyers for his family said in a statement.

A DHS agent fired multiple rounds at Martinez, who allegedly hit another DHS agent with his car as the agents assisted local police in South Padre Island, Texas, with traffic control following an accident on March 15, 2025, according to the records obtained by American Oversight, a nonprofit watchdog group.
The records are part of a tranche of heavily redacted internal documents from Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) that the nonprofit obtained as part of a Freedom of Information Act lawsuit.
The agents were conducting immigration enforcement, records show.
Martinez, who worked at an Amazon warehouse, had never had any prior run-ins with law enforcement, his mother, Rachel Reyes, said. “He was a typical young guy,” she told The Associated Press news agency. “And he wasn’t a violent person at all.”
Martinez, who was identified as a US citizen in the redacted records, was taken to hospital in nearby Brownsville, Texas, where he was later pronounced dead. The agent who was hit by a car went to the hospital for a knee injury and was later released, according to the report.
“These records paint a deeply troubling picture of the violent methods used by ICE,” Chioma Chukwu, the executive director of American Oversight, said in a statement.
“In just the first months of this administration, ICE’s own data shows a dramatic spike of nearly 400 per cent in use-of-force incidents – with people hospitalised, bystanders swept up in operations, and even the death of a US citizen.”
A DHS spokesperson said in a statement that Martinez “intentionally ran over” an agent with DHS’s Homeland Security Investigations, and another agent “fired defensive shots”. The nearly year-old incident is under investigation by the Texas Department of Public Safety’s Ranger Division, a DHS spokesperson said.
Call for investigation
Martinez’s shooting appears to be the first known instance of a US citizen being killed during US President Donald Trump’s anti-immigration crackdown. Federal agents in the operation shot at least five people in January alone, including Pretti and Nicole Good in Minnesota.
Martinez was trying to comply with instructions from local law enforcement when he was shot, Charles Stam and Alex Stamm, lawyers for his family, said in a statement. They called for a “full and fair investigation”.
“Ruben’s family has been pursuing transparency and accountability for nearly a year now and will continue to do so for as long as it takes,” the lawyers said.
The mounting death toll has increased scrutiny of Trump’s anti-immigration crackdown, driving a backlash among lawmakers and the public. The Trump administration is dramatically ramping up immigration enforcement, with $170bn budgeted for immigration agencies through September 2029, a historic sum.

South Korea protests Japan’s Takeshima Day event over disputed islands

South Korea on Sunday protested a Japanese government event commemorating a cluster of disputed islands between the two countries, calling the move an unjust assertion of sovereignty over its territory.
In a statement, the foreign ministry said it strongly objected to the Takeshima Day event held by Japan's Shimane prefecture and to the attendance of a senior Japanese government official, urging Japan to immediately abolish the ceremony.
The tiny islets, known as Takeshima in Japan and Dokdo in South Korea, which are controlled by them, have long been a source of tension between the two neighbors, whose relations remain strained by disputes rooted in Japan's colonial rule of the Korean peninsula from 1910 to 1945.
"Dokdo is clearly South Korea's sovereign territory historically, geographically and under international law," the ministry said, calling on Japan to drop what it described as groundless claims and to face history with humility.
The ministry summoned a top Japanese diplomat to the ministry building in Seoul to protest.
Seoul objects to Japan’s sovereignty claim over islets
A person at Japan's foreign ministry said no one was available on Sunday to comment. A call to the Prime Minister's Office went unanswered. The government sent a vice-minister from the Cabinet Office, not a cabinet minister, to the ceremony.
Seoul has repeatedly objected to Japan's territorial claims over the islands, including a protest issued on Friday over comments by Japan's foreign minister during a parliamentary address asserting Tokyo’s sovereignty over the islets.
The territory lies in fertile fishing grounds and may sit above enormous deposits of natural gas hydrate that could be worth billions of dollars, Seoul has said.

A Russian passport, a mother's vigil for Ukraine's children
When her kids aren’t watching, Olga devours every piece of news she can find about the war in Ukraine. The Russian mother forces herself to look at photographs of the Ukrainians who have been killed, trying to remember the face of every child lost in her country’s four-year aggression. Speaking out has cost her friends – and left her wary of every new Russian she meets in her self-imposed exile in France.
Already in 2010, Olga* knew that she would have to leave Russia sooner rather than later. “Even back then, I didn’t feel I was living in a free country.”
Olga grew up in Moscow – a modern, privileged “bubble” where Western-style cafes buzzed with life and several flights were leaving for Europe every day – but under Vladimir Putin’s rule, she felt things were changing.
“You could feel the power of the state behind you,” she recalls. “I never expressed my opinions in public. Even sharing my thoughts with friends didn’t feel safe.”
Less than a year later, she was living in Paris, enrolled at a university as part of an exchange programme. “Officially it was for a brief period, but I already knew I was going to stay.”
She applied for French citizenship as soon as she could. Her closest friends in France were Ukrainians.
Then, in 2014, Russia invaded and annexed Crimea.
“Before that we considered ourselves to be almost the same, that Russians and Ukrainians were one people. But after 2014 that wasn’t something you could say anymore.”
‘The Motherland’
When Russia launched its full-scale invasion on Ukraine in February, 2022, Olga was shocked, but she wasn’t surprised. Her stomach turned in fear for her Ukrainian friends because deep down she knew what Putin’s imperialistic regime would be capable of.
By then, Olga had also become the mother of two little boys. And somewhere in Moscow, she had a brother who risked being mobilised.
“I called my mother to help me convince him to leave Russia. I thought she would understand, as a mother.”
The response punched the air out of her lungs.
“She said: ‘If the Motherland asks your brother to fight for her, why would he refuse?’”
Since then, Olga doesn’t discuss the war with her family anymore, and conversations stay superficial, focused mainly on the children or the weather – just like they do when she speaks with others from back home.
In the first year of Russia’s full-scale invasion, she noticed how her Facebook friend list dwindled after every anti-war message she posted. Some of them were childhood friends.
“People in Russia are either brainwashed or afraid –I don’t know which,” she says, and describes their unquestioning loyalty “to the Motherland” as some kind of emotional dependency. “Almost like children who defend their alcoholic father, just because he’s their father.”
Still, Olga knows that her mother is, at least partly, acting out of fear.
“She deletes all my voice messages. She thinks everything is being listened to, even if it’s just about the weather. She told me ‘it would be better for everyone’.”
Feeling watched
The war is impacting her life in France, too.
Since 2022, Olga has avoided Russian events – “I never went to them very much anyway, but now I only go if it’s a very good friend’s birthday or something” – and she stays clear from Russian institutions, like the embassy and the Russian Orthodox church in Paris.
“There are cameras that monitor you – you feel it as you approach,” she says. “And I don’t want anyone trying to recruit me.”
This is also one of the reasons she is cautious whenever she meets new Russian people in France.
“I feel very uncomfortable. You never know what they think. I avoid new Russian acquaintances as much as I can.”
She has already severed contact with at least two Russian friends in Paris. One of them started sending her pro-war propaganda, “saying Ukraine wasn’t a real country and that the Ukrainian language was fake”, and refused to stop even though Olga repeatedly told her to.
“Now, if we meet in the street, we say hello. Nothing more.”

In the first weeks following the invasion, Olga also dreaded the children’s school run. The French parents did not yet know she opposed the war. She almost wanted to carry a large sign.
“I felt like all eyes were on me, and that everyone was like: ‘What is she thinking? What side is she on?’”
The curse of a Russian passport
Over time, this feeling has hardened into something more permanent.
Olga says she no longer recognises the country printed on her passport, and plans to renounce her Russian citizenship at the first opportunity. But it involves a lot of paperwork, and would most likely require her to travel to Russia – a country she hasn’t set foot in in the past eight years.
She recently learned that her two sons are considered Russian nationals by default from birth.
“It’s horrible. I don’t want them to have any link with Russia under this regime,” she says. “They’ve never been to Russia, and I don’t know if they ever will.”
The thought weighs on her, however. "My parents are not getting younger, and as I don’t know today when and where I can meet them due to travelling challenges and the growing risk of conflict in Eastern Europe, I sometimes wonder whether I will actually see them again. This is the pain that permanently sits inside of me, and I have not yet figured a way out yet."
In the meantime, she tries to shield her children the best she can from the horrors her country is causing. But at night, when she has tucked both of them into bed, she opens up the Ukrainian-sourced YouTube and Telegram news channels she subscribes to, forcing herself to scroll through the faces of the many children killed.
“I can’t do much to help. But I think we should remember them. We owe them at least this one second.”

Police officer fired for ‘offensive’ texts about Traveller community
- Detective Constable Mark Luker of the British Transport Police has been dismissed for gross misconduct.
- The officer used derogatory terms, including “p*key”, in WhatsApp messages when referring to Gypsy, Roma, and Traveller people.
- He also made comments linking the community to theft, which the panel deemed deliberate and discriminatory.
- Luker claimed that the language was a coping mechanism after being a first responder to the 2017 London Bridge terror attack and that he did not intend to cause offence.
- Despite accepting he was not 'inherently racist', the misconduct panel concluded that Luker likely knew the language was “offensive” to a minority community.

Opinion | Why the Fed credibility crisis will hit emerging markets harder
As confidence in US monetary stewardship falters, inflation risks rise and capital flows become more volatile. Emerging markets with fewer policy buffers will bear the brunt
This reassessment – marked by quiet “sell America” trades – is beginning to surface.
The damage extends far beyond Washington. It creates long-term risks to inflation trajectories and could push the global financial system towards greater fragmentation and inefficiency, leaving emerging markets and developing economies in Asia, Latin America and Africa most exposed. To be sure, these consequences stem from multiple factors, but doubts over the Fed’s independence are undoubtedly one of the key drivers.
Yet the renewed accumulation of gold also carries macroeconomic trade-offs. Unlike reserve currencies, gold does not provide liquidity backstops or support crisis-era funding mechanisms. When more global savings flow into non-yielding assets, the international financial system becomes less flexible to shocks over time. A widespread flight to safety may undermine the efficiency of capital allocation and weaken the resilience of the global financial system.
These effects weigh heavily on emerging markets. Constrained by shallow financial markets and lower gold shares in official reserves, emerging markets have experienced a dual shift towards gold for private investors and central banks.

Sarah’s experience while hiking alone has women taking safety into their own hands

Sarah’s experience while hiking alone has women taking safety into their own hands
Sarah Gibbs wanted to show women that they were just as capable of trekking alone as men.
The psychology student, 30, had watched men’s YouTube videos on overnight hiking, and had seen much older women bush camping alone.
She decided to film her first multi-night trek to show other young women it was wrong to assume that, because of the risk, “there are lots of things men can do that we can’t”. She chose the 210-kilometre Goldfields Track from Bendigo to Ballarat.
What happened after she had walked 160 kilometres through bushfire smoke and extreme heat has caused such an outpouring of fury from women in Daylesford that some believe they must take safety into their own hands.
“I’ve been an avid day hiker all my life,” Gibbs said. “I would go to really remote areas and hike, and all these women would say to me, ‘Oh, is that safe?’ I would literally say, ‘Yeah, I’ve never felt safer.’”
But while on a single-lane track near Daylesford on January 27, Gibbs heard what sounded like “something falling down a cliff or like someone was sliding down” behind her.
Soon after, on a water stop, she saw a man jogging down the track towards her. He sat next to her, started asking questions and placed his hand on the underside of her thigh while pretending to admire her shoes.
Gibbs said he touched her hair, grabbed her hand and held it to his face, and used sexually explicit language such as, “Do you want to f--- a prince?”
When he grabbed her hand, Gibbs said, “his whole demeanour and face just went blank; it scared me to death. I felt, ‘Oh my god, this is it, this is the end.’”
He stuck to her side when she got up and was “swaying into” her so heavily on the narrow track that “it felt like he was contemplating if he could nudge me into the bush”.
Gibbs recorded what she could with her camera at her side and cajoled him as she diverted towards Lake Daylesford. When he stopped to rifle through others’ belongings at a campsite, she sprinted off. She reached the lake terrified and shaking.
‘Are police seriously interviewing people outside a pub and saying, “Good luck, take care”?’Daylesford woman Tessa Gardiner, on the police response to Sarah Gibbs
Gibbs called police intending to make a statement that she expected would lead to the man (whose image she captured) being spoken to by police. She told them he was still in the area and knew her intended route.
When an officer met her about three hours later, she said, he asked to see her footage in the busy street outside the pub but did not take a statement, a response that has outraged women in the region.
They say that, especially given high-profile attacks on women exercising alone, police should have acted.
Sexual Assault Services Victoria chief executive Kathleen Maltzahn, said that without early intervention such as Gibbs had hoped for, perpetrators are often emboldened.
“We know that getting away with less clearly criminal acts gives men permission to go on to escalate their behaviour,” she said. “The message should have been, “You have absolutely done the right thing. We are extremely concerned and will take this seriously.’”
Gibbs said the officer told her: “There’s not much we can do. Keep your wits about you and if you see him again on the track, call us back.”
Concerned that no statement had been taken, she posted on a Daylesford Facebook page hoping to learn if the man was local and whether she risked another encounter. Her post drew ABC media attention in Ballarat, and when it was shared on Daylesford pages, dozens of women reported similar experiences.
Daylesford shop owner Jo Sheppard told the ABC she had to pull a woman into her store for safety after a man matching the description allegedly assaulted her on the street. Sheppard alleged he had also harassed her daughter in the main street, and said she had made a police statement.
Victoria Police issued a media statement on February 12 stating that a thorough investigation had been conducted into Gibbs’ incident and no offence was detected. After a public outcry police have since shown some renewed interest.
Daylesford woman Tessa Gardiner said dissatisfaction with the police response had grown so high that she would establish a private local Facebook group for women to share information to protect themselves.
“[Gibbs’ story] just blew up so fast: there were so many other stories, it just felt like we could all identify with that post straight away,” Gardiner said. “There’s a sadness about the response she received from the local police. I wouldn’t even classify it as mediocre – it sounds like a failure of policing. Are they seriously interviewing people outside a pub and saying, ‘Good luck, take care’?”
Local resident Liv Brown said she had recently bought hiking gear planning to walk the Goldfields Track, but that Gibbs’ experience and its handling had discouraged her from going alone. She has offered to help Gardiner create the safety page.
Sissy Austin, also a local, was attacked and knocked unconscious with a rock by a man who was never found, while she was jogging in Lal Lal State Forest in February 2023. She invited Gibbs to speak on February 15 at a local rally for her national movement to raise awareness of assaults on women exercising outdoors, Take Back the Track.
Austin timed the annual event to mark the anniversary of incidents including the attack that left her with shocking facial injuries.
Victorian Health Minister Mary-Anne Thomas spoke at the Castlemaine Take Back the Track event with Gibbs and Austin. Gibbs said she was grateful that Thomas offered her help to have a statement taken.
Thomas told this masthead that every woman, girl and gender diverse Victorian should be able to feel safe and enjoy the environment without fear. That they could not “is really distressing to me”, she said.
Mount Alexander Shire Mayor Toby Hayden, told the rally that Gibbs had been failed by local authorities.
Gibbs said on Friday that after the rally she had been invited to give a police statement, and had gone to Ballarat to do so.
A Victoria Police spokesman said contrary to its original media statement, an active and ongoing investigation was now under way.
“The details of the incident have also been recorded for the awareness of local police,” the new police statement said.

Revealed: Hundreds of school-leavers with ATARs of less than 50 offered teaching spots

Revealed: Hundreds of school-leavers with ATARs of less than 50 offered teaching spots
Almost 500 school-leavers across the nation with an ATAR of less than 50 were offered places to study teaching at university in 2025 amid fears the “concerning” trend will damage teaching standards, student learning and the economy.
Last year’s cohort was the highest number of low-achieving students offered a teaching place since 2017, when 443 students with an ATAR under 50 were offered places. While the number of teaching students is growing, so too is the proportion of students with an ATAR of less than 50, which grew to more than 2 per cent of people offered teaching places for the first time since 2017.
University admissions data released by the federal government show that 499 students who achieved between 0 and 50.00 were offered an undergraduate teaching place in 2025. There were also 666 students with ATARs in the 50s who were offered teaching places. At the other end of the spectrum, there were 450 students with an ATAR of more than 90 who were offered a place to study teaching.
“I do find it concerning that the proportion of students with an ATAR below 50 is rising. It’s an awful lot,” said UTS academic Rachel Wilson, author of a seminal 2022 report on teaching called The Profession At Risk: Trends in standards for Admission to Teaching.
A decade ago, there were 562 school-leavers with an ATAR between 0 and 50 offered teaching places. That number has been as low as 226 in 2019.
“There is a clear downward trend in the academic attainment of students [studying teaching]. Australia’s academic standards for entry to teaching are neither stable nor assured. This situation poses a serious threat … negatively impacting on the esteem of the teaching profession, Australian students’ outcomes, and national educational and economic progress,” Wilson said.
The average ATAR for a teaching student across the country was 71, compared to 78 for the average ATAR of a uni student, according to the data.
Research has repeatedly shown the aptitude of a teacher has a significant impact on student performance. In the decades since the 1980s, teacher quality and Australia’s standing in international league tables have both declined. Australian 15 year olds are 2.5 years behind their counterparts in the Baltic states.
“The risks are high if [students with low ATARs] get through their degree and get to teach in schools. We still have major challenges in meeting national benchmarks for NAPLAN and similar challenges in the international benchmark,” said Wilson.
Asked if hundreds of would-be teachers achieving an ATAR of less than 50 was acceptable, federal Education Minister Jason Clare pointed to the literacy and numeracy tests they need to pass.
“All teaching students must pass the [Literacy and Numeracy Test for Initial Teacher Education] test. You can’t graduate without it,” he said.
Before the 2019 election, Labor said it wanted to lift the minimum ATAR to about 80. It did not take the policy to the 2022 election, but rather offered $10,000 scholarships to a select number of teaching students with an ATAR of at least 80.
“We’ve introduced scholarships for high-achieving school leaders and we have tripled the number of participants entering the High Achieving Teachers Program,” said Clare, declining to comment on the impact a low-achieving teacher might have on students.
The NSW Education Standards Authority said the state “maintains one of the strongest Initial Teacher Education frameworks in the country, to attract and prepare the best and brightest teachers for our schools”.”
NSW teaching students must achieve a minimum of three HSC Band 5 results, including one in English, as well as at least a Band 4 in HSC mathematics, although there are alternative pathways for students who do not meet those marks.
The data also shows a 23 per cent increase in teaching offers last year in NSW, which NSW Teachers Federation president Henry Rajendra attributed to the historic pay rise won by the state’s teachers in late 2023.
“We now have a good pipeline of teachers coming into the system. Over time, this means ATAR entry scores will trend higher,” he said.
The Department of Education said the pay rise and other factors, including lessened workloads, reductions in mandatory training, streamlined accreditation procedures and fewer policy changes meant more school-leavers were attracted to teaching.

How GPs plan to end Medicare politics and change bulk billing for good

How GPs plan to end Medicare politics and change bulk billing for good
Australia’s GPs want the federal government to butt out of Medicare funding, saying decisions about rebates and prices should be delegated to an independent body to avoid the politicisation of healthcare.
The call from the Royal Australian College of General Practitioners would dampen future political fights over Medicare, ruling out such initiatives as the $8.5 billion boost to Medicare that became the centrepiece of Labor’s 2025 re-election campaign as well as previous government policies to freeze Medicare rebates.
Data from the office of Health Minister Mark Butler shows that the federal government’s Medicare investment is turning around GP bulk-billing rates: since November, when the Albanese government began paying doctors incentives not to charge patients out-of-pocket fees, 1300 extra clinics have become fully bulk billing.
For general adult patients targeted by the measure, bulk-billing rates have risen 7 percentage points in that time – the largest quarterly rise on record. They are up 6.4 points in NSW and 9.2 points in Victoria. The national bulk-billing rate for all patients sits at 81.4 per cent, up 4.3 points in the year since the promise was first made.
However, in its pre-budget submission, the college of GPs has said that an independent body should advise on Medicare rebates. These stipulate what the government pays doctors for certain services; doctors can then choose to charge patients a gap fee on top.
“Recent Medicare investments have shown the value the current federal government places on primary healthcare, but support from the current government doesn’t guarantee the same level of commitment from future governments,” said college national president Dr Michael Wright.
“Governments on both sides of politics have set rebates based on short-term political imperatives, rather than from a sound evidence base.”
The Albanese government is offering GP clinics additional lump-sum payments if they bulk bill all of their patients, in a bid for them to change their funding models.
But Wright said the key issue for GPs as they considered changing their business practices was the risk that the policy would not endure under future governments.
“For many practices, moving to become a fully bulk-billing practice is not just a financial decision – it is about trust,” he said.
“An independent authority enshrined in legislation would provide the certainty many GPs need when making financial decisions about the future of their practices. It would provide transparent, evidence‑based decision-making that directs funding where it’s most effective and most needed.”
Several of the college’s budget ideas in previous years – tripling bulk-billing incentives, and extending them to adult patients – have eventually become government policy as Labor has looked to restore the accessibility of primary care.
Health economist Stephen Duckett, a former secretary of the federal Health Department, said he had previously recommended the idea, as had recent reviews commissioned by the government.
“If you look at any GP comments, they say you can’t trust governments – by which they mean Liberal governments, but they don’t make that explicit – because they went ahead and froze the rebate,” Duckett said.
“My own view is that you can’t expect practices to change everything they do when it is at the whim of the government what the rebates are. If we want Medicare to be well accepted by the medical profession, as well as consumers, then fair fee-setting would have to be part of that.”
Both hospitals and aged-care facilities have independent pricing bodies. The college of GPs has highlighted recent data from the Report on Government Services that shows spending on hospitals rose 30 per cent over a decade, while spending on general practice had risen 13 per cent.
It also pointed out that the Medicare rebate for a standard consultation had risen 22 per cent since 2010, while health inflation had risen 62 per cent. A significant reason for the discrepancy was a freeze on Medicare rebates, introduced in the dying days of the Labor government in 2013 and maintained by the Coalition until 2018.
Wright said Medicare rebates had “failed to keep pace with inflation and rising operational costs, driving up out-of-pocket expenses and creating barriers to access”.
Duckett said the biggest barrier to introducing an independent pricing authority would be the Treasury, which would not want to lose any levers to control spending. Health spending is one of the most expensive budget items.
He suggested another way to bake in certainty would be legislating that Medicare rebates must rise with inflation – this would be more difficult, politically, for governments to change.
Butler, meanwhile, said his Medicare changes “are helping ease cost‑of‑living pressures, strengthen primary care, and ensure Australians can access reliable, high‑quality health services close to home”.
There are now 126 urgent care clinics across the country, with four more due to open this week. Australians have saved $2.2 billion on pharmaceuticals too, as the government has lowered the maximum co-payment for scripts to $25.

Qantas, union at loggerheads over job security in AI-era

Qantas, union at loggerheads over job security in AI-era
Qantas and a key union are at odds over job security amid a round of job cuts linked to the adoption of new technology at the airline’s Sydney headquarters.
The Australian Services Union said workers were told they would be replaced by AI, though the union did not provide details of that claim, which the airline denies.
On Monday, Qantas and the union are scheduled to meet for consultation following the termination of 30 roles at company headquarters last week.
While the 30 roles have been eliminated as Qantas simplifies its management structure, the consultation will determine whether staff who held those positions can be relocated to other roles, and what redundancy payments are on offer. The jobs were at Qantas’ headquarters in Mascot, NSW.
The ASU also wants to know whether the reductions are the first round of a multi-tranche redundancy plan. Under the terms of the EBA signed in January, Qantas has an obligation to consult on jobs, the union said.
“Unless Qantas is prepared to immediately back away from this announcement and commence genuine consultation with the union and our members, we see no alternative other than to lodge a dispute with the Fair Work Commission,” the union’s NSW ACT secretary, Angus McFarland, said.
The affected jobs include freight, crew support, finance and airport services, among other roles.
“Our members need to know that their jobs are safe and secure,” McFarland said. “If their jobs are redundant, they need to know that their entitlements will be paid, or they will be offered training to apply for new jobs.
“Just six months ago, when we bargained for a new agreement, Qantas refused to provide any protections for our members against job losses due to AI – now we know why.”
Qantas denied the job losses were related to AI, but it did not dispute that other technology played a role. It said the company continues to grow in other areas. It also said no further jobs should be cut as part of the restructure announced in December 2025.
“We advised the Australian Services Union on Wednesday last week of the changes and are meeting with them on Monday to discuss ways to reduce the impact on affected employees,” a company spokesperson said.
“This includes considering redeployment opportunities into one of the newly created roles resulting from these changes, or into other roles across the group.”
The union also questioned whether the redeployment of laid-off staff was “genuine” – with appropriate work, pay, responsibility and shifts.
McFarland said: “Our members turned up for work on Wednesday, were taken aside and told effectively that their job had been replaced by AI and they have four weeks to find another job.”
When asked for more detail, the union would not say what AI tools it claimed Qantas was using to replace the staff.
The job cuts followed Qantas’ December 3 announcement that it would trim the size of its group leadership team while elevating the role of a technology-focused executive.
In December, QantasLink chief Rachel Yangoyan was named chief technology, AI and transformation officer to oversee “AI strategy, data and analytics and enterprise technology-driven transformation programs”.
At the time, chief executive Vanessa Hudson said the company was recruiting a group chief AI officer “to lead implementation and scaling of AI across the organisation” and that recruitment was under way.
Qantas is establishing a product innovation centre in Adelaide to sharpen its delivery of “world-leading digital experiences” for the millions of customers who travel with the airline each year.
Hudson has worked to improve morale and industrial relations within the company since taking over from Alan Joyce in 2023, amid bitter recriminations between staff and management. The company was later found to have unlawfully sacked nearly 1800 ground crew in 2020.
Hudson ordered a $1000 one-off “thank you” to 23,000 non-executive staff, praising employees’ “fantastic” efforts in 2024. Last year, she followed up by outlining a non-executive employee share plan that provides staff with $1000 worth of shares every year, linked to Qantas’ financial performance.
Despite efforts to rebuild trust between management and staff, the aviation sector as a whole is not immune to the impact of technology reshaping workflows and employment.
Innovations in ticketing, marketing and operations are flowing through the aviation industry, even as the air carriers seek to manage costs by refreshing their fleets with newer, more efficient planes, which can dramatically affect costs.
Anxiety about the impact of artificial intelligence has become a recurring theme across industries as varied as education, financial services and programming.
Qantas is scheduled to release its half-year financial results on February 26.
The airline is coming off a strong performance last year, where underlying earnings climbed 15 per cent to $2.39 billion – a boost driven by a surge in vacation travel, significant expansion from Jetstar, and a positive future forecast.

‘It’s really unfair’: Leo’s Supermarket Heidelberg to close in weeks

‘It’s really unfair’: Leo’s Supermarket Heidelberg to close in weeks
Leo’s Supermarket in Heidelberg will close earlier than planned, with shoppers reporting flagging customer numbers and dwindling stock.
But the new owner of the site, in Burgundy Street, revealed that a new supermarket and five shops will replace it.
Customers on Sunday said they were sad that after 25 years of trading, Leo’s Fine Food and Wine supermarket in Heidelberg, which is known for its gourmet produce, will shut for good on March 13.
Mario Lo Giudice, managing director of the new owner of the site, Banco Group, confirmed the closure date was correct but emphasised refurbishment plans, which will include a new supermarket, were under way.
A planning permit had been obtained to refurbish the building, retaining a supermarket and creating five new shops along Burgundy Street.
“We are negotiating with a number of independent supermarket operators,” he told this masthead.
In June last year, when this masthead reported the Burgundy Street store had been sold, its management indicated that the Heidelberg supermarket and its sister store in Kew would close at the end of 2026.
On hearing news of the March 13 closure, customer of 16 years Sandra Andary, of Rosanna, said: “I’m devastated, like everybody else. It’s really unfair. The strip, the community needs this.
“It’s like a hub. A guy just said ‘hi’ to me, he met me during COVID and remembered my name. There’s a beautiful community that come together around Leo’s.”
She said Leo’s sold items that you can’t get elsewhere and she had favourite brands like Green Nation Life multipurpose cleaner, and Earth Taste Life Himalayan Pink Salt.
“I buy the frozen berries, I buy good quality meat from here and nice brands of bread and milk.”
Andary said since the closure was announced last year she had noticed customer numbers were down and she herself had shopped there less, feeling it was harder to stay attached to the place, knowing it was closing.
Lifelong Heidelberg resident and Leo’s fan since it opened in 2001 Gerald Sheahan said he was disappointed about the closure and having to shop at Coles now.
Another regular Steve Caddy, from Heidelberg, said, “I’m very sad about it closing.”
Caddy said while he gets staple groceries at Woolworths he gets “all the good stuff” at Leo’s such as Sergio Valentino durum wheat semolina pasta, Irrewarra sourdough bread, and Ivan’s chunky Angus beef pies.
“The herbs like dill, thyme and tarragon are always fresher here, and they’re in bigger batches, than in other places.”
In addition, he said Leo’s had been a community hub. “There are always interesting people shopping here, there’s a more interesting vibe because there are unique foods, and everything’s a bit fresher.”
He said there were always old Italian songs playing on the sound system.
“It’s something that makes Heidelberg unique,” Caddy said.
It’s not known whether Kew Leo’s will close at the end of 2026 as originally planned.
In June last year, developer Orchard Piper announced that the Leo’s block in Princess Street, Kew, which it had bought, would be turned into luxury housing in a joint venture backed by billionaire James Packer.
The new Kew building will also include shops and a fine-produce offering.

Iranian university students have resumed protesting against the regime on the first day of a new semester, as US President Donald Trump considers limited military strikes to pressure the Islamic Republic into signing a new nuclear deal.
Trump’s Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff said over the weekend that the president was “curious” why Iran hadn’t capitulated to American demands in the face of the ongoing military build-up.
Trump warned on Friday that limited strikes against Iran were possible, while at the same time, Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi said Tehran expected to have a proposed deal ready in the next few days.
The next round of talks between the two sides will be held in Geneva this Thursday, Oman’s foreign minister said on Sunday, shortly after Araghchi said he expected to meet Witkoff then.
Speaking on Fox News on Saturday, US time, Witkoff said: “I don’t want to use the word ‘frustrated,’ because [Trump] understands he has plenty of alternatives, but he’s curious as to why they haven’t ... I don’t want to use the word ‘capitulated,’ but why they haven’t capitulated”.
The Pentagon has orchestrated a massive deployment to the region that includes two aircraft carriers, fighter jets and refuelling planes, giving Trump the option to launch limited or extended operations against Iran.
Trump has also reportedly been briefed on options to assassinate the son of Ayatollah Ali Khamenei and various mullahs.
Araghchi told CBS on Sunday that there was a “good chance” of a diplomatic solution to the nuclear issue, adding that it was the only matter under discussion.
Meanwhile, Witkoff told Fox News that “zero enrichment” was non-negotiable for any deal with Iran, “and we have to have the material back”.
“They’re probably a week away from having industrial-grade bomb-making material, and that’s really dangerous, so you can’t have that,” he said. “This is something they have to stick with until they prove to us that they can behave.”
Asked during a news conference on Friday about what his message would be to the Iranian people, Trump said, “They better negotiate a fair deal. They better negotiate.”
Protests flare up again
The fresh campus demonstrations in Tehran and the north-eastern city of Mashhad came a month on from a deadly government crackdown that killed thousands of people. While the government has not acknowledged the latest protests, state-affiliated news media have reported on tensions on university campuses.
A video purportedly showed rows of marchers at Tehran’s Sharif University of Technology condemning Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei as a “murderous leader”, and calling for Reza Pahlavi, the exiled son of Iran’s toppled shah, to be a new monarch.
State-affiliated news agencies such as SNN carried videos of clashes, with protesters allegedly injuring volunteer student Basij militia by throwing rocks at Iran’s top engineering university. Pro-government Basij members often assist security forces in quelling protests.
Protests were also held at Beheshti and Amir Kabir universities in the capital, Tehran, and at Mashhad University in the north-east, according to unverified videos published by rights group HAALVSH.
In the western town of Abdanan, a hotspot for protests, demonstrators chanted “Death to Khamenei” and “Death to the dictator” after the arrest of an activist teacher, according to rights group Hengaw and social media posts.
The protests coincided with ceremonies traditionally held after 40 days to mourn those killed by security forces during last month’s anti-government demonstrations, which saw thousands lose their lives in the worst domestic unrest since Iran’s 1979 Islamic Revolution.
Activism by students and Tehran shopkeepers grew into a nationwide protest movement that appeared to threaten the regime before it was violently suppressed.
The Iranian government acknowledges more than 3000 people were killed in January, but rights groups such as the US-based Human Rights Activists News Agency say at least 7000 were killed, with more to come as numbers are verified.
Iran experts argue that bombing the country in the middle of negotiations might derail a deal and could prompt a deadly cycle of retaliation.
Tehran would likely suspend participation in talks if the US launched a strike, according to a senior government official in the region, who asked not to be identified discussing private deliberations.
“He’s not going to get a diplomatic agreement out of the Iranians if he attacks them again,” said Barbara Slavin, a fellow at the Stimson Centre in Washington. The military threats alone — even if the US doesn’t ultimately act on them – “is going to make them less willing to make a deal.”
While Trump has given a deadline of between 10 and 15 days, it also remains unclear what a new round of airstrikes – limited or otherwise – would actually achieve.
Israel and the US bombed the country’s nuclear sites and air defences extensively last June, with the president saying at the time that “key nuclear enrichment facilities have been completely and totally obliterated”.
The US and Israel could target Iran’s ballistic missiles, but the danger there is that Tehran could be spurred to fire them off at US or allied targets before it loses them, according to Slavin.
The shifting US rationale for talks – and strikes – makes deciphering US intent even more difficult. Trump’s initial threat of airstrikes was in support of the protests in Iran in December and January rather than a nuclear deal.

Russia carried out a large-scale combined drone and missile attack across Ukraine overnight on Feb. 22, killing one person and injuring at least 15 others in the Kyiv region as explosions were reported in multiple cities.
The Ukrainian Air Force said the night initially began relatively calmly before waves of drones entered Ukrainian airspace around 2 am (00:00 UTC), according to RBC-Ukraine. The first were detected over the Dnipropetrovsk, Kirovohrad and Donetsk regions, with their numbers increasing over time.

By approximately 4 am (02:00 UTC), air raid alerts were issued in Kyiv and across roughly half the country as ballistic missiles were launched. Targets were reported approaching from the north and later from the south.
Monitoring channels indicated that Zircon missiles may have been launched from occupied Crimea, though this was not officially confirmed.
At around 4:30 a.m. (02:30 UTC), Russian forces scrambled Mikoyan MiG-31K aircraft, which are capable of carrying Kinzhal air-launched ballistic missiles. No confirmed launches were reported. Strategic bombers – Tu-95MS and Tu-160 – were also airborne overnight. Monitoring channels suggested launch maneuvers may have taken place around 4:30 a.m., potentially placing cruise missiles over Ukrainian airspace around 6 am.
Kyiv targeted multiple times
Kyiv was among the first cities to come under attack. Between 4:00 and 4:30 a.m. (02:00-02:30 UTC), explosions were heard in the capital during ballistic missile launches. Enemy drones were also detected in the Kyiv region.
UK Should Send Non-Combat Troops to Ukraine ‘Now’ – Boris Johnson
By 5:12 am (03:12 UTC), explosions were reported in Kyiv for the third time overnight, with Russian forces again attempting a ballistic strike.
One hour later, another series of explosions was heard amid what was described as a cruise missile attack on the capital. The Air Force reported targets flying directly toward Kyiv, while monitoring channels warned that drones were entering simultaneously.
Initial reports indicated that a multi-story residential building in the Sviatoshynskyi district had been damaged, with a fire on the roof.
“At 05:33 [03:33 UTC], as a result of the attack, a residential multi-story building in the Sviatoshynskyi district was damaged. There is a fire on the roof of the building. We are clarifying information about the injured,” Tymur Tkachenko, head of the Kyiv City Military Administration, wrote on Telegram.
However, around an hour later, Tkachenko posted an update stating: “The information was not confirmed.”
Kyiv Mayor Vitali Klitschko later reported that a woman and a child from the capital’s suburbs were hospitalized after being injured. Preliminary information suggested debris had fallen in a private residential area.
Casualties reported in Kyiv region
The head of the Kyiv Regional Military Administration, Mykola Kalashnyk, later reported that one person was killed and 15 others injured as a result of the attack in the Kyiv region.
“Currently, we have confirmed information about 15 injured people, including four children. Unfortunately, one person died from the injuries sustained,” Kalashnyk said in a Telegram update.
He said the largest number of casualties was recorded in the Fastiv district, where rescuers pulled eight people from beneath the rubble of a destroyed building. Seven sustained injuries of varying severity.
“Despite all efforts by doctors, one man died from his injuries,” Kalashnyk said.
Five people were transported to medical facilities, including the deceased man. Four injured individuals remain under treatment. Three are in serious condition, including two undergoing surgery.
Additional injuries were reported in the Boryspil, Vyshhorod, Obukhiv and Bucha districts. Victims suffered shrapnel wounds, lacerations, fractures, smoke inhalation and acute stress reactions.
Rescue services, medics and police continue working at the sites of impact.
Kropyvnytskyi and other regions hit
In Kropyvnytskyi, local media reported at least two explosions around 4 am (02:00 UTC). Shortly before the first blast, the military had reported a high-speed target heading toward the city before changing course toward Kyiv.
At 5:33 am (03:33 UTC), further explosions were heard. Monitoring channels suggested a possible ballistic strike, though no official confirmation was provided.
Explosions were also reported in Mykolaiv at approximately 5:22 am (03:22 UTC), with the cause unclear.
In Poltava, explosions were heard as cruise missiles were reported flying over the region.
Poland scrambles tactical and strategic aircraft
Poland scrambled fighters and strategic aircraft overnight due to Russia’s overnight attack on Ukraine, according to the Operational Command of the Polish Armed Forces in a post on X.
“Due to the activity of long-range aviation of the Russian Federation, which is carrying out strikes on the territory of Ukraine, Polish and allied aircraft have begun operations in our airspace,” the command said.
On-duty fighter pairs and an airborne early warning aircraft were scrambled, while ground-based air defense systems and radar reconnaissance units were placed on heightened alert.
The command described the measures as preventive and aimed at ensuring security in areas adjacent to the Ukrainian border. It added that forces remain ready for immediate response as the situation continues to be monitored.
Pattern of combined strikes
The Feb. 22 attack followed another combined Russian strike on Feb. 17, when drones, ballistic and cruise missiles were also used.
At that time, the primary targets included the Odesa and Dnipropetrovsk regions and the city of Burshtyn in the Ivano-Frankivsk region.
In Dnipro, enterprises, administrative buildings, residential houses and vehicles were damaged. In Odesa, an infrastructure facility, civilian buildings, a store and a service station were hit, and a high-rise building caught fire. In Burshtyn, Russian forces attempted to strike a thermal power plant.
The full extent of damage and casualties from Saturday night’s strike was still being clarified as of the morning.

Iranian students renew anti-government protests in Tehran amid a US military buildup

Videos geolocated at universities in Tehran show students chanting "bi sharaf," or "disgraceful" in Farsi, as clashes erupted against supporters of the government.
Anti-government protests at university campuses continued in Iran on Sunday amid a US military build-up in the region.
This is the second consecutive day of intense clashes after the deadly crackdown last month, with speculation that the unrest could spill over into the streets.
European Parliament president Roberta Metsola said on social media platform X that 'Iran must be free,' and that the country had been "at the boot of a forceful theocracy" since she was alive.
Amid reports of renewed protests in Iran, Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian said that his country would not give in to international pressure as nuclear talks with the United States are ongoing.
Trump has said he is considering a limited military strike on Iran in order to pressure its leaders to agree a deal to curb the nuclear programme.
During a speech broadcast live on state TV, Pezeshkian said, "World powers are lining up to force us to bow our heads... but we will not bow our heads despite all the problems that they are creating for us."
Meanwhile, local and diaspora media reported renewed anti-government student protests in Tehran over the thousands killed during the January clashes, as well as other groups showing support for the government.
Videos geolocated by AFP at Tehran's top engineering university show people chanting "bi sharaf", or "disgraceful" in Farsi, and fights breaking out. Persian-language TV channel Iran International, which is based in London, also reported on protests at Sharif University of Technology, also located in the capital.
Iranians repeated protest slogans this week to mark 40 days since the deaths of thousands of people, in line with Shiite mourning tradition, after demonstrations peaked on 8 and 9 January.
Local outlet Fars reported that a planned “silent and peaceful sit-in” by students to remember the dead was disrupted when some began chanting slogans including “death to the dictator”, a reference to Iran’s supreme leader, Ali Khamenei.
A video published by Fars showed one group chanting and waving Iranian flags facing another crowd wearing masks, who were being held back by men in suits. Both sides appeared to be holding memorial photographs.
The unrest began in December after months of financial hardship, before escalating into mass anti-government protests. Security forces crushed the demonstrations in a violent crackdown that rights groups say killed thousands.
Iran’s clerical authorities admit more than 3,000 people were killed, but blame the violence on “terrorist acts” allegedly driven by the country’s enemies.
However, US-based Human Rights Activists News Agency says that more than 7,000 people were killed in the crackdown, most of them protesters, though the true figure may be much higher.
On Friday, US President Donald Trump said that 32,000 people had been killed during the recent protests without providing a source.
Following Trump's comments, on Saturday Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi called on social media X for "anyone" who "disputes the accuracy of our data, please share any evidence".
Growing tension in the region
The protests come as Iran faces growing pressure to reach a deal on its nuclear programme with the United States, which has deployed forces within striking distance and is mounting its presence in the Middle-East.
US President Donald Trump had already threatened military action against Tehran during the protests over the security forces’ crackdown.
Reuters reported that US military aircraft were spotted at Lajes Air Base, and US officials said that strikes on Iran could target individual leaders. The aircraft carrier USS Gerald R. Ford was also spotted passing by the Strait of Gibraltar on Friday.
Live flight tracker Flightradar24 also reported that Bulgaria's Sofia airport will be closed for a few hours on Monday and Tuesday, with only military planes allowed. Local media note that this temporary closure coincides with the presence of US military aircraft at the airport and the nearby airbase.
Bulgaria’s Ministry of Defence said the aircraft belong to the US Air Force and that their deployment is part of NATO’s enhanced vigilance activities.
Sweden, Serbia and Australia have urged their citizens to leave Iran and avoid travelling to the country.
In a statement released overnight into Saturday, Serbia's foreign ministry said, "Due to the deteriorating security situation, citizens of the Republic of Serbia are not recommended to travel to Iran in the coming period."
On Friday, Trump said he was "considering" a limited military strike on Iran during a White House briefing if negotiations were unsuccessful.

Lionel Messi, Inter Miami routed by LAFC in MLS season opener
The Inter Miami player began his club’s MLS Cup title defence with a crushing away loss to rivals Los Angeles FC.
David Martinez scored in the first half, Denis Bouanga scored and added an assist in the second and Los Angeles FC completed a 3-0 victory over Lionel Messi and visiting Inter Miami in the teams’ season opener on Saturday night.
Substitute Nathan Ordaz added the final goal for the hosts, who moved the match to Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum and drew a crowd of 75,673, the second-largest in Major League Soccer (MLS) history for a regular-season game that was not part of a double-header.

Son Heung-Min provided the final assist on Martinez’s opener for the Los Angeles-based football club, who have lost only twice in 16 games since signing the South Korean star last summer.
Hugo Lloris made three saves for the hosts, who held Messi’s Herons scoreless in a match he played for the first time in 15 matches in all competitions, a stretch that dates back to a 3-0 regular-season loss at Charlotte on September 13.
Mexican-Argentinian striker German Berterame made his debut for Miami, which held 63 percent of the possession.
But LAFC threatened constantly in transition, especially during the first half, and finished the night leading 16-13 in shots and 6-3 in efforts on target.
Martinez put LAFC in front in the 38th minute on one such moment.
Timothy Tillman began the attack when his dogged defensive work turned over Messi’s national team teammate Rodrigo de Paul in midfield.
The ball fell to Stephen Eustaquio, who played a first-touch pass to Son above the box. Son played it on into the run of Martinez down the left, and Martinez finished crisply past Dayne St Clair for his eighth career MLS goal.
St Clair created trouble for himself on Bouanga’s tally in the 73rd minute, racing outside the box in an attempt to reach Tillman’s diagonal ball.
But Bouanga was first by a healthy margin and headed the ball beyond the goalkeeper before finishing into a stranded goal.
Bouanga then set up Ordaz to seal it in the fourth minute of second-half stoppage time, beating his defender down the left flank before driving in a low cross.

Should I worry about how much water my AI chatbot conversations are using?
As AI advances at rapid rates, concerns are growing over the vast amount of water it is using. Harriette Boucher takes a look at how people’s AI usage is consuming water, and whether or not it is a problem
- Bookmark
- CommentsGo to comments
AI’s thirst for water has sparked widespread environmental fears, with many concerned that the rapidly advancing technology is putting further strain on the world’s resources.
Each prompt or question a person feeds AI will require energy and water to cool the data centre containing the software. The estimates of how much water AI is using have been widely debated, and different AI companies report varying numbers.
Sam Altman, the chief executive of OpenAI, has said ChatGPT uses less than 1/15 teaspoon for an average query. A Google Gemini study claims an average AI prompt uses less than 0.3ml of water.
But other estimates suggest it uses far more. Research from the University of California in 2023 calculated that ChatGPT “drinks” roughly 500ml of water for every 10 to 50 medium-length responses.
A report by the UK government Digital Sustainability Alliance predicts that AI could drive global water usage up from 1.1 billion to 6.6 billion cubic metres by 2027, an amount equivalent to more than half of the UK’s total water usage.
Why does AI use water?
Data centres, which power software like ChatGPT or Google Gemini, rely on water to cool the systems and prevent them from overheating.
They also use water for electricity generation, and during the manufacturing of the hardware they run on.
The Lincoln Institute of Conventional Policy said a mid-sized data centre will consume as much water as a small town, and a larger one, which requires up to 5 million gallons of water every day, will use as much as a city of 50,000 people.
Why are people concerned about it?
People are concerned about AI’s water consumption as they fear it is putting growing demand on already limited supplies.
By using local water supplies, data centres are putting pressure on surrounding communities, which people fear will only worsen as AI expands, especially in areas where water is already scarce.
Members of the Government Digital Sustainability Alliance Planetary Impact working group said that almost 68 per cent of data centres were near protected or key biodiversity areas, where the ecosystems rely on clean water supplies, and whose communities depended on them.
As the demand for water increases, water scarcity and water stress are becoming more prevalent issues.
The group said: “Demand for fresh water is expected to exceed supply by 40 per cent by the end of the decade and 55 cent of global data centres are in river basins with high risk of water pollution, meaning much of the local water may be unsafe for use, increasing the pressure on clean water supplies and worsening the overall water scarcity in the regions.”
Is it a problem?
Many experts say the amount of water AI is consuming is a global crisis. However, others say that fears have been overstated.
Andy Masley, the director of Effective Altruism DC, a not-for-profit focused on improving the community through research, claims that the amount of water used by an individual is far smaller than most assume.
He said that hundreds of thousands of ChatGPT “prompts” would require less water than your pair of jeans, which the UN says takes around 7,500 litres of water to produce.
“That’s incredibly small by the standards of how most people use water in their day-to-day lives,” he told The Independent. “Almost all of our water footprint is actually invisible to us because it happens off-site and in other places.”
Mr Masley estimates a person would need to submit more than 1,000 prompts in a day to increase their daily water footprint by just 1 per cent.
Staying home and generating that many prompts could actually result in a smaller water footprint than going out and using electricity, he said.
A water footprint measures the total amount of fresh water used to produce a product. The European Union now requires data centres to report their annual fresh water consumption.
Sam Gilbert, a researcher at the University of Cambridge’s Bennett School of Public Policy, said the issue is not individual consumption but the impact that centres have on their immediate environment, and the demand they place on local water supplies.
He said there needs to be more transparency from companies that build and use these data centres around what the real environmental footprint of them is going to be.
Mr Gilbert said that the estimate that ChatGPT uses 500ml of water for every 10 to 50 responses is “probably overstated”.
“But even if it was correct, that’s just not very much water in the context of the amount of water that people use in their everyday lives,” he said.
However, Nick Couldry, a sociologist from the London School of Economics, said: “Whatever the rival calculations on water use, we have to consider the sustainability of the massively increased data processing that an economy and society largely dependent on AI will require.”
He said even if water usage can be reduced, technology companies “want and need us to use AI constantly for even more of our lives”.
“It is hard to see how this addictive business model won’t lead to unsustainable demands on the physical environment and rival versions of AI development will demand even more energy,” he added.
Shaolei Ren, an engineering professor at the University of California, said one of the main issues is that many data centres have a high peak water usage over the summer, which is putting immense pressure on the public water system.
Thames Water has previously warned that data centres could face restrictions on use during the hottest and driest times of the year.
Mr Ren said: “Water is a local and seasonal resource. There’s plenty of water in total, but just not everywhere or every time we need it. Only looking at the total volume without considering locational or timing contexts can miss the important nuances.
“The water infrastructure must be sized to support the peak demand. But expanding the water infrastructure capacity is extremely costly for public water systems.”
Can AI help save water from other processes?
Mr Ren said that AI can also help save water from other processes. Some of the ways in which it is already doing this is through technology that is able to detect leaks and improve energy-efficient water distribution.
In 2024, a water company in Surrey began using AI to reduce leaks across its network. The World Economic Forum reported that once AI-enabled water solutions in the United States are fully implemented, they will be able to reduce water use by 15 per cent.
Google’s data centre in Waltham Cross uses air-cooling to limit the amount of water it uses. A spokesperson told The Independent: "As a pioneer in computing infrastructure, Google’s data centres are some of the most efficient in the world.
“Beyond our operations, Google is committed to improving local watershed health where it operates office campuses and data centres and replenishing 120 per cent of the water it consumes, on average.”

Modi’s Israel visit: Timeline of India’s relations with Israel, Palestine
From Mahatma Gandhi’s support for Palestine to Modi’s Netanyahu embrace, we trace how India’s ties have evolved over the decades.
Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi is scheduled to begin his two-day visit to Israel on February 25, nine years after his first trip to the country.
His 2017 trip was the first ever by an Indian prime minister to Israel.

His upcoming visit also comes just days after India, together with more than 100 other nations, condemned Israel’s de facto expansion in the occupied West Bank after New Delhi initially appeared to hesitate about adding its name to the criticism.
From defence and security to trade and technology, India and Israel have forged tight ties in recent years, even as New Delhi has turned cool towards the plight of Palestinians, despite decades of support for their struggle for a sovereign nation.
While multiple Western leaders have visited Netanyahu in Israel since the October 7, 2023 attack, very few Global South leaders have, making Modi’s visit more significant, say analysts.
Addressing the Conference of Presidents of Major American Jewish Organisations in Jerusalem on February 15, Netanyahu said the two prime ministers were going to discuss “all sorts of cooperation”.
“Tremendous alliance between Israel and India, and we are going to discuss all sorts of cooperation. Now, you know, India is not a small country. It has 1.4 billion people. India is enormously powerful, enormously popular,” he said.
But India’s ties with Israel were not always this cosy. Here is a timeline of how their relations have evolved — from hostility and suspicion, to secret weapons trade and now open embrace — and what that means for India’s relations with Palestine.
1930s and 40s: India opposes the creation of Israel
Under British colonialism, India strongly identified with the Palestinian struggle for independence.
Between 1920 and 1948, Palestine was under British administration, and the United Kingdom, through the Balfour Declaration of 1917, had promised Jews, who had been displaced from Europe due to Adolf Hitler’s oppression, a homeland in the British Mandate in Palestine.
This was opposed by many nations, including India, which were also fighting British colonialism at the time.
“Palestine belongs to the Arabs in the same sense that England belongs to the English, or France to the French,” Mahatma Gandhi, India’s most prominent freedom fighter, revered as the Father of the Nation, wrote in an article in his weekly newspaper Harijan, on November 26, 1938.
While he also sympathised with the Jews in his article and said “the German persecution of the Jews seems to have no parallel in history”, Gandhi stressed that it would be “wrong and inhumane to impose the Jews on the Arabs”.
“It would be a crime against humanity to reduce the proud Arabs so that Palestine can be restored to the Jews partly or wholly as their national home,” he wrote.
In 1947, India became an independent nation, and that same year, it voted against the United Nations Partition Plan of Palestine into the Jewish state of Israel and the state of Palestine, comprising Palestinian Arabs. According to the book, Selected Works of Jawaharlal Nehru, Volume 5, the first Indian prime minister’s sister, Vijaylaxmi Pandit, who was India’s envoy to the UN, received death threats to pressure New Delhi to vote in favour of the division. But the Nehru government did not buckle.
Instead, India, erstwhile Yugoslavia and Iran advocated for a single federated state with — per Nehru — “the largest possible autonomy to respected regions where the Jews and Arabs are in majority”.
“We have maintained that Palestine should be independent and free from the control of any single power; that no solution can be lasting unless it is based on the consent of both Arabs and Jews; and no lasting solution is possible which is imposed and maintained by force,” Nehru said in 1948.
In 1949, India also voted against Israel’s UN membership.
1950s: India recognises Israel, but refuses to set up diplomatic ties
But Israel was keen for recognition and sent many envoys to meet Indian officials.
Renowned scientist Albert Einstein was among those nudged by Israel to help convince India to recognise the Jewish nation.
In a letter to Nehru in June 1947, Einstein told him to end “the rivalries of power politics and the egotism of petty nationalist appetites” and support “the glorious renaissance which has begun in Palestine”.
At the time, Nehru was not convinced, but eventually, on September 17, 1950, India recognised Israel. “We would have [recognised] long ago, because Israel is a fact. We refrained because of our desire not to offend the sentiments of our friends in the Arab countries,” Nehru said, post recognition.
However, India steered clear of establishing diplomatic ties with Israel. For four decades to follow, India even forbade the use of its passport for travel to Israel.
1960s: Pro-Palestinian, with an opening for Israel
India’s political and diplomatic sympathies continued to lie firmly behind the Palestinian cause. In May 1960, Nehru visited UN troops stationed in Gaza.
But when war broke out between India and China in 1962, then Israeli Prime Minister David Ben-Gurion wrote to Nehru, offering his sympathies and weapons.
India accepted Israeli weapons and munitions, but requested that the ships supplying them not bear Israeli flags, so as not to antagonise New Delhi’s Arab allies. These details have been revealed in documents held in archives in Jerusalem, and India has not disputed them. This marked the beginning of a decades-long covert relationship between India and Israel.
Israel again supplied India with munitions during its 1965 war against Pakistan.
1970s: Secret Israeli weapons and a historic Palestinian recognition
As tensions between India and Pakistan spiked in 1971, DN Chatterjee, India’s ambassador to France, wrote to the Ministry of External Affairs, advocating for New Delhi to seek Israeli assistance.
The then prime minister, Indira Gandhi, accepted the proposal, scholar Srinath Raghavan wrote in his book, 1971. Through India’s external intelligence agency, the Research and Analysis Wing (RAW), the country began the process of procuring Israeli arms via Liechtenstein.
Israeli Prime Minister Golda Meir wrote to Indira, seeking diplomatic recognition for Israel in return, but India demurred.
Instead, despite the military help it had sought and received from Israel, India grew even closer to the Palestinian movement diplomatically through the 1970s. In 1974, it became the first non-Arab country to recognise the Palestinian Liberation Organization (PLO) as the sole representative of the Palestinian people. The following year, the PLO opened an office in India. Thousands of Palestinian students came to India for their higher studies.
1980s: ‘My sister’ and a planned attack on a nuclear facility
By the 1980s, India’s relations with Palestine and Israel had fallen into a familiar pattern. New Delhi overtly, loudly declared its support for the Palestinian cause, and PLO leader Yasser Arafat made frequent visits to the country. But covertly, Israel and India had established security ties.
In 1983, when Arafat visited India for a summit of the Non-Aligned Movement, he described Indira, the prime minister, as his “sister”, underscoring the personal and nation-to-nation affinity that existed at the time between India and Palestine.
But the early 1980s also saw Israel propose to India a joint operation to attack a Pakistani nuclear facility, which New Delhi turned down.
In 1988, India became among the world’s first non-Arab nations to recognise Palestinian statehood.
1990s: India and Israel establish diplomatic ties
With the Cold War over and a unipolar world emerging, India adjusted several of its diplomatic positions. Domestically, India opened up its economy starting in 1991. Externally, it reached out to the United States and, in January 1992, turned its long-hidden relationship with Israel into the establishment of formal diplomatic ties.
In a September 2022 report for the Indian think tank Observer Research Foundation, retired Indian diplomat Navdeep Suri wrote that New Delhi took decades to establish diplomatic ties with Israel because of India’s “support for anti-colonial movements and its close ties with Arab countries”.
In fact, India’s prime minister in 1992, PV Narasimha Rao, announced the decision to set up diplomatic ties with Israel just weeks after Arafat had visited New Delhi and said he would respect India’s decision on the matter.
India and Israel set up their embassies in Tel Aviv and New Delhi, respectively.
In 1999, Israel helped India during the Kargil war when its troops were trying to force out Pakistan’s military and Kashmiri rebels who had occupied strategic positions on the Indian side of the de facto border between them, known as the Line of Control or LoC. Israel aided India militarily by supplying laser-guided bomb kits and missiles.
2014 onwards: An open embrace
In the early 2000s, India became one of Israel’s largest buyers of defence equipment.
But in 2014, when Modi came to power, India’s ties with Israel witnessed a sharp upturn; the hesitancy of the past was shed once and for all.
Under the Modi government in 2015, India’s president at the time, Pranab Mukherjee, became the first Indian president to visit Israel, seeking to strengthen bilateral economic and defence ties.
In July 2017, Modi visited Israel, becoming the first Indian prime minister to visit the country. During that visit, according to Indian media reports, Modi and Netanyahu said they “visualised that the two countries will become close partners in development, technology, innovation, entrepreneurship, defence and security”. A year later, in January 2018, Netanyahu also visited New Delhi.
In 2021, under Modi, the Indian Air Force participated in a multilateral air force exercise called Blue Flag-2021 in Israel. Israeli defence companies like Elbit Systems and Rafael Advanced Defense Systems have also established partnerships with Indian firms, such as Adani Group and Tata Advanced Systems.
Trade relations between the two nations have also strengthened under the Modi government. India is currently Israel’s second-largest trading partner in Asia, after China. According to India’s Ministry of External Affairs, trade jumped from $200m in 1992 to $6.5bn in 2024.
India’s main exports to Israel include pearls, precious stones, automotive diesel, chemicals, machinery, and electrical equipment, among others, while imports include petroleum, chemical machinery and transport equipment, etc. The two countries also signed a Bilateral Investment Treaty (BIT) last September.
At a time when many Western countries, including allies of Israel, have sanctioned far-right members of Netanyahu’s cabinet, including Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich, these ministers have been welcomed in India.
Israeli companies have also sought to hire more employees from India in recent years. After Israel suspended work permits for thousands of Palestinians following the October 2023 attack by Hamas and other Palestinian groups, Israel hired thousands of Indians to work in their place.
Meanwhile, India has been a tourist destination for Israelis, with many of them holidaying in the country after serving their mandatory time in the Israeli army.
Kfir Tshuva, a lecturer in economics at the Ramat Gan Academic College in Israel, said, under Modi, India and Israel’s relationship has become more visible and politically open.
However, he noted that India’s approach in the Middle East was also one of strategic balancing — in which New Delhi maintains separate and independent relationships with multiple actors that may have conflicting interests, rather than framing its policy as a zero-sum choice.
“This allows India to deepen cooperation with Israel in areas such as defence, technology and economic integration, while also sustaining diplomatic engagement with the Palestinian leadership and strong ties with Arab states,” he said.
“Modi’s visit to Israel [next week] should therefore be understood within this broader strategic calculus. It reflects New Delhi’s effort to integrate stronger bilateral cooperation with Israel into its wider regional strategy without undermining its commitment to peace, its support for a two-state solution, or its substantive relationships with Arab partners,” he added.
Kadira Pethiyagoda, author and geopolitical strategist, told Al Jazeera that there are currently multiple countervailing forces at play.
“On one hand, India’s short-term interests are advanced by defence trade and investment, and remittances from Israel; on the other, India’s long-term goal of becoming a ‘great power’ with a strategic footprint in the Middle East, invariably involves reducing US regional hegemony,” he said.
“This requires that Israel is balanced by other regional powers, like Iran, which have closer ties to India than the US. India would not want to contribute to Israel achieving complete dominance in the Middle East,” he noted.
What does this mean for India’s relations with Palestine?
Under Modi, India has officially maintained its support for a sovereign Palestinian state alongside Israel — backing the two-state solution — even as he has embraced more publicly warm ties with Netanyahu.
But India has been cautious in criticising Israel’s actions on Gaza, even before the genocidal war that began in 2023.
In 2016, India abstained from a UN vote which sought to bring Israel before the International Criminal Court (ICC) for its alleged war crimes during its conflict with Gaza in 2014. When Israel began its genocidal war on Gaza, India condemned the humanitarian crisis in the enclave but repeatedly abstained from UN resolutions which called for a ceasefire. In 2024, India also abstained from a UN Human Rights Council resolution which called for an arms embargo on Israel.
India has, however, been critical of Israel’s actions in the occupied West Bank. Last week, India joined more than 100 nations in condemning Israel’s recent plans to occupy more territory in the region.
A joint statement issued by the nations rejected “all measures aimed at altering the demographic composition, character and status of the Palestinian Territory occupied since 1967, including East Jerusalem”.
“Such measures violate international law, undermine the ongoing efforts for peace and stability in the region, run counter to the Comprehensive Plan, and jeopardize the prospect of reaching a peace agreement ending the conflict,” the statement added.
But India joined that statement only a day after the first batch of 80 countries and organisations signed it, drawing criticism from the domestic opposition.
Modi’s visit to Israel, too, has drawn condemnation from the opposition Congress party and others, who have accused him of reversing decades of Indian support for the Palestinian cause.
In a post on X after India condemned Israel’s actions in the occupied West Bank, Congress party’s general secretary in charge of communication and media, Jairam Ramesh, said: “This is sheer hypocrisy and cynicism since the PM will be going to Israel early next week. If he is really serious – which of course he is not – he should call out his good friend Mr Netanyahu, and publicly express India’s grave concern at what Israel is executing in the occupied West Bank.”
Analysts have told Al Jazeera that Modi will likely be “highly diplomatic” with respect to discussing the Palestine issue during his Israel trip.
According to Pethiyagoda, India has had a fairly unique position among large powers in maintaining cordial ties with both sides in most of the world’s major conflicts.
“But the timing of the [Israel] visit, when the US is likely to strike Iran, is not ideal in terms of maintaining this image,” he said, referring to soaring tensions between Washington and Tehran. The Trump administration has amassed warships and jets close to Iran, in preparation for a potential attack, even as the US and Iran also engage in diplomatic talks.
He added that during his visit, Modi will likely make reference to the Gaza conflict but “in a neutral, highly diplomatic way”.
Tshuva said beyond India’s engagement with the Palestinian leadership, its ties with Arab states remain strategically significant.
“Gulf countries are vital to India’s energy security, trade flows, investment partnerships and the welfare of millions of Indian nationals working in the region,” he said.
“These economic and geopolitical considerations form an essential part of New Delhi’s Middle East policy and shape its careful approach to the Israeli-Palestinian issue,” he added.

The Finnish men's ice hockey team defeated Slovakia by a score of 6–1 in the bronze medal match at the Milan-Cortina Olympics, bringing Finland's medal tally to six.
That number was the Finnish Olympic Committee's medal goal – a modest target set following the 2024 Paris summer games, when Finland for the first time ever failed to win a single medal.
Finland’s northern neighbour, Norway, has won the most medals at the Italian games, scooping up 40 as of Sunday morning, 18 of them gold. Another neighbour, Sweden, has racked up 16 medals.
The hockey medal is Finland's eighth in Olympic men's ice hockey, but its first medal in any men's international tournament since 2022.
The Lions won gold in Beijing 2022, silver in Calgary 1988 and Turin 2006, collecting bronze medals in 1994, 1998, 2010 and 2014.
Most medals in NHL-powered Olympic tournaments
This was the sixth time that NHL professionals took part in the Olympics, with Finland winning the most hockey medals at these Games, five. The Lions only went home empty-handed from the 2002 Salt Lake City Olympics.
The Finnish men’s hockey team has never lost an Olympic bronze medal match.
It narrowly missed a spot in this year's final, having led 2–0 in the semi-final against Canada, but falling to a 2–3 defeat in the last minute on Friday.
On the final day of the Olympics, Canada and the United States play the all-North-American final, broadcast on Yle TV2 and Areena starting at 3pm Sunday.
Before that, three Finns took part in the women’s 50km classic cross-country ski race. They included Kerttu Niskanen, who ended up in seventh place after winning a bronze medal at the Beijing Olympics four years ago.
The closing ceremony starts at 9.30pm.
22 Feb, 1.26pm: Updated with Niskanen's ranking.

Trump curious why Iran hasn’t capitulated under US pressure

In an interview with Fox News, Witkoff says Trump is questioning why Tehran has not “capitulated” despite what he describes as significant US naval and sea power deployed in the region.
“The president asked me that this morning, and he’s — I don’t wanna use the word frustrated… because he understands he’s got plenty of alternatives, but… he’s curious as to why they haven’t, I don’t wanna use the word capitulated, but why they haven’t capitulated.”
Witkoff suggests that Washington expects Iran to formally state that it does not seek a nuclear weapon and outline concrete steps to prove it.
Witkoff’s remarks come as Iranian officials have repeatedly stressed the peaceful nature of the country's nuclear program. Iran has constantly declared that it is not seeking nuclear weapons, stressing that its nuclear technology is solely for civil purposes. Also, there is a Fatwa by the Leader of the Islamic Revolution, which bans any possession and use of weapons of mass destruction.
Elsewhere in his remarks, Witkoff said that the US insists Iran give up uranium enrichment, adding that this is a red line in negotiations for Washington.
This is while Iranian officials have time and again stressed that they would in no circumstances accept any deal that demands zero enrichment inside the country. Also, Iran's Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi recently said in an interview with MSNBC that the United States did not demand "zero uranium enrichment" from Iran in recent talks in Geneva. Iranian officials have repeatedly criticized American officials for their contradictory statements in negotiations and in media statements.

Blizzard warnings blanket US East Coast, including New York City
Nearly 30M people under alert as powerful northeaster expected to dump up to 2 feet of snow
ISTANBUL
Blizzard warnings have been issued across a wide stretch of the US East Coast as a powerful winter storm threatened to unleash heavy snow, strong winds, and coastal flooding from the Mid-Atlantic to New England.
The US National Weather Service said early Saturday that nearly 30 million people were under blizzard warnings from Sunday morning through Monday afternoon, including residents of New York City, where forecasters said snowfall could reach up to 18 inches, with as much as 2 feet possible in some areas.
The warnings span from Delaware to southern Connecticut, with the heaviest snowfall expected Sunday night into early Monday. Snowfall rates could exceed 1 to 2 inches per hour at times, according to the Weather Service.
It marks the first blizzard warning issued for New York City since 2017. The city last experienced a record-breaking snowfall in 2016, when 27.5 inches were recorded in Central Park, the highest total since record-keeping began in 1869.
Forecasters warned that sustained winds of 25-35 mph could reduce visibility to near zero and increase the risk of power outages and coastal flooding, according to The New York Times.
Travel conditions are expected to become “dangerous, if not impossible,” particularly during Monday morning and evening commutes in major cities, including Washington, DC, Philadelphia, New York, and Boston.
Washington, DC, is forecast to see a mix of rain and snow early Sunday, transitioning to all snow by midday, with accumulations of up to 5 inches expected.
Philadelphia could receive up to 12 inches, while New York City and surrounding areas – including Long Island, northeastern New Jersey, and coastal and southern Connecticut – may see 15-20 inches or more, depending on the storm’s track.
Meteorologists described the system as a classic nor'easter, expected to develop off the coast of the Carolinas before rapidly intensifying as it tracks northward offshore.
New York City Mayor Zohran Mamdani said sanitation crews were preparing more than 700 salt spreaders and outfitting 2,200 vehicles with plows ahead of the storm. A workforce of 2,600 employees, including 1,000 emergency snow shovelers, is scheduled to begin operations early Sunday.
The city is also inviting residents to sign up as paid emergency snow shovelers at local sanitation facilities as the storm begins.

NASA delays Artemis II moon mission to April over rocket system issue
Space agency rules out March launch window, targets early or late April for crewed lunar flight
ISTANBUL
NASA has delayed its Artemis II mission to the moon until at least April after engineers identified a new issue with the rocket’s helium system, the agency said Saturday.
The mission, initially scheduled for March 6, would have marked the first crewed lunar flight in more than 50 years. However, the problem detected during routine testing led mission managers to rule out the March launch window.
NASA Administrator Jared Isaacman said the issue may involve a faulty filter, valve or connection plate. He said the only way to inspect and repair the affected area is to roll the 322-foot (98-meter) Space Launch System rocket back to its hangar at Kennedy Space Center in Florida.
“We will begin preparations for rollback, and this will take the March launch window out of consideration,” Isaacman said in a post on US-based social media platform X. He added that the next available launch opportunities would be in early or late April.
NASA said the latest issue is not related to previous hydrogen fuel leaks that delayed earlier launch attempts. A recent fueling test had cleared the mission for a possible March launch before the new problem emerged.
Artemis II is planned to send astronauts around the moon and back, marking the first such mission since NASA’s Apollo program ended in 1972. The Artemis program completed its first uncrewed lunar mission in 2022.

Ancient church frescoes and gilded gold: Exploring Polotsk Art Gallery's rich legacy

Today, the Art Gallery, one of the popular cultural institutions of ancient Polotsk, celebrates its 45th anniversary since founding. It is part of the National Polotsk Historical and Cultural Museum-Reserve and is housed in a building that was once part of the former Jesuit Collegium, an example of the 18th century architecture. Originally called the City Picture Gallery, it opened on 20 February 1981. On the eve of this milestone, BelTA reached out to the museum to talk about the rich legacy of the musuem.
Forty-five years ago, the building of the Epiphany Cathedral was given over to the Picture Gallery. In 1992, the cathedral was returned to the Polotsk Diocese, and the cultural institution moved to the nearby Museum of Belarusian Book Printing. The gallery found its current home in 2002, and the head of state participated in its opening. Now, across three floors of the former Jesuit Collegium building, visitors can see both permanent and rotating exhibitions. It also has its own art salon
Both Belarusians and international visitors come here to explore the rich cultural heritage of the past and the works of contemporary masters. Some visitors are interested only in archaeological finds, but there are also those who prefer guided tours of all the exhibition halls. The gallery has an influx of visitors in the summer. Here, you can use an audio guide to independently explore the gallery's collections or wander through the halls with a tour guide. Additionally, detailed information is posted at the entrance to each hall, describing what is on display - art movements, authors, historical features, and painting styles. According to the staff, a full examination of the exhibits typically takes up to three hours on average.To mark the gallery’s 45th anniversary, an exhibition of contemporary artists has been mounted. “The First Quarter” exposition presents a collection of 50 works created between 2000 and 2025, i.e. the first quarter of the 21st century.
The gallery’s second floor showcases an exhibition of paintings by 20th-century Belarusian artists. The collection spans Realism, Socialist Realism, the so-called severe style of the 1950s and 1960s, as well as individual collections of works distinguished by their own unique techniques.
The first floor features specimens of the 19th-century ancient iconography and murals uncovered during the restoration of the Transfiguration Church on the grounds of the St. Euphrosyne Convent.
The oldest artifact and one of the gallery’s most valuable archaeological items is the icon “Saints Constantine and Helena.” It dates back to the 12th century. The stone icon is made of soapstone and was discovered in 1967 during excavations at the St. Sophia Cathedral in Polotsk. The icon depicts Saint Constantine the Great, Equal-to-the-Apostles, the Roman Emperor during whose reign Christianity became the dominant religion in the empire, and his mother, Helena, canonized for her work spreading Christianity. During his lifetime, the emperor venerated the Holy Cross and provided funds for his mother’s pilgrimage to Jerusalem. Helena, along with Macarius, the Patriarch of Jerusalem, recovered the True Cross from Mount Golgotha, and thus, in 326, the Christian world acquired this relic.
Another example of ancient church art is a 12th-century engolpion cross, intended to hold the relics of saints. It was also found during archaeological excavations in Polotsk.
The icon collection includes items donated by residents of Polotsk and Polotsk District. The best-preserved icons are those cast in copper, typically used in Old Believer communities, where they sought to create images from materials that could travel well and were relatively lightweight. According to their belief, anything that had been treated with fire was considered consecrated. In the gallery, one can also find examples of icons with wooden covers, which could easily be mistaken for metal ones due to being overlaid with gold leaf. This openwork carving, characteristic of Belarusian craftsmen, has brought them fame beyond the country’s borders. In addition, works by local amateur masters are also on display here.

The most popular exhibit among visitors is the 19th-century mural
painting. “It was removed during the restoration of the Transfiguration
Church, a 12th-century structure. Initially, the church walls were
completely covered with frescoes, applied using water-based paints. They
had to be applied to wet plaster so the paint would be fully absorbed.
Over time, these frescoes darkened, and in the 19th century, it was
decided to repaint them, covering them with new paintings. Since it was
impossible to replicate the frescoes in their original form, they were
repainted using oil paint, which creates a kind of film. In 1885, the
first layer of painting was done, meaning all the 12th-century
monumental art was covered, and then, 50 years later, a second stage of
restoration took place,” the gallery staff explained.
When
restoration work began in 1992, the question arose of how to preserve
the impressive 19th-century wall paintings. For this project, Belarusian
specialists, together with a team of Russian restorers, developed a
special technique that made it possible to detach the oil paint and
transfer it onto a prepared backing. Today, the fruits of this
meticulous, 20-year endeavor are on display at the Art Gallery, offering
visitors a chance to appreciate the truly monumental work done by these
masters of their craft.
“There is no other exhibition like this anywhere in Belarus,” the cultural workers assured. It is for its uniqueness that visitors, both residents and visitors of Polotsk, value it most of all.

Hong Kong official warns of lower payout if Tai Po fire victims reject buy-back plan
Deputy finance chief Michael Wong urges Wang Fuk Court flat owners to ‘make a wise decision’ or face lower compensation under possible legislation
The acquisition price for properties damaged in Hong Kong’s deadly Tai Po fire will be “far lower” if homeowners reject the government’s buy-back offer and authorities are forced to use legislation to acquire the remaining properties, a senior official has said.
Deputy Financial Secretary Michael Wong Wai-lun on Sunday dismissed claims that the government was using public funds to cover its responsibility for the Tai Po tragedy, following online criticism that taxpayers’ money was being used to support individual property owners.
The government is expected to spend about HK$6.8 billion (US$870 million) to buy back damaged flats at Wang Fuk Court, offering HK$8,000 or HK$10,500 per square foot. Of that total, HK$2.8 billion will come from a dedicated support fund, with the remaining HK$4 billion drawn from public coffers.
Wong said the proposal was a compassionate arrangement aimed at helping owners purchase a new home, warning that otherwise they might lose their investment without significant government intervention.
“Society should look at it comprehensively,” he said on a radio show.
In a separate television interview, Wong added the proposal represented an “appropriate use” of public money, stressing that the Wang Fuk Court case was “exceptional” and would not set a precedent.

Chef, 34, arrested for allegedly spraying unknown liquid on 3 women in Hong Kong
Suspect apprehended on Saturday over three separate incidents near Tai Wai MTR station during Christmas and Lunar New Year holidays
A 34-year-old chef has been arrested for allegedly spraying an unknown liquid on three female pedestrians near Hong Kong’s Tai Wai MTR station in separate incidents during the Christmas and Lunar New Year holiday periods.
The first incident took place on Christmas morning, when a woman crossing a footbridge on Mei Tin Road felt liquid dripping on her hair and saw a man running away from her soon after.
Police arrested the man on suspicion of common assault on January 8 and later released him on bail.
Another woman reported that her hair and jacket were found to be wet with an unknown liquid after she walked past Sin Sam House in Lung Hang Estate on the first night of Lunar New Year on Tuesday.
On Thursday morning, a third victim discovered liquid on her hair at Che Kung Temple Road Playground. She, too, saw a man fleeing the scene.
The chef, a Sha Tin resident, was again arrested – this time for loitering – on Saturday morning.

US, South Korea postpone announcement of date for major springtime military drills
It comes due to coordination issues over on-field exercises, as Seoul seeks to minimize on-field training while Washington reportedly expressed disapproval
ISTANBUL
The US and South Korean militaries have decided to postpone announcing a date for their major springtime exercise for this year due to differences over the scale of on-field drills, the Seoul-based Yonhap News reported on Sunday.
The two militaries had planned to make the announcement in a joint press briefing Wednesday, but it was postponed after the US military expressed reluctance over Seoul's proposal to minimize field training during the Freedom Shield exercise, the news agency reported, citing security sources.
The Freedom Shield drill takes place every spring under an all-out war scenario as the allies seek to enhance readiness against North Korea's "advancing nuclear and weapons programs."
President Lee Jae Myung's administration has sought to scale back the allies' on-field drills in an apparent reconciliatory gesture to Pyongyang, which has long denounced them as preparations for an invasion against it.
The announcement was postponed due to coordination issues over on-field exercises as Seoul seeks to minimize on-field training.
The US military, however, has reportedly expressed disapproval of South Korea's proposal, as additional troops and equipment have already arrived in the country to take part in the drills.
The two sides plan to coordinate further and announce the exercise later this month or in early March.
According to Seoul's Defense Ministry, the Freedom Shield exercise, planned for March, "will take place normally."

US avoids condemning settler killing of Palestinian-American in armed West Bank attack
Asked for comment on killing of 19-year-old Nasrallah Abu Siam in settler attack, US State Department says it has ‘no higher priority’ than safety of Americans, is ‘monitoring’ situation
US President Donald Trump’s administration said Saturday that it was “aware of” the settler killing of a Palestinian-American in the West Bank a few days earlier, but avoided condemning the attack.
Asked for comment on the Wednesday killing of 19-year-old Nasrallah Abu Siam in an armed settler attack on the central West Bank Palestinian village of Mukhmas, a US State Department spokesperson asserted the administration “has no higher priority than the safety and security of Americans.”
”We are aware of the death of an American citizen in the West Bank,” the spokesperson continued. “We are closely monitoring the situation and stand ready to provide consular assistance.”
“Out of respect for the privacy of the family and loved ones during this difficult time, we have no further comment at this time,” the statement added.
The Trump administration has largely avoided commenting on settler violence in the West Bank. The rare exceptions have come in incidents involving US citizens, though that did not appear to be the case this time.
Mukhmas residents cited by the Kan public broadcaster said Abu Siam was shot when some 30 masked settlers, some of them armed, raided Palestinian barns and stole 380 head of livestock, as Palestinian shepherds tried to fend off the settlers. In addition to Abu Siam, four Palestinians were wounded in the attack.

The Haaretz newspaper cited one eyewitness as saying the settlers surrounded Abu Siam after he was shot, “hit him with clubs and stones, and almost killed him. They acted like animals — there was no humanity in them.”
Soldiers who arrived on the scene “watched them and did nothing except hurl tear gas at us. It was awful,” the person said, adding that the military ordered Palestinians to leave the barns.
In response to a query, the IDF said troops were dispatched to Mukhmas on Wednesday “following a report of rioting and violent confrontations that included stone-throwing,” and that later, “another force arrived at the scene and used riot dispersal means to restore order.”
The military said it later received reports of gunfire by “suspects” that resulted in several Palestinians being wounded.
Abu Siam was the first person killed by Israeli settlers in the West Bank in 2026, and the 37th since the Hamas-led onslaught of October 7, 2023, according to the PA’s official news agency WAFA.
He was also at least the sixth American citizen to be killed in the West Bank by Israeli forces or settlers since October 7, 2023. American-born teenagers Tawfic Abdel Jabbar and Mohammad Khdour were killed in early 2024 by Israeli fire while driving in the West Bank. In April 2025, 14-year-old Amer Rabee, a New Jersey native, was shot in the head at least nine times by Israeli forces, according to his father.
In July 2025, two Palestinian-Americans were killed in separate settler attacks: 20-year-old Saif Musallet was beaten to death while visiting family in the town of Sinjil; 41-year-old Khamis Ayyad, from Chicago, died from smoke inhalation after settlers allegedly set his West Bank home on fire.
Mike Huckabee, the US ambassador to Israel, in a rare direct condemnation, demanded Israel investigate Musallet’s killing, calling it a “criminal and terrorist act,” but Israeli authorities still have not arrested anyone in connection to the case.
Settler attacks have spiked since Hamas attacked Israel on October 7, 2023, killing 1,200 people and taking 251 hostages, which sparked the war in Gaza.
The settler attacks, which occur on a near-daily basis, largely go unchecked.
Prosecutions of Jewish extremists are rare, and convictions are even rarer. Critics have accused the government, described as the most hardline in Israel’s history, of shrugging off the attacks.
Data published by the IDF and Shin Bet security agency last month showed a 27 percent rise in settler attacks in 2025 compared to the previous year.

It's on: US and Canada face off for Olympic gold in men's hockey as Winter Games come to a close
The U.S. and Canada meet in the men's gold-medal hockey game at the Winter Olympics after each went 5-0 to advance
- Bookmark
It had to be the U.S. and Canada for Olympic gold.
As the 4 Nations Face-Off a year ago showed, the North American powerhouses are atop the hockey world on the international stage. They proved it at this tournament, with the U.S. going through Sweden and Canada getting past Czechia and Finland to make the most-anticipated final possible happen.
A gold medal would still mean everything to the players and coaches involved, but it feels right to have the two border rivals as the last teams standing in Milan.
“If you’re going to get through to your goal, you’re going to probably have to go through them at some point," U.S. winger Matthew Tkachuk said. "They’ve had the success in pretty much all the Olympics that NHL players have been going to. Two great teams, and I can only speak for ourselves, we’re just so excited for this opportunity, honored to represent our country and honored to be in this position.”
Canada won the past two Olympics where NHL players participated, in 2010 and 2014. The U.S. has not taken home gold in men's hockey since the 1980 “Miracle on Ice" team.
That's ancient history. These countries have more recent history from two epic 4 Nations games, including the first one that opened with three fights in nine seconds. Fighting is not allowed at the Olympics, though Canada's Tom Wilson didn't care about the automatic ejection when he dropped the gloves against France.
“There’s no fighting (but) I expect a hard-fought game, the same as it was the last two times we played them,” U.S. forward J.T. Miller said.
Canada may be shorthanded: Captain Sidney Crosby left the quarterfinal game against Czechia with an apparent right knee injury and did not play in the semifinal against Finland, when his teammates rallied from a two-goal deficit to advance to the final.
The U.S. should be at full strength after winger Tage Thompson — tied for the team lead in goals with three — left the semifinal against Slovakia after blocking a shot. Thompson is expected to be good to go for what is the biggest game of a lot of players' careers.
“Everybody that’s playing is going to be 50 years old one day, not playing in the NHL anymore and playing thousands of games hopefully, and you’re going to remember start to finish a handful of games,” Tkachuk said. "This is probably one of them.”

Missiles Pound Kyiv Ahead Of Russian Invasion Anniversary
Unknown

17:10:02 KST

Explosions rocked Ukraine's capital Kyiv early on Sunday with officials warning of a ballistic missile attack, just two days before the fourth anniversary of Russia's invasion.
AFP journalists in Kyiv heard a series of blasts starting at around 4:00 am, shortly after an air raid alert was issued, with the air force later widening the alert warning nationwide citing the threat of missiles.
"The enemy is attacking the capital with ballistic weapons," the head of Kyiv's military administration Tymur Tkachenko said on Telegram, urging people to remain in shelters.
Kyiv Mayor Vitali Klitschko said on Telegram that two wounded people, a woman and a child, were rushed to hospitals from the suburbs.
The Ukrainian capital, regularly targeted by Russian missile and drone attacks since the start of the invasion on February 24, 2022, has faced waves of overnight strikes in recent weeks as Moscow has intensified its winter assaults on energy and military infrastructure.
Temperatures had plunged to nearly minus 10 degrees Celsius when the capital was struck, with emergency services deployed across the city.
Tkachenko said the attacks had caused a fire on the roof of a residential building.
The bombardment prompted heightened vigilance across Ukraine, all the way to the western border.
Poland's Operational Command said early Sunday it was scrambling jets after detecting "long‑range aviation of the Russian Federation conducting strikes on the territory of Ukraine."
It also came hours after blasts in Lviv, a western city near the Polish border that rarely sees deadly attacks.
Explosions ripped through a central shopping street at around midnight, killing a policewoman and injuring 15 people after officers responded to a reported break‑in.
"This is clearly an act of terrorism," Mayor Andriy Sadovyi said, offering no details on perpetrators.
Ukraine 'not losing'
Ukraine will mark four years since Russia's assault on February 24, 2022, a war that has shattered towns, uprooted millions and killed large numbers on both sides.
Moscow occupies close to a fifth of Ukrainian territory and continues to grind forward in places, especially in the eastern Donbas region, despite heavy losses and repeated Ukrainian strikes on logistics.
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky told AFP on Friday that Ukraine was "definitely not losing" the war and that victory remained the goal.
He said Ukrainian forces had clawed back about 300 square kilometres of territory in recent counter‑attacks, gains AFP could not immediately verify.
If confirmed, they would be Kyiv's most significant advances since 2023.
Sweeping outages of Starlink internet terminals across the Ukraine front, shut down by owner Elon Musk following a plea from Kyiv, have enabled the push, according to Zelensky.
The United States is pushing both sides to end the war, brokering several rounds of talks in recent weeks without a clear breakthrough.
Zelensky, under mounting pressure from Washington to consider concessions, said on X on Saturday he planned consultations with European leaders in the coming days and wanted deeper involvement from Middle Eastern states and Turkey.

Poppy thieves steal thousands of plants from Victorian farm, sparking health warning
Thieves stole about 1700 alkaloid poppy plants from a farm in the Ballarat area earlier this month prompting health experts to warn the plant’s products could kill people.
Ballarat detectives are investigating the thefts that happened sometime between February 14 and 16.
Police have “strongly discouraged” anyone from handling, transporting or experimenting with the plants due to the life-threatening levels of toxicity.
The plants were grown for pharmaceutical use only, and at least 40 people were hospitalised with life-threatening conditions after drinking tea made from this type of poppy in recent years.
A drug alert from the Victorian Department of Health on Saturday said these poppy plants only have tiny trace amounts of opioids and can cause seizures and other issues.
“These poppies are very different from traditional opioid poppies and contain dangerously high concentrations of thebaine and oripavine, with risk of life-threatening toxicity. They contain only tiny (‘trace’) amounts of traditional opioids like morphine and codeine,” the alert said.
“Thebaine is very different from the opioids in traditional opium poppies.
“Thebaine does not produce pain relief, sedation or euphoria. Thebaine stimulates the nervous system and can lead to seizures, high body temperature, and life-threatening toxicity. Any exposure to thebaine may cause toxicity.”
Thebaine is used in the industrial manufacture of some drugs, among other uses.
The alert further warns people that the toxicity caused by these plants will not be reversed by the life-saving Naxolone that is used for treating opioid overdoses.
“Oripavine can produce opioid-like effects such as sedation, slowed breathing, and small pupils. However, oripavine is not used medically because it can also cause severe toxicity (agitation, seizures) and life-threatening complications at high doses,” it read.
“The effects may be unpredictable, particularly when combined with thebaine.
“Naloxone will reverse the opioid effects of oripavine but will not reverse the toxic stimulant effects. Naloxone will not reverse thebaine toxicity.”
At least 40 people experienced life-threatening symptoms from these kinds of products in 2022-2023.
“Poppy plant products may include dried flower heads (without petals), ground poppy-plant material, or liquid preparations derived from poppy plants. These products may contain high concentrations of thebaine and oripavine that lead to life-threatening toxicity,” the alert said.
“In 2022-2023 at least 40 people experienced life-threatening effects following consumption of thebaine-contaminated poppy seed ‘tea’ – including agitation, muscle twitching, high body temperature and seizures.”
Police continue to investigate the thefts and they have urged anyone who may have witnessed the thefts or has vision or information to contact them anonymously at crimestoppersvic.com.au or phone 1800 333 000.

Terrorist attack in Lviv: Police officer killed, 24 people injured
The Lviv regional police announced this on Facebook, Ukrinform reports.
The officer killed in the attack was 23-year-old Viktoriia Shpylka.
"She was originally from the Volyn region and later moved with her parents to Kherson. She chose the path of serving people – she graduated from Lviv State University of Internal Affairs and joined the patrol police. She first served in the Kherson region and, since 2023, in the Lviv region," the police said.
A patrol police service vehicle and a civilian vehicle were damaged.
Preliminary reports indicate that improvised explosive devices detonated.
"At around 00:30 today, a report was received on the 102 emergency line about a break-in at a store on Danylyshyna Street. After a patrol police crew arrived at the scene, an explosion occurred. Later, when a second crew arrived, another explosion went off," the statement said.
According to Maksym Kozytskyi, head of the Lviv Regional Military Administration, some of the injured are in serious condition.

Russia attacked Ukraine with dozens of strike drones and ballistic and cruise missiles, focusing on energy infrastructure, the Ukrainian military and local officials said on Sunday.
The overnight strikes hit Kiev and the region around the capital, the Black Sea port Odessa and central Ukraine, they said. At least one person was injured in the Kiev region, with damage reported in five districts where more than a dozen houses were damaged, regional Governor Mykola Kalashnyk said on the Telegram messaging app.
Odessa Governor Oleh Kiper wrote on Telegram that a nighttime drone attack on the energy infrastructure of the region caused fires that had been extinguished.
Russia attacks the Ukrainian energy system almost daily, striking thermal power plants and electrical substations.
Attacks on power stations, the energy transmission system and the gas sector are important elements of the full-scale invasion of Ukraine launched by Russia in February 2022. Moscow says it is seeking to undermine Ukraine's ability to fight.
"Russia continues to undermine diplomacy with terrorist mass strikes," Ukrainian foreign minister Andrii Sybiha said on X.
"This terror cannot be normalised; it must be stopped. Russia cannot wag the world, just as the tail cannot wag the dog," he said, calling on the international community to impose tough sanctions against the Kremlin.

Explosion in Lviv
Separately, one police officer was killed and 24 other people were injured after several explosive devices detonated at midnight in Lviv in western Ukraine, the National Police said on Sunday.
"It has been preliminarily established that homemade explosive devices detonated," the police said on the Telegram messaging service.
The police said that the first explosion occurred after a patrol crew arrived at the suspected scene of a shop break-in, while the second explosion occurred a little later.
The mayor of Lviv, Andriy Sadovyi, called the incident a terrorist act.

China amps up electric ships in push to decarbonise waterways, leverage EV prowess
Twin strengths, battery technology and shipbuilding, are being fused to electrify maritime transport, moving beyond short-haul passenger vessels to commercial cargo
Having electrified its highways, China is mobilising its shipbuilding prowess and battery giants such as CATL to overhaul some shipping fleets, betting that the revolution in green transport can float as well as it drives.
The shift towards clean energy underscores Beijing’s broader decarbonisation commitment – vowing to peak carbon emissions by 2030 and achieve neutrality by 2060. These goals have spurred substantial strides in renewable capacity installation, end-use revamps, new technology development and carbon trading.
More than 1,000 vessels powered by electricity or alternative fuels are currently operating on China’s vast network of inland waterways, including 485 e-vessels, most of which are river passenger ships, according to data from the Ministry of Transport.
However, some governments and companies are pivoting towards the development of electric cargo vessels, moving beyond short-haul passenger ships but largely confining this shift for now to domestic waterways rather than international deep-sea freight.
Fujian Shipbuilding Industry Group launched a pure-electric cargo ship on February 7. Designed to transport up to 1,000 tonnes of freight on the Min River, the vessel boasts a 200km (124-mile) range on a single charge.
Contemporary Amperex Technology (CATL), the world’s largest EV battery producer, has partnered with Jining Energy, a state-owned firm in Shandong province, to develop electric vessels with a 2,000-tonne load capacity and a range of up to 270km (158 miles) on a single charge. Five units were launched in December, with Jining Energy placing orders for an additional 50 ships.

Japan youth share photos to show before and after cosmetic surgeries, raise copycat concerns
AI-generated before and after images posted online raise fears about promoting risky procedures; warping youngsters ideas about beauty
Young people in Japan are using artificial intelligence (AI) to make before-and-after cosmetic surgery photographs which look like they are two “different” versions of themselves in a single setting.
Data suggests the country is relatively relaxed about cosmetic procedures, but the latest trend is raising concerns about the effect it might have on youngsters.
According to the Japan Society of Aesthetic Plastic Surgery, the country logged about 3.3 million aesthetic medical procedures in 2022, making it one of the world’s biggest markets.
Compared with South Korea, known for cutting-edge, trend-led treatments, Japan’s industry is often associated with precision and subtle, natural-looking results.
This month, a Japanese online user called @rori_bb went viral after posting an AI-made “two-shot” that placed her current face beside her pre-surgery self. She captioned that she compared the two and ended up crying.
The post racked up 15.8 million views and sparked a wave of copycat images across social media.

Lithuanian teenager builds record-breaking snowman

A 10th-grade student from the small town of Semeliškės has built what is believed to be Lithuania’s tallest snowman, reaching a height of 6.9 metres after weeks of work in freezing winter conditions.
Rokas Rulevičius, 16, from Semeliškės in the Elektrėnai municipality, spent hours each day since January constructing the massive snowman in his family’s yard. After returning from school, he would head straight outside to continue building before starting his homework. On some days, he worked four to five hours, and up to eight hours on weekends.
Even on a day when schools were closed due to record-low temperatures, Rulevičius continued working outdoors.
The idea of building a colossal snowman had been on his mind for years. In 2019, he tried constructing one with his family, reaching about 2.5 meters before melting snow halted the effort. He made another attempt on his own in 2022, but said the conditions – or perhaps his enthusiasm – were not sufficient for an impressive result.
This winter, however, brought unusually cold and snowy weather, and Rulevičius decided not to miss the opportunity.
At first, when the snow was sticky enough to hold its shape, he carried it in buckets, building the structure layer by layer. Each circular layer required 24 buckets of snow, with each bucket holding 25 litres. He built at least a dozen such layers.
As the base grew taller and the snow became less adhesive, he adapted his approach. Rulevičius constructed a frame from a metal fence and filled it with snow, watering it with a watering can to help it freeze into place. While refining his technique, the structure developed a slight lean.
As the snowman rose higher, he needed a ladder to continue. Recent icy conditions also made the work more challenging. Although there was plenty of snow, he had to clear a large area of nearby fields to gather enough material.
His parents did not discourage him, though they occasionally asked whether the snowman might already be tall enough. Rulevičius persisted until he surpassed the previous national record.
The tallest snowman previously recorded in Lithuania was built in 2019 and measured 6.7 metres. Rulevičius’ creation exceeds that mark by at least 20 centimetres. The new record has not yet been officially registered but is expected to be submitted soon.
The towering snowman now stands as tall as the roof of a nearby farm building. While it is not clearly visible from the town centre, visitors have already begun stopping by to see and photograph it.
“I’m happy that I managed to achieve this result and that I did it all with my own hands,” Rulevičius said. “I think it was more useful than sitting at a computer.”

Many cleaning products contain harmful ingredients

According to the Christian trade union ACV, many cleaning agents that we use every day contain chemical that could be harmful to our health. The union commissioned research into the risks posed to the health of domestic cleaners by the use of cleaning agents.
The research concludes that domestic cleaners in particular have an increased risk of lung and heart problems. The Leuven University (KU Leuven) Professor of Occupation Medicine Lode Godderis told the VRT’s consumer team ‘WinWin’ that “The impact is often underestimated”. ‘WinWin’ examined which chemicals are used to make the products we use every day to clean our homes.
Karolien from Minderhout (Antwerp Province) works as a domestic cleaner. She told ‘WinWin’ that she suffers health issues such as skin irritations.
"I only started wearing gloves once my fingers had completely dried up in the evening”. She find that the smell of the products is too strong and she tries not to inhale it. “But I don’t know exactly what is in them”. Karolien is not the only domestic cleaner that has issue. Many other have similar medical complaints. They don’t always have a say in the products that they have to use in their work.
Skin complaints and lung problems
A large-scale study conducted in 2023 by the Christian trade union ACV shows that shows that a strikingly large group of domestic cleaners suffer from health issues that are directly linked to their daily exposure to cleaning products.
33% of the domestic cleaners surveyed reported having skin problems. In addition to this 28% said that they suffer from lung and respiratory problems. Coughing, tightness of the chest, shortness of breath, and even headaches are remarkably common among those employed as cleaners and complaints of this nature are more common than among those with other kinds of job.
Professor Lode Godderis (KU Leuven) told the VRT that
Many traditional cleaning products contain a mixture of chemical ingredients that have an impact on our health. “It is this that causes irritation to the lungs, making you cough or become short of breath. It can also cause allergies and even asthma,” says Professor Godderis says. According to Mr Godderis, aerosol cleaning products are particularly harmful: “With these products you inhale more. It is better to add a cleaning product to a bucket of water than to spray it.”
Endocrine disruptors
But what exactly is in the cleaning products? Solvents ensure that a product evaporates quickly. Detergents and disinfectants are designed to combat dirt and bacteria and foam boosters make the whole thing look more effective and give us the impression that a floor or other surface is clean more quickly even if this is not always necessarily the case.
In addition to this, there are preservatives that extend shelf life and fragrances that make the room that has been cleaned smell nice. It is these fragrant components, such as limonene that can be particularly irritating, especially to people that are exposed to them on a daily basis.
Protect yourself, your family and your cleaner
ACV has provided a list of tips to help protect yourself, your family and if you have one your clear from the harmful effects of overexposure to cleaning agents.
Provide gloves for your cleaning assistant
Avoid aggressive products and sprays
Consider using alternative cleaning products, such as vinegar, ecological soap (Marseille soap) and sodium bicarbonate (baking soda).
Use eco-friendly products that don’t contain harmful chemicals.

Are indoor cats less happy than outdoor cats?
Unknown

17:00:00 KST

A question that many cat-owners ask themselves is whether or not to allow their pet outside. But is it necessary to allow a cat out to explore with the risks this entails not only for cat itself (traffic, fights with other cats…), but also for the local fauna? Is a cat as happy living its live indoors as it would be if it were an outdoor cat?
The cat behaviour therapist Anneleen Bru says that every cat is different.
"Not every cat is by definition an animal that needs to go outside”. Anneleen Bru adds that we shouldn’t assume that an indoor cat is less happy than an outdoor cat.
"Each cat is unique and not every cat would preffer to be outside rather than indoors. You also can’t just turn an outdoor cat into an indoor cat. It always depends on the individual situation”.
Nevertheless, Anneleen Bru told VRT Radio 2 that there are some telltale signs in a cat’s behaviour that show its owner whether they have taken the right decision by keeping their pet indoors or allowing it out.
Beware of “the zoomies”
There’s a thing that exists that is known as locomotor play. This is when your cat plays with its surroundings and, for example, literally flies back and forth over your furniture or runs up and down the stairs.
This is also known as “the zoomies”. Cats that really engage this type of play benefit from being able to go outside, climb trees and explore their surroundings”, Anneleen Bru explains. “You really see them blossom. When they’re allowed out"
Read your cat’s body language
You can also learn a lot from your cat’s body language. “Look at your cat’s whiskers. If they are pointing forwards, your cat is happy. If they are pointing back your cat feels ill at ease”.
A cat’s tail also tells you a lot about its mood. “If the tail is upright or like a question mark, you have a happy cat. Your cat is not happy if its tail is pointing down it is not happy. You can learn a lot by looking at a cat’s whiskers and its tail.
If you notice that your cat often hides or seeks solitude or that it often acts afraid. “Then this is a sign of chronic stress. In this case it would be a good idea to look and your cat’s living quarters”.
Always take your cat’s behaviour into account
Annelene Bru stresses that ultimately the decision lies with the cat owner “This also differs from person to person. Consider where you live and to what extent it is feasible or safe to let your cat outside.
If you live near to a busy road, you may be more inclined to keep your pet indoors. Other cat owners, however, cannot bring themselves to deprive their cat of its freedom. Whatever you decide, should always take your cat's behavior into account.

The reason you don’t exercise – and the best way to overcome it
In the latest Well Enough newsletter, Harry Bullmore explores why we struggle to turn good intentions into regular exercise – and how ‘exercise snacking’ and other small, expert-backed habits can deliver meaningful health gains without the all-or-nothing overhaul

The article below is an excerpt from my newsletter: Well Enough with Harry Bullmore. To get my latest thoughts on fitness and wellbeing pop your email address into the box above to get the newsletter direct to your inbox.
In today’s newsletter we’re going to attempt to solve one of the biggest health and fitness conundrums going: “We know exercise is good for us, so why don’t we do more of it?”
My inspiration came from a PureGym survey that fell into my inbox a few days ago. It found that “76 per cent of adults aspire to be fit and healthy”, but “only three in 10 people in the UK meet recommended weekly activity levels”.
Few, if any, people set out to live an unhealthy life – I’d wager most actively chase the opposite. But there’s a significant disconnect between wanting to be fitter and actually doing the things we know will get us there. Why?
To answer this, I like to look at exercise like a detective in a crime drama – people need motive, means and opportunity. It requires enough gumption to get out of the door; the time, energy and resources to take part; and a conducive environment to keep going.
These criteria are hard to hit in 2026, courtesy of a cost of living crisis, increasingly busy schedules, and alternatives to exercise (phones, social media, streaming services and so on) being specifically engineered to steal your time.
There’s no absolute solution to this, but we can shrink the obstacles standing in our way to make them easier to overcome. To do this, the best expert-backed method I’ve encountered is exercise snacking.
The premise is simple: short bursts of equipment-free activity that can test your muscles and get you out of breath, spread throughout the day in digestible chunks lasting no more than five minutes. For example, climbing a few flights of stairs at a brisk pace or performing a series of squats and press-ups at your desk – this article has plenty of ideas to help you get started.
For most, this no-cost approach tends to be more palatable than a string of hour-long gym trips or lengthy runs. Exercise snacking also breaks up lengthy periods of sitting down, which can have bonus health benefits, according to recent research from Brunel University London.
“The concept of ‘exercise snacks’ has genuine research support,” Jack McNamara, clinical exercise physiology course leader at the University of East London, told me in a recent interview.
“The evidence suggests those snacks are most effective when they’re vigorous enough to elevate heart rate meaningfully and when they’re part of a broader pattern of regular physical activity. For the many who cite lack of time as their main barrier to exercise, knowing that a few minutes here and there genuinely counts could be transformative.”
This advice is less for seasoned exercise veterans and more for those who struggle to squeeze movement into their regular routine.
If you are in this latter group and can factor three or more five-minute bursts of exercise into each day, you will have strengthened muscles across your entire body and accumulated 105 minutes of vigorous-intensity exercise (exercise that gets you breathless) by the end of the week.
This is in excess of the NHS physical activity guidelines of “at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity activity or 75 minutes of vigorous-intensity activity a week”. If you can accumulate a decent number of daily steps too, you could transform your health.
To what extent? For this query, I spoke to University of Sydney researchers Professor Emmanuel Stamatakis and Dr Nicholas Koemel. Their work confirms that small positive changes can have a disproportionately impressive impact on how you look, feel and function.
Their large-scale study found that, for those with poor sleep, diet and exercise levels, an extra half-portion of fruit or vegetables, 96 seconds of exercise and 15 minutes of sleep per day could measurably improve health and longevity.
“These are accessible and manageable changes that can make a significant difference if people incorporate them, ideally simultaneously, into their lives in the long term,” says Professor Stamatakis.
Much of his research revolves around finding accessible pathways to better health for those who don’t currently exercise. This group, he says, “is at the highest risk of chronic disease and compromised lives”
“It’s about giving options to the 80 or 85 per cent of the population who are not keen on doing regular, structured exercise,” he adds. “It’s not an optimal fitness solution – if you want to become fully fit, of course structured exercise is the best way to go, but it comes with major commitments.
“We want to lower the bar of participation and lower the bar of getting benefit from movement.”
In summary: if you’ve already built a regular exercise habit, you are pulling one of the biggest levers available for better health. If you struggle to squeeze gym sessions and other beneficial behaviours into each week, just know that the threshold for making meaningful changes to your health is likely far lower than you think. Or, to nick an old Tesco slogan: “Every little helps.”

Beijing monitors Australian frigate HMAS Toowoomba’s passage through Taiwan Strait
Anzac-class frigate ‘conducted a routine transit through the South China Sea’, Australian defence department says
The Global Times, a nationalist newspaper affiliated with the Communist Party mouthpiece People’s Daily, reported the vessel’s passage on Saturday, citing a Chinese military source.
“[The Toowoomba’s] shipborne helicopter approached the median line of the strait in the afternoon, and the Taiwan military immediately issued a radio warning to drive it away,” the report said.
Reuters on Sunday quoted an unnamed Australian government source as confirming that the warship sailed through the strait on Friday and Saturday.
The transit drew criticism from military enthusiasts on mainland Chinese social media.
A day earlier, the Australian Department of Defence said the Toowoomba, an Anzac-class frigate of the Royal Australian Navy, had “conducted a routine transit through the South China Sea in accordance with international law”.

Israeli members of Trump’s Board of Peace vow Hamas will disarm 'one way or another'

Senior political and security figures in Israel are expressing skepticism over U.S. President Donald Trump’s vision for Gaza, even as details unveiled at the first meeting of a newly formed Board of Peace point to an ambitious international effort to link reconstruction to the full disarmament of Hamas, which is designated as a terrorist organization by the United States and the European Union.
Some officials have described the initiative as naïve, particularly regarding the roles assigned by Trump to envoy Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner. But participants in the inaugural gathering said the plan reflects months of coordination among American, Israeli, Arab and European figures and could represent what they call a historic opportunity to reshape Gaza if security conditions are met.
The Board of Peace includes U.S. officials such as Witkoff, Kushner and Secretary of State Marco Rubio, as well as retired American generals and international figures including former British Prime Minister Tony Blair. Representatives from most Arab states are involved, alongside Palestinian representatives selected with the backing of regional governments, including Israel. Organizers said those Palestinian factions have no direct or indirect ties to Hamas.
The Israeli contingent includes businessman Yakir Gabay, technology entrepreneur Liran Tancman and investor Michael Eisenberg, who serves as Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s representative at a U.S. coordination headquarters in Kiryat Gat and is described by participants as a full partner in the board’s work.
Gabay, described by colleagues as hawkish on security matters, said reconstruction funds would not be released unless Hamas fully disarms.
“Not a single dollar can be transferred and no valve can be opened unless Hamas lays down its weapons. That is nonnegotiable,” he said in closed forums, according to participants.
A key element pressed by Israeli representatives is reform of school textbooks in Gaza to promote tolerance and halt incitement against Israel, a condition they describe as no less important than dismantling Hamas’ weapons.
In remarks at the board’s opening session, Gabay outlined what he called a comprehensive rebuilding plan.
“Gaza is destroyed. We have gathered here on a historic day with a shared vision to build Gaza for future generations,” he said. The plan calls for clearing and recycling an estimated 70 million tons of rubble and unexploded ordnance, dismantling hundreds of kilometers of tunnels, providing rapid temporary housing and beginning permanent infrastructure projects.
According to Gabay, proposals include modern hospitals, schools, factories, agricultural zones, roads, rail lines, energy facilities, water infrastructure, data centers, a seaport and an airport. He said contractors who have built millions of homes across the Middle East would be recruited at competitive prices and that funding commitments are already in place.
He added that Gaza’s coastline could be developed into a “Middle Eastern Riviera” with up to 200 hotels and potential artificial islands, with profits directed to Gaza residents. All development, he said, would remain conditional on demilitarization and the disarmament of Hamas.
Kushner told participants the initiative is structured like a private-sector board meeting, with members reporting on opportunities and challenges.
“We cannot change the past, but we can change the future if we focus the right way,” he said. “Failure is not an option.”
U.S. investor Marc Rowan presented financial projections, saying the reconstruction effort would begin in Rafah with a goal of rebuilding the city within three years. Plans include constructing 100,000 homes for 500,000 residents in the first phase, with $5 billion invested in infrastructure. Over time, he said, 400,000 homes would be built across Gaza, alongside $30 billion in infrastructure investment.
Rowan estimated the total potential value of real estate and infrastructure at $115 billion, arguing that the main obstacle is not funding but security and political stability.
Organizers said $6.5 billion has already been pledged, including $1.2 billion from the United Arab Emirates, $1 billion from Qatar, $1.25 billion from the United States and additional funding from Kuwait and the World Bank. Trump announced that the United States would contribute an additional $10 billion. European Union representatives attended as observers but have not yet committed funds.
Central to the plan is a proposal for Hamas to surrender its weapons in stages — first heavy weaponry, then tunnel infrastructure and finally small arms. Under the proposal, individual Hamas members who turn in weapons would receive financial compensation and amnesty. Board officials said they expect a decision from Hamas in March, with disarmament potentially beginning in April.
An International Stabilization Force is expected to deploy initially at the Rafah crossing in May. U.S. officials said 20,000 troops have been pledged by five Muslim-majority countries: Indonesia, Morocco, Kazakhstan, Kosovo and Albania, with the possibility of expanding the force if needed.
In parallel, organizers are establishing a new Palestinian police force that would begin with 2,000 officers and eventually expand to 12,000. Officials said recruits are being trained in Jordan and Egypt and will not include individuals with a background in terrorism. The goal, they said, is “one weapon and one authority.”
A senior board official said the timeline envisions rebuilding Rafah within three years and completing Gaza’s broader reconstruction within a decade. Plans include a rail network, potentially a monorail or tram system, and linking Gaza as a logistics hub to the Gulf, Jordan, Egypt, Saudi Arabia and Israel, with trade routes extending to Europe.
The official emphasized that progress depends entirely on Hamas’ response.
“It is very binary,” he said. “On the positive track, everything moves forward. On the negative track, nothing happens.”
He added that the Palestinian Authority would not play a direct role in Gaza’s reconstruction but remains a relevant entity that could potentially integrate in the future if it meets governance benchmarks.

Brazil’s Lula urges Trump to treat all countries equally
Sign up now: Get ST's newsletters delivered to your inbox
NEW DELHI - Brazil’s President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva urged US President Donald Trump on Feb 22 to treat all countries equally after the Republican leader imposed a 15 per cent tariff on imports following an adverse Supreme Court ruling.
“I want to tell the US President Donald Trump that we don’t want a new Cold War. We don’t want interference in any other country, we want all countries to be treated equally,” Mr Lula told reporters in New Delhi.
The conservative-majority Supreme Court ruled six to three on Feb 20
Mr Lula said he would not like to react to the Supreme Court decisions of another country, but hoped that Brazil’s relations with the United States “will go back to normalcy” soon.
The veteran leftist leader is expected to travel to Washington in March for a meeting with Mr Trump.
“I am convinced that Brazil-US relation will go back to normalcy after our conversation,” Mr Lula, 80, said, adding that Brazil only wanted to “live in peace, generate jobs, and improve the lives of our people”.
Mr Lula and Mr Trump, 79, stand on polar opposite sides when it comes to issues such as multilateralism, international trade and the fight against climate change.
However, ties between Brazil and the United States appear to be on the mend after months of animosity between Washington and Brasilia.
As a result, Mr Trump’s administration has exempted key Brazilian exports from 40 per cent tariffs that had been imposed on the South American country in 2025.
‘Affinity’
“The world doesn’t need more turbulence, it needs peace,” said Mr Lula, who arrived in India on Feb 18 for a summit on artificial intelligence and a bilateral meeting with Prime Minister Narendra Modi.
Ties between Washington and Brasilia soured in recent months, with Mr Trump angered over the trial and conviction of his ally, the far-right former Brazil president Jair Bolsonaro.
Mr Trump imposed sanctions against several top officials, including a Supreme Court judge, to punish Brazil for what he termed a “witch hunt” against Bolsonaro.
Bolsonaro was sentenced to 27 years in prison
Mr Lula said that, as the two largest democracies in the Americas, he looked forward to a positive relationship with the United States.
“We are two men of 80 years of age, so we cannot play around with democracy,” he said.
“We have to take this very seriously. We have to shake hands eye-to-eye, person-to-person, and to discuss what is best for the US and Brazil.”
Mr Lula also praised Mr Modi after India and Brazil agreed to boost cooperation on critical minerals and rare earths and signed a raft of other deals on Feb 21.
“I have a lot of affinity with Prime Minister Modi,” he said.
Mr Lula will travel to South Korea later on Feb 22 for meetings with President Lee Jae Myung and to attend a business forum. AFP

Trump's envoy Witkoff says Zelenskyy-Putin meeting possible in coming weeks
US President Donald Trump's Special Envoy Steve Witkoff has suggested that "good news" on ending Russia's war against Ukraine could emerge in the coming weeks and has not ruled out a summit between Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and Russian leader Vladimir Putin.
Source: Witkoff in an interview with Fox News, as reported by European Pravda
Details: Witkoff said Ukraine and Russia are engaged in a "silly war" over territory.
"You know, everyone throws the word 'dignity' around. But what does dignity get you if you have that amount of killing?"
"They [Ukraine and Russia – ed.] don't seem like they really want to fight with one another, and I don't think they do," Witkoff said.
He suggested that the main difficulty in reaching peace lies "at the leadership levels" of the two states.
Quote: "We are hopeful, Jared [Kushner] and I, that – we've put some proposals on the table to both sides that will bring them together in the next three weeks and maybe even result in a summit between Zelenskyy and President Putin." [N.B. Ukrainska Pravda does not recognise Putin as president – ed.]
Details: Witkoff did not rule out that Donald Trump could join such a meeting but added that the US president "does not want to come to a meeting unless he feels that he can consummate this thing and get the best result".
"And he uniquely has that power to do it. So hopefully you will be hearing some good news in the coming weeks," the envoy added.
Background:
- Following trilateral meetings in Geneva on 17-18 February, Zelenskyy said he sees progress in the military area of the talks but not in the political one.
- On 20 February, Zelenskyy said another round of talks with Russia and the US on ending the war could take place before the end of the month.
- He also accused Russia of dragging out negotiations that could already have reached the final stage.

Rondale Moore, Vikings NFL receiver, dies aged 25
Police say the ex-Purdue University star died of a suspected self-inflicted gunshot wound in his hometown in Indiana.
Rondale Moore, the National Football League (NFL) receiver who suffered season-ending training camp knee injuries in each of the last two years after a standout college career at Purdue and a promising start with the Arizona Cardinals, was found dead on Saturday, authorities say.
Police said Moore, aged 25, died of a suspected self-inflicted gunshot wound. Moore was found dead in the garage of a property in his hometown of New Albany, police chief Todd Bailey said. The death remains under investigation.

Floyd County Coroner Matthew Tomlin confirmed Moore’s death. He said an autopsy would be conducted on Sunday.
After being traded to the Atlanta Falcons in 2024, Moore dislocated his right knee during training camp and never played for them. He signed with the Minnesota Vikings in 2025, but he injured his left knee while returning a punt in their first exhibition game and spent another full season on injured reserve. Moore was so distraught after immediately realising the seriousness of that injury that he slammed his hand down on a cart so hard the sound was audible throughout the stadium.
The Vikings said they had spoken with Moore’s family to offer condolences and support.
“I am devastated by the news of Rondale’s death. While Rondale had been a member of the Vikings for a short time, he was someone we came to know well and care about deeply,” coach Kevin O’Connell said in a statement distributed by the team.
“He was a humble, soft-spoken, and respectful young man who was proud of his Indiana roots. As a player, he was disciplined, dedicated and resilient despite facing adversity multiple times as injuries sidelined him throughout his career. We are all heartbroken by the fact he won’t continue to live out his NFL dream, and we won’t all have a chance to watch him flourish.”
In a statement, the Cardinals said they were “devastated and heartbroken”.
“Our thoughts and deepest condolences are with his family, friends, teammates, and everyone who loved him and had the privilege of knowing such a special person,” the team said in a social media post.
Moore grew up in New Albany, just across the Indiana border from Louisville, Kentucky, and was a first-team All-American as a freshman at Purdue in 2018.
Drafted in the second round by the Cardinals in 2021, Moore had 1,201 receiving yards and three touchdowns, plus 249 rushing yards and one score over three seasons. He served as their primary returner for kickoffs and punts as a rookie before injuries pushed him away from that role.
“Can’t even begin to fathom or process this,” former Cardinals teammate JJ Watt said on social media. “There’s just no way. Way too soon. Way too special. So much left to give. Rest in peace Rondale.”

Envoy says Trump ‘curious’ why Iran has not ‘capitulated’ under US pressure
Steve Witkoff said Trump can’t understand Tehran’s refusal to yield despite Washington’s military build-up in the region
US envoy Steve Witkoff said on Saturday that President Donald Trump is questioning why Iran has not “capitulated” in the face of Washington’s military build-up aimed at pressuring them into a nuclear deal.
The United States and Iran this week resumed Oman-mediated talks in Geneva aimed at averting the possibility of military action, after Washington sent two aircraft carriers, jets and weaponry to the region to back its warnings.
In a Fox News interview with Trump’s daughter-in-law Lara, Witkoff said the president was “curious” about Iran’s position after he had warned them of severe consequences in the event they failed to strike a deal.
“I don’t want to use the word ‘frustrated’ because he understands he has plenty of alternatives, but he’s curious as to why they haven’t … I don’t want to use the word ‘capitulated’, but why they haven’t capitulated,” he said.
“Why, under this pressure, with the amount of sea power and naval power over there, why haven’t they come to us and said, ‘We profess we don’t want a weapon, so here’s what we’re prepared to do’? And yet it’s sort of hard to get them to that place.”
The US envoy also confirmed in the interview that he had met Reza Pahlavi, who has not returned to Iran since before the 1979 Islamic Revolution that ousted the monarchy.
“I met him at the direction of the president,” he said, without providing further details.

AfD leader calls for return to energy imports from Russia

BERLIN, February 22. /TASS/. Co-chair of the Alternative for Germany (AfD) party Alice Weidel believes it is necessary to resume energy supplies from Russia.
Germany urgently needs reforms, she noted. "The Alternative for Germany party has a plan for Germany, and we are absolutely clear that Germany must return to an affordable and reliable energy supply to be internationally competitive. This, of course, includes a return to nuclear energy, and we must purchase energy resources, oil and natural gas, where it is cheapest, which is Russia," Weidel said speaking at a party event broadcast on the AfD YouTube channel.
It is for this reason that the AfD party has always advocated for peace negotiations between Russia and Ukraine, she noted. Weidel emphasized the need for a swift end to the conflict in Ukraine. "Where is the strategy here? Why did Western countries, and especially the UK, prevent the Istanbul Moratorium in 2022? This would have been a better peace agreement for [Vladimir] Zelensky than what we have today," she said.
Germany began giving up Russian energy supplies in February 2022. The country is also not receiving gas via Nord Stream as both pipelines were damaged in 2022 as a result of sabotage in the Baltic Sea, one of which had not previously been certified by the German government. In the current situation, the government is relying on the construction of LNG receiving terminals.

Ultimatum
Witkoff's comments come after Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi said a draft proposal for an agreement with Washington would be ready in a matter of days.
Trump said on Thursday that Iran had at most 15 days to make a deal on concerns starting with its nuclear programme.
As talks between the two nations continued in Geneva, Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei on Tuesday said that Trump would not succeed in destroying Iran.
Western countries accuse Iran of seeking to acquire nuclear weapons, which Tehran denies, though it insists on its right to enrichment for civilian purposes.
Iran, for its part, is seeking to negotiate an end to sanctions that have proven to be a massive drag on its economy, which played a role in sparking anti-government protests in December.

Hugh Laurie, attacked for mourning ‘Tehran’ producer, rejects assumptions he’s ‘Zionist’
Denial comes after anti-Israel accounts disparaged British actor for grieving Dana Eden, who died last week; his response then drives backlash from pro-Israel accounts
British actor Hugh Laurie on Saturday lashed out against people calling him a “Zionist” for mourning the death of “Tehran” producer Dana Eden – but insisted that the term does not apply to him, sparking further criticism from different quarters.
“Nothing I have ever said or done could lead a sane person to believe that I am a Zionist. However. If someone exults in the death of a friend of mine, yes I will block them. If you wouldn’t do the same in my position, you can fuck off too,” he wrote on X, days after he wrote an initial post about Eden’s death.
The actor then clarified that he was not identifying as an anti-Zionist, either, writing: “God almighty, why does no one understand English any more? I have not spoken or written a word that would indicate pro or anti Zionism. That’s what those words mean. Blimey.”
The comments came after Laurie wrote on X on Tuesday, mourning the Israeli producer, who was found dead in Athens last weekend during filming of the show’s fourth season. No cause of death was given, but police said they were investigating it as a possible suicide.
“Dana Eden, who co-created and produced ‘Tehran’, died on Sunday, seemingly by her own hand. It’s a terrible thing. She was brilliant, and funny, and an exceptional leader. Love and condolences to all who knew her,” Laurie’s first post read.
Though many of the responses were sympathetic, others disparaged Eden, calling her a “Zionist propagandist” or “part of the occupation force’s propaganda arm,” and saying she “creates propaganda for Israel so that that they can kill kids more effectively.”
God almighty, why does no one understand English any more? I have not spoken or written a word that would indicate pro or anti Zionism. That’s what those words mean. Blimey.
— Hugh Laurie (@hughlaurie) February 20, 2026
On Thursday, Laurie posted, in an apparent response to the nasty reactions his original post received: “I used to hate blocking people, and hardly ever did it. I’m older now.”
On Saturday, he made the contentious posts about being, or not being, a “Zionist.”
The latter post drew further backlash, this time from pro-Israel influencers, who responded to Laurie by defining Zionism and insisting it was nothing to be ashamed of. Others called his clarification “slimy, weak and sad,” or labeled him a “pathetic weasel.”
Dana Eden was 52 when her body was discovered in her hotel room during filming for “Tehran.” The Israeli producer was among the leading figures in the country’s film industry.
The award-winning show was produced for the Kan public broadcaster, and was available internationally on Apple TV. The show follows an Israeli spy of Iranian Jewish descent operating in Tehran to thwart the theocracy’s nuclear program.
Laurie starred in the show’s third season, and was expected to appear in the fourth as well.
Anti-Israel voices have accused the show of presenting an Israeli narrative about Iran, which regularly vows to destroy Israel and funds terror groups across the region that attack it.

The UAE's national cybersecurity system foiled organized cyberattacks described as having a "terrorist nature" targeting the country’s digital infrastructure and vital sectors, the UAE's Cybersecurity Council confirmed on Saturday.
The attacks were intended to destabilize the country and disrupt essential services, the council said.
According to a post shared by the council on social media, the attacks included attempts to breach networks, deploy ransomware, and conduct organized phishing campaigns targeting national platforms.
Terror groups also used AI as an offensive tool
Attackers also exploited AI technologies to develop complex offensive tools, a significant advancement in terrorist groups' methods and capabilities.
With the start of Ramadan, when many Muslims in the UAE and worldwide make charitable donations, the council urged citizens to adopt "safe practices" online and shared techniques to protect data and prevent fraud.
It has urged the public to report any cyber threats or suspicious attempts through officially approved channels to help safeguard the country’s digital security and ensure the continuity of institutions under all circumstances, according to the report.

At least five bodies of migrants including two women have been washed ashore in َQasr al-Akhyar, a coastal town in the east of Libya's capital Tripoli, a police officer told Reuters on Saturday.
Hassan Al-Ghawil, head of investigations at the Qasr Al-Akhyar police station, said that according to people in the area, a child's body washed ashore and because of the waves' height the body returned to the sea, and the coast guard was asked to search for it.
Ghawil said the bodies are all dark-skinned people. The bodies were found on Emhamid Al-Sharif shore in the western part of the town by people who reported to the police station.
Conflict and migration in Libya since 2011
Libya has become a transit route for migrants fleeing conflict and poverty to Europe across the Mediterranean since the fall in 2011 of dictator Muammar Gaddafi to a NATO-backed uprising. Factional conflict has split the country into western and eastern factions since 2014.
Qasr al-Akhyar is a coastal town some 73 kilometers (45 miles) east of Tripoli.

Investor Shani Zanescu launches resilience tech push amid global instability - interview

When Shani Zanescu arrived in Davos two years ago, she found herself less captivated by the swirl of panels and receptions than by the underlying patterns connecting the world’s crises.
Geopolitical shocks, extreme weather, social fragmentation, and economic instability: Each seemed to erupt from a different fault line, yet she saw a common thread.
“I realized I wanted to focus on resilience and technology,” she told The Jerusalem Post. “The world is changing faster than our systems can adapt. So I started mapping the challenges and the meeting points between them.”
That moment became the foundation of Universe Partners, an investment house dedicated to what Zanescu calls “resilience tech,” a field she believes will define the next decade of global innovation to prepare societies to withstand future challenges. “We know it’s going to happen,” she explains. “So let’s prepare, de-risk, and be efficient about it.”
The Universe Partners board reflects the scale of that ambition. It includes Philipp Rösler, Germany’s former vice chancellor and minister of economics and technology; Cameron Geiger, who previously led supply chain operations at Walmart; Laura Segafredo, who headed sustainable product and portfolio research at BlackRock; and Julia Diament, a senior figure in Microsoft’s CTO office and a former lieutenant colonel who led artificial intelligence (AI) solutions in the IDF’s Unit 8200.
Additional members come from the World Economic Forum, and last year, Universe Partners announced a collaboration with the Clinton Global Initiative to build and invest in various technologies.
Zanescu herself brings a broad background to the table. Before entering the deep-tech investment world, she spent a decade in foreign policy and national security roles across Israel, Europe, and the United States.
At Israel’s Defense Ministry, she led collaborations with the Benelux countries, the European Union, and NATO. She later headed the UK-Israel Foreign Relations Department, overseeing bilateral cooperation in science, technology, and innovation at the British Consulate. Her military service also centered on foreign relations.
In the private sector, Zanescu has invested more than $100 million and managed roughly $400 million in deep-tech assets through roles such as venture partner at Jibe and investment manager at Consensus Business Group, a family office overseeing about $1 billion. She has served as chairwoman and board member for multiple companies and initiatives.
Alongside her professional work, she founded philanthropic organizations, such as Israel’s Children’s Fund, which supports children orphaned by the October 7, 2023, attacks, and Plantech, which backs climate-tech ventures.
Issues of national security
Universe Partners is now raising $20-$30 million in capital for 10-12 early-stage companies working on challenges that Zanescu believes will shape the next era of global stability. These include early prediction of earthquakes, supply-chain vulnerabilities, tariff disruptions, and energy instability. She is also eager to invest in technologies that counter misinformation.
All of these, she describes, are “a matter of national security.”
Her goal is not only to fund these companies but also to help them reach the scale required to make a global impact. “I want to bring these start-ups to the level they can achieve,” she says. “And connect them to the right people.”
Zanescu argues that resilience is better understood in the US and Europe than in Israel, where the term is often interpreted narrowly through a security lens.
Her vision is broader and more systemic. “Resilience tech isn’t about solving one issue,” she explains. “It strengthens many layers of society, and even future issues we haven’t encountered yet.”
She believes that the past five years have been a preview of what’s coming.
“Everything that happened will continue to happen, but at a much faster pace,” she says. “We have predictions, especially around extreme weather. We don’t have the privilege of taking our time. We know what’s coming, so let’s not be surprised.”
Zanescu also sees an opportunity to expand Israel’s innovation ecosystem outward, particularly toward Abraham Accords countries facing acute challenges in energy and food security.
Other venture capital firms, she notes, are beginning to acknowledge that the only constant is change. But she believes resilience tech will soon become a category of its own, one that governments, corporations, and investors will increasingly prioritize.
Zanescu’s message is ultimately pragmatic rather than alarmist. “Instead of being afraid of change, let’s handle it,” she says. “Let’s make sure society can withstand what’s coming.”

FIFA president Gianni Infantino's presence at the inaugural meeting of The Board of Peace this week, alongside United States President Donald Trump and other heads of state, does not violate any Olympic Charter rules on political neutrality, the International Olympic Committee said on Saturday.
The boss of global soccer's governing body, who is also an IOC member, took part in Thursday's meeting of The Board of Peace, which is focusing on reconstruction work in Gaza and aims to rebuild the territory once Hamas disarms.
"The IOC has been in contact with FIFA," an IOC spokesperson said. "We understand that FIFA is supporting, through football, a comprehensive sport recovery investment program in Gaza, by providing sporting infrastructure, education and elite development proposals."
"This is entirely in keeping with the role of an International sport federation. The IOC, through Olympic Solidarity, which is our development vehicle, has been and continues to support sport development in the region," the spokesperson said.
The Olympic Charter states that members must always act independently of commercial and political interests. They also cannot accept "from governments, organizations, or other parties, any mandate or instructions liable to interfere with the freedom of their action and vote," the Charter says.
IOC confirms Infantino’s participation in Trump meeting
Trump's Board of Peace has been controversial. It includes Israel but not Palestinian representatives, and Trump's suggestion that the Board could eventually address challenges beyond Gaza has stirred anxiety that it could undermine the UN's role as the main platform for global diplomacy and conflict resolution.
Infantino appeared on stage with several heads of state, sported a red hat with 'USA' on the front and the numbers 45-47, for the two non-consecutive presidencies of Trump.
Infantino also displayed the FIFA collaboration agreement with The Board of Peace, which includes building 50 mini-pitches near schools and residential areas in Gaza, five full-size pitches across multiple districts, a state-of-the-art FIFA academy and a new 20,000-seat national stadium.
Trump has met Infantino several times, with the United States set to co-host this summer's soccer World Cup along with Mexico and Canada.
The US President was also awarded FIFA's inaugural peace prize in December for his efforts to promote dialogue and de-escalation in some of the world's biggest hotspots, the soccer body said at the time.
IOC President Kirsty Coventry, elected in 2025, has not yet met Trump. The 2028 Summer Olympics are due to be held in Los Angeles.

India-Israel tech synergy will define the next decade of defense strategy - opinion

On February 1, 2026, New Delhi formally codified a fundamental shift in its security paradigm: With the unveiling of the Union Budget for fiscal year (FY) 2026-27, the Indian Ministry of Defense received a historic allocation of approximately $93.5 billion (₹7.85 lakh crore). This 15.2% increase is not merely an inflationary adjustment but also serves as the strategic financial roadmap for the post-Operation Sindoor era – reflecting an India that has moved from strategic ambiguity to assertive clarity.
For Israel’s defense establishment and the broader Western alliance, this budget is a seminal document. Against the backdrop of Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s upcoming visit to Israel in late February, this allocation signals the final transition from a traditional supplier-customer model to a deep industrial partnership.
The India that Modi represents in 2026 is no longer a security consumer; it is a security provider seeking to shape the regional environment through technological self-reliance.
The strategic legacy of Operation Sindoor
The budget must be viewed through the lens of Operation Sindoor (May 2025), which validated India’s shift toward "precision statecraft." The operation demonstrated that integrated intelligence, armed unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), and AI-driven intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) could impose costs on adversaries while remaining below the threshold of full-scale nuclear escalation.
The FY27 budget represents the "Sindoor dividend," with a 21.8% surge in capital expenditure, totaling over $26.1 billion (₹2.19 lakh crore). This funding is now also strategically funneled into hi-tech "force multipliers" rather than traditional heavy platforms alone.
A critical 30% increase in the "other equipment" – approximately $9.8 billion (₹82,217 crore) – is specifically directed at artificial intelligence (AI), autonomous ISR systems, and network-centric warfare. India is no longer purchasing hardware in isolation; it is investing in the "digital brain" of the force to ensure operational fusion between its services.
Structural imbalance: A shared Indo-Israeli challenge
A granular analysis of the budget reveals a structural imbalance mirroring the Israeli defense dilemma. Both nations grapple with manpower-heavy models that constrain technological maneuverability. The 2026 budget indicates that, despite the modernization push, fixed costs remain a significant burden.
There are fixed budgetary commitments as India dedicates approximately $20.4 billion (₹1.71 lakh crore) to pensions (21.84% of the budget) and $24.7 billion to pay and allowances (26.40%). Combined, nearly half of the defense outlay is consumed by personnel costs, a reality that parallels the Israeli challenge of legacy budgetary pensions and high personnel maintenance.
AI is the strategic escape velocity, and in order to overcome this fiscal rigidity, India is betting on extreme efficiency. AI serves as a strategic solution, enabling "more security with less manpower." This resonates deeply with the IDF’s "small and smart" doctrine. By automating ISR, logistics, and border management, India aims to maximize its "teeth-to-tail" (combat personnel to support personnel) ratio.
There are also parallel reform trajectories. India’s Agnipath scheme (reforming recruitment for a tech-savvy force) and the SPARSH project (digital pension delivery) are direct responses to this structural weight. These efforts mirror Israeli initiatives to modernize military HR and reduce the pension drag on modernization funds.
The AI revolution and the Israeli advantage
The FY27 budget makes it clear that the Indian market for conventional, off-the-shelf platforms is shrinking while the market for intelligence-on-board (integrating AI, edge computing, and smart systems for autonomous decision-making) is exploding. India's counter-drone architecture, which successfully destroyed hundreds of hostile drones during Sindoor, is now the baseline requirement.
This is where the Israeli sector has a unique advantage. Israeli defense firms are not just equipment vendors; they are providers of battle-proven algorithms.
As India seeks to integrate AI across its three services, from underwater domain awareness to high-altitude surveillance, the Israeli "combat-proven AI" has become the preferred currency.
The upcoming visit of PM Modi is expected to focus on creating joint AI centers of excellence, where Israeli software is embedded into Indian-manufactured hardware, satisfying both India’s technical needs and its political mandate for self-reliance.
The Atmanirbhar Bharat policy framework: Redefining the partnership
The reservation of 75% of the capital acquisition fund, approximately $16.5 billion (₹1.39 lakh crore) for the domestic industry, is a mandatory requirement for future engagement. Israeli firms must move from exporting to co-production. The budget provides several specific entry points. Among them are MRO and sustainment hubs (the exemption of customs duties on raw materials for maintenance, repair, and overhaul (MRO) is a direct invitation for Israel to establish regional service hubs in India. This ensures India's strategic autonomy while maintaining an Israeli technological presence.
Private sector synergy is also one of the points; partnering with Indian giants, such as Tata, L&T, and Bharat Forge, is no longer optional. As the private sector’s share in defense production hits record levels, Israeli firms must embed their sensors, radars, and AI suites within owned-by-India platforms.
There is also the drone ecosystem, which follows the performance of autonomous systems in recent regional conflicts. India is accelerating its indigenous counter-drone and swarm-drone programs. The missing piece of the Indian puzzle is Israeli expertise in electronic warfare and AI-driven target tracking.
The road to Jerusalem
Modi’s visit, slated for late February, will be the moment when India’s fiscal planning meets its diplomatic execution.
The FY27 budget has set the stage: India is willing to spend nearly $94 billion, but it demands technology that is not only-combat proven but also "Made in India."
The synergy between Israeli AI expertise and India’s industrial scale is the only viable path for the next decade of their strategic partnership.
For the Israeli defense community, the message is clear: The opportunity is vast, but the entry price is a willingness to share technology and build local capacity. Those who align with India's goal of sovereign crisis management today will shape tomorrow’s hard-power equation.

MOSCOW, 22 February (BelTA) - A new “Belarusian Village” opened in St. Petersburg, Russia on 20 February, BelTA learned from the press service of the Belarusian Embassy in Russia.
“Another 'Belarusian Village' has opened in the very heart of St. Petersburg - in the Gallery shopping and entertainment center on Ligovsky Prospekt. Ahead of the spring holidays, Belarusian goods became even closer and more accessible to residents and guests of the northern capital of Russia,” the diplomatic mission noted.
The Belarusian Village project was launched last year on the initiative of the Minsk Dairy Plant No. 1 trading house and was supported by the Belarusian government, the Belarusian Embassy in Russia and Russian retailers. The concept of the Belarusian Village suggests bringing various Belarusian producers from food products to light industry goods in one space.
The project will be scaled up, Irina Novikova, director of the Minsk Dairy Plant No. 1 trading house told BelTA earlier. In Moscow, cooperation with the Auchan hypermarket chain will continue, with new “Belarusian Villages” opening in three of their stores by April. In addition, negotiations are underway to create such retail spots in Yekaterinburg, Severodvinsk, and Ulan-Ude where “Belarusian Villages” may be set up by the end of this year. The "Belarusian Village" brand has become very popular and Irina Novikova did not rule out future work with Russian partners in the regions under a franchise model.

Stockpiling food, sealing windows: Iranians brace for possible war

Nearly eight months after Israel and the United States carried out strikes in Iran last summer, residents of Tehran say they are again bracing for the possibility of a broader conflict as the United States expands its military presence in the Middle East.
The recent deployment of additional U.S. forces, including aircraft carriers in the region, has fueled anxiety in the Iranian capital, where memories remain fresh of the 12-day conflict in June that ended in a fragile ceasefire.
“I sleep badly at night, even with medication,” said Hamid, a retiree in Tehran, speaking to Agence France-Presse. Others described similar fears as speculation grows that another round of fighting could erupt in the coming days.
On Friday, U.S. President Donald Trump said he was “considering” a strike against Iran, prompting many in the Islamic Republic to recall the night of June 12-13, when Israel launched a surprise attack as Tehran was preparing for renewed nuclear negotiations with Washington.
“I think a war between Iran, the U.S. and Israel is inevitable,” said Mina Ahmadvand, an information technology worker in Tehran. “Everything changes by the hour.”
Haniyeh, a 31-year-old jeweler, said she has struggled with anxiety since the previous round of fighting.
“I can’t sleep at night anymore. I have nightmares where I am being chased and I die,” she said. “I go to bed late, wake up late and I am depressed.”
A recent nighttime thunderstorm in Tehran and fireworks marking the anniversary of the 1979 Islamic Revolution were enough to alarm some residents, who initially feared fighting had resumed.
Iran has warned that in the event of an attack, Israel would be considered a legitimate target, along with U.S. bases in the Middle East.
Concerns have also been heightened by domestic unrest. Trump has cited a figure of more than 30,000 protesters killed during demonstrations in January, a claim that differs from other estimates. Human rights groups have accused Iranian security forces of deliberately targeting protesters, while Iranian authorities have said many of those killed were security personnel or bystanders slain by what they describe as terrorists backed by Israel and the United States.
“Since the protests, my life has been on pause,” Haniyeh said. “Now with this situation, we are waiting to see what happens. I think war will break out within 10 days.”
Despite the tense atmosphere, daily life in Tehran — a metropolis of about 10 million people — has continued largely as usual. Traffic congestion remains heavy and pedestrians weave through crowded streets lined with motorcycles carrying goods.
Behind the outward routine, however, some residents are taking precautions.
“I bought about 10 cans of food, including tuna and beans, as well as cookies, bottled water and spare batteries,” Ahmadvand said. “I don’t wish for war, but we must not take the situation lightly.”
She said she had stocked enough supplies for a week and sealed her windows in preparation for a possible emergency.
“I am applying the lessons I learned from the 12-day war,” she said.

The West: From sexual slavery to Epstein Island

16:35:18 KST

Since the 15th century, when the followers of liberalism in Europe set out to discover new areas in the world and the colonial period was formed, along with the plunder of Africa's natural resources, the slave trade was also formed.
During this period, thousands of Africans were "hunted" and sold in European and American markets, and the economies of countries such as England, France, Spain, Belgium, Germany, Netherlands, and then the United States, flourished from this trade. During this period, slaves did not only become a means of production, but were also sexually abused by Westerners, and sexual abuse, especially against children and adolescents, was added to the suffering of slaves.
James Walwin, a historian and professor at New York University, has presented a vivid picture of sexual slavery during the colonial period in his research and in his book "Black Ivory" says: "Any type of sexual operation with female slaves was permitted, and the first sexual intercourse of white boys who reached puberty was usually with black women who had raised them or even breastfed them. Thus, a generation of congenital slaves emerged; Humans who had white fathers and worked as slaves in the homes of their paternal brothers and relatives. For a long time, Europeans prevented the formation of a family center in black society because they thought that they lacked the instinct to form a family; creatures lower than animals! Many years passed before slaves were finally allowed to have a family life."
Sexual abuse of slaves, which gradually became known as sexual slavery, transformed the inhabitants of colonial countries, especially in Africa, into uneven societies lacking a balanced demographic and cultural structure, and destroyed their political and social structures. Men, especially young men, were generally enslaved and separated from their families, and the female population was disproportionately dominated by the male population and, worse, exposed to the pleasures of their Western European masters. Colonialism in Africa added new concepts such as the sex industry and "slave prostitution" to the Western vocabulary and extended it to other parts of the world, and thus a new type of slavery was formed that held millions of women in captivity and spread prostitution throughout the world.
In 1991, at a conference of the Southeast Asian Women's Organization in Malaysia, it was said that from 1975 to 1991, that is, in a period of 16 years, at least 30 million women were sold into brothels worldwide. Ms. Vasilia Tamzali, head of UNESCO's Women's Division, said at the conference: "The sex industry is a huge market with its own driving forces. These global slavery networks are run by powerful Western mafia gangs that control the sex market, from Japan to the United States." (Time Magazine, June 1993)
In the 21st century, the events of Epstein Island, which became known as a hideout for the trafficking of young women and underage girls for sexual slavery and child abuse, and sexual harassment, were another nail in the coffin of liberal democracy after the tragedies of the colonial era. Jeffrey Edward Epstein, an American financier, child molester, and human trafficker, committed suicide in his cell at the Metropolitan Correctional Center in New York in 2019. He bought the island of "Little St. James" in 1998 and turned it into a place of pleasure for senior officials of Western countries, especially the United States and Britain. On this island, a modern system was created to lure and attract underage girls who were transported to the island on private planes with the promise of work and earning money. They, along with a number of children, were sexually abused and molested by Epstein's high-ranking guests. To prosper in his business, Epstein asked his victims to lure other girls and bring them to the island in exchange for money.
He had relationships with influential figures in politics, economics, and the media in the United States, Europe, and Israel, and with their support, he was not afraid of the consequences of his crimes.
After Epstein died in prison in 2019, the FBI raided the island and seized hundreds of gigabytes of files and images. Subsequent targeted leaks revealed a much larger and more dangerous network than previously thought. These leaks revealed that guests on the island included prominent Western figures.
The Epstein Island scandals, which are beyond description, have shown how liberal systems that present themselves as the cultural axis of the world and supporters of human rights, women and children, nurture networks of sexual abuse in their hearts with the participation of influential political and economic figures.
Today, it is the duty of the UN Human Rights Council and other international institutions to break their silence and take a firm stand against the transnational dimensions of this tragedy. Institutions such as UNICEF, which is responsible for protecting children's rights, and the international police (Interpol) must carry out their duties as quickly as possible. ofcourse the continued silence of governmental and non-governmental organizations such as Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch, and similar institutions will show their participation in the tragedies of Epstein Island.

Pakistan launches airstrikes on Afghanistan killing and wounding dozens
Taliban vows to give ‘measured response’ after cross-border firing
- Bookmark

Pakistan has carried out airstrikes on what it described as militant hideouts inside Afghanistan, saying it was a response to cross-border attacks that have killed members of its security forces and civilians.
Afghanistan’s Taliban authorities said the strikes hit a religious school and several residential homes, killing and wounding dozens of civilians.
The Taliban-run defence ministry described the action as a “blatant violation of national sovereignty” and said an “appropriate and measured response will be taken at a suitable time”.
They added that they considered the act a “a clear breach of international law, the principles of good neighbourliness, and Islamic values”.
Pakistan said it had targeted hideouts belonging to the Tehrik-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), an outlawed militant network responsible for a surge in attacks in Pakistan’s north-west. The military described the operation as “intelligence-based” and said it was aimed at camps used to plan and launch assaults across the border.
The strikes followed a suicide vehicle bombing in Bajaur district on Tuesday that killed 11 Pakistani security personnel and a child, an attack claimed by the Tehrik-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP).
A statement from Pakistan's ministry of information and broadcasting said the country had “conclusive evidence” that militants behind the recent attacks were operating under the direction of “Afghanistan-based leadership and handlers”.
It said the operation targeted seven militant camps and that the Taliban regime “failed to undertake any substantive action” despite Pakistan’s urging.
Pakistan “has always strived to maintain peace and stability in the region”, it added, but said the safety and security of its citizens was its priority.
Issuing a strong condemnation of the strikes, Taliban spokesperson Zabihullah Mujahid wrote in a post on X: “Pakistani special military circles have once again trespassed into Afghan territory.”
He said dozens of “civilian compatriots” were injured and killed, including women and children, in Nangarhar and Paktika provinces.
“Pakistani generals compensate for their country's security weaknesses through such crimes,” he wrote.
Since the Taliban forcibly seized control of Kabul in August 2021, Pakistan has repeatedly accused it of failing to curb TTP fighters who use Afghan territory as a base to organise and launch attacks. Kabul has consistently denied allowing any group to use its soil to threaten other countries.
Hours before the strikes, a suicide bomber targeted a security convoy in the nearby Bannu district in Pakistan's northwest, killing two soldiers, including a lieutenant colonel.
Pakistan's military warned after Saturday’s attack that it would not “exercise any restraint” and operations against those responsible would continue “irrespective of their location”.
Relations between the two neighbours have been strained since October, when clashes along the border left dozens of soldiers, civilians and suspected militants dead. The escalation came after explosions in Kabul that Afghan officials attributed to Pakistan.
Although a ceasefire brokered by Qatar has largely held, negotiations held in Istanbul in November 2025 failed to produce a formal settlement, leaving ties fragile and tensions unresolved.

Our women in Syria should have support they deserve
I applaud the PM’s view that if they make the bed they should lie in it (“Road to Damascus”, February 21). It completes his transition from left-wing table thumper to national leader. It has a much wider application, though. Smokers with lung cancer, or drinkers with liver disease? No Medicare for you. Speeding and hit a tree? Get yourself to the nearest private hospital. Finally, tell the abusive boss to stick it? No JobSeeker payments for you. Go to a conflict zone and get injured or imprisoned? Suck eggs, sister. Imagine the savings: money that could be better used. David Neilson, Uralla
As a private citizen, Anthony Albanese is entitled to feel “contempt” for the Australians languishing in an increasingly dangerous Syrian camp. But having sworn an oath to “serve the Commonwealth of Australia, her land and people”, he does not have the right to deny procedural fairness and access to the rule of law to these Aussies. No amount of political posturing and tough-speak can cloud his responsibility. Mark Paskal, Austinmer
Our “nothing but contempt” PM, Angus Taylor and Pauline Hanson have finally achieved “cohesion” in beating down on the Australian women and children stuck in Syria. But Australia has, of course, form in this: only five years ago, during COVID-19, we threatened our own citizens in India with imprisonment and hefty fines if they dared to come home to Australia. What a timid and fearful country Australia has become. With the current “leadership”, there is not much hope for improvement. Dierk Mohr, South Turramurra
I fear our PM, Anthony Albanese, is disappointing many of those who put faith in him and his government. With a thumping majority, and the opportunity to prove that his government values kindness and decency, he has stigmatised these unfortunate women and blameless children. Instead of offering them friendly asylum, he has followed the hard right in condemning them. It seems obvious that he has done this in order not to be out of step with the noisy popularist right, who he fears might take some votes away from Labor. The Australian electorate is better than that. Rather than join in the baying throng, he should be endorsing principles contained in a progressive Labor agenda. You’ve failed us, PM. Shame on you. Derrick Mason, Boorowa
Is Australia’s public security so frail that it cannot manage the assessment and support of 11 Australian women and 23 Australian children wishing to return to the country whose passports they hold? Does the prime minister’s expressed contempt for these women extend to the titans of the gambling industry who wreak such destruction on the lives of thousands of Australians and who access the halls of Parliament House with easy confidence? Does this contempt fit with his previously avowed view that kindness is not weakness? Or does it suggest a scurrying to the right, to shore up perceived voter threat? This has been a bleak episode; the moral compass crushed under the marching heel of political expediency. Jon Fogarty, North Avoca
My mother used to say, “You learn from your mistakes.” Paree Hartley, North Sydney
So, when Anthony Albanese says that the girls who went to Syria made their own bed and should therefore lie in it, isn’t he basically saying that women who end up in violent relationships should not try and leave those relationships because they made a foolish choice in going into the relationship? I notice that Tony Burke has expressed similar uncaring, judgmental views about this group of teenage girls who were groomed or coerced into travelling to Syria. And here I was, thinking that this was going to be a nicer, more compassionate government than the other lot. How wrong I was. Catherine Rossiter, Fadden (ACT)
The current leaders of the Labor, Liberal and National parties all profess to hold strong Christian values and morals. Regarding the dire circumstances of the ISIS brides and their children, a simple question: what would Jesus do?Paul Soares, Bardwell Valley
Gutted by rejection
Much of the community is gutted by the UNESCO rejection of the Parramatta Female Factory for World Heritage (“UN rejects Parramatta heritage bid for precinct”, February 21). This is after 15 years of advocating for it with support by amazing Australians including Jack and Judy Mundey and Tom and Meg Keneally, 20,000-plus petitions from all over Australia and internationally, as well as significant state and government support. The reason, we believe, is that its assessment focus was on the institutional care of the submission, not the thousands of women who went through it, or the fights for rights by hundreds of women against military, police and the system, including the first women’s workers action. We are pleading that the state and federal government continue the good work and submit an extension of the 11 world heritage sites to 12, as was done for the Tasmanian wilderness; make it a museum with management by museum experts with appropriate funding. The Parramatta Female Factory Friends have fought for this place. We submitted a successful National Heritage Listing because we believed it worthy, just as we believe in the world heritage value. Gay Hendriksen, president, Parramatta Female Factory Friends
Off to the Tower
There are suggestions that the scandal surrounding Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor could be a catalyst for revisiting the question of changing our head of state (“A duke reduced: arrest, prints, cell”, February 21). However, as long as the king of a constitutional monarchy prioritises national duty over family loyalty and reputation, insisting that the “law must take its course” while the president of a democratic republic blatantly flouts justice and disregards all personal responsibility, I reckon that any increase in support for an Australian republic would now be unlikely. Col Burns, Lugarno
Surely there is a traditional and practical solution to the problems raised by the behaviour of Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor: have His Majesty the King lock him in the Tower, as has happened with previous royal transgressors. Not only will it give those splendidly uniformed Tower jailers a real purpose in life, it should also vastly increase tourism numbers and easily pay for any costs involved. Irving Warren, Riverview
While it is embarrassing in the short term, I believe that Andrew’s arrest demonstrates the strength, importance and ongoing value of the monarchy. Not a single president, elected politician, government official, business magnate, charity advocate or star celebrity has been arrested for their entanglements with Jeffrey Epstein – yet royalty has been prepared to step ahead before all of them to see justice done. Supposedly “progressive” institutions have been put to shame by the monarchy’s meaningful gesture. Robert Frazer, Campbelltown
If Andrew does get sentenced to jail at his brother’s pleasure, we can only hope he isn’t sent to the colonies to serve out his time.Jenny Coote, Woonona
I have great respect for King Charles. One gets the sense that he is a decent human being: a good King. Prince William seems to be cut from similar cloth. So we condemn the behaviour of Mountbatten-Windsor and we keep monarchy. But suppose Andrew had been the firstborn? I imagine that if nothing else we’d regret not having become are public. Gerianne Rudd, Toowong (Qld)
I wonder if he’s sweating now? Patrick McGrath, Potts Point
Put endangered fauna before cats
Every cat owner should be required to read Antone Martinho-Truswell’s article (“Don’t bell the nation’s cats. Make it illegal to own one”, February 21), which is a common-sense blueprint for state and federal governments. Local councils need suitable laws to eliminate cats outside owners’ properties. The killing of 3 billion of our native animals by cats each year cannot rationally be acceptable. Since 1788, immigrants to this country have failed to protect our environment. As custodians, we have a duty to leave this country in a better condition then we found it, for our future generations. Is it time to consider breeding our endangered fauna for pets? Regardless, it is time to protect what fauna we have left by stopping the import and breeding of cats, and thus for our politicians to use their common sense to control and eradicate existing cats found in the public domain. Brian McDonald, Willoughby
Oh, Antone! Think of those poor lonely people whose pet cat gives them a reason to live. I agree, though, that pet cats should definitely be indoor pets and neutered. Where I live, huge feral cats roam the bush and there are thousands of rabbits running around unchecked. They are frequently seen grazing the nature strips and don’t even bother to move when you drive by. This is 20 minutes from the CBD. Baits were put down a while ago to eradicate the foxes, which has helped the rabbits to proliferate. It’s not unusual to see a group of bush turkeys marching down the street. At least the foxes kept the cat, rabbit and bush turkey numbers down. Judith Rostron, Killarney Heights
Antone Martinho-Truswell describes a very alarming picture of feral and domestic cats decimating, if not eliminating, Australia’s native fauna. It’s an emotional, misleading article. Feral cats are referred to with domestic cats. The estimated population of feral cats is 6.3 million, with another 700,000 living in urban areas. Domestic cats number about 5 million to 6 million. Over 90 per cent are neutered. According to Antone, pet cats kill almost 200 animals per cat, per year. What are these animals killed by domestic cats? Because many of the native species under threat live in the regions and the national parks near the cities, we don’t see them in city streets and parks. In fact, in urban areas, cats kill mostly mice and rats, as well as skinks and little lizards.
What we don’t have are bilbies, numbats, bandicoots or quolls – the native species most at threat by feral cats. So before we ban domestic cats, perhaps we could address the problem of feral cats roaming the countryside and killing native animals. Rodney Crute, Hunters Hill
Good luck with that, Antone. Alicia Dawson, Balmain
Another environmental advantage of banning cats would be reduced resource use and less waste through the elimination of their single use plastic, single serve dinners and associated plastic paraphernalia. Karen Joynes, Bermagui
I have to ask; “Why pick on cats?” There are many other sources of threat to native wildlife. For instance, dogs. The biggest threat to our wildlife is land clearing, which destroys habitat. What about the effect on habitat of farm animals? Should we ban cars, which are responsible for many deaths of native animals? Domestic cat ownership provides many benefits to families and individuals, so let’s not foster a pathological hatred of them. Robin Douglas, Cherrybrook
In response to the call to outlaw cat ownership, please note that the inner west, at least, is indeed alive with roaming mammals, but unfortunately, those mammals are rats. The rats are now largely resistant to poison and are no longer taking bait. Cats are an effective line of defence against the rats and should most certainly not be banned until there is an alternative and equally effective method for eradicating rats. Patricia Loughlan, Glebe
Yes, cats need to be contained indoors or in secure areas where they cannot roam. That could be a requirement to owning a cat. Not hard to do, but perhaps harder to enforce. Stray or wandering cats could be rounded up and, if not possible to identify and returned to the legal registered owner, be euthanised. Legal owners who do not contain their cats need to be fined. Yes, I am a cat lover and own one cat, who has never been outside. My cat is affectionate and part of our family. She brings joy and happiness into our home. I think a less emotional approach needs to be taken to resolve this issue. Stephen Wilton, Ettalong Beach
Fear of violence
I understand the trauma of break-in and burglary in the Kempsey region (“The towns where kids wear balaclavas and carry machetes”, February 21). Recently, while working at the Aboriginal medical service in Kempsey, and staying in Crescent Head, I had a late-night break-in. My bag, with cash, keys, phone, and two cars were stolen – video surveillance showed it was four balaclava-covered youths. I was fortunate, as tracking software enabled police to locate my phone and one of the cars. I was only significantly traumatised when I learnt there were golf clubs in the cars, stolen elsewhere, that could have been used if my husband or I had woken, as the burglary occurred in the next room. The burglary was not the traumatic fear – it was the fear of violence. These young people have often suffered repeated episodes of violence in their lives. This is what needs to be addressed. Where are the old police boys clubs where young men are occupied and taught life skills and other ways of dealing with emotions and boredom? Where are the older men leading by good example? Katriona Herborn, Blackheath
Australia-wide request
A wonderful letter about Lakemba (Letters, February 21). Whether we visit Lakemba or not, surely your correspondent’s request not to bring anger and racism with you should apply Australia wide. Lynne Poleson, Kingsford

A Personal Tribute to a Friend, Courageous Opponent of Soviet Political Abuses of Psychiatry

I had the privilege of knowing Semon Gluzman, who died this week. I do not claim to have known him well. But, all the same, there was an indirect and direct connection.
I’d like to recall this as part of my tribute to this courageous individual, who initially became a symbol of independent thought and ethical professionalism and paid a price for it as a Soviet political prisoner, but who also, as a freethinker, subsequently contributed to the development of the notion of a Ukrainian political nation.
JOIN US ON TELEGRAM
Follow our coverage of the war on the @Kyivpost_official.
My first memories of Gluzman are from the mid-1970s. At the time, I was both a postgraduate at the London School of Economics and Political Science and already involved with those in London who were campaigning for the release of Soviet political prisoners, and especially the victims of the Soviet abuse of psychiatry for political purposes.
Gluzman, as a young psychiatrist, made his name by courageously opposing punitive psychiatry as applied by the Soviet authorities against dissenters. One of them was the Ukrainian former Soviet general, Petro Hryhorenko, who had turned against the system. Gluzman dared to refuse to recognize that this “patient” was indeed insane and made his findings public.
Born in Kyiv, he served as a psychiatrist in the notorious Dnipropetrovsk Special Psychiatric Hospital, where numerous political dissidents were held. He was probably the first Soviet psychiatrist to break ranks and expose the truth about what was happening.
Four Years and More of Heroic Resistance: Ukraine Will Not Be Broken
He was arrested in May 1972 and subsequently sentenced to seven years in a strict-regime labor camp and three years in Siberian exile for “anti-Soviet agitation and propaganda.” While imprisoned, he continued his defiance, notably co-authoring “A Manual on Psychiatry for Dissidents” with Vladimir Bukovsky between 1973 and 1974
Following his release from exile in 1982, Gluzman remained in Ukraine, continuing his fight for human rights despite ongoing harassment. With the fall of the Soviet Union, he became a pivotal figure in reforming Ukrainian psychiatry. In 1991, he founded the Ukrainian Psychiatric Association, serving as its president and working to integrate Ukrainian psychiatry into the international professional community and establish ethical standards.
I recall taking part in large public meetings in London, especially in Trafalgar Square, when a host of well-known public figures called for the release of Soviet prisoners of conscience. They included many Ukrainians, such as the mathematician Leonid Pliushch and physician Mykola Plakhotniuk. And Gluzman’s name figured prominently.
At that time. I was not even aware as a young student that Gluzman was from Kyiv. He was depicted simply as a brave “Russian” psychiatrist who had opposed the imprisonment of dissenters in Soviet psychiatric hospitals.
It was only later that I discovered that, after he had been arrested and detained in Kyiv, not Moscow or any other large Russian city, for his courageous position in refusing to do what the Soviet authorities demanded of him, that as a Soviet Ukrainian Jew, he had undergone a transformation in his view of things.
Time as a political prisoner
While awaiting trial in a Kyiv KGB cell, he met the prominent Ukrainian poet and defender of Ukraine’s national rights, Vasyl Stus.
I was subsequently impressed to learn how the two diverse personalities with different priorities but united by their defense of human rights had interacted in the prison cell. They bonded and opened up to one another.
The Russian-speaking psychiatrist Gluzman gave Stus tips on how to act before his KGB interrogators. For his part, Stus explained to his temporary cellmate what Ukrainian patriots were struggling for, interested him in learning basic Ukrainian, and even shared some of his poems with him
So, Gluzman, preoccupied with opposing political abuses of psychiatry, was won over to the Ukrainian cause that hitherto he had not been particularly interested in.
Subsequently, in the labor camps in which he served his sentence, Gluzman felt at home with Ukrainian political prisoners. Including those national freedom fighters from the late 1940s and early 1950s that the Soviets had branded as Nazis.
After completing his sentence and Ukraine becoming independent, Gluzman returned to his psychiatric profession, eventually becoming the head of the Ukrainian Psychiatric Association, which he founded.
He maintained a very open and balanced perspective. As a former “Soviet” Jew, after his experience in the Soviet labor camps and his meetings with Ukraine’s leading national rights defenders, he developed his own views on what an independent Ukraine should be.
A former dissident and political prisoner, Gluzman did not try to capitalize on this politically. He worked and advanced within his profession and, from time to time, shared his thoughts about where Ukraine was heading.
We know that he supported the Maidan protests, or rather the Revolution of Dignity, which occurred at the end of 2013 and beginning of 2014.
But it is clear that he became very disillusioned with what followed under President Petro Poroshenko. He became increasingly critical of what he saw as the failure to uphold the principles of the Revolution of Dignity.
He also questioned, and then opposed, the approach to the reform of the country’s health care system launched under Poroshenko.
I met Gluzman several times, the last just before Russia’s full-scale assault on Ukraine. It was on a terrace on Khreshchatyk Street close to the Maidan.
We had an intense discussion about the way Ukraine was heading. He was not happy with what he was seeing. This was towards the end of the Poroshenko era, but before Zelensky emerged on the political scene and before he was elected president of the country.
Corruption, broken promises, cheap patriotic populism, and incompetence in managing reforms, especially in the health sphere—these were among issues he raised.
But he was also concerned that the project to build a new, modern, inclusive Ukraine was faltering because of what he saw as the wrong, populist, and inherently divisive, motivations from the top.
I don’t know what he felt and believed subsequently, as Zelensky replaced Poroshenko, and Russia launched its full-scale war against Ukraine.
Suffice to say, he remained on the fringes and did not seek the limelight for himself.
So, in this short tribute, I want to pay my respects to a courageous psychiatrist who risked, or rather invited, imprisonment for opposing the barbaric Soviet ways of treating dissenters.
But also as a figure who embodied the movement in Ukraine towards genuine democracy and the crystallization of an authentic political nation.
Gluzman maintained his dignity and principles throughout and had the guts to express his views on the state of affairs, whether during Soviet despotism or the complex period of independent democratic statehood that followed.
We are fortunate that he was with us and did what he did. He will not be forgotten.

US envoy Steve Witkoff says Trump questioning why Iran has not ‘capitulated’
Sign up now: Get ST's newsletters delivered to your inbox
WASHINGTON - US envoy Steve Witkoff said on Feb 21 that President Donald Trump is questioning why Iran has not “capitulated” in the face of Washington’s military build-up aimed at pressuring them into a nuclear deal.
The United States and Iran this week resumed Oman-mediated talks in Geneva aimed at averting the possibility of military action, after Washington dispatched two aircraft carriers
In a Fox News interview with Mr Trump’s daughter-in-law Lara, Mr Witkoff said the president was “curious” about Iran’s position after he had warned them of severe consequences in the event they failed to strike a deal.
“I don’t want to use the word ‘frustrated,’ because he understands he has plenty of alternatives, but he’s curious as to why they haven’t... I don’t want to use the word ‘capitulated,’ but why they haven’t capitulated,” he said.
“Why, under this pressure, with the amount of seapower and naval power over there, why haven’t they come to us and said, ‘We profess we don’t want a weapon, so here’s what we’re prepared to do’? And yet it’s sort of hard to get them to that place.”
The US envoy also confirmed in the interview that he had met with Mr Reza Pahlavi, who has not returned to Iran since before the 1979 Islamic Revolution that ousted the monarchy.
“I met him at the direction of the president,” he said, without providing further details.
US-based Mr Pahlavi last week told a crowd in Munich that he was ready to lead the country to a “secular democratic future” after Mr Trump said regime change would be best
Mr Witkoff’s comments come after Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi said a draft proposal for an agreement with Washington would be ready in a matter of days.
Mr Trump said on Feb 19 that Iran had at most 15 days to make a deal on concerns starting with its nuclear programme.
As talks between the two nations continued in Geneva, Iran’s supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei on Feb 17 said that Mr Trump would not succeed in destroying the Islamic republic.
Western countries accuse the Islamic Republic of seeking to acquire nuclear weapons, which Tehran denies, though it insists on its right to enrichment for civilian purposes.
Iran, for its part, is seeking to negotiate an end to sanctions that have proven to be a massive drag on its economy, which played a role in sparking anti-government protests in December. AFP

U.S. President Donald Trump on Saturday said he is going to dispatch a hospital ship to Greenland, autonomous Danish territory that Trump has said he wants to acquire.
Danish officials responded by saying the health care systems in Denmark and Greenland are more than adequate.
“Working with the fantastic Governor of Louisiana, Jeff Landry, we are going to send a great hospital boat to Greenland to take care of the many people who are sick, and not being taken care of there. It’s on the way!!!” Trump said in a post on social media alongside an illustration of the U.S. hospital ship the Mercy.

New peace talks on ending Ukraine war will take place within three weeks – Witkoff
U.S. special envoy Steve Witkoff said this in an interview with Fox News, Ukrinform reports.
"We're hopeful, Jared [Kushner] and I, that we've put some proposals on the table to both sides that will bring them together in the next three weeks and maybe even result in a summit between [Ukrainian President Volodymyr] Zelensky and President Putin. It might end up being a trilateral at some point with President [Donald Trump]. We'll have to see," he said.
According to Witkoff, Trump does not want to attend a meeting unless he feels that he can achieve the best result.
Witkoff also expressed hope that the world could hear "good news" on this issue in the coming weeks.
Zelensky earlier said that the next round of peace talks should take place in Geneva within ten days.
On February 18, talks in a trilateral format involving representatives of Ukraine, the United States, and Russia concluded in Geneva.

Four Years of Heroic Resistance: Ukraine Will Not Be Broken

Four years ago this week, on Feb. 24, 2022, Russian President Vladimir Putin launched his full-scale invasion, expecting Kyiv to fall within days and sovereign Ukraine to disappear within weeks.
He had begun his military aggression against Ukraine back in 2014 when his unidentified “green men” seized Crimea and plunged the Donbas into a bloodbath.

He was confident Russia’s might and the West’s hesitation. would allow him to get away with his criminal goals.
He was wrong.
Ukraine still stands. Its flag flies over Kyiv. Its military fights on. Its people endure, remaining defiant and hopeful.
The cost has been brutal. Tens of thousands of soldiers are dead. Thousands of civilians killed. Millions displaced. Cities reduced to rubble. Some 18 percent of Ukraine’s territory occupied by the Russian invaders.
Yet Ukraine has not broken.
Whatever his domestic shortcomings, Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelensky, has provided the necessary wartime leadership and become a Churchillian figure on the international scene.
Ukraine’s armed forces have held the line against a larger enemy. Citizens have kept the country running through blackouts and air raids. Western military aid and financial support have been crucial.
But US President Donald Trump’s approach has created grave uncertainty about his country’s commitment. Europe has stepped up instead. Britain, France, Germany, Poland, the Nordics, the Baltics, and Canada – a Coalition of the Willing – are filling the void.
No Illusions: What Will Really Stop the War?
Russia has paid a staggering price. Hundreds of thousands of soldiers killed or wounded. Its economy buckling under war costs and sanctions. Internationally disgraced and isolated, Moscow depends on China, North Korea, and Iran for survival.
Western support has been vital, but it hasn’t reached decisive levels. Ukraine needs more – not just to survive, but to force Russia to the table on terms that respect sovereignty and territorial integrity.
Talk of peace negotiations is hollow without real pressure. Putin won’t negotiate in good faith. He respects only force. Appeasement has never worked with Moscow, and it won’t work now. Every delay, every half-measure, and every attempt to accommodate the Kremlin only emboldens further aggression.
Remember, this is not a neighborhood dispute. This is a genocidal war against Ukraine and a direct threat to Europe and the free world. If aggression succeeds here, autocrats worldwide will take note.
The West must act. Expand sanctions. Increase military aid. Isolate Moscow completely. Guarantee Ukraine’s future in a democratic Europe with a clear path to EU and NATO membership. Pressure Russia to retreat – not merely hope it will.
This is a struggle between authoritarianism and freedom, old-style imperialism and national self-determination.
Four years ago, Putin sought to erase Ukraine. Instead, he forged a nation more united than ever. That is his failure – and Ukraine’s strength.
Putin has also woken Europe up to realities, and even as the US steps back and its leadership appeases the Kremlin, Ukraine has been reassured that it will not be abandoned and left to fend for itself.
There is no more time to waste!

Bodies of 9 backcountry skiers recovered in California
Victims include 6 close friends, 3 professional guides as authorities launch investigations into deadly avalanche in Lake Tahoe,
ISTANBUL
The bodies of nine backcountry skiers killed earlier this week were recovered Saturday after an avalanche struck the California side of Lake Tahoe, according to officials.
Authorities said the group was on a day-trip skiing expedition Tuesday when the avalanche struck.
Six of those killed were close friends described as “passionate, skilled skiers,” along with three professional guides.
Relatives identified the victims as Carrie Atkin, Liz Clabaugh, Danielle Keatley, Kate Morse, Caroline Sekar and Kate Vitt.
The Nevada County Sheriff’s Office confirmed that three employees from the Blackbird Mountain Guides-- Michael Henry, 30, Andrew Alissandratos, 34 and Nicole Choo, 42 -- also died in the avalanche.
“We are grateful that we can bring them home,” said Shannan Moon, the sheriff of Nevada County, California, as reported by NBC News.
Five of the victims were recovered and airlifted Friday by helicopter.
Fifteen skiers were caught in the avalanche. Six survived, including two who sustained non-life-threatening injuries.
Multiple agencies have launched investigations into the avalanche. The Sierra Avalanche Center will prepare an incident report, Cal/OSHA is examining possible workplace safety violations, and the sheriff’s office is conducting its own inquiry.

NEW YORK, February 22. /TASS/. Special US Envoy Steve Witkoff has said that Russian President Vladimir Putin was always straight with him during their meetings.
"He’s never been anything other than straight with me, and I say that and I get attacked, but that’s an accurate statement. He’s told me that this is what his red lines are," Witkoff said in an interview with the Fox News TV channel.
He indicated that it was important for him to understand Russia’s position. "I got attacked for going to meet him eight times. How would you make a deal with someone on the other side unless you knew where the other person was coming from? I needed to understand what his motivations were, his goals and so forth. And I actually think that a lot of those meetings now are becoming very relevant," Witkoff said.
"So I think those meetings were important, and hopefully we’re going to consummate this whole thing," the official noted.

Israel disqualifies its own Olympic bobsleigh team for lying to officials
Team tried to let Ward Fawarseh, an alternate, compete by faking another member’s medical exam, Olympic Committee of Israel says, calling behavior ‘against fair and sportsmanlike conduct’
Amy Spiro is a reporter and writer with The Times of Israel
In a shock move, Israel’s bobsleigh team was barred by Israeli Olympic officials from completing its competition on Sunday in the four-man event at the 2026 Winter Games.
In a statement to The Times of Israel early Sunday, the Olympic Committee of Israel said it disqualified the team from competing after one of its athletes lied to Olympic officials in order to allow their teammate, Ward Fawarseh, to compete in their stead.
Israel competed Saturday in the first two runs of the event with the team consisting of AJ Edelman, Menachem Chen, Uri Zisman and Omer Katz. As of Sunday morning, the team was still slated to compete according to the official schedule, but with Edelman, Chen, Fawarseh and Katz.
Had he taken to the ice, Fawarseh would have been Israel’s first-ever Druze Olympian. But he went to the Games officially as an alternate, and wouldn’t be allowed to compete unless another member of the team was unwell.
“The bobsleigh team asked to include Ward, the substitute, in the competition. According to the rules, this is only permitted if one of the athletes is injured or ill,” said the Olympic Committee of Israel. “In order to make this possible, one of the team members — encouraged by his teammates — declared that he was unwell. He even went for a medical examination and signed an affidavit so that the Olympic Committee could request approval for a substitution.”
Afterward, the OCI said, Zisman “admitted to the head of the delegation that he had acted improperly. This forced the Olympic Committee of Israel to withdraw the request and disqualify the move.”
The OCI said that the team’s behavior was “improper” and “goes against fair and sportsmanlike conduct.”
In a statement posted to Instagram Sunday morning, Edelman wrote that since the team was not in a competitive position and had no chance of winning, “it was more important to us that our alternate could have the opportunity to compete in the Olympics.”
However, he wrote, “the circumstances under which we made the substitution did not meet the high bar that allows a team to make a lineup change, and we withdrew from our final run.”
Edelman said the team is “sorry that this will not end for us in the way we had hoped,” but that it is “proud of the history we made representing Israel.”
David Greaves, president of the Israeli Bobsleigh and Skeleton Federation, told the Times of Israel that he was “deeply disappointed in the actions of the team.”
Following its first two runs on Saturday, the team was in 24th place out of 27 competitors after three sleds crashed during the second run. Only the top 20 sleds qualify for the fourth and final heat.
The bobsleigh team had been at the center of controversy throughout its time at the Milano Cortina Games, in part due to its high profile in the Israeli delegation, fueled by Edelman’s strong social media presence.
The team made history as Israel’s first-ever Olympic bobsleigh team, and as one of the only groups to compete for Israel in a Winter Olympics team event. Throughout its time in Cortina, the team garnered considerable press coverage and attention.
Last week, a Swiss commentator came under fire after he spoke over the team’s entire run in the two-man bobsleigh event with commentary accusing Edelman of “supporting genocide” and questioning if he should be eligible to compete due to his political positions.
The Swiss RTS public broadcaster later said it had pulled the remarks from its digital platforms, saying that while they were “factual,” they were “inappropriate due to its length within the context of a sports commentary.”
Then on Saturday, the RAI Italian public broadcaster apologized after an off-air comment that called for “avoiding” any discussion of the Israeli bobsleigh team during its first heats in the four-man competition.
The interim director of RAI Sport called the comment an “unacceptable expression” and said that “immediate internal reviews have been launched to determine responsibility.”
The 2026 Winter Olympics are set to wrap up on Sunday, with Israeli skier Barnabas Szollos slated to be the country’s flag-bearer during Sunday night’s closing ceremony.

Orthodox Church celebrates Forgiveness Sunday

MINSK, 22 February (BelTA) - Orthodox believers celebrate Forgiveness Sunday today. This holiday concludes Maslenitsa week, after which Great Lent begins.
The Orthodox Church teaches: first reconcile with people, and only then seek the opportunity to be reconciled with God. Since ancient times, on this day people have asked each other for forgiveness for all visible and invisible offenses, and in response it was customary to say: “God will forgive” as if expressing the hope that in heaven the Lord will not hold it as a sin against a person for what they were forgiven for on this sinful earth. The Gospel of Matthew states: “For if you forgive others their trespasses, your heavenly Father will also forgive you.”
On this day, during the evening service in churches, the Rite of Forgiveness is performed in memory of the ancient custom of Egyptian monks. Before the start of Great Lent until Easter, they would disperse into the desert for 40 days to devote themselves entirely to prayers. Some of them never returned: some were torn apart by wild animals, others perished in the lifeless desert. Everyone understood that their meeting on the eve of Great Lent might be their last. Therefore, as they parted, the monks asked each other for forgiveness for all their wrongs, voluntary or involuntary, as if before death. Over time, this became a tradition among all believers.
On Forgiveness Sunday, believers attending the liturgy have the opportunity to hear the Gospel reading, which speaks of the forgiveness of sins, fasting, and storing up heavenly treasures. The Church provides guidance to believers on proper conduct during Great Lent and calls upon parishioners to repent to one another for all trespasses, to reconcile, and to forgive. One of the rules states, “judge not thy neighbor”. The priests themselves set a good example and are the first to ask forgiveness from their flock.
On this day, it is customary to visit the graves of deceased relatives and loved ones to mentally repent for any offenses ever caused to them.

KYIV, Feb 22 - One police officer was killed and 24 people were wounded after several explosive devices detonated at midnight in Lviv, in western Ukraine, the National Police said on Sunday, in an attack President Volodymyr Zelenskiy blamed on Russia.
"It has been preliminarily established that homemade explosive devices detonated," the police said on the Telegram messaging service.
Lviv Mayor Andriy Sadovyi, writing on Telegram, described the incident as a terrorist act and said a 23-year-old policewoman had died. Twelve people remained in hospital, two in serious condition, he said.
Interior Minister Ihor Klymenko said a woman had been detained in connection with the investigation.
The police said that the first explosion occurred after a patrol crew arrived at the suspected scene of a shop break-in, while the second explosion occurred a little later.
Zelenskiy, speaking in his nightly video address, accused Russia of being behind the attack and said the perpetrators had been recruited online. Ukrainian intelligence believed Russia would "continue to do such things, real attacks on Ukrainians. There needs to be more protection for people", Zelenskiy said.

Attacked in India, Kashmiri shawl sellers choose between safety, livelihood
A surge in attacks has forced many Kashmiris to return home. Others are devising survival strategies, such as WhatsApp groups where they alert each other about places to avoid.
Srinagar, Indian-administered Kashmir – Ayaz Ahmad stares at his screen, fingers moving rapidly as he types in a group chat on his mobile phone.
Ahmad, 28, goes around houses in Hisar, a city in northern India’s Haryana state, selling shawls and other handicraft items – like thousands of other itinerant traders from Indian-administered Kashmir, who crisscross the country on foot or bicycles.

But a spate of hate attacks faced by the shawl sellers in recent weeks has forced them to rethink and strategise what was once a common, winter-time sight across Indian cities: Kashmiris lugging large wraps holding shawls and other wares.
Ahmad now runs a WhatsApp group in which nearly two dozen members share information as they guide each other on areas to avoid.
“I guide them on where to go and where to avoid because some areas are fine, but others have seen harassment against our members,” Ahmad told Al Jazeera.
“Now, our priority is safety rather than business, as harassment incidents continue to happen to our members almost every day.”
‘Simply because of my identity’
Ahmad formed the WhatsApp group late last month after a Hindu shopkeeper in northern India’s Uttarakhand state hit Tabish Ahmad Ganie, an 18-year-old Kashmiri shawl seller, with an iron rod.
“This is a Hindu village. Kashmiri Muslims won’t work here at all,” the shopkeeper was heard shouting in a viral video of the attack, which left Ganie unconscious, while his elder brother Danish, who was also attacked, suffered minor injuries.
Ganie, a class 10 dropout, received 12 stitches on his head and his left arm. He is unable to walk due to fractures in his leg.
Bloodied, bandaged and wearing a sling, he told Al Jazeera the Hindu shopkeeper was accompanied by two others as they thrashed him brutally.
“Not for anything I had done, but simply because of my identity as a Kashmiri Muslim,” he said at his home in Kashmir’s Kupwara district, more than 800km (about 500 miles) from Uttarakhand’s Vikas Nagar area where he was attacked.
Ganie’s was not an isolated case, but part of a growing trend of attacks across India on Kashmiri traders and migrant workers, accompanied by a drumbeat of rhetoric against the region’s people on social media and at times, in public speeches from influential individuals linked to Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). That rhetoric often depicts Kashmiris as “security threats” to India, and as “antinational” and “Pakistani agents”.
Since Modi came to power in 2014, anti-Muslim hate in India has soared — often patronised and fomented by leaders of the Hindu majoritarian BJP, and at times legitimised through dog whistles by the prime minister himself.
But Kashmiri Muslims carry a double burden — their faith and their homeland are both subjects of suspicion and widespread hatred in today’s India.
On Christmas Day, shawl vendor Bilal Ahmad was attacked by a Hindu group in Uttarakhand’s Kashipur district after he refused to chant “Bharat Mata Ki Jai” (Hail Mother India), a nationalist slogan that imagines India as a mother goddess. The slogan has been weaponised by the BJP and Hindu right-wing groups, who have often used it as a war cry in their campaign against Muslims and other minorities.
Bilal said his family grew concerned after seeing a video of the attack online.
“They called me and urged me to return to Kashmir because of the increasing attacks on Kashmiris. After facing harassment, I decided to close my business and came back to Kashmir,” he told Al Jazeera.
No easy choices
But returning to Kashmir is not an easy choice for many.
Rampant unemployment due to limited job opportunities in Kashmir often pushes young Kashmiris out of the region to look for livelihoods elsewhere, mainly the northern Indian states of Punjab, Himachal Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Haryana, and the national capital territory of Delhi.
Since 2019, when Modi’s government scrapped the region’s decades-old partial autonomy guaranteed by the constitution and brought it under New Delhi’s direct control, a fledgling economy still recovering from the aftershocks of the move has compounded the job crisis.
However, anti-Kashmiri sentiments – and resultant attacks on them – spiked last year after a group of armed men attacked Indian tourists in Kashmir’s scenic Pahalgam area, killing 26 people. India accused Pakistan of backing the attackers, a charge Islamabad rejected. The attack triggered a four-day air war between India and Pakistan — the neighbours that control parts of Kashmir but claim it in full — while diplomatic tensions and sporting boycotts continue.
In recent months, about 200 cases of attacks on Kashmiri students, shawl sellers or migrant workers have been reported across India. Many were beaten, threatened, harassed, and forced to leave the areas where they were living or doing business.
When Bashir Ahmad visited a Hindu-majority locality in early January to sell shawls in Punjab state’s Moga district, he was stopped and asked to show permission to conduct his business. He knew it was a mere pretext. Failing to show any permit, he was abused, and his bag of shawls was thrown on the ground.
The 50-year-old man returned to Kashmir after the incident and advised fellow shawl sellers to operate only in areas that other Kashmiris had found safe.
In neighbouring Himachal Pradesh’s Kangra district, a retired Indian army soldier, Surjeet Rajput Guleria, abused and publicly interrogated an unidentified Kashmiri hawker on January 17, livestreaming the incident on Facebook.
The video shows him making anti-Muslim and sexually charged remarks, accusing Kashmiris of supporting Pakistan and engaging in pelting stones at Indian soldiers deployed in Kashmir. “Your sisters and daughters go to Pakistan and return pregnant,” he is heard saying in the video.
Local media reports said the Kangra police filed a report against Guleria, but no further action was taken.
On February 1, Guleria was back again – livestreaming his harassment of another Kashmiri hawker, Mohammad Ramzan, on Facebook.
“He threatened me and demanded that I leave the state. He went through my shawl bundles and mockingly accused me of carrying an AK-47 rifle instead of Kashmiri shawls,” Ramzan told Al Jazeera.
He said such targeting of migrants “not only jeopardises livelihoods but also reinforces a climate of fear that affects families” dependent on seasonal trade for survival.
It is not just shawl sellers who have suffered.
Abdul Hakeem, a resident of Kashmir’s Kulgam district, ran a fruit-selling business in Punjab’s Jalandhar city. He said he faced constant harassment from fellow Hindu vendors, and finally left the area on February 6, after he was given an ultimatum to either leave the state or face consequences.
“I had to leave fruits worth about 100,000 rupees [$1,100] behind and return to the valley because my family was afraid due to the rising attacks on Kashmiris outside the valley,” he told Al Jazeera.
His 50-year-old mother, Misra Begum, said they did not want him to continue his business if he did not feel safe. “We would rather go without food than see our son get into trouble,” she said.
‘Troubling pattern’
Kashmir’s main political parties — the governing National Conference and the opposition Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) — have urged the federal government, which effectively governs the region, to intervene and stop the attacks on Kashmiris across the country.
Calling the attacks “unacceptable”, Kashmir’s Chief Minister Omar Abdullah said earlier this month he had raised the issue at a meeting of the chief ministers of the northern Indian states and appealed to them to prevent such incidents.
Abdullah’s predecessor, Mehbooba Mufti of the PDP, alleged that the attackers operated with the backing of respective state authorities.
“[The] state governments appear to be granting silent patronage to mob violence, treating hatred as a shortcut to political success. The rule of law has been replaced by politics of fear,” she wrote on X on February 3, as she shared a video about an elderly Kashmiri man harassed in BJP-ruled Uttar Pradesh state.
BJP spokesman in Kashmir, Altaf Thakur, condemned the attacks on Kashmiri shawl sellers as “wrong and unacceptable”. He said the Kashmiris are an “inseparable part of the nation” and asserted the government would not tolerate such actions.
But Kashmiri lawmaker, Mohammad Yousuf Tarigami, told Al Jazeera the attacks on Kashmiris are a “troubling pattern” that could not be ignored as they send “an alarming signal” to the people of Kashmir.
“Kashmiris, particularly small traders and shawl sellers, travel to different parts of the country to earn a livelihood, but repeated assaults and intimidation were causing fear and insecurity,” he said.

Kuwait summons Iraqi chargé d’affaires for Baghdad’s filing maritime coordinates with UN
Iraqi submission ‘infringes on its sovereignty’ over disputed maritime features, says Kuwait
ISTANBUL
Kuwait summoned Iraq’s chargé d’affaires on Saturday to protest Baghdad’s filing of maritime coordinates and a map with the UN, saying the submission “infringes on Kuwaiti sovereignty” over established maritime areas.
The Kuwaiti Foreign Ministry said Iraq “had deposited a list of coordinates and a map with the UN that included claims regarding Iraqi maritime domains.”
It said the coordinates and map affect its sovereignty over maritime areas and fixed water elevations, including Fasht Al-Qaid and Fasht Al-Aij, which it described as not subject to any dispute regarding Kuwait’s full sovereignty.
The ministry said Acting Deputy Foreign Minister Aziz Rahim Al-Daihani summoned Zaid Abbas Shanshal “to deliver a formal protest note over Iraqi claims affecting Kuwait’s maritime sovereignty and related water elevations.”
Kuwait urged Iraq to take into account the historical ties between the two countries and to act responsibly in accordance with international law, including the 1982 UN Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS), as well as bilateral understandings and agreements.
The UNCLOS entered into force in 1994 and establishes a comprehensive legal framework governing the world’s oceans, setting rules for the allocation of states’ rights and jurisdiction in maritime zones, the peaceful use of seas and oceans, and the management of marine resources.
Earlier Saturday, Iraq’s Foreign Ministry said it had deposited updated lists of coordinates for Iraq’s territorial sea baselines and maritime zones with the UN secretary-general on Jan. 19 and Feb. 9, in accordance with UNCLOS provisions.
It said the submission includes the determination of straight baselines and baselines drawn along the low-water line for measuring the breadth of the territorial sea, as well as the delimitation of the territorial sea, the contiguous zone, the exclusive economic zone and the continental shelf of Iraq, in accordance with the internationally recognized World Geodetic System 1984 (WGS-84).
Baghdad said the deposit replaces previous submissions dated Dec. 7, 2021, and 15 April 2011, and aims “to update Iraq’s maritime data in line with the provisions of international law and enhance the legal clarity of the boundaries of maritime zones subject to Iraq’s sovereignty and sovereign rights.”
Iraq also said the coordinates and chart have been published on the website of the UN Division for Ocean Affairs and the Law of the Sea, and reiterated its commitment to international law and regional stability.
In August 1990, Iraq, under then-President Saddam Hussein, invaded Kuwait, leading to the 1991 Gulf War, during which a US-led international coalition expelled Iraqi forces after seven months.
Baghdad and Kuwait resumed diplomatic relations in 2003 following the fall of Saddam Hussein’s government.
After the invasion, the UN demarcated the land boundary between the two countries. But the demarcation did not settle all aspects of their maritime boundary, leaving certain maritime delimitation issues to be addressed bilaterally between the two oil-producing neighbors.

American rights to free speech vs. European rights to set their own rules
Unknown

16:00:47 KST

Europeans and Americans talk past each other while rivals watch. The EU can set its own standards, but in an interconnected economy, decoupling fantasies and grandstanding won’t help.
“Free speech” narratives against the EU's legislative framework for digital policy often prompt a knee-jerk reaction in Europe: “This is our land, our Union, our laws, follow them, or leave the EU - we’ll find alternative products to use!”- that’s the most typical reaction from some Europeans when they hear Americans talk about the EU’s digital rules.
Let’s be clear: the general European public cares about American constitutional amendments about as much as Americans care about European acts and regulations - very little.
And since global cooperation on emerging-technology regulation is more about diplomatic conversations, resolutions, and paperwork than real collaboration, and all of the previous attempts to establish some type of dialogue have essentially failed.
Both sides of the Atlantic are stuck in a back-and-forth cycle, where attempts to normalise the conversation (such as the EU-US trade deal) are ruined every few months by those who want to see Europe and the US further apart, not closer together.
Understanding both sides
Understanding the American perspective is not difficult.
Since social media platforms are built to have a globally universal user experience, whatever legislation is adopted in the EU will eventually change the design and functioning of global social media platforms and, therefore, also influence the “American right to exercise free speech”.
Couple that with the European Union reiterating its ambition to shape the global regulatory picture through the “Brussels effect”, the American trade surplus with the EU in services, the ambiguity of some EU digital rules (leaving the industry at constant regulatory twilight), the American technological competition with China, and the American hyperfocus on the European digital rules becomes understandable.
Europeans also have a point: a 450-million-consumer market has the right to define rules that reflect local principles, values, and needs. That doesn't mean the status quo cannot be questioned, and the Europeans who disagree with the course of action when it comes to digital rules are traitors.
Change, even if the need for it is acknowledged, isn’t easy in Europe. The European Commission, and the handful of politicians arguing for scaling back regulation and exercising “regulatory self-restraint”, are stuck between a rock and a hard place.
Even incremental attempts to simplify rules or remove regulatory overlaps are often met with hostility and personal attacks. This is in part due to different political views, and in part because Europe’s regulatory machine tends to create lawyer, consultant, and expert classes (if not entire industries) that live off those regulations and are ready to defend them with all their might.
To be completely fair, some American public figures are also shooting themselves in the foot by engaging in broadly anti-EU rhetoric, which only drowns out European moderates and prompts knee-jerk reactions from others in Europe.
Zooming out
The past two years have been difficult for moderates on both sides of the Atlantic, where discussions based on mutual interests and partnerships are overshadowed by grandiose statements and negativity.
The most logical course of action at the moment is to think long-term - zoom out to assess the EU-US tech partnership in the context of partnerships between, say, China and Russia, and to take any grandiose statements with a grain of salt.
Neither we Europeans nor the Americans live in a vacuum, and both sides will eventually lose more if the tangible dialogue is postponed even further: the global economy is interconnected, blank-slate decoupling is unrealistic, and the rest of the world is watching - and sometimes benefiting from transatlantic infighting.

High energy prices threaten UK’s status as manufacturing power, business groups say
Unknown
Unknown Publisher

07:00:32 UTC
16:00:32 KST

The UK is at risk of losing its status as a major manufacturing centre after a sharp rise in energy prices that has forced about 40% of businesses to cut back investment, according to a report by the CBI and Energy UK.
In a stinging message to ministers, the report said British businesses – from chemical producers to pubs and restaurants – were being undermined by a failure to cap prices and upgrade the UK’s ageing gas and electricity networks.
A far-reaching review of outmoded regulations that govern the sale and supply of energy is also needed to spur investment and boost economic growth, the report said.
Energy UK, which represents more than 100 electricity generators and retailers, said business electricity costs remained 70% higher than before Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, while gas prices were 60% higher.
A survey underpinning the report found that almost 90% of companies have seen energy bills rise over the last five years and four in 10 had reduced investment as a result.
Without a reduction in energy bills, “the risk of job losses, production cuts, plant closures and offshoring will increase”, the report said.
The CBI and Energy UK said ministers needed to join forces with industry to conduct a comprehensive review of the UK’s energy needs and how they can be met during the transition to net zero.
A taskforce made up of researchers from both organisations and industry groups will consider how reforms could reduce prices and improve the efficiency of the gas and electricity networks.
The aim is to persuade ministers that initiatives to improve the UK’s energy system have not gone far enough, leaving the UK in danger of widespread deindustrialisation.
The UK has some of the most expensive industrial energy prices in the developed world. They are almost two-thirds above the median of International Energy Agency (IEA) countries and the highest among G7 members.
As an indication of the impact, figures covering 2025 show the UK’s trade in goods slumped to its worst performance on record. Britain reported a £248.3bn deficit for goods – £30.5bn more than the previous year.
The Office for National Statistics said the widening gap was only partly filled by a £192bn surplus in services, up £16.4bn from the previous year.
Last year the manufacturers’ lobby group, Make UK, said the government should provide millions of pounds in extra subsidies to prevent the industry from shrinking.
Louise Hellem, the CBI’s chief economist, said industrial sectors were already suffering severe financial pain from the dramatic rise in energy prices.
“You can see it already in the chemicals industry, which has seen several closures,” she said.
Hellem described this year as a “pivotal moment” for the UK’s industrial strategy.
Among medium-sized businesses, UK electricity prices are around double the EU median. Nondomestic gas prices are in line with the EU, the report said, but are considerably higher than the likes of the US and Canada.
“This acts as a brake on ambitions for economic growth. Also, businesses cannot invest in switching to clean energy – even though they know the long-term benefits of doing so – which again undermines one of the government’s key policies,” the report said.
Energy minister Ed Miliband has sought to protect some of the UK’s biggest users of energy. Last year, the government said it would cut electricity prices by up to £40 a megawatt hour for 7,000 “heavy users” to “move the UK from being an outlier to right in the middle of the pack”.
Dhara Vyas, the head of Energy UK, said she was concerned that thousands of businesses outside the ringfence would continue to be hampered by high energy bills.
The government had made significant progress on reducing domestic energy costs, she said. But the help on offer for some industrial users was not only “a sticking plaster”, but it was also being funded by other bill payers.
She added: “Lowering prices for all businesses is fundamental to the UK’s growth story.”
She said the initial report showed “how high energy costs are holding back the UK economy, and the limits of existing support”.
“But our aim will not be just about how to reduce bills. It will be the first of its kind to take a fundamental look at the energy market and the regulations to see how it can become more effective,” she said.
A government spokesperson said ministers were aware that the cost of energy was “one of the greatest challenges facing industry” and that they were “moving full steam ahead” to implement last year’s industrial strategy to tackle it.
“We’ll shortly publish the response to our consultation on eligibility for the British Industrial Competitiveness Scheme, which will reduce electricity bills by up to 25% for over 7,000 businesses, and our Supercharger package of support will cut businesses’ electricity costs by up to £420m per year,” they said.

‘That’s a losing battle’: baboon incursions cause tense human-wildlife standoff in Cape Town
Unknown

16:00:31 KST

At the edge of Da Gama Park, where the Cape Town suburb meets the mountain, baboons jumped from the road to garden walls to roofs and back again. Children from South African navy families living in the area’s modest houses played in the street. Some were delighted; some wary; most were unfazed by the animals.
A few miles away, overlooking a soaring peak and sweeping bay, Nicola de Chaud showed photos of food strewn across her kitchen by a baboon. In another incident, a baboon threw one of her dogs across the veranda. In January, a male baboon lunged at her and refused to leave the house for 10 minutes.
“It has become really, really difficult and very traumatic actually,” said De Chaud, 61, a documentary maker who moved from Johannesburg to Simon’s Town five years ago.
Cape Town’s baboons have also caused conflict between humans, with a furious debate raging over whether the two species can coexist or whether baboons should be kept away from humans altogether.
During a 2024 protest against baboons entering the community of Kommetjie, a face-off between pro- and anti-baboon groups resulted in a person and a baboon being pepper sprayed.
The result is a “wicked problem”, said the 2025 Cape baboon management action plan. “No single solution can satisfy all parties or resolve the conflict in a final, definitive manner,” it added.
Most of Cape Town’s mountains are covered by the 25,000-hectare (61,750-acre) Table Mountain national park. However, the park is fragmented. The chacma baboons prefer to forage on low-lying land, much of which has been consumed by the city, whose population has grown 65% to 4.8 million from 2001 to 2022.
The number of baboons, which don’t have natural predators on the Cape Peninsula, has increased at a similar rate – from about 360 in 10 troops at the turn of the century to more than 600 in 17 troops in 2024, according to action plan data.
As many troops have become accustomed to foraging for calorific human food, more baboons have been shot, run over by cars, mauled by dogs or electrocuted. In 2013, four baboons died from human-related causes, according to an annual official baboon census. In 2024, it was 33.
For animal rights activists, residents should be responsible for coexisting with baboons, by locking up bins, securing doors and windows and training their dogs not to attack the animals.
Lynda Silk, a healer and activist, who educates people about living alongside nature, wants more accountability. “There’s been no successful prosecution for a person shooting a baboon,” she said.
For Tom Cohen, an American journalist who retired to Cape Town in 2019, peaceful urban coexistence is impossible. He described the two troops that frequent Simon’s Town as “hopelessly habituated and dependent on human food and settlements to survive,” adding: “They’re not wild baboons.”
Despite Cohen’s efforts to baboon-proof his home, in February 2025, they smashed a bathroom window to get in, breaking a microwave and leaving faeces. “The smell [of baboons] lingers, I can tell you that,” he said.
The three layers of government have agreed to build fences to keep baboons out of some areas and enforce a new bylaw with a “zero tolerance” approach to harming the primates.
In Simon’s Town, a fence has been deemed unworkable owing to the topography. So authorities have proposed moving the two troops to a sanctuary later this year. Euthanasia, which is anathema to animal rights activists, is to remain a last resort.
The whole plan is now under a legal challenge. Many activists are unhappy about the sanctuary. Some want to maintain the reliance on rangers, who shoot paintballs near baboons to scare them away from houses and whose management was taken over by the non-profit Cape Baboon Partnership in March 2025.
“What concerns us is that the decision to put them into a sanctuary, and even to cull them, was made before … the new management of the baboon rangers was settled,” said Sandie MacDonald, 54, who leads Cape Peninsula Civil Conservation, a non-profit organisation, with Lynda Silk. “The baboons are coming into the majority of those areas so much less.”
Nerine Dorman, 47, who lives in Welcome Glen, vehemently opposes the sanctuary: “You might as well just put them down, [rather] than relegate them to this living captivity.”
The rangers can’t solve the problem in Simon’s Town, though, said Joselyn Mormile, a Cape Baboon Partnership scientist who has studied South Africa’s baboons for 15 years. “That’s a losing battle that we are fighting every day to keep baboons and people happy there,” she said.
Mormile studied Rooi-Els, a village about 20 miles (32 km) south of Cape Town where residents opted for coexistence, for her PhD.
She found the mortality of baboons was still higher than in the wild, with 11 infant baboons killed by vehicles in four years. “I can never promote … sharing space,” she said.
Justin O’Riain, a University of Cape Town professor, said animal welfare activists bore some responsibility for the human-wildlife conflict.
He cited legal challenges that contributed to the authorities not taking important decisions about managing baboons, which he said ultimately led to one of the two Simon’s Town troops forming.
He said: “There’s never accountability for the people who complain about how baboons are managed, but do not provide a viable alternative.”

Romance fraud: warning over scam that turns victims into insurance cheats

Romance fraud typically evokes images of people being tricked out of their life savings by partners they meet on dating sites, but some scammers use a different tactic: recruiting unsuspecting victims into fake insurance claims.
The scam involves a fraudster convincing their partner, or a person they are dating, either to say they have witnessed a car accident, or to take out an insurance policy and file a bogus claim in order to secure a payout.
The Insurance Fraud Bureau (IFB), a UK body working for insurers, says that although a number of cases have been detected over the last year it is likely some victims have not reported incidents.
Nicola Smith, intelligence and investigation manager at the IFB, says this may be because the scam does not centre on directly exploiting the victim for money.
“The generic reason that it might be going under-reported is because of the shame around the situation,” she says. “But also this tactic is different in that the target isn’t being hugely financially impacted. They’re not being asked for money. They’re being asked to use their identity.”
Last year, a man who manipulated women he met on dating sites into taking part in staged car crashes was sentenced at Bournemouth crown court to 20 months’ imprisonment.
Nathan Atkins persuaded the women to take part in planned crashes at specific locations. They then made personal injury claims, which insurers paid out on.
While the impact appears to have little financial effect on the victim, they risk being placed on the insurance fraud register. This can make getting another insurance policy very difficult and affect their credit score.
“What you’re being targeted for is your identity,” says Smith. “And it’s really important to know that if you’re complicitly taking part in this, you are committing fraud along with them.”
What it looks like
The scammer identifies victims they feel they can persuade to be complicit in fraud, rather than because they have savings. “You don’t have to have lots of money to be a target of this scam because all they need is your identity,” says Smith. “What they want from you is your agreement to take part in a scam.”
At some point the victim might be asked to take part in the insurance fraud by saying that they witnessed an accident; or they were in a car when an accident happened; or they were injured as a result of an accident.
Often, the fraudster will give the victim a script or an account of what happened that they should follow. “It could be just being arranged to answer a phone call from an insurer where they were asked ‘Were you a passenger in this car’?” says Smith.
“But ultimately, to be directly involved in the scam, you would be being asked to lie to an insurer.”
What to do
If you meet someone on a dating app who asks you to be involved in anything illegal, then report the person on the app.
Screenshots can be sent to the police and to the service Report Fraud.
The Insurance Fraud Bureau operates Cheatline, a confidential online tool to report fraud.
Like many frauds, a sense of urgency is often used by the scammer to get you to act quickly and make decisions you might normally not do under different circumstances. The IFB says that if someone needs your help urgently, you should offer to contact the emergency services. If they decline, you should be wary and end any further conversation.

‘A natural paradise’: the south of France’s beautiful blue lagoon
Unknown

When I asked Nordine Nid Hsain, the owner of my favourite Parisian bistro, why he sold up and left the capital to join the arty diaspora living in the Mediterranean port of Sète, he said: “What really drew me here was not Sète itself, but the natural paradise of the adjoining Thau lagoon. I love cycling and, after 10 years here, I am still excited to go out every day to explore the bike paths that run around the lagoon.”
He added: “There’s always something new to discover – beaches; wetland landscapes; enjoying a plate of freshly harvested oysters at the water’s edge; riding through the vineyards then tasting the wine in the vigneron’s cellar.”
It sounded irresistible, and even though I have no plans to up sticks from Paris, I bought a train ticket and arrived in Sète three and half hours later to explore this hidden corner of the Mediterranean.
Although officially classed an étang (a lake), Thau is actually a sprawling lagoon, separated from the Mediterranean by the Lido, a narrow 9-mile-long beach. I based myself on the lagoon side, in the quiet port of Mèze, where my no-frills room in the affordable Hôtel du Port had a balcony overlooking a tiny harbour lined with fishing smacks and pleasure boats.
The biggest surprise about Mèze is that there are two beaches tucked away in the centre of town, perfect for an undisturbed early dip. Two minutes from the hotel, La Plagette sits beneath the medieval Chapelle des Pénitents, which glows yellow in the morning sun. On the other side of the harbour, La Pinède is a pine-clad stretch of sand, part of La Conque wetlands reserve, that hugs the banks of the lagoon, and is on the walking and cycle route that offers opportunities to spot flamingos.
Most of the countryside surrounding Thau is covered with vineyards, the lagoon waters glinting in the background. The most famous wine is Picpoul de Pinet, a crisp white that’s become popular in the UK. Pinet itself is a sleepy hamlet of wineries, and at historic Domaine Gaujal, the fifth-generation owners, Audrey and Laurent Gaujal, welcome visitors like family friends. They offer an extensive tasting, including an organic Picpoul aged in ceramic amphora, followed by a tour of the cellar, free of charge.
My last stop for the day was the ancient Roman port of Marseillan at the tip of the lagoon. Between the grand mansions and fishers’ cottages, the cobbled alleys remain untouched by modernity – a testament to the preservation of the lagoon’s natural beauty. Just by the old port stands the grand stone warehouse of Noilly Prat, where France’s famous vermouth has been produced since 1813.
Recently refurbished, it has an elegant tasting room in the cellar and a bar where locals go for after-work cocktails. An immense courtyard at the back is filled with hundreds of wooden barrels left to age their secret recipe of botanicals. Outside, the bustling quay is lined with reasonably priced seafood restaurants, such as Brasserie Galinette (mains from about €20), specialising in sea bream and cuttlefish, a perfect alfresco dinner as the sun sets over the lagoon.
The next day I headed out to Bouzigues, a fishing village that gives its name to the lagoon’s most famous oysters. The oyster fields are what mark Thau out from other wetlands – an Escher-like maze of hundreds of “tables” opposite the shore, where thousands of oysters grow.
The ostréiculteurs operate from ramshackle huts on the water’s edge, zipping back and forth in boats to their wooden cabins, many of which double up as waterside eateries.
At Le Cercle des Huîtres, Irene Salas Fernandez served some of the best oysters I have ever eaten: freshly shucked, made into a tangy ceviche, deep-fried tempura style, or baked with delicious sauces such as bourbon and smoked paprika. Fernandez and her partner Sebastian moved here from Barcelona and started farming only three years ago. I was shocked when Sebastian told me: “We only cultivate oysters today since the farming of mussels, which Bouzigues was also famous for, has almost disappeared due to global warming. The lagoon’s water is becoming too hot in summer for these fragile molluscs to survive.”
I resisted the temptation of a dip in the azure waters off Bouzigues’s beach, Plage de la Pyramide, and headed inland to Valmagne Abbey. This magnificent 11th-century monastery was deconsecrated during the French Revolution and the gothic church was transformed into a wine cellar. Today, the owners still run a vineyard, operate a farm-to-table organic restaurant and store their immense barrels of wine inside the church itself.
Before heading back to Sète station, I drove the length of the Lido’s sand dunes, which are almost deserted out of season. Parisian photographer Pierre-Emmanuel Rastoin was taking a late afternoon dip with his brother, who lives in the nearby winemaking village of Frontignan. “This is the perfect place to escape to,” he said, “as long as you avoid the summer months.”
But one of the biggest attractions of this corner of the south of France is that even in peak season – when holidaymakers descend on the campsites and caravan parks, unpacking deckchairs, cabanas and sun umbrellas – it is always possible to find a quiet, spot along this beach.
The trip was provided by the Archipel de Thau tourism office. Hôtel du Port has doubles from €65 B&B

‘It helps with loneliness’: grief, play and the power of lifelike dolls - photo essay
Unknown
Unknown Publisher

“It’s a doll,” Ineke Schmelter, 71, often says as she walks down the street with a pram and someone peers fondly under the hood, asking: “How old is the baby?” Then she pulls back the blanket and reveals the doll. She points out the craftsmanship – the little veins, the creases in the skin – and explains that it can take as many as 20 layers of paint to achieve such a lifelike finish. Sometimes, though, she can’t be bothered with the long version – the explanations, the strange looks. “As if I’m not quite right in the head.” Then she just says: “Two months,” and keeps walking.
Schmelter is one of many reborn doll lovers: dolls so realistic they are almost indistinguishable from real babies. She bought her first around four years ago, when she retired and didn’t know what to do with her free time. She had spent her whole working life with babies and children. First as a nurse in hospital, later as a maternity nurse. She missed the daily contact: the tiny grabbing hands, that warm little body in her arms. At first she mainly bought old dolls on Marktplaats and restored them, but when she saw a real reborn baby for the first time, she was hooked. She bought her first for €400 (£350) from a collector: a sleeping baby. She now has 10 dolls displayed around her home. The most expensive cost €1,200.
“I trawl charity shops looking for vintage clothes and baby bottles,” says Schmelter. “It’s often a trip down memory lane. When I dress a doll, I chat to it a little, and when I’m watching television I sometimes sit one on my lap. I don’t walk that easily any more and I really should be using a walker. But I’d rather take a little stroll behind the pram and put a doll in it. I’ve always worked very irregular hours, so I don’t have many friends now. It helps with the loneliness.”
The dolls originated in the US, where hobbyists in the 1990s began hand-modifying mass-produced dolls. Today, they have millions of enthusiasts worldwide: makers, collectors and carers who dress and cherish them. They gather in Facebook groups where they don’t just share photos or offer dolls for sale, but also exchange private stories. On TikTok and YouTube, “a day in the life” videos – in which dolls are cared for as if they were real babies – rack up hundreds of thousands of views.
According to Nicolle Lamerichs, a researcher of fan culture and lecturer at the Utrecht University of Applied Sciences, the dolls are popular because they bring together different kinds of play. “Children’s play is often mainly about storytelling, but with adults it works differently. You need multiple elements to make something appealing: creativity, role play, collecting, and a community of like-minded people. You see all of that with reborn dolls. And if you add emotion, the attraction becomes even stronger. With these dolls, that emotion is also very intimate. Some women use them as a way of remembering a child who died, or a longing for a child that never came true. In our culture, there is often little space for that darker side of motherhood – but in the Facebook groups there is.”
Prices vary widely: from a budget doll of about €300 to several thousand euros for one by a well-known artist. Everything is handmade. The head, arms and legs are usually vinyl; more expensive dolls are made of silicone. First a mould is sculpted in clay, then it is cast. After that, the doll is painted in many layers and baked. Often, real human hair is rooted into the head one strand at a time. The body is filled with glass granules so that it weighs the same as a real baby. Online, unpainted kits are also for sale – ideal for hobbyists.
Still, love for these dolls is not without its downsides. Anyone who takes a doll out on the street quickly attracts strange looks or blunt reactions. Online, enthusiasts receive hateful messages, and the hobby is often dismissed as bizarre, or even sick. In Brazil, where “a day in the life” TikTok videos now generate substantial advertising revenue, a rush has begun – to the point where some women even take their dolls to hospital and, mainly for social media, pretend they are real babies. Authorities are considering legislation, the media are full of the commotion, and many people say these women are “crazy” because they think the doll is real. For Dutch enthusiasts, this is a recognisable caricature of the hobby: an image that often ignores the genuine love people have for the dolls.
Lamerichs is not surprised. “Hobbies that are popular with women often carry less status. I’m a gamer, for example, and I have Lego – lots of people think that’s cool. But my Barbies and dolls, they find weird and childish. That’s because women’s hobbies often have a strong emotional component, and emotions are still brushed aside in our culture. Just look at how women who show emotion are still labelled hysterical. It’s deeply woven into our culture.”
The fact that reborn dolls also disturb the idealised image of motherhood and babies does not help, she says. “Motherhood is still seen as the highest achievement a woman can reach. It’s almost revered in our culture. So if you show up with a kind of ‘fake baby’, you immediately start poking at that ideal, and that makes people uncomfortable – and sometimes even angry.”
Lamerichs believes we often underestimate how important play is – not just for children, but for adults, too. “A hobby with a role-play element can help people process things. You see it in all kinds of therapy and coaching programmes. Look at the popularity of family constellation work, where you literally act out scenes from your childhood. By playing out emotions, you learn how to live with them.”
Various studies have also found that the dolls can have a positive effect on older people with dementia: among other things, they reduce aggressive and obsessive behaviour, encourage communication, and improve mood. Some psychologists also use the dolls as a form of therapy for people with, for example, an anxiety disorder or autism. Looking at the dolls triggers the release of “feelgood” chemicals in the brain, and because they feel like a real baby, holding them can be comforting – comparable to the effect of a weighted blanket.
“When I walk through the park with my doll, I sometimes take a photo and post it in a Facebook group,” says Schmelter. “Women will say: I can’t believe you dare. Lots of people are ashamed of their hobby and keep it secret. That’s such a shame. As a nurse, I sometimes saw grown men being wheeled into an operating theatre with a teddy bear in their arms. So why shouldn’t we be allowed to watch television with a doll on our lap? I’m proud of the hobby I have. The first doll I made myself, I gave to a girl I knew through the Facebook group. She desperately wanted one, but couldn’t afford it. She was so happy she named the doll after me.”

Thailand sees Lunar New Year travel boom as Chinese tourists back in droves
The country’s heavy investment in wooing Chinese visitors appears to have paid off as it overcomes safety fears to secure holiday growth
Resorts are near capacity in Pattaya, Bangkok restaurants are doing a roaring trade and the strict time slots to visit the Louis Vuitton pop-up “hotel” in the Thai capital are fully booked.
An army of Chinese influencers has been hired targeting multigenerational family groups and Gen Z travellers who shun large tours. This supports the country’s biggest ever tourism promotion campaign launched last month starring Lalisa “Lisa” Manobal, the Thai-born member of the K-pop girl group Blackpink.
While the final Lunar New Year arrivals data are yet to be released, anecdotally the investment appears to have paid off.

War update: 138 combat clashes on front line, Huliaipole sector sees fiercest battles
According to Ukrinform, the General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine reported this on Facebook, publishing operational information as of 8:00 a.m. on Sunday, February 22.
“The Defense Forces are successfully repelling attempts by the occupiers to strengthen their position and advance further into Ukrainian territory, disrupting their plans and inflicting significant losses on the enemy in terms of personnel and equipment,” the statement said.
According to the General Staff, yesterday the Russian army launched one missile and 97 air strikes, using, in particular, 280 guided aerial bombs.
The invaders also used 8,328 kamikaze drones. They fired on populated areas and Ukrainian defense positions 3,389 times, including 80 times with multiple launch rocket systems.
Enemy air strikes were carried out, in particular, on the areas of Sumy, Velykomykhailivka, Prosiana, Pysantsi, Rozivka, Hirke, Zaliznychne, Myrne, Huliaipilske, Luhivske, Charivne, Barvinivka, Liubytske, Dolynka, Komyshuvakha, Yulivka, Novoandriivka, Tavriiske, and Novooleksandrivka.
Ukrainian Rocket Forces, Artillery, and Air Force struck 15 Russian army targets in 24 hours: two command posts, three drone control posts, two command and observation posts, three areas of troop concentration, an electronic warfare station, three artillery pieces, and another important target.
One combat engagement was recorded in the Northern Slobozhanshchyna and Kursk sectors over the past day. In these areas of the front, the Russians carried out 74 shellings, including six with the use of multiple launch rocket systems, and also dropped four guided aerial bombs.
In the Southern Slobozhanshcyna sector, the Russian army attempted to break through the defensive lines in the Dvorichanske area once.
In the Kupiansk sector, the invaders attacked four times in the Pishchane area.
In the Lyman sector, Russian troops carried out six attacks, attempting to break through the defenses in the areas of Hrekivka, Stavky, Drobysheve, and Masliakivka.
In the Sloviansk sector, Ukrainian defenders stopped nine enemy attempts to advance toward Yampil, Dronivka, and Zakitne.
There were no clashes in the Kramatorsk sector.
In the Kostiantynivka sector, the Russians attacked 14 times near Kostiantynivka, Ivanopillia, Shcherbynivka, Berestok, Rusyn Yar, Sofiivka, Novopavlivka, and Pleshchiivka.
In the Pokrovsk sector, Ukrainian defenders stopped 29 enemy assaults near Shakhove, Rodynske, Pokrovsk, Udachne, Molodetske, Muravka, and Novopavlivka.
In the Oleksandrivka sector, Russian troops attacked three times in the Zaporizhzhia area.
In the Huliaipole sector, the Russians carried out 35 attacks in the areas of Huliaipole and Zaliznychne, Staroukrainka, Sviatopetrivka, Zelene, Varvarivka, Dobropillia, Zahirne, Myrne, and Hirke.
In the Orikhiv sector, the invaders attempted to improve their position in the Prymorske area once.
No combat engagements were recorded in the Prydniprovske sector.
In the Volyn and Polissia sectors, there are no signs of the formation of enemy offensive groups.
The General Staff emphasizes that systematic enemy elimination continues, with Ukrainian defenders putting up effective resistance on all sections of the front.
As reported by Ukrinform, the Defense Forces exterminated 890 Russian invaders in 24 hours.

Missiles Pound Kyiv Ahead of Russian Full-Scale Invasion Anniversary

Explosions rocked Ukraine’s capital Kyiv early on Sunday with officials warning of a ballistic missile attack, just two days before the fourth anniversary of Russia’s invasion.
AFP journalists in Kyiv heard a series of blasts starting at around 4:00 am (0200 GMT), shortly after an air raid alert was issued, with the air force later widening the alert warning nationwide citing the threat of missiles.

“The enemy is attacking the capital with ballistic weapons,” the head of Kyiv’s military administration Tymur Tkachenko said on Telegram, urging people to remain in shelters.
Kyiv Mayor Vitali Klitschko said on Telegram that two wounded people, a woman and a child, were rushed to hospitals from the suburbs.
The Ukrainian capital, regularly targeted by Russian missile and drone attacks since the start of the invasion on February 24, 2022, has faced waves of overnight strikes in recent weeks as Moscow has intensified its winter assaults on energy and military infrastructure.
Temperatures had plunged to nearly -10C when the capital was struck, with emergency services deployed across the city.
Tkachenko said the attacks had caused a fire on the roof of a residential building.
The bombardment prompted heightened vigilance across Ukraine, all the way to the western border.
Poland’s Operational Command said early Sunday it was scrambling jets after detecting “long‑range aviation of the Russian federation conducting strikes on the territory of Ukraine”.
No Illusions: What Will Really Stop the War?
It also came hours after blasts in Lviv, a western city near the Polish border that rarely sees deadly attacks.
Explosions ripped through a central shopping street at around midnight, killing a policewoman and injuring 15 people after officers responded to a reported break‑in.
“This is clearly an act of terrorism,” mayor Andriy Sadovyi said, offering no details on perpetrators.
- Ukraine ‘not losing’ -
Ukraine will mark four years since Russia’s assault on February 24, 2022, a war that has shattered towns, uprooted millions and killed large numbers on both sides.
Moscow occupies close to a fifth of Ukrainian territory and continues to grind forward in places, especially in the eastern Donbas region, despite heavy losses and repeated Ukrainian strikes on logistics.
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky told AFP on Friday that Ukraine was “definitely not losing” the war and that victory remained the goal.
He said Ukrainian forces had clawed back about 300 square kilometres (116 square miles) of territory in recent counter‑attacks, gains AFP could not immediately verify.
If confirmed, they would be Kyiv’s most significant advances since 2023.
Sweeping outages of Starlink internet terminals across the Ukraine front, shut down by owner Elon Musk following a plea from Kyiv, have enabled the push, according to Zelensky.
The United States is pushing both sides to end the war, brokering several rounds of talks since in recent weeks without a clear breakthrough.
Zelensky, under mounting pressure from Washington to consider concessions, said on X on Saturday he planned consultations with European leaders in the coming days and wanted deeper involvement from Middle Eastern states and Turkey.

TBILISI, February 2. /TASS/. Georgia imported more than 4,800 tons of liquefied propane from Russia in January 2026, a record monthly figure, according to data released by the National Statistics Service of Georgia analyzed by TASS.
Liquefied propane imports totaled 4,811.8 tons worth $2.3 mln, according to the service. This is 2.2 times more than in January 2025 and the highest figure ever for a single month. In total, Georgia purchased 39,900 tons of this raw material from Russia last year, representing a 53.2% year-on-year increase. Russia is Georgia's primary supplier of propane.
In January, Georgia imported 366.5 tons of liquefied butane worth $186 mln from Russia. Compared to January 2025, Russian butane imports decreased by 41.4%.

White House leak: Trump will strike Iran on Monday or Tuesday

ALBAWABA - John Kiriakou, an American journalist and whistleblower, said that a former CIA officer told him that U.S. President Donald Trump has decided to launch an attack on Iran on Monday or Tuesday.
Kiriakou said that his friend, who is a CIA officer, was at the White House on Friday morning and told him, "A decision has been made to attack Iran on Monday or Tuesday." He continued that Trump gave Tehran 10 days to accept the U.S. proposal to end their missile program and uranium enrichment program, in addition to ending Iran's support to groups in the Middle East, like Hamas, Hezbollah, and the Houthis.
Kiriakou, who's also a former high-ranking CIA officer, also revealed that Trump might give Iran 10 days more or less and then launch a surprise attack.
John Kiriakou quoted the source as saying that Vice President J.D. Vance and Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard are the only dissenting voices to launch an attack on Iran, while U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth and the Joint Chiefs of Staff have shown their full support for the decision.
On the other hand, Axios reported, citing senior Trump advisers that the U.S. president has not yet made up his mind regarding launching strikes against Iran. Republican Senator Lindsey Graham told the news agency on Saturday that several people around Trump are against bombing Tehran, but Graham confirmed that he is in favor of attacking Iran.
On Thursday, Trump said that he had given Iran a maximum of 15 days before Washington would take any action, warning of "bad things" if Iran did not reach an agreement on its nuclear program.
When reporters later pressed him for clarification, he added, "You'll probably find out in the next 10 days. I think that's enough time... 10 or 15 days maximum."
However, the US president did not specify a timeframe, merely reiterating his warning of "truly dire consequences" and emphasizing that "Iran will have to make a deal one way or another."

Explosions ripped through a central shopping street around 12:30 am (2230 GMT Saturday), killing a policewoman and injuring 15 people after officers responded to a reported break-in.
"This is clearly an act of terrorism," mayor Andriy Sadovyi said, offering no details on perpetrators.
Such attacks far from the front line have become more frequent over the past two years.
Four years of war
Ukraine will mark four years since Russia's assault on February 24, 2022, a withering war that has shattered towns, uprooted millions and killed large numbers on both sides.
Moscow occupies close to a fifth of Ukrainian territory and continues to grind forward in places, especially in the eastern Donbas region, despite heavy losses and repeated Ukrainian strikes on logistics.
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky told AFP on Friday that Ukraine "is definitely not losing" the war and that victory remains the goal.
He said Ukrainian forces had clawed back about 300 square kilometers (116 square miles) of territory in recent counter-attacks, gains AFP could not immediately verify.
If confirmed, they would be Kiev's most significant advances since 2023.
Sweeping outages of Starlink internet terminals across the Ukraine front, shut down by owner Elon Musk following a plea from Kiev, have enabled the push, according to Zelensky.
The bombardment also came amid a diplomatic push by Washington to end the four-year war.
Ukrainian, Russian and U.S. envoys have met several times since January, but without a breakthrough.
Zelensky, under mounting pressure from Washington to consider concessions, plans consultations with European leaders in the coming days and wants deeper involvement from Middle Eastern states and Türkiye.

Russia’s war in Ukraine outlasts Soviet war against Nazi Germany

Last month, Russia’s full-scale war with Ukraine crossed a grim, symbolic threshold: 1,418 days. It is now officially longer than the time it took the Soviet Union to defeat Nazi Germany in World War II.
For a Kremlin that frequently leans on the legacy of the "Great Patriotic War," the comparison is a sobering one. While the Red Army’s momentum eventually carried it all the way to Berlin, Moscow’s current campaign is bogged down in a gruelling struggle just to secure Ukraine’s eastern industrial heartland.
What began in February 2022 as a failed lightning strike to seize Kiev and topple the government has devolved into a static, 1,200-kilometre front of brutal trench warfare.
The cost of this deadlock has been catastrophic. With nearly 2 million soldiers estimated killed, wounded, or missing, the war has cemented its place as the bloodiest conflict on European soil since 1945.
Russia has occupied roughly 20 percent of Ukrainian territory, including Crimea, which it illegally annexed in 2014. But gains since the February 24, 2022, invasion have been slow and costly.
NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte recently compared Moscow’s advance to “the speed of a garden snail.” In the Donetsk region, Russian troops have inched forward only about 50 kilometres over the past two years in fierce battles for key strongholds.
The Washington-based Centre for Strategic and International Studies estimates Russian casualties at 1.2 million, including 325,000 killed. Ukrainian losses are estimated at up to 600,000 troops, including as many as 140,000 dead.
The think tank said Russia has suffered the highest casualty rate of any major power in a war since World War II, advancing at an average of just 70 meters a day over two years in its effort to capture transport hubs such as Pokrovsk.
Drones have reshaped the battlefield in unprecedented ways, making it nearly impossible for either side to mass troops undetected. Ukraine initially used drones to offset Russia’s advantage in firepower, but Moscow has since expanded its drone operations, including fibre-optic-tethered models that evade electronic jamming.
The combination of high-tech drone warfare and World War I-style trench fighting has forced small infantry units to infiltrate devastated towns under constant surveillance. Supplying front-line troops and evacuating the wounded has become increasingly perilous.
Russia has intensified long-range strikes on Ukraine’s energy infrastructure, causing repeated blackouts in Kiev and other cities during winter. It has also targeted power lines to fragment the national grid.
Ukraine has responded with drone and missile attacks on Russian oil refineries and military assets, sinking several warships in the Black Sea and forcing Moscow to redeploy its fleet from Crimea to Novorossiysk. In a bold operation code-named “Spiderweb,” Ukrainian drones launched from trucks struck air bases deep inside Russia, damaging long-range bombers.
US-mediated peace efforts have faltered amid sharply conflicting demands. President Vladimir Putin insists Ukraine withdraw from the four regions Moscow claims, abandon its NATO aspirations, limit its military and grant official status to the Russian language. Ukraine has rejected those terms.
President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has called for a ceasefire along current lines but refuses territorial concessions without firm security guarantees.
Both sides accuse the other of stalling negotiations. Analysts argue that beyond territory, Moscow’s broader aim is to ensure Ukraine remains within Russia’s sphere of influence.
While Western sanctions, inflation and labour shortages have strained Russia’s economy, defence production has ramped up, and key social groups have been shielded from hardship. Despite mounting costs and historically slow battlefield gains, the Kremlin appears capable of sustaining the war for now.

'It's already a Belarusian brand’: Maslenitsa festivities in full swing in Minsk

Maslenitsa week in Belarus is drawing to a close, but its most vibrant part is just gaining momentum. Drawn by the aroma of fragrant pancakes with a variety of fillings, thousands of people are flocking to the festivities despite the frosty weather. They are kept warm not only by the food but also by dancing, and there will also be chances to work up a sweat in various contests. A BelTA correspondent visited the celebration on the square near the Palace of Sports, where Minsk residents and guests are summoning a sunny spring.
Music and Belarusian songs could be heard far from the concert venue. The singing was periodically interrupted by the loud and energetic voice of the permanent host of Maslenitsa in Minsk, Maria Fedorenko. For her, this holiday means a good mood, wonderful people, and, most importantly, the imminent arrival of warm weather
“Maslenitsa is our Belarusian brand, our roots; this holiday was created by our distant ancestors. Today, it is celebrated brightly and beautifully in any city. And our guests today have a chance to test their wit, ingenuity, and all sorts of other qualities,” she said.
On 21 February, the festivities in the capital city continued until eight in the evening, with a vibrant mood created by folk bands, honored and professional groups, and popular Belarusian artists and modern hits on the theme of Maslenitsa.
The main focus of the holiday is traditional Maslenitsa cuisine, everything connected with pancakes, fluffy fritters, butter, milk, and cheese. There are six locations, each adhering to the theme. There are interactive zones: for example, at one, you need to toss a plush pastry onto a frying pan to win a prize.
“We’ve prepared Maslenitsa mazes of pancakes are hung from above, and a person must walk past them blindfolded, slipping through like butter. We’re also offering free coffee in cooperation with the Defense Ministry. You can warm up, dance, and have fun. And then there's the tradition of a mother-in-law testing her son-in-law's manliness - games where you can measure your strength, including a wooden barbell for that purpose,” he noted.
There are indeed a great many trials and entertainments: each one is tied to a specific day of Maslenitsa week. For example, on Thursday, guests are invited to go horseback riding and navigate various obstacles; at another spot, they can play “lyndy” (a type of traditional game); and on Monday, they can spin the Maslenitsa wheel and try to win a sweet lollipop. But even if you don’t win anything, it's no big deal. You'll get a large sticker with a bright sun to attach to your clothes. Some guests have a lot of such stickers, which means they've participated in almost all the contests and are having a great time.
“Experience shows that people really enjoy the holiday. Last year, Maslenitsa lasted for one day, and drew about 6,000-7,000 visitors a. It attracts people with its openness and cheerful atmosphere, thanks to the games. The contests are different each time and always adhere to the concept,” the director explained.
The main highlight of the program is, of course, the pancakes. They are baked in every stall along the long trade row. Besides the usual ones with cheese and ham, you can also find something new, for example: with salmon, fish spread, hot shashlik, or caviar. And if one pancake isn't enough, you can grab some meat and salad snacks, hot corn, potatoes, or grilled shrimps. Together, they were taking photos with animators who had arrived on a “stove”, that has small wheels underneath, dressed as Baba Yaga and other fairy-tale characters.
“Usually we organize children's contests, but today we've eaten and are having a good time. It’s especially delicious to eat hot pancakes in the cold and warm up with them. This is our first time here; the last time I was at Maslenitsa was a very long time ago, back in childhood. The atmosphere is very cool,” a girl said.Russians are also getting acquainted with Belarusian culture through Maslenitsa. For example, Oksana Shulmina, along with her husband Dmitry and son Savely, came to Minsk from Yekaterinburg. “We ended up here by chance, and we really like it. It's non-stop entertainment not only for children but also for adults. The groups are performing great; we are enjoying the holiday and feeling the Belarusian hospitality,” the guest said.
On 21 February, the festivities in the capital city continued until eight in the evening, with a vibrant mood created by folk bands, honored and professional groups, and popular Belarusian artists and modern hits on the theme of Maslenitsa.
Dmitry Sergeychuk, the principal director of the holiday, said that the main concept of the Minsk Maslenitsa was inspired by the diverse ritual foods of Belarusians. Meanwhile, we looked around and noticed other details: the stage was designed in the shape of a huge oven, and tall, brightly decorated fir trees were placed on the square. It might seem that the concept has nothing to do with spring, but that's only at first glance.
“Back in the day, in the central region of our country people used to decorate fir trees with ribbons on this day, and we decided to incorporate this into the thematic design,” Dmitry Sergeychuk explained. The main focus of the holiday is traditional Maslenitsa cuisine, everything connected with pancakes, fluffy fritters, butter, milk, and cheese. There are six locations, each adhering to the theme. There are interactive zones: for example, at one, you need to toss a plush pastry onto a frying pan to win a prize.

The celebration of spring will continue on Sunday and culminate in the burning of the effigy. This traditional ritual will help cleanse bad thoughts and let new, bright things into life.

Iran will not bow down to US pressure in nuclear talks, Pezeshkian says
Iranian president vows to stand firm as Trump threatens strikes and the US bolsters its military presence in the Gulf.
Iran’s President Masoud Pezeshkian has pledged not to fold to pressure from the United States after his American counterpart, Donald Trump, said he was considering limited strikes to force a deal on Tehran’s nuclear programme.
Pezeshkian’s comments on Saturday came amid high tensions in the Gulf, with the US continuing to grow its military presence with the deployment of two aircraft carriers and dozens of jets.

“We will not bow down in the face of any of these difficulties,” Pezeshkian said at a ceremony to honour members of the Iranian Paralympics team.
“World powers are lining up with cowardice to force us to bow our heads. Just as you did not bow down in the face of difficulties, we will not bow down in the face of these problems,” he said.
Iran and the US resumed indirect talks on Tehran’s nuclear programme in Oman earlier this month, and held a second round in Switzerland last week.
Although Washington and Tehran described the talks in overall positive terms, they failed to achieve a breakthrough.
Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi said on Friday that a diplomatic solution appeared within “our reach” and that his country was planning to finalise a draft deal in “the next two to three days” to send to Washington.
Crossroads
Al Jazeera’s Tohid Asadi, reporting from Tehran, said the two countries appear to be at a “crossroads once again” and that residents of the Iranian capital were watching closely for signs of diplomatic progress.
“How can anyone not worry about war?” one woman told Al Jazeera. “Even if we don’t worry about ourselves, we worry about our children’s future.”
A businessman said he believed military confrontation was eventually inevitable “because what the Americans want is surrender, and the Iranian state won’t accept that”.
“If that happens, conditions will become even harder – business is already slow,” he added.
Another man was more optimistic.
“The US knows it can’t overpower Iran,” he said. “The US hasn’t truly won a war in any country, say Afghanistan, Iraq or Vietnam. In the end, it will bow to Iran. People shouldn’t worry.”
Iran and the US engaged in nuclear talks last year, too, but the effort collapsed when Israel launched attacks on the country, triggering a 12-day war. The US joined in by bombing three Iranian nuclear sites at Fordow, Natanz and Isfahan.
Trump issued new threats of military action in January following a deadly Iranian crackdown on antigovernment protesters. Tehran responded by threatening to strike US military bases in the region and warning that it could close the Strait of Hormuz, a vital waterway for oil exports for the Gulf Arab states.
Greatest air power since 2003
According to the US media, the airpower Washington is amassing in the region is the greatest since its invasion of Iraq in 2003. In the past few days, Washington has deployed more than 120 aircraft to the Middle East, while the world’s largest aircraft carrier, the USS Gerald R Ford, is on its way to join the USS Abraham Lincoln carrier strike group already positioned in the Arabian Sea.
Iran emphasised in a letter to the United Nations Security Council on Friday that the build-up “must not be treated as mere rhetoric”.
Although Iran is not seeking “tension or war and will not initiate a war”, any US aggression will be responded to “decisively and proportionately”, the letter added.
The letter came after Trump claimed on Thursday during his inaugural Board of Peace meeting that “bad things will happen” without a “meaningful deal”.
Clarifying his remarks on Air Force One later that day, Trump said Iran had “10, 15 days, pretty much, maximum”.
On Friday, in response to a reporter’s question on whether the US could take limited military action as the countries negotiate, Trump said, “I guess I can say I am considering that.” A few hours later, he told reporters that Iran “better negotiate a fair deal”.
Fears of a regional conflict have prompted countries including Sweden, Serbia, Poland and Australia to advise their citizens in Iran to leave the country.

Hungary will block the European Union's next package of sanctions against Russia, its foreign minister said on Sunday, until Ukraine resumes shipments of Russian oil to Hungary and Slovakia via the Druzhba pipeline, which has been cut off since January 27 after being damaged by a Russian drone, according to Kyiv. Follow our liveblog for the latest developments.
Watch: Russian launches missile barrage on Ukraine's energy facilities
Russia fired scores of missiles and drones at targets across Ukraine on Sunday, crashing into energy and rail infrastructure and residential buildings, just two days before the fourth anniversary of Moscow's all-out invasion. The capital Kyiv, regularly targeted by Russian missile and drone attacks since the start of the full-scale invasion, has faced waves of overnight strikes in recent weeks as Moscow has intensified assaults amid freezing winter temperatures.
Putin's record in Ukraine, "a resounding and humiliating failure", says French foreign minister
The record of Russian President Vladimir Putin is "a resounding and humiliating failure" after four years of conflict, French foreign minister Jean-Noël Barrot said on Sunday.
"The Ukrainian army has just liberated 300 square kilometers in a gesture of incredible panache and courage. Let us realize that after four years, Vladimir Putin's record is a resounding and humiliating failure," said Barrot in an interview.
Hungary says it will block EU's latest package of sanctions on Russia
Hungary will block the European Union's latest package of sanctions against Russia unless Ukraine re-opens a key oil pipeline that supplies the country, Hungary's prime minister and foreign minister both said Sunday.
"No support for sanctions; the 20th sanctions package will be rejected," Prime Minister Viktor Orban posted on X.
"Until Ukraine resumes oil transit to Hungary and Slovakia via the Druzhba pipeline, we will not allow decisions important to Kyiv to move forward," Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto posted, also on X.
Ukraine says the Druzhba pipeline that crosses its territory to deliver Russian oil to Slovakia and Hungary was damaged January 27 by Russian strikes.
Pope says Ukraine peace 'cannot be postponed'
Peace in Ukraine is "an urgent necessity", said Pope Leo XIV on Sunday ahead of the fourth anniversary of Russia's full-scale invasion.
"Peace cannot be postponed. It is an urgent necessity that must find space in hearts and be translated into responsible decisions," he said in his regular Sunday address to a crowd in St Peter's Square.
"I strongly renew my appeal: may the weapons fall silent, may the bombings cease, may a ceasefire be reached without delay, and may dialogue be strengthened to open the way to peace," the American-born pontiff said.
Russia targets Ukraine's energy infrastructure in drone strikes
Russia attacked Ukraine with dozens of strike drones and ballistic and cruise missiles, focusing on energy infrastructure and killing at least one person, the Ukrainian military and local officials said on Sunday. Reporting from Kramatorsk, FRANCE 24’s Gulliver Cragg said the strikes on the city appeared to have been unsuccessful, as no power cuts had been reported so far.
Russia launched 50 missiles, 297 drones at Ukraine overnight, Kyiv's air force says
Russia launched 50 missile and 297 drones in overnight attacks against Ukraine, Ukraine's air force said on Sunday.
Air defence units shot down or neutralised 33 missiles and 274 drones, the air force said in a post on Telegram.
Police officer killed, 24 people injured in bombs explosions in Lviv
One police officer was killed and 24 other people were injured after several explosive devices detonated at midnight in Lviv in western Ukraine, the National Police said on Sunday.
"It has been preliminarily established that homemade explosive devices detonated," the police said on the Telegram messaging service.
The police said that the first explosion occurred after a patrol crew arrived at the suspected scene of a shop break-in, while the second explosion occurred a little later.
The mayor of Lviv, Andriy Sadovyi, called the incident a terrorist act.
Overnight strikes target energy infrastructure in Odesa, central Ukraine
Overnight Russian strikes also hit the Black Sea port Odesa and central Ukraine, said Ukrainian officials.
Odesa Governor Oleh Kiper wrote on Telegram that a drone attack on the energy infrastructure of the region caused fires that had been extinguished.
Russia attacks the Ukrainian energy system almost daily, striking thermal power plants and electrical substations.
Attacks on power stations, the energy transmission system and the gas sector are important elements of the full-scale invasion of Ukraine launched by Russia in February 2022. Moscow says it is seeking to undermine Ukraine's ability to fight.
Russian missiles, drones strike Kyiv
Russia attacked Ukraine with dozens of strike drones and ballistic and cruise missiles, focusing on energy infrastructure, the Ukrainian military and local officials said on Sunday.
At least one person was injured in the Kyiv region, with damage reported in five districts where more than a dozen houses were damaged, regional Governor Mykola Kalashnyk said on the Telegram messaging app.

A democratic Iran could become Israel's ally, regional power

Governments across the Middle East are watching developments in Iran with mounting unease. The threat of a regional war is not the only issue, nor is the Iranian regime's threats to attack US sites and forces.
Two main scenarios worry the Arab states. The first is large scale chaos and civil war inside Iran, with spillover effects across the region. Such instability could trigger waves of refugees and disrupt shipping lanes in the Persian Gulf, a vital artery for Gulf economies.
The second scenario, seen by Israel the as optimistic one, is the rapid collapse of the Islamic Republic and the rise of a pro Western government in Tehran. Over time, that could transform Iran into a rising regional power.
"In the end, Arab states want the Islamic Republic to remain," an Iranian exile told Israel Hayom. "They fear a free Iran in the future, because they know that a free and democratic Iran would become Israel's first ally in the Middle East. Their double game or the Muslim Brotherhood project would no longer have buyers."
The exile argued that the regime's threats should be put in proportion. "The Islamic Republic's ultimate power lies in threats. These are empty threats of disrupting regional order for days and harming the economy and livelihoods of billions. That is why any blow to the Islamic Republic must be severe and effective, until it falls. Otherwise the regime will become bolder and more dangerous than before."
Against this backdrop, the strategy of most Arab states becomes clearer: embrace the regime diplomatically, while assisting mediation efforts with the US.
Egypt
The head of Iran's Interests Section in Cairo, Mojtaba Ferdowsi-Pour, issued a dramatic statement Friday announcing that a final decision had been made to exchange ambassadors between Iran and Egypt, with only a formal declaration pending. If implemented, the move would fully restore relations severed after the 1979 Islamic Revolution.
Although lower level diplomatic channels have existed over the years, the announcement signals warming ties from the Egyptian side, which seeks to distance itself from a regional confrontation. The previous regional flare up following the war against the Hamas terrorist organization in Gaza led to disruptions in the Suez Canal and heavy financial losses for Egypt. Cairo has no interest in renewed Houthi attacks in the Red Sea.
Qatar
The Gulf emirate, which hosts terrorist organizations, has much to lose from a war with Iran. The Al Udeid Air Base on its territory hosts thousands of US troops. Instability in the Persian Gulf could also damage its economy, which relies heavily on gas exports shipped by sea.
Qatar is therefore operating on two tracks. Diplomatically, it is passing messages between Iran and the US in an effort to preserve negotiations aimed at preventing war. Over the weekend, Qatari Foreign Minister Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani conveyed a message to his Iranian counterpart Abbas Araghchi that talks were "still ongoing."
Militarily, Qatar is relying on US defense systems being deployed to the region, in addition to American made systems it already possesses.
Saudi Arabia
The kingdom is increasing coordination with Iran in hopes of preventing an attack on US forces stationed on Saudi soil. On the sidelines of an international naval exercise in India, Milan 2026, a trilateral meeting was reportedly held between senior naval officials from Saudi Arabia and Iran. Discussions focused on improving maritime cooperation, including combating piracy, securing shipping lanes and crisis management.
This follows talks several weeks ago between Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman and Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian. The crown prince reportedly delivered conciliatory messages and pledged that he "would not allow any action from his territory."
Oman
The sultanate has emerged as the most significant Gulf mediator between Iran and the US. After the latest round of talks in Geneva, Omani Foreign Minister Badr Albusaidi said progress had been made and that the atmosphere was constructive. Still, it remains unclear whether Oman will succeed this time.
Diplomatic sources aligned with Iran said the US side raised the issues of ballistic missiles and regional involvement, while the Iranian delegation insisted on focusing solely on the nuclear file. According to a report in Al Akhbar, US envoy Steve Witkoff warned the Iranians that such insistence "would not be to their benefit."
United Arab Emirates
Officials in Abu Dhabi, like others in the region, have made clear they will not allow any attack on Iran to be launched from their territory, possibly in the hope that the regime in the Islamic Republic will limit its response. There is also concern about the economic impact of a regional conflict on the federation.
According to Reuters, stock markets in the UAE already fell Friday after investors reacted to a US ultimatum demanding that Iran reach an agreement within days or "suffer." At the same time, Emirati commentators argue that Tehran has lost most of its leverage and is at a dead end.
Kuwait
The emirate has also expressed concern. Earlier this month, senior Kuwaiti politician Abdullah al-Nafisi questioned why negotiations between Iran and the US could not be direct. "Wouldn't that be faster and avoid the tensions associated with indirect talks?" he asked. On another occasion, he predicted the talks would fail because President Donald Trump views the Iranian issue as the only solution to his "domestic problems."
Iraq
Amid the regional turmoil, Baghdad appears mired in political gridlock. The pro Iranian Shiite bloc had intended to nominate Nouri al-Maliki for prime minister. However, the US and various Iraqi actors quickly voiced opposition to a candidate seen as close to Tehran. As a result, alternative, less controversial names are now reportedly under consideration.
A US strike on Iran could plunge Iraq into chaos due to Shiite militias loyal to the Iranian regime. However, in January 2026 the US completed its withdrawal from its last major base in Iraq, Ain al-Asad. That development narrows the range of potential targets available to Tehran.

Trump hikes US global tariff rate to 15 pct

President Donald Trump raised the global duty on imports into the United States to 15 percent on Saturday, doubling down on his promise to maintain his aggressive tariff policy a day after the Supreme Court ruled much of it illegal.
Trump said on his Truth Social platform that after a thorough review of Friday's "extraordinarily anti-American decision" by the court to rein in his tariff program, the administration was hiking the import levies "to the fully allowed, and legally tested, 15% level."
Shortly after the court's 6-3 ruling that rejected the president's authority to impose tariffs under a 1977 economic emergency powers act, Trump had initially announced a new 10 percent global levy by invoking a different legal avenue.
At the same time, the Republican launched an extraordinary personal attack on the conservative justices who had sided with the majority, slamming their "disloyalty" and calling them "fools and lap dogs."
The ruling was a stunning rebuke by the high court, which has largely sided with the president since he returned to office, and marked a major political setback in striking down Trump's signature economic policy that has roiled the global trade order.
Saturday's announcement is sure to provoke further uncertainty as Trump carries on with a trade war that he has used to cajole and punish countries, both friend and foe.
It is the latest move in a process that has seen a multitude of tariff levels for countries sending goods into the United States set and then altered or revoked by Trump's team over the past year.
The new duty by law is only temporary — allowable for 150 days. According to a White House fact sheet, exemptions remain for sectors that are under separate probes, including pharma, and goods entering the U.S. under the U.S.-Mexico-Canada agreement.
On Friday, the White House said U.S. trading partners that reached separate tariff deals with Trump's administration would also face the new global tariff.
High court defeat
Friday's court ruling did not impact sector-specific duties Trump separately imposed on steel, aluminum and various other goods. Government probes still under way could lead to additional sectoral tariffs.
But it nevertheless marked Trump's biggest defeat at the Supreme Court since returning to the White House 13 months ago. The court has generally expanded his power.
Trump heaped praise on the conservative justices who voted to uphold his authority to levy tariffs — Clarence Thomas, Samuel Alito and Brett Kavanaugh, a Trump nominee — thanking them "for their strength and wisdom, and love of our country."
The president alleged the majority of six justices, including two nominated during his first term, had been "swayed by foreign interests."
"I think that foreign interests are represented by people that I believe have undue influence," he said.
Shares on Wall Street — a metric closely watched by Trump — rose modestly Friday after the decision, which had been expected.
Business groups largely cheered the ruling, with the National Retail Federation saying this "provides much-needed certainty" for companies.
In court arguments, the Trump administration said companies would receive refunds if the tariffs were deemed unlawful. But the Supreme Court's ruling did not address the issue.
Trump said he expected years of litigation on whether to provide refunds. Kavanaugh noted the refund process could be a "mess."
Several countries have said they are studying the Supreme Court ruling and Trump's subsequent tariff announcements.
German Chancellor Friedrich Merz said Saturday he would hold talks with European allies to formulate "a very clear European position" and joint response to Washington before he travels to the U.S. capital in early March.
On the domestic front, Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro, a Democrat, said on X it was time for Trump to "listen to the Supreme Court, end chaotic tariffs, and stop wreaking havoc on our farmers, small business owners, and families."

Russian missile barrage hits energy, railways across Ukraine

KYIV – Russia fired scores of missiles and drones at targets across Ukraine on Feb 22, crashing into energy and rail infrastructure and residential buildings, just two days before the fourth anniversary of Russia’s invasion
AFP journalists in Kyiv heard a series of blasts starting at around 4am (10am Singapore time), shortly after an air raid alert was issued, with the air force later widening the alert warning nationwide, citing the threat of missiles.
“Moscow continues to invest in strikes more than in diplomacy,” Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky commented on the attack on social media, saying that Russia launched about 50 missiles and 300 drones overnight.
“The main target of the attack was the energy sector. Ordinary residential buildings were also damaged, and there is damage to the railway,” he said.
One man was killed and a dozen more people were wounded, among them four children, in and around Kyiv, Ukraine’s national police said.
Rescuers sifted through debris of a largely destroyed two-storey house in Sofiivska Borshchagivka in the Kyiv region.
Temperatures plunged to nearly minus 10 deg C when the capital was struck, with emergency services deployed across the city.
The Ukrainian capital, regularly targeted by Russian missile and drone attacks since the start of the invasion on Feb 24, 2022
The Russian army said it carried out a mass strike targeting facilities used by Ukraine’s military, saying all targets were hit, in a standard comment for such attacks.
The authorities in Russia’s western Belgorod region said one man died after a Ukrainian drone strike.
‘Act of terrorism’
The bombardment, which included ballistic and cruise missiles, prompted heightened vigilance across Ukraine, all the way to the western border.
Ukraine’s Energy Ministry said consumers in six eastern and south-eastern regions were without power after the strikes.
Poland’s Operational Command said early on Feb 22 it was scrambling jets after detecting “long-range aviation of the Russian federation conducting strikes on the territory of Ukraine”.
In a separate attack, an explosion rocked a store in central Lviv, a western city near the Polish border far from the front line that is largely spared the worst of the conflict.
Explosions ripped through a central shopping street at around midnight, killing a policewoman and wounding 25 people after officers responded to a reported break-in.
Hours later, law enforcement said it detained a Ukrainian woman suspected of carrying out the bombing, without giving more details and saying that a probe was ongoing.
“This is clearly an act of terrorism,” Mayor Andriy Sadovyi said, offering no details on perpetrators.
Ukraine ‘not losing’
Ukraine will mark four years since Russia’s assault on Feb 24, 2022, a war that has shattered towns, uprooted millions and killed large numbers on both sides.
Moscow occupies close to a fifth of Ukrainian territory and continues to grind forward in places, especially in the eastern Donbas region, despite heavy losses and repeated Ukrainian strikes on logistics.
Mr Zelensky said on Feb 20 that Ukraine was “definitely not losing” the war and that victory remained the goal. He said Ukrainian forces had clawed back about 300 sq km of territory in recent counter-attacks, gains AFP could not immediately verify. If confirmed, they would be Kyiv’s most significant advances since 2023.
Sweeping outages of Starlink internet terminals across the Ukraine front, shut down by owner Elon Musk following a plea from Kyiv, have enabled the push, according to Mr Zelensky.
The United States is pushing both sides to end the war, brokering several rounds of talks since in recent weeks without a clear breakthrough.
Mr Zelensky, under mounting pressure from Washington to consider concessions, said on X on Feb 21 he planned consultations with European leaders in the coming days and wanted deeper involvement from Middle Eastern states and Turkey. AFP

Around 2,000 people marched in Paris on Saturday to show their support for Ukraine, police estimated, just days before the fourth anniversary of Russia’s invasion.
Demonstrators marching through the French capital chanted: “We support Ukraine against Putin, who is killing it”, and “Frozen Russian assets must be confiscated, they belong to Ukraine”.

“In public opinion, there is massive support for Ukraine that has not wavered since the first day of the full-scale invasion” by the Russian army on Feb. 24, 2022, European Parliament member Raphael Glucksmann, told AFP.
“On the other hand, in the French political class, sounds of giving up are starting to emerge. On both the far left and the far right, voices of capitulation are getting louder and louder,” he added.
Police estimated around 2,000 people joined the demonstration.
Among those marching, Irina Kryvosheia, a Ukrainian who arrived in France several years ago, “thanked with all her heart the people present”.
UK Should Send Non-Combat Troops to Ukraine ‘Now’ – Boris Johnson
She said they reminded “everyone that what has been happening for four years is not normal, it is not right”.
Kryvosheia said she remained in daily contact with her parents in Kyiv, who told her how they were deprived “for several days” of heating, electricity, and running water following intense bombardments by the Russian army.
Francois Grunewald, head of the “Comité d’Aide Médicale Ukraine”, had just returned from a one-month mission in the country, during which the humanitarian organization had delivered around 40 generators since the beginning of the year.
Russia’s full-scale invasion sent shock waves around the world and triggered the bloodiest and most destructive conflict in Europe since World War II.
The war has killed tens of thousands of civilians and hundreds of thousands of military personnel on both sides. Millions of refugees have fled Ukraine, where vast areas have been devastated by fighting.
Russia occupies nearly 20 percent of Ukrainian territory, and its heavy attacks on the country’s energy sites have sparked a major energy crisis.

Pakistan launches deadly strikes in Afghanistan

Pakistan said Sunday it launched multiple air strikes targeting militants in neighbouring Afghanistan, where the government reported children were among dozens of people killed and wounded.
The overnight attacks were the most extensive since border clashes in October killed more than 70 people on both sides and wounded hundreds.
Islamabad said it hit seven sites along the border region targeting Afghanistan-based militant groups "in the aftermath of recent suicide bombing incidents in Pakistan".
The military targeted the Pakistani Taliban and its associates, as well as an affiliate of the ISIL group, a statement by the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting said.
Afghanistan's defence ministry said "dozens of innocent civilians, including women and children, were martyred and wounded" when strikes hit a madrasa and homes in Nangarhar and Paktika provinces.
An AFP journalist in Nangarhar's Bihsud district said residents from around the remote and mountainous area joined rescuers in one village, using a digger and shovels to search for bodies under the rubble.
"People here are ordinary people. The residents of this village are our relatives. When the bombing happened, one person who survived was shouting for help," said neighbour Amin Gul Amin, 37.
Nangarhar police told AFP the bombardment started at around midnight and hit three districts.
"Civilians were killed. In one house, there were 23 family members. Five wounded people were taken out," said police spokesperson Sayed Tayeeb Hammad.
'Calculated response'
Afghanistan's defense ministry said it will "deliver an appropriate and calculated response" to the Pakistani strikes.
The two countries have been locked in an increasingly bitter dispute since the Taliban authorities retook control of Afghanistan in 2021.
Pakistani military action killed 70 Afghan civilians between October and December, according to the UN mission in Afghanistan.
Several rounds of negotiations followed an initial ceasefire brokered by Qatar and Turkey, but they have failed to produce a lasting agreement.
Saudi Arabia intervened this month, mediating the release of three Pakistani soldiers captured by Afghanistan in October.
The deteriorating relationship has hit people in both countries, with the land border largely shut for months.
Pakistan said Sunday that despite repeated urging by Islamabad, the Taliban authorities have failed to act against militant groups using Afghan territory to carry out attacks in Pakistan.
The Afghan government has denied harbouring militants.
Islamabad launched the strikes after a suicide blast at a Shiite mosque in Islamabad two weeks ago and other such attacks more recently in northwestern Pakistan.
The ISIL group had claimed responsibility for the mosque bombing, which killed at least 40 people and wounded more than 160 in the deadliest attack in Islamabad since 2008.
The militant group's regional chapter, Islamic State-Khorasan, also claimed a deadly suicide bombing at a Kabul restaurant last month.

Burke reveals process has begun to ban Islamist group Hizb ut-Tahrir

In brief
- Burke said his department had received advice from ASIO that the group met the legal threshold to be banned.
- Established in 1953, Hizb ut-Tahrir is an Islamic political organisation with chapters around the world.
The federal government has begun the process of banning Islamist group Hizb ut-Tahrir under new hate group laws, Home Affairs Minister Tony Burke has revealed.
Speaking on ABC's Insiders program on Sunday, Burke said his department had received advice from the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation that the group met the legal threshold to be banned.
Under hate group laws introduced after the Bondi Beach terror attack, a new legal framework was established that allows the home affairs minister to ban groups found to be engaging in or advocating hate crimes based on race, nationality or ethnic origin.
Burke said his department would now prepare a briefing to satisfy him that the radical cleric group increased the risk of hate-motivated violence.
The opposition leader would then be briefed before the attorney-general signed off on the laws.
"This is the first time we have been able to ban, potentially, a group which falls short of a terrorist listing," he said.
"It says you don't have to be specifically calling for, but you do have to be acting in a way that increases the risk of communal violence or politically-motivated violence."
The federal government announced in December that the laws were intended to target "hate preachers". They named Hizb ut-Tahrir and the National Socialist Network, a neo-Nazi group that disbanded in January, as organisations it wanted banned.
Established in 1953, Hizb ut-Tahrir is an Islamic political organisation with chapters around the world. Its name translates to "Party of Liberation".
The organisation is banned in several countries, including in the United Kingdom, Germany, Egypt, Turkey, China and several countries in Central Asia.

Brazil's Lula calls for equality as Trump faces court tariff setback

Brazil's President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva on Sunday urged Donald Trump to treat all countries equally after the US leader imposed a 15 percent tariff on imports following an adverse Supreme Court ruling.
"I want to tell the US President Donald Trump that we don't want a new Cold War. We don't want interference in any other country, we want all countries to be treated equally," Lula told reporters in New Delhi.
The conservative-majority Supreme Court on Friday ruled six to three that a 1977 law Trump has relied on to slap sudden levies on individual countries, upending global trade, "does not authorise the President to impose tariffs".
Lula said he would not like to react to Supreme Court decisions of another country, but hoped that Brazil's relations with the United States "will go back to normalcy" soon.
The veteran leftist Brazilian leader is expected to travel to Washington next month for a meeting with Trump.
"I am convinced that Brazil-US relations will go back to normalcy after our conversation," Lula, 80, said, adding Brazil only wanted to "live in peace, generate jobs, and improve lives of our people".
Ties between Brazil and the United States appear to be on the mend after months of animosity between Washington and Brasilia.
As a result, Trump's administration has exempted key Brazilian exports from 40 percent tariffs imposed on the South American country last year.
"The world doesn't need more turbulence, it needs peace," said Lula, who arrived in India on Wednesday to attend a summit on artificial intelligence.
On Saturday, India and Brazil agreed to boost cooperation on critical minerals and rare earths and signed a raft of other deals after a meeting between Lula and Prime Minister Narendra Modi.

The heavy toll of the Iran mission on USS Gerald R Ford

One sailor missed the death of his great grandfather. Another is considering leaving the Navy after spending nearly a year away from her toddler daughter. Two others said problems were discovered in the ship's sewage system. Behind the geopolitical headlines surrounding the arrival of the USS Gerald R. Ford in the Middle East lies a crew that has not seen home for months.
President Donald Trump decided to extend once again the deployment of the Ford's crew, a move that is exacting a steep personal price from sailors and their families. In interviews with The Wall Street Journal, some spoke of their longing for home and of milestones that will never be reclaimed.
The Ford, the largest warship in the US fleet, has been at sea since June last year. In October, the War Department redirected it from a planned Caribbean mission to the Middle East. The carrier had previously been part of the support infrastructure for a special operation aimed at capturing former Venezuelan president Nicolas Maduro. Earlier this year, the crew was informed that their deployment would be extended again and that they would be sent back to the Middle East in case a US airstrike against Iran is carried out.
In peacetime, aircraft carrier deployments typically last six months, with planners leaving several additional months of flexibility in case of unforeseen developments, retired Rear Adm. Mark Montgomery told the Journal. The USS Gerald R. Ford's sailors have already been away from home for eight months, and the deployment could stretch to 11 months. If that happens, it would break the US Navy's record for the longest continuous carrier deployment.
The US Navy operates 11 aircraft carriers, all functioning according to schedules planned long in advance. At any given time, some are deployed to different regions around the world, others are engaged in training and others are undergoing maintenance. In addition to the Ford, the USS Abraham Lincoln and its strike group have also been dispatched to the Middle East.
One female sailor aboard the Ford told the Journal that many crew members feel anger and frustration, and some have said they intend to leave the service once the deployment ends. She herself is seriously considering doing so. She misses her daughter, but above all, she said, the uncertainty over when she will be able to return home is the most painful part.
Extended deployments can mean missing birthdays, weddings, funerals or even the birth of a child.
Not all members of the roughly 5,000 strong crew accept the sacrifice without reservation. Many of the sailors aboard the Ford are in their early twenties and miss their parents and home cooked meals. Others are parents themselves. They try to stay in touch through phone calls and WhatsApp messages, but the secrecy surrounding aircraft carrier movements means communication is often sporadic and unpredictable.
Some sailors see prolonged periods away from home as an integral part of military service. One told the Journal that although the extension was difficult and fatigue is evident throughout the ship, every sailor knew what they were signing up for when they enlisted. Their mission, he said, is to ensure that war does not reach the home front, and that sometimes requires long and demanding deployments.
If anyone feels the strain acutely, it is those left behind. Rozrin McGee, whose husband is serving aboard the Ford, said she has been alone for eight months while he remains at sea. Communication is sporadic and fragmented. She regularly sends him letters and small care packages containing snacks and items to remind him of the home awaiting his return. "When I heard that Donald Trump had decided to extend the crew's deployment, my heart broke," she said.
The Ford is the newest aircraft carrier in the US Navy and the first built in the Ford class. It entered service in 2022 and first saw operational activity when it sailed to the Mediterranean to help protect Israel following the October 7 Hamas terrorist attack. Compared with the previous Nimitz class, Ford class carriers can sustain a much higher sortie rate, operate with a smaller crew and rely on significantly greater automation for launching and maintaining aircraft.
The Gerald R. Ford leads a task force that includes missile destroyers and cruisers capable of firing dozens of cruise missiles at targets hundreds of kilometers away and intercepting ballistic missiles, drones and cruise missiles with high precision. These ships could provide an additional layer of defense against Iran's missile capabilities.

Fact check: Are China's robot soldiers just AI fakes?
February 22, 2026A dozen humanoid robots stand in front of a snow-covered mountain range. They hold machine guns and run across a shooting range, kneeling down to shoot at targets and change magazines, then maneuvering through an obstacle course.
The setting for these scenes in a 48-second video currently circulating on social media is supposedly China, with the national flag flying in the background. But is it real?
Claim: "China has released a video of shooting drills involving Terminator-like robots," says a post on X that has been viewed 375,000 times. Another poststates: "China deployed 10,000+ robotic soldiers that will reduce the human cost if China-Taiwan war breakouts in 2027." Still other posts refer to the video as a "Unitree Robotics robot shooting test," including one on X with more than 1.5 million views. The video has been shared with similar claims in many other languages, including Arabic, French, Russian, Spanish, Turkish, Portuguese, Georgian, and Vietnamese.
DW Fact Check: Fake
The robots in the video are based on the G1 model by Chinese company Unitree Robotics. But the scenes were clearly created using artificial intelligence. While some users have at least suggested that the video could be AI-generated, they have continued to post it with false claims.
Using a reverse image search of a still image from the video, DW Fact Check found a higher-resolution, slightly shorter version on YouTube that reveals more details. Frame-by-frame analysis revealed several AI-typical inconsistencies that could not have been created in the editing process.
- In the middle of the video, a robot reloads a magazine. Two seconds later, the magazine has disappeared without a trace under the rifle barrel.
- A person can be seen giving a shooting order while holding a radio in one hand. When he raises his hand, it merges with the device to form a single mass.
- Two cars in the background are deformed and appear to be fused together.
- A robot moves through a stack of sandbags like a ghost, without stepping over them.
- The lettering on the robot's chest disappears repeatedly and only partially resembles the company name "Unitree" where it typically appears on the real G1 model.
Philipp Cachee, an expert in forensic ballistics, also points out logical errors in the video. "There is no shell ejection in at least two places, and at 0:23, an empty magazine is loaded into the weapon," he said, concluding that it is "almost certainly" an AI-generated video.
The video is in fact labeled as such on on Bilibili, a video platform popular in China where it has also been uploaded.
Dancing robots
Unitree Robotics specializes in the development and production of four-legged and humanoid robots. DW contacted the company about the video, but these questions remained unanswered at the time of publication.
On its English website, the company states that it is known for its civilian robots. Unitree's social media profiles also highlight the complex movements its robots can now master, including dancing, martial arts, and moving through rough terrain.
The company was recently in the media after its robots performed a choreographed routine at a Chinese New Year gala, showing off somersaults and kung fu tricks.
While there has been no recent mention of weapons or military use on the company's profiles, that doesn't rule out the possibility that such tests could be underway. Nevertheless, the AI video being circulated does not portray a real exercise with Unitree robots.
A similar video makes a stir
Another video has also recently spread on social media worldwide, this time showing shooting exercises by humanoid robots, together with four-legged robots among ruined houses.
Claim: "ITS REAL!!! Chinese Unitree humanoids are now firing Type 191 Rifles!" claims a user on X, in a post viewed more than 680,000 times in less than a day. "Training kung fu robots to use weapons," writes another. In French, a Facebook user shared both videos at the same time, emphasizing that they are not AI. The video has also been shared in Spanish, Arabic, Turkish, and Korean — all without any reference to AI.
DW Fact Check: Fake
The video bears a watermark that leads back to the Bilibili platform, where it was posted by the same user who shared the first video with the note: "Tactical assault exercise by a Unitree robot squad, AI-generated, video content is for entertainment purposes only."
A close look at this video also shows inconsistencies that suggest AI. A target being shot at appears out of nowhere at 0:33, and at 0:38, one of the robots pulls a leg through the solid fence while jumping over it.
This video was edited before it was distributed on other networks. A logo and text elements were added to make it look like a television report by state channel CCTV Military. But the logo is missing characters.
The text added at the bottom of the video announces: "Expert analysis — Military report: New high-tech 'companions' in action! Visit to the tactical training ground for human-machine cooperation." While this may make sense, the text inserted on the video continues with a jumble of keywords, which is unusual for a real media report.
Robots join civic life
Even if these videos of shooting robots are AI-generated, China is still on the way to using humanoid robots in everyday life, including in the support security forces.
Just under a year ago, the state-run English-language Chinese broadcaster CGTN reported that a humanoid robot was patrolling the city of Shenzhen alongside police officers. In several major Chinese cities, such as Wuhan and Shanghai, such robots are already controlling traffic or being trained to do so.

ALBAWABA - Pakistan confirmed carrying out airstrikes on Afghanistan, targeting locations of Pakistani militants, which Islamabad blames for recent attacks inside the country, AP reported on Sunday.
Pakistan did not specify which areas the strikes were carried out in or provide any other details. However, Afghan reports said that the attacks hit the Ghani Khelo and Garda Samia districts inside Afghanistan, killing at least 17 civilians.
In addition, Afghan government spokesperson Zabihullah Mujahid revealed in a post on X that a strike was carried out by Pakistan, targeting civilians in Nangarhar and Paktika provinces. The Afghan official said that the attack led to the killing and injuring of dozens of people, including women and children.
In addition, Afghanistan's Ministry of Defense said in a statement, "Continuing the previous aggressions, the Pakistani military regime has once again launched airstrikes on several civilian areas in the provinces of Nangarhar and Paktika, targeting (a religious school and a number of civilian homes), resulting in the martyrdom and injury of dozens of innocent civilians, including women and children."
It added, "The Ministry of National Defense strongly condemns this flagrant violation of Afghanistan's sovereignty and this crime in the strongest terms, and considers it a clear breach of international laws and principles of good neighborliness and Islamic values..."

Homeland security to suspend TSA PreCheck and Global Entry airport security programs

15:23:53 KST

The Department of Homeland Security partially reversed course Sunday morning on an order that had suspended the TSA PreCheck and Global Entry airport security programs as a result of staffing shortages caused by the partial government shutdown.
“TSA PreCheck remains operational with no change for the traveling public,” the Transportation Security Administration said in a social media post. “As staffing constraints arise, TSA will evaluate on a case by case basis and adjust operations accordingly.”
A DHS official told the Washington Post that Global Entry would remain halted. The reversal was “based off of conversations the secretary had with the White House and TSA,” the official said.
TSA PreCheck and Global Entry are popular programs that give approved participants a fast-track through bag check and passport control.
The reversal came after air transport groups voiced their opposition to program closures. TSA PreCheck has around 20m enrolled users; and Global Entry is used by over 10 million pre-approved, low-risk, international travelers, including US citizens and green card holders.
Chris Sununu, president and CEO of the trade association Airlines for America, said in a statement that the group “is deeply concerned that TSA PreCheck and Global Entry programs are being suspended and that the traveling public will be, once again, used as a political football amid another government shutdown”.
“The announcement was issued with extremely short notice to travelers, giving them little time to plan accordingly, which is especially troubling at this time of record air travel,” he added.
Geoff Freeman, head of the US Travel Association, accused Democratic and Republican lawmakers of putting politics first. “Air travel is essential for our economy and daily life, and it’s disgraceful for travel to be used as leverage in political disagreements,” he said in a statement.
After the PreCheck system was restored, Freeman said in a statement that his group was “glad” DHS had avoided “a crisis of its own making”.
“We are urging the same for Global Entry,” he added. “These Trusted Traveler Programs strengthen aviation security and improve screening efficiency. They are funded by user fees, and there is no reason at this time for them to be suspended.”
The popular government programs at US airports accelerate security lines and make travel slicker for all. The suspension from early Sunday was destined to cause headaches for passengers – combined in the north-east with an incoming blizzard.
The homeland security secretary, Kristi Noem, said in a statement that “shutdowns have serious real world consequences”. She said also that “TSA and [Customs and Border Protection] CBP are prioritizing the general traveling population at our airports and ports of entry and suspending courtesy and special privilege escorts.”
TSA’s PreCheck program allows approved passengers through a faster security lane at US airports and is designed to reduce wait times. Global Entry expedites US customs and immigration clearance for pre-approved, low-risk international travelers entering the US.
A similar shutdown last year caused losses of more than $6bn across the travel industry and related sectors, he said.
The partial government shutdown began on 14 February after Democrats and the White House were unable to reach a deal on legislation to fund DHS. Democrats have been demanding changes to immigration operations that are core to Donald Trump’s aggressive mass deportation campaign.
Democrats on the House committee on homeland security have criticized the decision about airport security.
They said on social media the administration was “kneecapping the programs that make travel smoother and secure” and accused them of “ruining your travel on purpose”.
Senator Andy Kim, a New Jersey Democrat, said Noem’s actions are part of an administration strategy to distract from other issues and shift responsibility.
“This administration is trying to weaponize our government, trying to make things intentionally more difficult for the American people as a political leverage,” he told CNN on Sunday. “And the American people see that.”

Bleijie tells Labor to ‘cry me a river’ over social housing sales
Queensland’s second-most senior politician has told the opposition to “cry me a river” over its criticism of the government’s resumption of social housing sales.
Deputy Premier Jarrod Bleijie made the comments while opening submissions for a second $500 million round of his government’s fund for infrastructure to accelerate housing developments.
Earlier in the day, Opposition Leader Steven Miles held a media conference with housing spokesperson Meaghan Scanlon in which he said the sales were “taking Queensland backwards”.
Paused by Labor in 2022 amid criticism of the action during escalating demand, initial detail of the resumed sales was aired in parliamentary budget estimates last August.
As a result, the opposition asked Housing Minister Sam O’Connor a parliamentary question on notice about the expected proceeds – said by Miles on Sunday to be $119.3 million.
Scanlon added: “It defies logic that the Crisafulli government would sell off public housing in the middle of a crisis”.
Speaking to reporters at his media conference on Brisbane’s south, Bleijie hit back, noting that between 2015 and 2020, Housing Department sold an average of 280 social homes each year.
“So, cry me a river from the Labor Party, they can’t lecture people on the housing affordability … crisis we have in Queensland at the moment,” Bleijie said.
“Considering the two very people that got up this morning and spoke were the reason we have a Labor affordability and housing crisis in the first place.”
Bleiijie said the LNP was building four-times as many social and affordable homes as Labor, and since coming to power had overseen 5900 contracted or constructed – many by his government.
Median house prices in Brisbane jumped 13.3 per cent last year into second-place behind Sydney at $1.17 million, with another 11 per cent jump expected this year.
The median price for a unit, in which Brisbane has placed second for more than a year, jumped 19.3 per cent to more than $770,000 in December.
At the same time, median weekly rents in Brisbane saw some of the highest jumps in the year to December – also second to Sydney, alongside Perth at $650 per week for a unit.
Meanwhile, the number of people waiting for social housing across the state rose by almost 10,000 to 56,719 between September 2024 and June last year, despite a government crackdown.
While housing demand outpacing supply – for various reasons – is acknowledged by many as a key factor in housing price growth, tax breaks such as the capital gains concession are again in focus.
The government has pledged 1 million new homes by 2044, a figure Bleijie said on Sunday was “ahead of schedule”, while deriding social and affordability quotas as “red tape”.
O’Connor’s September response to the opposition question on notice said his department reviewed social homes it owned for those no longer cost-effective to own or at “the end of their useful life”.
Department-owned land “unsuitable to support social housing outcomes” was also considered for sale as part of this process “so it can be made available for broader housing supply”.
He said the last state budget featured $119.3 million as “cash inflow from the sale of non-financial assets”, in line with Labor’s budgets from 2022 and 2023, and forecast to continue going forward.
This was not linked to any expectation or target, with any proceeds reinvested to the department’s social and social and community housing capital program, O’Connor wrote.

Combined attack on Kyiv: Two victims hospitalized from suburbs
According to Ukrinform, this was reported on Telegram by Kyiv Mayor Vitaliy Klychko.
“Two victims, a woman and a child, were hospitalized in Kyiv hospitals from the suburbs of the capital. Preliminary information indicates that debris fell in a private sector,” he said.
At the same time, the head of the Kyiv City Military Administration, Tymur Tkachenko, reported on Telegram that the information about a fire in the Sviatoshynskyi district was not confirmed.
Earlier, he reported that a residential high-rise in the Sviatoshynskyi district had been damaged in the attack. In particular, a fire broke out on the roof of the building.
Information about the victims is being clarified, Tkachenko added.
As reported by Ukrinform, explosions were heard in the capital during an air raid alert last night, as the Russian troops attacked the city with missiles and combat drones.

Trump announces plan to send US hospital boat to Greenland, says sick are not being treated

US President Donald Trump on Saturday said he was working with Louisiana Governor Jeff Landry to send a hospital boat to Greenland.
Trump announced the plan on social media moments before hosting a dinner for Republican governors at the White House, where he sat next to and chatted with Landry.
"Working with the fantastic Governor of Louisiana, Jeff Landry, we are going to send a great hospital boat to Greenland to take care of the many people who are sick and not being taken care of there. It’s on the way!!!" Trump said.
Neither the White House nor Landry's office responded to queries about the post, whether Denmark or Greenland had requested the ship and which sick people needed help. The Department of War had no immediate comment.
Danish King Frederik paid a second visit to Greenland in a year last week, an attempt to demonstrate unity with the territory amid Trump's push to buy the island.
Greenland hospital ship plan lacks official confirmation
Greenland, Denmark and the US late last month held talks to resolve the situation following months of tensions within the NATO defense alliance.
Trump's post came hours after Denmark's Joint Arctic Command said it had evacuated a crew member who required urgent medical treatment from a US submarine in Greenland's waters, seven nautical miles outside of Greenland's capital, Nuuk.
It was unclear what connection Landry had with the matter or if the post had any connection to the evacuation.
The US Navy has two hospital ships, the Mercy and the Comfort, but neither are stationed in Louisiana.

Australian navy ship crosses strategic Taiwan Strait, drawing Chinese military response

An Australian warship sailed through the Taiwan Strait, a government source said on Sunday in the latest transit of the sensitive waterway by a US ally, which Chinese state-backed media said was tracked and monitored by the nation's military.
In addition to claiming sovereignty over democratically governed Taiwan, Beijing views the narrow, highly strategic strait as Chinese territorial waters and has responded aggressively on occasion to foreign navies sailing there.
The Toowoomba, an Anzac-class frigate of the Royal Australian Navy, "conducted a routine transit through the Taiwan Strait" on Friday and Saturday as part of a "Regional Presence Deployment in the Indo-Pacific region," the source said.
"All interactions with foreign ships and aircraft were safe and professional," the source said.
China's state-backed Global Times newspaper, citing an unnamed Chinese military source, reported late on Saturday that "the Chinese People's Liberation Army carried out full-process tracking, monitoring, and alert operations throughout the transit."
Taiwan Strait transit by Australian ship draws China response
US warships traverse the strait every few months, enraging Beijing, and some US allies, such as France, Australia, Britain, and Canada, have also made occasional transits.
China has ramped up its military presence around Taiwan and staged its latest war games around the island in late December.
Taiwan's government rejects Beijing's sovereignty claims, saying only the island's people can decide their future.

Israel's bobsled team has been suspended from the Winter Olympics in Milan-Cortina after an attempted unauthorized substitution of one of its athletes, the Olympic Committee of Israel announced.
The decision came after team members sought to replace a competitor in an apparent bid to improve their standing in the rankings. Under Olympic regulations, substitutions are permitted only in cases of injury or illness.
According to details released by the committee, one of the athletes reported feeling unwell, was examined by a doctor and signed a medical affidavit, enabling the Olympic Committee of Israel to submit a formal request to approve the change.
However, the athlete later admitted to the head of the Israeli delegation that he had not been ill and that the move had been improper. Following the confession, the committee rejected the substitution request and decided to suspend the entire team from further participation in the Games.
In a statement, the Olympic Committee of Israel said it had received information Saturday evening that members of the bobsled team had sought to replace one of the participants "in an improper manner that does not meet the standards expected of Olympic athletes and is not aligned with Olympic values."
"As a result, a decision was made not to allow the bobsled team to compete in the event," the statement said.

The Ministry of Defense of Afghanistan’s Taliban-led administration stated that the country will respond “at the appropriate time” to recent Pakistani airstrikes, which it says hit civilian areas.
In a statement reported by Al Jazeera, the ministry said Pakistani aircraft carried out air raids in the provinces of Nangarhar and Paktika, resulting in dozens of casualties.
The statement strongly condemned what it described as violations of Afghan airspace, calling them breaches of international law and principles of good neighborly relations.
The Taliban authorities held the Pakistani military responsible for allegedly targeting civilians and religious centers, warning that they would respond with an “appropriate and measured” reaction at a time of their choosing.
Taliban officials in Kabul rejected Islamabad’s claims that the strikes targeted bases of the Tehrik-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP). Reports indicate that a religious school in Paktika province was struck during the latest air operation.
Meanwhile, Pakistan’s information minister said the strikes targeted camps and hideouts belonging to the TTP and ISIL near the Afghan border.

The data published on the Education Ministry's website leaves no room for doubt. A majority of the Jewish children studying in Israeli elementary schools today are either religious Zionists or ultra-Orthodox. This trend is clear and unequivocal. The secular community's great days as a majority have passed; it is marching inexorably down the slope of the graph toward a new reality in which it becomes a minority.

Milan-Cortina 2026: Can the Winter Olympics leave a sustainable legacy?
Unknown
Unknown Publisher
2026-02-22
06:02:32 UTC
15:02:32 KST

The 2026 Games have utilised upgraded venues and multi-use developments designed for long-term community use.
This year's Milan-Cortina Winter Olympics have been the most geographically dispersed Winter Games in Olympic history, with venues split between Milan and the mountain resort towns of Cortina d'Ampezzo, Livigno and Predazzo.
From the outset, organisers framed the Games as an opportunity to prioritise sustainability, aiming to minimise the environmental footprint by leveraging existing facilities and limiting new construction.
As the competition draws to a close, attention is turning to the legacy they will leave on Italy's infrastructure.
New developments serve long-term community and tourism needs
The multi-city model was designed by organisers and endorsed by the International Olympic Committee to maximise the use of existing facilities, while targeting infrastructure investment where it was most needed, with a strong emphasis on post-Games functionality.
In Cortina, long established as a World Cup alpine skiing venue, the Games have accelerated upgrades to transport links, public spaces and sports facilities.
The IOC has said the strategy focuses on modernising existing infrastructure and ensuring that new developments serve long-term community and tourism needs, rather than creating standalone Olympic sites with limited future use.
Cortina reinforced as winter sports hub – but climate change casts a shadow
Cortina’s mayor Gianluca Lorenzi says the most significant legacy will be felt in everyday infrastructure.
"So better roads, better facilities, the new ski lift, this is something that is enjoyed directly by citizens but also by those who come to Cortina," he says.
He adds that the Games have reinforced Cortina’s position as a winter sports hub, expanding beyond alpine skiing to include sliding disciplines.
One of the most significant bespoke projects in the mountain cluster is the new Cortina Sliding Centre, built to host bobsleigh, skeleton and luge.
The IOC has confirmed that the track is intended to remain as an international level sliding venue after the Games, replacing the historic Eugenio Monti track and aiming to secure future World Cup and championship events in the region.
But even with careful planning, climate change is reshaping the viability of winter sports –both as a competitive and a tourist activity. Winters are growing shorter and milder, with less consistent heavy snowfall in Europe and beyond, forcing reliance on artificial snow and potentially limiting the lifespan of such investments.
Increased tourism, while economically beneficial in the short-term, is likely to drive up the country's carbon footprint.
Urban development in Milan
In Milan, the Games' legacy centres on urban redevelopment.
The Olympic Village has been constructed in the Porta Romana area on the site of a former railway yard, as part of a wider regeneration project that predates the Games but was accelerated by the Olympic timeline.
During the Games, the complex houses athletes in purpose-built residential blocks, with each designed to be converted after 2026.
The IOC has confirmed that once the Games conclude, the Village will be transformed into student housing and residential accommodation.
Thousands of beds will be allocated primarily to university students, addressing long-standing demand in a city that hosts major institutions such as Bocconi University, the University of Milan and Politecnico di Milano.
The development also includes public green spaces, services and mixed-use buildings intended to integrate the area into the surrounding neighbourhood. Despite some critiques of its brutalist aesthetic, the project aims to avoid the fate of past Olympic compounds that became costly, unused developments.
Dino Ruta, professor of Sports and Events Business at Bocconi University, says the success of that conversion will be critical to domestic perceptions of the Games’ legacy.
Another key facility, the 16,000-capacity Arena Santa Giulia, hosted Olympic ice hockey and will transform into a flexible events space for concerts, sports, conventions and shows.
Its location near the Rogoredo transport hub and a metro line has been highlighted as part of a broader strategy to redevelop the Santa Giulia district into a mixed residential and commercial area.
Unlike some previous Olympic venues that were built with a single sport in mind, the arena has been designed from the outset for use across multiple sectors throughout the year.
Sustainable investment over a construction boom
Elsewhere across the Games footprint, organisers have relied heavily on existing or upgraded facilities, reducing new construction and associated emissions.
In Milan, the Mediolanum Forum in Assago, long used for basketball, concerts and figure skating, has hosted Olympic events with temporary adaptations.
In the mountain venues, established ski slopes and ice rinks have been modernised to meet Olympic standards, with upgrades focused on safety, technology and spectator capacity rather than entirely new construction.
For Ruta, however, legacy is not solely material.
"The Games are very much inspirational. The five rings, the six colours of the Olympic flag, that’s something that people will remember forever," he said.
Still, the Games’ environmental impact is under scrutiny. Winter sports inherently demand energy-intensive snowmaking and infrastructure, and as climate change accelerates, the long-term sustainability of future Olympics in mountain regions is increasingly uncertain.
Organisers hope that Milan-Cortina sets a precedent, demonstrating that careful planning and multi-purpose infrastructure can minimise emissions while maximising community benefit.
As the competition approaches its final days in the snow-covered Dolomites, and in Milan’s new arenas, the ultimate measure of legacy will not be the scale of the facilities alone, but whether they remain active, environmentally responsible, financially viable, and accessible to residents long after the Olympic flame is extinguished.

The political bureau of Ansarallah has strongly condemned recent Israeli military operations in Lebanon, as well as remarks made by the US envoy to occupied Palestine, Mike Huckabee.
In a statement cited by Al Mayadeen, the movement denounced the “bloody massacre” carried out by the Israeli regime in Lebanon's Bekaa Valley.
The statement also condemned Israeli strikes targeting the Ain al-Hilweh refugee camp in Lebanon, describing the actions as aggression against Palestinian Resistance groups.
Addressing recent remarks made by Huckabee, the group stressed that the comments reflected US support for the expansionist ambitions at the expense of Palestine and Arab countries.
Ansarallah further called on Arab governments to act jointly and responsibly to confront the growing regional threats.

More than 1,500 detainees seek release under Venezuela’s new amnesty law
Law excludes serious crimes, signals shift after years of official denials that political prisoners existed
ISTANBUL
More than 1,500 people in Venezuela detained for political reasons have filed for amnesty under a newly enacted law and are slated for release, authorities announced Saturday.
"As of yesterday, there were 405 applications from people deprived of liberty. Today, an additional 1,152 applications were received, bringing the total to 1,557. These are being addressed immediately, and at this moment hundreds of people deprived of liberty are already being released under the amnesty law," said National Assembly leader Jorge Rodriguez.
The measure approved Thursday is expected to benefit opposition members, activists, journalists and others. Its passage marks a shift by authorities, who have long denied holding political prisoners, and comes after last month’s US military raid in Caracas that captured President Nicolas Maduro.
The legislation does not apply to individuals convicted of homicide, drug trafficking, grave human rights abuses or military rebellion.
Rights groups have urged authorities to extend the measure to all those detained for political reasons, regardless of whether they are formally included.
“It is discriminatory and unconstitutional to exclude imprisoned military personnel and persecuted political figures,” Alfredo Romero, head of Foro Penal, wrote Saturday on US social media platform X, adding that without measure, “there can be no talk of national coexistence.”
Rodriguez added that the law also applies to people who had been under alternative detention arrangements, such as reporting requirements or house arrest, and “the law provides for these alternative measures to be lifted so that individuals can enjoy full freedom.”
He noted that “authorities are processing the requests of more than 11,000 people who were under alternative detention regimes within the justice system, and those 11,000 individuals will be reviewed by the Dennis Law monitoring committee.”
Acting President Delcy Rodriguez described the measure during the bill’s signing as evidence that the nation’s political leaders were “letting go of a little intolerance and opening new avenues for politics in Venezuela.”

‘The anxieties just lift’: why domestic abuse refuges are turning to female tradespeople
Unknown
Unknown Publisher

06:00:31 UTC
15:00:31 KST

One of the main challenges in maintaining the 64 homes for domestic abuse survivors run by Refuge is the reliance on a male-dominated workforce of electricians, plumbers and decorators.
“The presence of men can be distressing and could trigger past traumas for our survivors,” said Lisa Cantwell-Hope, the head of property services at the charity. “Male contractors need an escort to make our survivors feel more comfortable, and we always put a notice out to all our residents saying there will be a male presence in the building today. So it can be challenging and takes up more time.”
Data from the Office for National Statistics shows there were 48,000 tradeswomen in the UK in 2021, a growth of 41% from 2006, but it is thought this is still only about 4% of the total trades workforce, and construction is consistently ranked as the most male-dominated industry in the country.
Regionally, the West Midlands has the highest number of tradeswomen (who make up 4.4% of all tradespeople, above London (2.98%) and the south-west (2.24%). In the East Midlands, north-east, Northern Ireland, Scotland, south-east and Wales, they make up less than 1% of tradespeople, according to 2023 data from My Local Toolbox.
But there are clear signs that things are shifting and women are increasingly moving into the sector – the number of women taking construction and engineering apprenticeships rose by 73% between 2019 and 2022.
This is welcome news for domestic abuse charities such as Refuge, which are slowly starting to shift from handymen to handywomen.
“If we could just use female contractors, I’d be a happy woman, but there isn’t enough currently,” said Cantwell-Hope. “But having them makes our jobs a lot easier, and it makes it easier to get people in the refuges, because there’s that common understanding of the sensitivity. They say they feel much more relaxed having a female in the property.
“We’ve got to remember our refuges are people’s homes, and as much as we need to maintain the building, we also have to make it therapeutically pleasing and comfortable.”
The charity is working with TaskHer, an online directory of tradeswoman, to source female workers. The service was set up by Anna Moynihan and her husband in 2021, due to the difficulty in finding tradeswomen when renovating their home.
“I found that every time a tradesperson came to our house, they were a man and they would always speak to my husband and not me,” said Moynihan. “It was really frustrating.”
After doing some research, they found there was huge unmet demand from consumers for tradeswomen – particularly from single women living alone, the LGBT community and women who for religious reasons did not want men in their home.
They then started getting inquiries from domestic abuse charities. “We realised that they were having essentially the same issues that we had from a personal perspective, but on a larger scale,” said Moynihan. “It wasn’t necessarily about convenience, it was about creating an environment that the women who are living in their refuges would still feel safe in.”
They’re now working with Refuge, and other domestic abuse charities, to supply female workers in London, with an aim to expanding outside the capital in the near future.
Erin, a 26-year-old electrician in London, has been working with Refuge for the past few months doing everything from odd jobs to replacing consumer units in their safe houses.
She said taking on the job was a no-brainer as it is rewarding to be able to put her skills to good use in a scenario where a tradesman might cause some apprehension.
“If you can make anyone feel more comfortable in a situation, why wouldn’t you want to do that anyway?” she said. “You can feel it in the air, the anxieties just lift slightly when you go in and they can see who you are.”
She said she’s met very few fellow tradeswomen in her work, although numbers have started to increase in recent years. “I was the only girl on my course at the time and I don’t think they had another one for at least a couple years after that,” she said. “Every day on the job and going around different sites, I never encountered any tradeswomen, never mind an electrician.”
She also said there’s still a degree of sexism she encounters when doing jobs. “You get the older gents watching over and making sure you’re doing it right. I’ve got a baby face and I’m only five foot two so that doesn’t help things,” she said. “But it does feel like things are starting to change. I know a fair few female gas engineers now as well as plumbers, and painters and decorators.”

‘We are not scared’: the Ukrainians building families in the shadow of war
Unknown

Four years ago Russian troops were a few kilometres away from Leleka maternity hospital, beyond a pine forest and a lake. Vladimir Putin’s plan to conquer Ukraine – wrapping it into a new Russian empire – began just down the road. His forces were meant to seize Kyiv and topple Volodymyr Zelenskyy’s pro-western government.
To the Kremlin’s surprise, Ukraine fought back. A Russian armoured column was destroyed in nearby Bucha. For five weeks a battle raged. Maternity staff treated wounded Ukrainian soldiers. Then, in March 2022, Russian troops pulled out of the Kyiv region. They left behind the bodies of hundreds of civilians they had killed, including fleeing families gunned down in their cars.
The hospital in the snowy health resort of Pushcha-Vodytsia has since returned to its original function: delivering babies. The war grinds on as Putin seemingly looks to the White House and Donald Trump to deliver a victory that has been elusive on the battlefield.
In eastern Ukraine, Russia continues to slowly push forward, but there is a price: in January, 35,000 of its soldiers were killed or wounded.
Moscow’s army now occupies 20% of the country, including Crimea. It has taken 1.2 million dead and wounded for it to advance 30 miles in the Donbas region, about the same number of casualties that the US suffered during the entire second world war.
“I don’t believe Ukraine will lose, ultimately. This is my internal feeling. Russia won’t defeat us,” said Valeriia Ivashchenko, who gave birth at the clinic. “So many people have lost friends and loved ones. There’s been so much destruction. It’s taken a toll on both countries. Ukraine won’t stop existing. Our life can’t be called normal, but we try to adapt.”
Ivashchenko was visiting the hospital with her 20-month-old daughter, Veronica, one of a new generation of Ukrainian children born during the conflict. In 2022, Russian shells damaged her family’s apartment building in the village of Horenka. Now enemy drones and ballistic missiles can be heard buzzing above their home, en route to the capital.
“It’s scary. You don’t know their direction. We hide at home between two walls. Veronica recognises the air-raid sirens,” Ivashchenko said. “When the invasion began, I didn’t have a kid. I want to continue to build our life here. War means you can only plan for the short or medium term.”
According to the UN refugee agency, 5.9 million Ukrainians have fled the country, and 3.7 million have been internally displaced. Many are women with children. After four years of all-out war, Ukraine has one of the lowest birthrates in the world, with about one birth for every three deaths. The hospital’s own figures illustrate the country’s stark demographic crisis. In 2020, there were 2,300 deliveries. In 2022, it was 868, and last year, 952.
Dr Valerii Zukin, Leleka’s chief executive, described the fall in numbers as “very sad for me”.
“I like the atmosphere in maternity clinics. It’s different from in a regular hospital, where there is pain and tragedy. Here, people come with positive emotions,” he said, adding: “We must learn to live and survive in these conditions. As Ernest Hemingway wrote: ‘It is silly not to hope.’”
Another mother, Ivanna Didur, said her growing family had decided to stay in Kyiv. In October 2025 she gave birth to her third child, Anastasia. “We are not leaving unless Russia is going to be on the doorstep,” she said. She described having a baby in wartime as a “patriotic act”. “I feel I owe it to people on the frontline to stay, raise kids and tell them about Ukraine,” she said.
Ukraine’s low birthrate was in line with European trends, she added. On top of that, many Ukrainians were struggling financially and felt they “could not afford” to have children. Now there is also a lack of security. Ivanna said she had taped up the windows on her son and daughters’ bedrooms, to protect them from flying glass.
She and her husband, Anatolii, try to give their children as normal a life as possible. Their eight-year-old, Anna, does acrobatics, while Andrii – five – plays football and attends scouts. They eat pizza and go to the cinema. The couple have bought power banks, so their flat stays warm during blackouts caused by bombing. “I don’t think Ukraine is losing. In Donbas the Russians are taking micro-steps,” she said.
Before the war, Ukraine’s population was 41 million. The estimated figure today is between 30 million and 32 million, excluding citizens living under Russian occupation. Kyrylo Ventskivsky, the former head of obstetrics at the Kyiv perinatal centre, said the demographic story was “complicated”. “Overall, the birthrate has decreased by maybe 30%. At the same time, some pregnant women who went abroad come back,” he said.
One of his patients recently returned from the US to Kyiv, where basic maternity services are free. “She estimated she could buy a studio apartment in the suburbs with the $30,000-$40,000 it would take to give birth in America,” he said.
One law exempts fathers with three children from fighting and allows them to leave the country. “Some women tell me they have a third child for this reason,” the doctor acknowledged.
If the low birthrate continues, demographers predict that by 2050 only 25 million people will live in Ukraine. The Verkhovna Rada, Ukraine’s parliament, has taken steps to address this alarming decline. In January it increased a one-off payment given to new mothers to 50,000 hryvnia (£858). It also introduced a new monthly subsidy of 7,000 hryvnia for pregnant women without a job.
Ventskivsky described himself as an optimist. “As a society we are changing. People are fighting, donating and trying to make things better ,” he said, predicting refugees would return in the event of peace. He added: “If there were no corruption, we could be a phenomenal country. We have sea, mountains, good food and great beer.”
For parents who have gone abroad, life can be tough. Ivashchenko said a lot of her friends who had left Ukraine “were struggling”. “It’s hard to adapt. You are considered a refugee and don’t have the same social status as at home. Here we have family, friends and a circle. There you have to start from scratch. It’s hard enough to have a child under normal conditions,” she said.
Ivashchenko said the outcome of the war in Ukraine would determine Europe’s future and the kind of world her daughter grew up in. “I don’t consider it to be a Russian-Ukrainian conflict. I think this is an attack on the whole liberal democratic system and on western values. The idea we live in a world based on rules and international law is an illusion. It doesn’t work any more,” she said.
Few believe the Russians intend to stop their bloody 12-year attempt to destroy Ukraine. “The invasion was a dumb thing to do. They are blinded by their own propaganda and lies,” Ivashchenko said. “The war has made Ukraine more united. We became more proud of our Ukrainian identity. And we are brave. A lot of nations are scared of Russians. We are not scared.”

Matt Goodwin is running: the search for Reform’s elusive byelection candidate

On a bracingly cold February night in Levenshulme, a black Volkswagen people-carrier draws up outside a little parish church, around which a small crowd has begun to gather. From behind the car’s darkened windows steps the Reform candidate for the Gorton and Denton byelection, dressed in the trademark gilet that makes him look less like a politician and more like a man who has come straight from a grouse shoot. As he enters the church where the electoral hustings will take place, a leaflet is thrust into his hand, which as he will later discover with a horrified grimace, is a flyer for the local branch of the Communist League, bearing policies such as “amnesty for all immigrants” and “defend Cuba’s socialist revolution”.
But then, when you are trying to attract the attention of someone as elusive as Prof Matt Goodwin, you have to seize your opportunities whenever they arise. Over recent weeks the former academic and rightwing firebrand has been a curiously intangible presence in the constituency whose representation he is seeking: perpetually detectable but not remotely approachable, always visible without ever really being seen.
None of the dozens of voters I spoke to across the area over the course of two weeks in February had actually glimpsed him in the flesh, much less seen him on their street or doorstep. “He’s probably chilling in St Albans,” jokes one young man crossing the Stockport Road in Denton, a pointed reference to Goodwin’s southern upbringing and unmistakable home counties vowels.
This is not quite true. By his own account, Goodwin has been out campaigning every single day since his candidacy was announced in late January, although this in itself is a term freighted with ambiguity. To a large extent, this is a campaign conducted for the benefit of the internet: consisting of a handful of carefully curated media appearances, arranged meetings and brief photo opportunities. A black car rolls up alongside a pub or a row of terrace houses; its cargo emerges; photographs are taken; content is captured. By the time it is posted, the candidate has long since been ferried away in his transport, presumably back to the safety of Reform’s headquarters, a corrugated iron hulk on an industrial estate just off the M67.
Then again, given the toxic fallout on both sides of the political divide that Goodwin’s campaign has engendered, perhaps a certain caution is only to be expected. Even by the melodramatic standards of the classic British byelection, this has been an unusually feverish month, beset by controversy and fury. There have been accusations on all sides of phantom polls and pretend numbers, dirty tricks and disinformation. A member of Goodwin’s team, Adam Mitula, has reportedly been suspended for racist social media posts in which he claimed he “wouldn’t touch a Jewish woman” and disputed the true death toll of the Holocaust. There were accusations made on social media – comprehensively debunked by Full Fact – that Reform had doctored photos to add posters in house windows. The far-right activist Tommy Robinson has given Goodwin his personal endorsement.
And so who can blame Reform’s buoyant and ever-alert operation from wanting to put as much distance between their candidate and any potentially awkward questions as humanly possible? Requests to interview him, or simply accompany him while he goes out canvassing, have been flatly denied. A terse security guard shoos us away from campaign HQ, reminding us that “everything to the end of the car park is private land”. Earlier this month Goodwin was withdrawn from a hustings in Gorton on the basis that it would not have provided an impartial environment. Other candidates have said that it was because the venue was unable to provide him with a private green room.
For a supposedly proud free-speech warrior, a man who has always readily embraced the adversarial side of politics, who says what he says and seems singularly unbothered by who he offends in the process, it all feels a touch incongruous. Goodwin has a huge Substack following, a significant media imprint and enough money not to need an MP’s salary. Why is a man with his own GB News show and a huge public platform concerning himself with bin collections and bus provisions in a place he had barely visited before January? What exactly are the voters of Gorton and Denton preparing to unleash on this country? In short: what’s the long game here?
Gorton and Denton is really about seven places in one: a jagged dinosaur’s tooth of a constituency, inelegantly redrawn in 2023, stretching from the slowly gentrifying south Manchester suburbs to the post-industrial villages and small towns of Tameside to the east. Some of it is lovely and some of it is grim. No single message, no single campaign can ever hope to appeal to the whole. In a way it is a perfect microcosm of modern Britain, fractured and dislocated from itself, separated by motorways and algorithms.
I sit in pubs and cafes and libraries and supermarkets and have countless conversations. There is no great enthusiasm for Reform in these parts, and even less for Goodwin himself. Nigel Farage is variously described as “a chancer”, “a smooth talker”, “a snake-oil salesman”, “full of shit”. But people intend to vote for his candidate nonetheless because – and this is something that also comes up again and again – they need to be “given a go”. Everyone else has fucked-up, and now it’s their turn.
There’s a bit of the basic, ill-informed racism that sounds parodic until you actually hear it come out of a real person’s mouth. We work hard; they come over here to take because of the benefits. My son can’t buy a house; they get houses for free. And by the way, if you’re hungry later there’s a cracking Chinese restaurant up the road. (This was a real conversation, and the guy was genuinely lovely. He bought me two pints of Cruzcampo, showed me his holiday photos and asked whether I was any good at paper folding.)
Insofar as anyone has heard of Goodwin, it’s because of his GB News show, which often plays in pubs with the sound down. Nobody can recall anything he’s actually said, whether it’s about fines for wearing the burqa in public places or penalising childless women through the tax system. Which, evidently enough, is a problem for anyone attempting to campaign against him. How do you counter a narrative that people can’t remember? How do you rebut a vibe?
“When I hear something racist or xenophobic, I will challenge it,” says Hannah Spencer, the Green party candidate. “But there’s a huge group of people considering Reform who aren’t racist, who often don’t fully understand what Reform are like. They don’t know what Matt Goodwin has been saying. When I’ve told people what he says about Muslims, what he says about women, people are really shocked. So maybe what we know about him, people don’t yet know about him.”
When asked previously about his past comments on Islam, Goodwin said: “What you’ll find in places like Longsight and Burnage is Muslim voters who are often quite socially and culturally conservative and agree with us on issues like open borders, legalisation of drugs, men going into women’s spaces, antisocial behaviour.”
One of the Greens’ main attack lines on the doorstep is that Goodwin isn’t really from Manchester. How does this square with the idea that this is a city for everyone, enriched for centuries by outsiders making it their home? “You don’t have to be from here to be one of us,” Spencer replies. “I really wholeheartedly believe that. However, I don’t believe he’s interested in wanting to make this area better. I think he’s just doing it because it’s a step on his career ladder. He wants the status and the attention and the ego.”
Goodwin is bristling. “I’m sorry, why would I want you to leave the country?” he asks, unhappy with the direction the conversation has taken. “When has anybody ever said anything like that?”
We’re back in Levenshulme, a few minutes before the start of the hustings, and there is precious little time for small talk. Goodwin has said in the past that Englishness is an “ethnicity deeply rooted in people that can trace their roots back over generations”. He has said that people from minority ethnic backgrounds, even if they were born here, are not necessarily British. Farage has already unveiled plans to deport up to 600,000 migrants in the first term of a Reform government. “Remigration” – a fancy term for the “send them back” motif that has defined far-right rhetoric for decades – is back on the political agenda. Do they mean me? Who is them? Where is back?
“I’m not sure you’ve looked at Reform policy in detail,” Goodwin says. “What I’ve said with regards to things like 7/7 and the Manchester bombings, is that if you come to Britain and you decide to blow up our children, you are rejecting membership of our community. Now, based on knowing you for one minute, you seem to be somebody who’s not … running around blowing up your fellow citizens.”
“Wouldn’t dream of it,” I respond.
“You seem to be working hard, probably paying taxes and probably following the rules. So I have nothing but support for people who do that. If you’re here illegally, you will be deported.”
The problem is that “legal” and “illegal” are extremely malleable terms, defined above all by the government and the polity of the day. My parents came here perfectly legally in the 1970s, but what if a future regime fixated on the evils of multiculturalism, determined to roll back mass immigration, decides that it wasn’t actually legal at all? “What I don’t understand,” I say, “is that you roll it back and roll it back. At what point do you say: OK, we’ve got our culture back? At what point is it enough?”
“Personally, I think we should do what America did after the 1920s and Ellis Island,” he replies. “America paused all immigration for 40 years. I think we should pause migration with the exception of a very small amount that is essential for some public services. And then we need to bring back a very limited amount of migration, something comparable to what we had in the 1980s, 1990s, before Tony Blair.”
But of course we had social unrest and racial tension in the 1920s, in the 1950s, in the 1960s, in the 1980s. Does he really think this was a better, more harmonious country in the 1980s?
“There’s been some disturbances,” Goodwin says disdainfully. “But nothing compared to what we’ve had over the last 25 years. 7/7, Manchester Arena, British Jews being murdered on the streets of Manchester. I mean, how much of this are you willing to tolerate? This is the problem with the left. The endless catastrophising. At no point did I say I wanted to return to the 1980s and 1990s. At no point did I talk about throwing communities out. And I’d appreciate a very fair write-up of this interview, otherwise Reform’s press officer will be in touch.”
As he leaves, doubtless elated at having owned another lib, I finally realise why Goodwin has entered the rat race. Over the course of the subsequent two hours at the hustings, his eyes will frequently glaze and droop as a succession of parishioners raise their concerns over air quality, fly-tipping, traffic gridlock. What really appears to animate him is the cut and thrust of the culture wars, the end-of-civilisations stuff, politics as a vessel for race debate, the parliamentary byelection reimagined along the lines of the YouTube comments thread.
In essence this is the very substance of the rightwing strategy: politicians feign enough of an interest in what voters care about so they can get on with what they care about. Gorton and Denton goes to the polls on Thursday. What does Matt Goodwin really think? By the time we find out, it may be too late.

‘She did kill. There’s no grey area there’: Labour MP Naz Shah on the day she and her mother were arrested for murder

Naz Shah found it thrilling when she was arrested on suspicion of murder. “I’ll be honest with you, I had fun. It was the most excitement I’d ever had in my flipping life. I’d never been to a police station before. I was 18 and wet behind the ears. I was this really sheltered kid who’d been arrested. And I was like, they’ve got it wrong, so in my head it was all going to be over soon,” the MP for Bradford West says. “They took my clothes and gave me this white suit to wear, and I was saying, ‘Ooh, I look foxy in this, don’t I? Can you imagine taking me on a date in this?’ I was having a right laugh with the police officers. Honestly, I was so naive.”
Shah’s beloved “Uncle” Azam had died unexpectedly in April 1992. An autopsy revealed that he had been poisoned with arsenic. Shah and her mother, Zoora, who spoke little English, had cooked the previous night’s supper. They were arrested and taken to different police stations. Shah was released. Zoora admitted that she had made the dessert that contained the arsenic. After a month-long trial, she was convicted of Azam’s murder in December 1993 and sentenced to 20 years in jail.
The excitement Shah had felt at the police station didn’t last long. She tried to kill herself twice following her mother’s conviction. But she is one of life’s great survivors. Despite leaving school at 12, being forced into an arranged marriage at 15, and having to bring up her two younger siblings after her mother was jailed, she became a celebrated campaigner, held down high-powered jobs and has been a member of parliament for 11 years. “It’s an interesting life I’ve had,” she says.
Over the next couple of hours, I discover Shah has a fine line in understatement. She was six when her wife-beating, heroin-dealing father traded in her mother for a younger model, and the shame it brought on the family led indirectly to her mother’s conviction.
Shah’s story has always been central to her relationship with the community. Before running against George Galloway in Bradford West in 2015, she published a blog about her family’s history: if she didn’t own her story, it was ripe for exploitation. But then she was telling it as a campaigner who had fought for her mother. Now she’s telling it in a profoundly personal way, as someone who lived through those horrors and was shaped by them.
Her memoir is called Honoured because she is honoured to be an MP, to have survived it all, and at its heart is the Islamic concept of izzat, Arabic for honour. But the book is as much about its bleak antithesis – dishonour. In her culture, a family without izzat is worthless. The day her father walked out, they lost it – and her mother’s attempt to regain it had terrible repercussions.
We’re at her Bradford home, a lovely stone cottage. There’s a fire roaring, her cat Ruby is juggling a couple of sticks and Shah is making us a cup of tea. I’ve arrived early and she’s not quite ready. “Give me a few minutes. D’you want some fruit? Should I put the telly on for you? Make yourself at home.” I sit marvelling at Ruby’s dexterity and at how Shah turned her life around.
Soon she’s back, fully made up, pack of fags in hand. “D’you mind if I smoke? When the kids are here, I can’t smoke in the house.” Shah has three children with her second husband, from whom she is now separated. He lives close by and they have a good relationship.
I ask how she’s feeling about the book. “I bumped into Sadiq Khan the other day,” she says. The London mayor and former Labour MP is a friend, and she gave him a proof to read. “Sadiq said, ‘That was traumatic’ and put his hand on his chest. I said, ‘Nah, you’re good!’ And he said, ‘No, Naz, it was traumatic reading that.’” What did she say then? “I went, yeah.” She might have as much front as the Pennines, but nobody understands what she and her family went through better than her.
Shah, 52, started the book in 2017 – then put it aside for six years: “I had healing to do, and writing it brought up a lot of issues.” Two years ago she was diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder. In the end, she says, she had to write it to get everything out of her system and show people you can get through the hardest of times. “It’s not a misery memoir,” she says pugnaciously. “I’m sat here in my own home with the fire on. To have a fire on and not think about the token you’ve got to buy to put your electricity on and leave a light on, these are things you can’t take for granted. To have got to where I’ve got to, it’s in strength, not weakness.” Shah is short and slight, but she’s made of tough stuff.
“My fight started in the womb. I mean, because I was born a girl, my father didn’t pick me up till he had a son.” Shah’s father was so disappointed, he wouldn’t look at her for the first year of her life. Zoora immediately got pregnant again and gave birth to a boy who died within hours. Shah’s maternal uncle told her father this was God’s way of telling him he should treasure her. So he did. For a while. He would lift her on to the TV, twirling her around to Boney M’s Brown Girl in the Ring. She adored him. Back then her father was a regular businessman, doing well for himself. They were the only family in the street with a colour telly and video recorder. Then one day, when she was five, she saw him drag her mother by her hair and assault her. “I ran up two sets of stairs to the neighbours and was banging on their door to come and stop him.” It wasn’t the only time she witnessed his violence towards her mother. But she told herself this was an aberration, that he was a good man, and continued to love him.
Then he walked away, leaving the family destitute. By now, Shah had a sister, Foz, and brother, Imy. There had been rumours her father was having an affair with a neighbour. It wasn’t true: he was having a relationship with her 16-year-old daughter, whom he went on to marry. And that’s when izzat came into play. Shah was told she was dishonoured because her father had left home. Zoora, still only 24 and working part-time as a cleaner, was determined to restore izzat to the family and thought she could do this by selling her wedding jewellery to put a deposit down on a £10,000 house. But without a full-time job, she couldn’t get a mortgage.
This is when Uncle Azam came into the story. He was neither a real uncle nor a real friend. But he appeared to be both. “He brought fruit over for us, so he seemed like a knight in shining armour. But he was exploiting a vulnerable young woman.” Another understatement. Azam, who was married, told Zoora he would register the house in his name, she would make payments via him, and when she had paid off the mortgage he would transfer the property to her. But it didn’t work out that way. The first time he took Zoora to her new home, he raped her. And so it continued. When he went to prison for heroin dealing, his criminal associates started to come to the house with provisions for the family. Zoora took them upstairs out of sight while the children did their homework. When she came back down, she looked distraught. Sometimes she was bruised.
At 12, Shah was sent to live with relatives in Pakistan. “I thought I was going for a holiday. I didn’t come back for two and a half years, and I never saw the inside of a school again. They didn’t let me come back till I had my nikah done [a marriage contract in Islamic law].” The relatives told her Zoora had approved the marriage, even though she hadn’t. At 16, Shah’s husband joined her in Bradford. He was immature, abusive and controlling. Six months later, she walked out on him.
The teenager briefly took back control of her life. And then Azam died. In her eyes, he was still a good man. But when her mother was remanded in jail, rumours grew that she had killed Azam because he had been abusing Shah. This left her even more devastated. She knew she hadn’t been abused by him, and was convinced her mother, who pleaded not guilty, hadn’t killed him. Shah felt humiliated and lost. She took an overdose, and had her stomach pumped. “We’d just been arrested and were on the front page of a local rag, and it was overwhelming and I wanted out.” She pauses. “Looking back, I think that was probably a cry for help.”
She was 20 when her mother was finally tried. Shah sat through every day of the month-long trial, and can still see the verdict being delivered in Technicolor. “Her right hand was on her mouth, as if she was trying not to scream, and the other was grasping the rail in front of her. Her eyes were locked on mine. It’s like she was trying to hold me tight. And that kills me, even today.” Shah gulps. When she was doing the audiobook, this was one of a few parts she simply couldn’t read out.
There are so many memories she struggles with. At 20, she found herself homeless, sofa surfing wherever she could. After Azam’s death, 11-year-old Foz had been sent to Pakistan. In 1993, with their mother remanded in jail, Shah sent Imy to bring Foz home, but without the money for a return flight, they got stuck there. She was now alone. “I was in a crack den at one point; I can still smell that horrible, sweet, sickly smell.” Then there was her first Eid alone: “My cousin Pini rang me and it hit me my sister wasn’t there, my brother wasn’t there, my mother was locked up, and I just felt overwhelmed.”
That was the second time she attempted suicide. This time it was for real. “I had nothing but the clothes on my back. I was homeless, I didn’t have a job, and I didn’t want to live.” How did she feel when she came round? “Numb. I’d had my stomach pumped again. I was in a mental health crisis.” Had she come close to killing herself? “Very close. Had I not been found, I think I’d have died. Nobody’s asked me that question.” She sounds remote. “I was out for days. When I came round, my mum rang. She cried and I cried. I thought, what the fuck was I doing, because I was her only hope. I felt guilty. She was like, ‘If you go, what’s left for me?’”
That was the last time she contemplated suicide. She now had a purpose in life: to fight for justice for her mother. Of course, Zoora was innocent. There was no way she could kill anybody, let alone a good man like Uncle Azam. Imy and Foz finally got home, and the three moved into a council flat. Shah made connections with campaigning groups, lawyers and miscarriage of justice experts. Zoora had still never said what she knew about Azam’s death. But she began to talk to Pragna Patel from Southall Black Sisters, and in 1995 told her exactly what had happened. She said Azam had raped her repeatedly and when he was in prison he had sent his friends to rape her. When she told him she was going to expose the truth, he threatened something even worse. “He told Mum, ‘Remember the grass is always greener with that daughter of yours.’ I realised she had sent me to Pakistan to keep me from his clutches.”
Until that day, she had insisted on her mother’s innocence. “Pragna sat me and Foz down and said, ‘You know your mum killed him, girls. She has admitted it.’” Did she still regard Zoora as a victim of a miscarriage of justice? “She served 14 years for killing someone who was destroying her and threatening her daughter. But she did kill somebody. There’s no grey area there. The grey area is she was a woman who was destitute and driven to kill the man who had abused her for years.”
Another Technicolor memory. Shah is driving on the M606 with Foz and Imy. By now Shah and Foz have known for months that their mother was abused by Azam, but they haven’t told Imy. Shah decides the time is right – because she’s driving, it will moderate his response. “I will never forget the sound of his fist on that windscreen. I was shocked it didn’t smash. I said, ‘Mum killed Azam because she was abused and she had forced abortions.’ My sister was bawling, I was crying, and he had broken down.” Did he punch the windscreen because she had killed Azam or because she’d been abused? “Because she’d been abused. That was so painful for him; that our mother had suffered so much.”
Southall Black Sisters helped the family to appeal against the length of the sentence. The Guardian’s crime reporter Duncan Campbell was the first national newspaper journalist to cover the story in depth, in 1998, under the headline “Murder appeal: despair drove woman to kill”. In the same year, Shah was awarded the Emma Humphreys Memorial Prize to honour women and groups working to end male violence against women and girls. Although the 1998 appeal had been dismissed, in 2000 an intervention by then home secretary Jack Straw led to Zoora’s tariff being reduced by the lord chief justice from 20 to 12 years (she eventually served 14). Lord Bingham said, “This was the conduct of a desperate woman threatened with the loss of her home and with destitution in what remained for her a foreign country.”
When her mother was initially remanded to New Hall prison near Wakefield, Shah visited her five days a week – a six-hour round trip. After being convicted Zoora was moved to HMP Durham, where Shah saw serial killers Myra Hindley and Rose West. “I remember Rose West getting on her moral fickin’ high ground. She said, ‘There’s a poisoner working in the kitchens’ and wouldn’t eat Mum’s food.”
I ask Shah if what happened to her mother politicised her? “Oh God yeah. What about this wouldn’t politicise me? I felt the sheer injustice of what happened, and what really pissed me off is when you presented this story to judges, they just didn’t get it. These were people high on their perches, especially in those days.”
In 2006, Zoora was finally released, at the age of 54. Shah writes that she was timid and broken, “hollowed out, nervous like a tiny shivering bird”. She was so used to seeking permission for everything, she asked Shah if she could use her toilet. But after working in a charity shop, she gradually reintegrated herself into the community.
Zoora is now staying with Shah, but she’s not here today; she is still on licence and is unwilling to talk to the press. How is she doing? “Mum is doing good.” Has she forgiven herself for what she did? “Yes because she’s been to Hajj. She also had lots of counselling in prison, and she knows she was driven to do it. Does she regret it? Yes, of course she does.”
As for Shah, she went from strength to strength, from broken girl to a formidable campaigner with a successful career. After packing crisps, she went on to become a social worker and ended up as a commissioning manager for public health, responsible for a £5m budget.
In 2014, Shah was one of five women invited by Labour MP Khalid Mahmood to attend a meeting above an Indian restaurant in Bradford. None of them knew why they were there. They discovered it was to address the “Galloway problem”. In 2012, George Galloway had won Bradford West for Respect. Labour had decided to opt for an all-women shortlist, and the guests had been invited to see if they fancied taking him on. The four other women declined to stand. Shah had never considered running for parliament before, but told Mahmood, “I could chew him up and spit him out.”
Sure enough, she saw him off. “After I won, Galloway made this flipping bizarre speech about the hyenas dancing on the grave of a lion. And I was thinking, get over yourself, mate, you were the pussycat who lapped the imaginary milk on Big Brother.” Three general elections on, she’s still representing Bradford. In 2019, she won 76% of the vote, making hers the safest of the 28 Labour seats in the Yorkshire and Humber region. But in 2024 she got a shock, holding on to her seat by only 707 votes when challenged by two independents standing on pro-Palestine tickets. The result said more about her constituents’ anger towards Labour over its stance on Gaza and Israel than it said about her.
Ironically, Shah’s greatest crisis as an MP had come eight years earlier because of her hostility to Israel. In 2016, she was suspended from Labour when social media posts from 2014 resurfaced, one featuring a graphic that superimposed Israel on to a map of the US under the heading “Solution for Israel-Palestine Conflict – Relocate Israel into United States”. Underneath she had written “Problem solved”. In another post, she had written “#IsraelApartheid” accompanied by the quote “Never forget that everything Hitler did in Germany was ‘legal’”, the suggestion being that Israel’s behaviour was comparable to that of Nazi Germany.
Does she think it was right that she was suspended? She nods. “Shall I be honest with you? I said to Jeremy Corbyn two days before I was suspended, ‘Let me resign my whip.’ Here’s the thing for me: after I shared that bloody meme, I knew I’d hurt a community, so it was like, I need to apologise. It was about the transportation of Jews, like they did in the Holocaust, that’s what the inference was. So I stepped down from my position as PPS to John McDonnell and said, ‘I want to go in the chamber and make a statement’, so I made the apology.” Later that day she was suspended, despite the apology.
“I’ll be straight with you,” Shah continues, “when I got suspended, my understanding of antisemitism wasn’t what it is today. I thought it was a hatred of Jews and I was like, well, I don’t hate Jews. The previous week I’d been at a seder with [senior rabbi and inclusion and development coach] Laura Janner-Klausner, so I can’t be antisemitic. For me it was genuine ignorance. A lovely guy called Mark Gardner from the Community Security Trust [a charity that protects Jewish people from antisemitism and terrorism] came to see me, and I’m forever grateful for how he explained it to me.” What did he say? “He said it was the concept of how people talk about Jews leading to hatred of Jews, then it leads to the persecution of Jews, which led to the Holocaust. Hitler talked about Jews having money and power, and these are antisemitic tropes, right? I then understood it as the other side of the coin to Islamophobia.”
In 2019, Shah was called a “grooming gangs apologist” by the pro-Brexit group Leave.EU. She sued and won, but is still furious. “Before the Tommy Robinsons of this world were talking about grooming, I was talking about it. Even before I had political ambitions, I was talking about grooming – about how livid the Pakistani community is and how it stands with victims of abuse because it’s just not who we are. Any society has its bad apples, but it doesn’t mean that’s the whole of a society.”
Does she think Britain’s Pakistani community has a disproportionate problem with grooming? “I think there is a model of grooming that is pertinent to Pakistani men. There is no doubt about it. They are over-represented in the street model of grooming, which accounts for a small percentage of grooming and is one Tommy Robinson and Rupert Lowe have an issue with, but they don’t have an issue with any other kind of grooming. For me, abuse is abuse, and it’s all horrific.”
Shah is sitting on the floor by the fire. “I love my fire.” She’ll never forget how she struggled to keep warm. I ask how she thinks her Labour government is doing. “Pfftttt,” she says, dejectedly. “We’ve got a challenge. We’re not good at communicating the brilliant things we have done. Parts of me are pleased. One of my staffers has just had a baby and said the free childcare she gets is worth an extra £1,000 a month. And when you hear that’s what it does to your life, having a Labour government, that makes me smile.” So why the pfftttt? “We should have been better at things like the two-child benefits cap. Own goals like the winter fuel allowance. And the noise of Reform doesn’t help. We need to stop contributing to that and get our message out there.”
Is Labour trying to out-Reform Reform? Look, she says, migration is a real issue. “My constituents are pissed with illegal immigration. The idea that it’s not a thing that affects people of migrant heritage or of colour just isn’t true. But we need to do more telling of the positive migrant story; their contribution to the economy. If we didn’t have migrants, the NHS would collapse tomorrow.”
What did she think of Labour refusing to let Greater Manchester mayor Andy Burnham contest the forthcoming Gorton and Denton byelection? “I was one of 50 signatories to say it was the wrong decision.” Who would she choose between Starmer and Burnham? “If they’d been contesting the leadership together, I’d have gone for Burnham. Right now, I’d have to think about it.”
Despite the government lurching from calamity to calamity, Shah says she adores her job. “I promise you I feel like I’ve found my calling. I love what I do. I love it with a passion. There’s not a day I don’t wake up looking forward to it. I’m not politically ambitious for position and power. I don’t want to be a minister. I hold my power in a much more authentic way as a backbencher.”
She still blinks at the idea that the girl who was forced into a marriage at 15 and fought so long to get her mother out of jail has represented her community for 11 years. I ask when she felt she recovered her izzat; her honour. Her eyes light up like lasers. “In my eyes I never lost it. Because izzat for me is standing against inequality and injustice, and I’ve done that all my life.”

Sông Quê Phở Bar, London E1: ‘The best phở in town’ – restaurant review | Grace Dent on restaurants

Some hot dining spots seem to expand almost the moment they open, but east London’s Vietnamese stalwart Sông Quê has waited almost 25 years to spawn a little sister, Sông Quê Phở Bar. The new offshoot sits on Commercial Street, a mile or so down the road, and serves a tiny menu focusing on phở, as well as a smattering of the original cafe’s small plates in the form of summer rolls, green papaya salad, grilled lamb chops and savoury banh khot cupcakes.
Quite why Sông Quê, with its regular weekend queues and well-known name, took so long to branch out, however, is unknown. Still, why rush things? After all, the road to restaurant ruin is paved with premature brand roll-outs, and even if managers think they’re superhuman, they cannot be in two – or three or four – sites all at the same time. Plus, the big question with an institution such as the OG Sông Quê is: can you really recreate the magic elsewhere?
The new phở bar has appeared in what at a glance seems a pretty good location, almost directly opposite the much-adored (not least by me) Xian Biang Biang Noodles (go for the belt noodles, I implore you), and close to the beloved Thai hotspot Som Saa. It’s also just down the road from somewhere called Slurp Thai, but the less said about that name, the better.
But is it a good location? The Spitalfields margins, in that sort-of-Aldgate and close-to-Shoreditch area, can be curiously hard to lure passing trade into, so, if I’m honest, I’m actually not so sure. Lauded fish chef Tom Brown opened The Pearly Queen on this very site only a couple of years ago, and that vanished pretty rapidly, and before that it was a Turkish spot called The Space, which made no impact on the London dining scene at all.
One Sunday earlier this month, it was also a bit of a concern to find ourselves the only customers at the new phở bar. Beforehand, I’d worried about not having booked a table, only to find we had the pick of the whole restaurant, and on both floors, too. Still, the staff were bright and chipper, and young enough to tell me, in tones that suggested they were talking about medieval times, that the original Sông Quê opened in 2002; they also seemed genuinely surprised that we had working stoves and electricity way back then. The new place, however, feels more like a canteen that’s there to do one job well: pop by for a bowl of their beef broth noodle soup topped with a choice of beef, beef balls, chicken, prawns or tofu.
My rare beef flank phở came thinly sliced, blushingly pink and generously served atop a bowl of thin, al dente noodles and a fistful of chopped spring onion, and all of it drowned in a very meaningful broth. Star anise is a shining light in this rich, sweet, warmly spiced soup. They also do their famous bun bo hue, which is slightly different from the phở in that it features well done beef flank and pork sausage, or spicy prawns or tofu, and is served with loads of fresh herbs. And if the idea of soup noodles leaves you cold, there’s also a grilled lemongrass chicken and vermicelli dish with gloriously fiery chicken thigh.
Those small plates shouldn’t be ignored, either, so we didn’t. We galloped through grilled beef wrapped in betel leaves, scattered with handfuls of chunky peanuts, dressed with a semi-hedgerow of fresh mint and dunked in a hot, sweet dipping sauce. This place does not skimp on its garnishes. We moved on to little juicy bullets of spicy tempura squid flanked by raw chilli, and a serving of those grilled lamb chops that look like nothing much but that have a truly gorgeous char and come with an oddly unobtrusive, vinegar-based dipping sauce that has just the right amount of sharpness to carry the heft of the meat.
It was at this point in the meal – roughly around the time I was devouring those cute little prawn cupcakes that are in fact little more than egg and cornflour moulded into little baskets, but that are jolly nice when dipped in something spicy and sweet – that I began to think: “Where the hell is everyone?” This is a jolly handy little spot, and there’s no way it can survive on midweek office workers alone while losing out at weekends to the likes of Slurp Thai simply because that’s a few blocks closer to Shoreditch’s main drag.
This is one of those places where I say: use it or lose it. Right now, they have seats going, so take a friend, or a book, and settle down to the best phở in town. What’s more, if you’re antisocial and like Vietnamese treats, well, right now, Sông Quê will feel like heaven.

Nearly 124,000 new hotel rooms are projected across Europe this year, with global hospitality giants among the most anticipated openings.
Europe’s hotel industry will see a projected 123,789 new rooms added to its hospitality portfolio in 2026, double the 56,043 that were added last year, according to pipeline data published by CoStar.
London (5,822) and Istanbul (3,017) are predicted to be the two major European markets for room openings in 2026. Shanghai (7,457) leads the way globally for new inventory, while Dubai (5,053) and New York City (4,852) will also see notable additions.
With the industry’s biggest companies set to expand their portfolios across the continent in 2026, we pick out some of the most anticipated new hotel openings.
Six Senses London, United Kingdom
Set to open its doors on 1 March, Six Senses London marks the luxury brand’s UK debut. Set within The Whiteley development in Bayswater, the hotel will include a range of rooms and suites, branded residences and dining options alongside the flagship wellness and spa facilities. The property will also feature the first Six Senses Place, a private members’ club and social wellness concept.
The Lake Como EDITION, Italy
There’s no shortage of luxury lakeside options on Italy’s Lake Como, and in March a new addition will open on the western shore. Offering views of the historic town of Bellagio, The Lake Como EDITION will be retreat-style destination with dining and private terraces, plus a floating pool, private dock, and waterfront access to the lake. Guests can enjoy curated waterside experiences, including scenic boat tours and immersive wellness rituals.
Mandarin Oriental Punta Negra, Mallorca, Spain
The first Mandarin Oriental in the Balearic Islands will open in Mallorca this spring. Located in Calvià, the resort boasts uninterrupted sea views, best enjoyed from one of the two adults’ outdoor pools. The hotel group is known for its show-stopping spa offering, and Punta Negra will be no different, with a hydro-massage pool, steam rooms, cold plunges and aromatherapy showers. On the food front, Nobu Matsuhisa will open an eponymous restaurant focusing on Nikkei-style dining, while Andalusian chef Dani García will open steakhouse Leña.
Orient Express Palazzo Donà Giovannelli, Venice, Italy
Housed in a former residence designed by the architect behind the Doge’s Palace, Orient Express Palazzo Donà Giovannelli was always bound to impress upon its opening in April 2026. Part of Accor’s Orient Express revival, which will include two train routes from next year, the hotel is located in the Venetian district of Cannaregio. There are 47 rooms, suites and apartments, with the latter being a first from the brand, as well as a fine dining restaurant with private boat access and the Wagon Bar, a nod to the famed train experience.
Villa San Michele, A Belmond Hotel, Florence, Italy
Among the first hotels opened by Belmond, Villa San Michele will reopen on 28 April after an 18-month renovation. The 15th-century Franscican monastery overlooking Florence is known for its Italian Renaissance architecture, and the team have worked with Luigi Fragola Architects to reimagine each of its 27 suites and 12 rooms. Among the biggest changes is the opening of its first-ever spa, Villa San Michele Spa by Guerlain, and a new experience programme curated by Italy-based luxury lifestyle brand La DoubleJ which will include mixology evenings, sound healing and art talks.
Waldorf Astoria London – Admiralty Arch, UK
When it comes to opening a hotel, it’s all about location, location, location. And we couldn’t think of a much better one than the new Waldorf Astoria London, which is opening inside the Grade I-listed Admiralty Arch. Originally commissioned by King Edward VII in memory of his late mother, Queen Victoria, the building served as government offices until 2011. Due to open in 2026, not much is known about the property beyond that it will have 100 rooms and suites, and that it will have a rooftop cafe facing Buckingham Palace. A seafood restaurant is also planned for the former home of the First Sea Lord.
Nobu Hotel Madrid, Spain
Nobu’s fifth hotel in Spain will be located in the heart of the Spanish capital – in the Cortes neighbourhood known for its tapas bars and cobbled streets. Expected to open in the first quarter of 2026, the exclusive 50-key property will offer a three-level Nobu restaurant and bar, as well as a rooftop bar and lounge with skyline views. Nobu is just one of the prominent openings in the city this year, alongside Nômade Temple Madrid and Mercer Hotel Madrid.
The Standard, Lisbon, Portugal
Part of the Hyatt group, The Standard brand arrives in Portugal’s capital in 2026. Known for its trendy, design-led spaces and experiences, the hotel will be located at Palácio Santa Clara, above Lisbon’s cultural hub, Alfama. A rooftop terrace, spa, and gardens will provide guests with spaces to relax, while 24 apartments will be available for long stays.
Hotel Raphaël, Paris, France
Set to reopen this year after a major renovation, Hotel Raphaël is a showcase of French tradition and hospitality. Built in 1925, this glamorous five-star is located in the heart of the 16th arrondissement, just a few steps from the Arc de Triomphe and the Champs-Elysées. Expect a typically Parisian stay at the Hotel Raphaël and make sure to visit its hidden gem, a beautiful rooftop with stunning views over the City of Light.
The Park Gstaad, A Four Seasons Hotel, Switzerland
Gstaad’s original five-star hotel, The Park Gstaad, is set to reopen over the 2026-2027 winter season as a Four Seasons. Exact details are yet to be revealed, but the luxury hotel group has said that there will be 75 rooms and suites as well as a number of penthouse residences that will be available for purchase. Guests will be able to rub shoulders with the rich and famous that flock to the famed mountain resort town at the hotel’s restaurants and bars, indoor and outdoor pools, and on the tennis court. There are also plans to open an ice rink over the winter months.

Viral dance challenge lifted Chinese ibuprofen maker’s shares – now they are languishing
Slumping profits at Shandong Xinhua Pharmaceutical have dragged the shares to about HK$7 in December 2025 from HK$15.62 in December 2022
When an ibuprofen dance challenge went viral on the Chinese social media platform Douyin in late 2022 during the Covid-19 pandemic, shares of the country’s leading ibuprofen maker surged more than 200 per cent in two weeks.
Now profits at Shandong Xinhua Pharmaceutical are plunging, and it is not alone, as drug makers are hit by oversupply and weakening demand.
The net profit at Shandong Xinhua, a leading manufacturer and exporter of fever and pain medicines, including ibuprofen, fell 26 per cent year on year to 256.2 million yuan (US$37 million) in the first three quarters of 2025, according to its exchange filing.
The earlier spike in Shandong Xinhua’s shares came as social media influencers mimicked the poses of a red human-shaped figure on the ibuprofen packaging, cheering up social media users and offering a brief escape from pandemic anxiety in December 2022. That month, the mainland began moving away from its “zero-Covid” strategy, lifting lockdowns, ending mass testing and reopening public venues.
The trend soon inspired tens of thousands to replicate the influencers with spins, stretches and jump kicks.
Shandong Xinhua’s slump extends a downturn that began in 2024, when full-year net profit fell 5.3 per cent from a year earlier. The company attributed the profit decline to price cuts on key products to defend its market share.

The real-life murder case behind ‘The Lady’: How Sarah Ferguson’s former dresser went from the palace to prison
A new drama about Jane Andrews, Sarah Ferguson’s ex-right-hand woman who ended up in jail for murder, is airing just as the former duchess is already at the centre of a media storm. Katie Rosseinsky looks back at the harrowing case

From a terrace in Grimsby to Buckingham Palace – then on to the Old Bailey and Her Majesty’s Prison. It is hardly a surprise that the story of Jane Andrews, the former dresser and right-hand woman to Sarah Ferguson who was later jailed for the murder of her boyfriend Thomas Cressman, became something of a grim cause célèbre in the early Noughties. After all, it had all the components of a very British tabloid scandal: class anxiety, mingled with royalty and shocking violence.
Headlines branded Andrews, the Lincolnshire woman who had ascended from humble beginnings to earn the nickname “Lady Jane” from her employer, a “bunny boiler” or the “Fatal Attraction” killer. She was portrayed as a callous and jealous social climber, fixated upon securing a place among the upper classes. Andrews, however, contended that she had been a victim of abuse.
Twenty-five years on from her trial, Andrews’ tale is now the subject of The Lady, a four-part, “partially fictionalised” drama from ITV, made by the producers behind The Crown. Bafta Rising Star winner Mia McKenna-Bruce plays Andrews, whose trajectory has been described by show writer Debbie O’Malley as a “toxic fairytale”, while Game of Thrones star Natalie Dormer dons a very red wig to play the former Duchess of York.
The series, of course, could hardly have landed at a worse time for said former duchess. Newly released emails from the Epstein files have put her contact with the paedophile financier Jeffrey Epstein – even after his 2008 conviction for procuring a girl under the age of 18 for prostitution – back in the spotlight.
Then, on Thursday, her ex-husband Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor was arrested on suspicion of misconduct in public office, amid claims that he shared sensitive information with Epstein while serving as the UK’s trade envoy. Andrew has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing in relation to his connections with Epstein; he doesn’t appear in The Lady, either, a creative decision the producers may well be thanking themselves for right now.
Dormer has already distanced herself from the role. Back in September, when a leaked email showed that Ferguson had called Epstein a “steadfast, generous and supreme friend” after having claimed to have severed ties, the actor said that she would no longer promote The Lady. “Since completing the project, new information has come to light that makes it impossible for me to reconcile my values with Sarah Ferguson’s behaviour, which I believe is inexcusable,” she said, adding that she would donate her salary to charities supporting childhood victims of sexual abuse.
McKenna-Bruce, meanwhile, contends that the show “is Jane’s story, it’s not Fergie’s story”.
Andrews was born in Lincolnshire in 1967 to a working-class family, whose financial difficulties formed the backdrop to her childhood. When she was eight, debts meant that her parents had to sell their home and move to a smaller place in Grimsby, with an outdoor toilet. “I remember one day we didn’t have enough to buy a loaf of bread and Mum had us looking down the sides of the settee and in our coats for money to scrape together,” she recalled in a 2003 interview.
From an early age, Andrews seemed to struggle with her mental health, experiencing depression, panic attacks and an eating disorder. At the age of 15, she tried to take her own life for the first time. It was around this time, in her mid-to-late teens, that she would start to become unhealthily dependent on her intimate relationships, she later told The Guardian, a result of low self-esteem and fears of abandonment.
Her love of fashion, though, came to represent a promise of escape. Andrews studied fashion in college and started working in Marks & Spencer. In 1988, she answered an anonymous advert in a copy of The Lady, the high society magazine, for a gig as a personal dresser. Months went by before she would eventually be invited for an interview. Her mysterious would-be employer? Sarah Ferguson, the Duchess of York, who was then married to the Queen’s favourite son and expecting her first child, Princess Beatrice.
The two very different women seemed to have an instant rapport, and Andrews got the job. “I was running away from all the horrible things in my past that Grimsby represented,” she later said. “I arrived at King’s Cross with a suitcase and £10 in my pocket. I got in a taxi and said, ‘Side door of Buckingham Palace’ and the driver made a joke.” When she arrived, she received flowers from Fergie, along with a card that read “Welcome to the team”, signed by “The Boss”.
In the ITV show, McKenna-Bruce’s Andrews becomes fast friends with the duchess by sharing snippets from her tumultuous romantic life, while overhauling her own image to align with the upper-class milieu in which she was now mixing. We see her upgrading her own wardrobe to fancier designers, and hear her lengthening her vowels to disguise her roots “oop north”, as Dormer’s Fergie rather hamfistedly puts it.
In the media storm that surrounded her trial, Andrews was painted as a calculated social climber who deliberately and strategically made herself over to better ascend the ladder; there was even a suggestion that she deliberately mirrored the duchess, whose apparently ironic nickname for her dresser was “Lady Jane”. One report from The Telegraph even claimed that “friends said Andrews was devoted to the duchess to the point of obsession, assuming her characteristics and copying her style”.
But for Andrews, this makeover was less some monomaniacal fixation with her employer, more just a consequence of an ordinary young woman suddenly finding herself in the upper echelons and attempting to fit in. “I was a country bumpkin,” she told The Guardian. “Suddenly, I was at Balmoral mixing with the royals, having long chats with Princess Diana. I was 21 years old, and of course I enjoyed it. If my accent changed, it was only because people made fun of the way I said ‘bath’ and ‘grass’.”
In the introduction to a travel book released in 1993, Ferguson included a special dedication to her right-hand woman, “whose loyalty and kindness knows no bounds”. Later, the duchess’s marital woes only brought the pair closer together – especially as Andrews, who had tied the knot with an IBM executive two decades her senior in 1990, was also floundering in her marriage. This eventually ended in 1997, a year after Fergie’s split from Andrew.
But the relationship between the two women would eventually sour. In 1997, Andrews was made redundant, with the palace citing cost-cutting reasons. Being let go came as a huge blow to her, after she had spent almost a decade entwined with the duchess’s day-to-day life. Fergie reportedly did not break the news in person and, Andrews has alleged, had only just told her, “I’ll never get rid of you, you’re with me for life.”
Recently divorced and dumped by her employer, Andrews became depressed, and struggled to find a new job, although she eventually secured positions with upmarket jewellers including Theo Fennell (father of Wuthering Heights director Emerald) and Annabel Jones.
In 1998, she met Thomas Cressman, a wealthy businessman whose father was a former director of Aston Villa football club. Later reports claimed that Andrews saw their relationship as a potential route back into the high society lifestyle she had previously enjoyed as part of Ferguson’s inner circle.
In the summer of 2000, the couple went on holiday to the South of France. But what should have been a romantic trip turned into a disaster. Later reports claimed Andrews had apparently been expecting a proposal, only for Cressman to tell her that he had no plans for anything of the sort.
Upon their return to London, they became embroiled in an argument so heated that Cressman eventually called 999, telling the operator: “We are rowing, someone is going to get hurt unless… I would like [the] police to come and split us up.” No one came to Cressman’s Fulham flat to follow up.
Andrews later beat him with a cricket bat and stabbed him with a knife from the kitchen; his body was found the following day, and the police began trying to locate his girlfriend, who appeared to have gone on the run. They even sought the help of the duchess, who left two voicemail messages for her former employee, imploring Andrews to turn herself in. She was eventually discovered in her car in Cornwall, having taken an overdose.
At her murder trial at the Old Bailey in 2001, Andrews’ stance was that she had acted in self-defence. The prosecution argued that she was a gold digger obsessed with the idea of marrying Cressman, and therefore cementing her status in high society, and had flown into a violent rage when it became clear this was not going to happen. Her defence claimed that Cressman had been physically abusive and sexually violent towards her throughout the relationship, and noted that her depression “would have heightened her sense of fear and helplessness”, according to a BBC report.
These allegations horrified Cressman’s family, who described them as “a whole tissue of lies”. The jury eventually discounted them, choosing to convict Andrews of murder rather than the lesser charge of manslaughter. “In killing the man you loved, you ended his life and ruined your own,” the judge told her.
She eventually received a life sentence, which she unsuccessfully appealed in 2003, citing a diagnosis of Borderline Personality Disorder, a mental health condition that can manifest as emotional instability and impulsive behaviour, according to the NHS. She also claimed that memories of sexual abuse from her childhood had been triggered by Cressman’s alleged behaviour. The Court of Appeal, however, declined to admit the evidence.
In jail, Andrews was reportedly nicknamed “Fergie’s bird”. She made headlines once again in 2009 when, shortly after she was transferred to an open prison, she made a bid for freedom, apparently jumping over a wall and then laying low in a nearby Premier Inn with her family, until she was caught and returned. She eventually left prison in 2019, and found work in a supermarket (which she would later lose when her identity was uncovered). Now aged 57, she is reportedly now working at a charity-funded animal hospital.
O’Malley, the writer behind The Lady, has said that the show is “about understanding the human behind the headlines”, and doesn’t seek to “apportion blame in other places, but to understand how someone could get to that point”. Whether the current headlines circling around Andrews’ former friend and boss will overshadow some of the drama’s nuance, though, is out of the writer’s hands now.

Lithuanian school student develops smart helmet after surviving motorcycle crash

A 16-year-old student from Panevėžys has developed a smart helmet control system designed to save lives after surviving a motorcycle accident that he says could have ended very differently.
Modestas Raila created a universal device that alerts riders if their helmet is not properly fastened. The system emits a warning sound until the helmet is securely strapped.
“If it senses that this part is not touching the neck, it starts beeping. It will keep beeping until you fasten it,” Raila said while demonstrating his invention.
The concept is similar to a car seat belt warning system, but adapted for motorcyclists. A special sensor reacts only to contact with the rider’s neck to avoid false alarms. An integrated speed sensor ensures the signal activates only when the vehicle is moving, not when the rider is walking.
Raila said the idea stemmed from personal experience.
“After flying over a car and landing sideways with my head on the asphalt, I realised the helmet saved my life – precisely because it was fastened,” he said. “Later, I learned from people around me that riding with an unfastened helmet is quite common. Some people don’t survive.”
His teacher, Laura Kuchalskienė, said Raila has been impressing classmates and educators with inventions since primary school. Over the years, he has built elaborate Rube Goldberg-style machines that make lemonade and hamburgers, a foot-operated piano, reaction games and even a homemade buggy.
“This year’s idea is probably the most serious one yet,” Kuchalskienė said. “Previous projects attracted large audiences because they were very playful. But this year’s idea addresses a real safety issue.”
Raila said investors have already shown interest in the device, and he plans to turn the invention into a business. He hopes the product will eventually be available in physical and online shops and become a new safety standard.
In the future, he plans to adapt the helmet safety system for use by electric scooter riders and cyclists.

Council fights ‘greedy land tax grab’ over kinders, parks and gardens
Few would notice the narrow garden bed that borders the car park of Werribee’s Bridge Hotel.
But the 18-square-metre strip, which features a row of gum trees, shrubs and a grey electrical services box, attracted more than $70,000 in land tax bills over three years and has become the unlikely focus of a multimillion fight between Wyndham Council and the state government.
Between 2021 and 2023, the State Revenue Office sent the garden owner, Wyndham City Council, an annual land tax bill, totalling $22,804 in 2021 and rising to $25,386.50 in 2022 and 2023.
The Watton Street garden bed is now part of a multimillion-dollar tax row with Wyndham formally objecting to what it calls a “greedy tax grab” on more than 20 council-owned parcels of land including drainage channels and power lines.
The disputed list of “properties” also includes not-for-profit kindergartens and maternal and child health centres, community sports fields, an animal pound, land reserved for telco towers and public parks bequeathed to council by developers.
The council has also called for the Auditor-General to investigate whether land tax is being improperly imposed not just on Wyndham, but across all 79 Victorian councils.
Wyndham is seeking a refund of $5.359 million it paid in land taxes on more than 20 properties between 2021 and 2023. It is yet to receive a land tax assessment on the same parcels of land for 2024 and 2025, and is requesting the tax for those years be waived.
Wyndham mayor Josh Gilligan said the council was being taxed millions of dollars on properties from which it accrues no revenue, robbing it of vital funds for essential services.
“Ratepayers are being double-taxed on kinders, sporting ovals and garden beds and the state needs to end their greedy tax grab immediately,” he said.
“We estimate that there are millions of dollars of taxes sitting on balance sheets of government agencies and councils across Victoria that have been paid that will need to be refunded,” he said.
The largest disputed tax bill – $4.3 million – is for 62 hectares of land earmarked for a future 8000-lot suburb built around a 15,000-seat rectangular sports stadium in Tarneit. The public-private partnership between Wyndham and Western Melbourne Group, the owners of A-League club Western United, stalled last year as the soccer club had its competition licence revoked, and the Australian Tax Office pursued its owners over a $15.5 million debt, which was repaid in January.
According to the council’s objection, Wyndham entered into a caretaker agreement with a local farmer to crop the Tarneit land, maintain firebreaks and control noxious weeds. The State Revenue Office’s tax assessment was triggered when the farmer was paid for the sale of his crops, even though the council received no revenue from the sale.
The council is also disputing a $19,837 assessment it received in 2023 for Wyndham Harbour, a Werribee South marina built on Crown land and managed by council under a 99-year lease.
The Age submitted detailed questions to the State Revenue Office on why these parcels had been assessed as liable for land tax. A spokesperson said the office was unable to comment on individual tax matters.
“Land owned by a municipality is exempt from land tax as long as the land is not used for business purposes, although some exceptions apply,” the spokesperson said.
Dr David Hayward, Emeritus Professor of Public Policy and the Social Economy at RMIT University, said the dispute indicated Wyndham council was trying to regain some control over its revenue after 10 years of government-imposed rate capping.
Victorian councils argue that the state government’s ongoing rate capping policy is constraining their ability to deliver services. A parliamentary inquiry found last year that rate capping is threatening their financial viability, but also delivering lower rates to about 40 per cent of ratepayers.
“It’s easy for the state government to say, ‘We’re capping rates to support cost of living’, which is true, but it’s pretty tough on councils, so I wouldn’t be surprised if there are a lot of these little conflicts popping up because their main source of revenue is obviously rates, and they’re not in control of them,” Hayward said.
The disputed sum is a small fraction of Victoria’s total land tax take: $9.254 billion in 2024-25, rising to $10.098 billion this financial year, according to Parliamentary Budget Office analysis published this month.
“It’s small in terms of the total revenue for the state, but for a cash-strapped council $5 million is a lot of money,” Hayward said.
Municipal Association of Victoria president Cr Jennifer Anderson said continued scrutiny of the land tax system was important, to ensure exemptions for local government remained fit for purpose.
“The local government sector remains committed to working constructively with the State Government to find a fair and workable approach to land tax that benefits the communities we both serve,” Anderson said.

NEW YORK, February 22. /TASS/. US insists Iran give up uranium enrichment, Special US Envoy Steve Witkoff said, adding that this is a red line in negotiations for Washington.
"The President gave Jared (US President Donald Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner - TASS) and I direction before we went over there (for talks with Iran - TASS), there were red lines, zero enrichment. We have to have the material (enriched uranium - TASS) back," he said in an interview with the Fox News TV channel.
Witkoff claimed Tehran would have enough uranium enriched to the level needed to make a nuclear bomb within a week.

Trump says he’s sending a hospital boat to Greenland. Nobody knows why
Trump did not say when the ship will arrive or how long it could stay
- Bookmark
- CommentsGo to comments
President Donald Trump announced the U.S. is “going to send a great hospital boat” to Greenland.
But it’s unclear why the island needs one, which boat he is sending, and when.
The president shared his announcement on his Truth Social account Saturday evening, shortly before hosting a dinner for governors at the White House. Trump noted that he’s working with Jeff Landry, Louisiana’s Republican governor, whom he named the U.S. special envoy to Greenland late last year.
“Working with the fantastic Governor of Louisiana, Jeff Landry, we are going to send a great hospital boat to Greenland to take care of the many people who are sick, and not being taken care of there. It’s on the way!!!” Trump wrote on Truth Social.
The president’s post included an illustration of the USNS Mercy, which is one of two hospital ships operated by the U.S. Navy. He did not say when the ship might arrive, or how long it would stay. It’s also unclear what specifically prompted Trump’s decision. The Greenlandic government provides free healthcare to residents.
The boat and its sister vessel the USNS Comfort are moored in Mobile, Alabama, according to naval trackers.
The Department of Defense referred The Independent’s questions to the White House.
The Independent has also requested comment from Landry’s office.
The announcement also arrived hours after Denmark’s Joint Arctic Command evacuated a crew member from a U.S. submarine in Greenlandic waters, according to Reuters. The crew member required urgent medical attention, authorities said.
The U.S. Navy sailor had to be medically evacuated from a nuclear-powered submarine that broke from its mission and surfaced roughly eight miles from Nuuk, Greenland.
Landry re-shared Trump’s announcement on X, writing, “Thank you, President @realDonaldTrump! Proud to work with you on this important issue!”
Orla Joelsen, a prominent Greenlandic activist, reacted to Trump’s announcement on X, writing, “No thanks!!!”
“We in Greenland are healthy and doing well, sustained by our own traditional foods — including seal blubber, which is rich in vitamins and nutrients that have kept our population strong for generations,” he said.
Trump and his allies have repeatedly argued the U.S. must acquire Greenland, which is an autonomous territory of Denmark, for national security purposes. Meanwhile, Greenlandic officials have maintained the island is not for sale, and that it should remain a territory of Denmark.
Late last month, Trump announced the “framework of a future deal” on Greenland.
“Based upon a very productive meeting that I have had with the Secretary General of NATO, Mark Rutte, we have formed the framework of a future deal with respect to Greenland and, in fact, the entire Arctic Region,” he wrote on Truth Social.
Trump’s push for Greenland appears to be unpopular among many Americans. An AP-NORC poll published earlier this month found that 72 percent of U.S. adults disapprove of the way Trump is handling Greenland, while just 24 percent approve.

Rape charges, Epstein links and sperm donor scandal: the dark secrets rocking Norway’s royal house
Unknown

14:45:08 KST

A series of scandals involving members of Norway’s royal family has placed the monarchy under intense public scrutiny, as the eldest son of Crown Princess Mette-Marit stands trial on multiple criminal charges and fresh attention focuses on the crown princess’s past ties to convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.
Marius Borg Høiby, 29, the son of Mette-Marit from a previous relationship, was indicted earlier this month in Oslo on 38 counts, including allegations of rape, violence against a former partner, drug offenses and making threats. Prosecutors have said he could face up to 10 years in prison if convicted. The trial is expected to continue through mid-March.
Høiby was first arrested in August 2024 on suspicion of assaulting a woman in her 20s at an apartment in Oslo. Norwegian media reported that the woman was treated for a concussion. Høiby was detained for about 30 hours before being released.
Days later, he issued a public statement acknowledging that he had caused bodily harm and damaged property following an argument while under the influence of alcohol and cocaine.
“I committed bodily harm and destroyed objects in the apartment after an argument and under the influence of alcohol and cocaine,” he said at the time. “This should not have happened.”
He also said he has struggled with mental health issues and apologized to the woman involved and to his family.
In November 2024, Høiby was arrested again on suspicion of rape. In February 2025, he was formally charged in connection with the alleged rape of Norwegian television presenter Linni Meister. According to British media reports citing police documents, the alleged assault took place in 2018 during a private gathering at Skaugum Castle, the official residence of the crown prince and crown princess. Police have said they obtained videos and photographs related to the case from Høiby’s computer.
Høiby has not publicly entered a plea on the most recent charges.
Two days before the trial began, Oslo police confirmed he had been arrested again on suspicion of assault, making threats with a knife and violating a restraining order.
The Norwegian royal household has sought to distance itself from the case. In 2017, the palace announced that Høiby would live as a private citizen and would not undertake royal duties. At the time, Mette-Marit said her son would “always be an important and beloved part of our family” but would not carry public responsibilities like his half-siblings.
Mette-Marit, 52, married Crown Prince Haakon in 2001. Haakon, also 52, is the son of King Harald V and Queen Sonja and is heir to the Norwegian throne. The couple has two children together, Princess Ingrid Alexandra, 21, and Prince Sverre Magnus, 20.
Their marriage drew public debate at the time because Mette-Marit, a single mother who had worked as a waitress, had no royal background and had spoken openly about a rebellious youth. In a 2001 news conference, she acknowledged past drug use and said she regretted earlier choices.
More recently, renewed attention has focused on her past association with Epstein, who died in a U.S. jail in 2019 while awaiting trial on federal sex trafficking charges. In 2008, Epstein had pleaded guilty in Florida to soliciting prostitution from a minor and served 13 months in jail.
In 2019, Norwegian newspaper Dagens Næringsliv reported that Mette-Marit met Epstein several times between 2011 and 2013, after his conviction. The palace confirmed that one meeting took place at Epstein’s residence and said Crown Prince Haakon encountered Epstein once in 2012 while on vacation in St. Barts.
The palace has said Mette-Marit ended contact with Epstein in 2014 after concluding he was attempting to use his association with her to connect with others.
Earlier this year, newly released documents related to Epstein included references to Mette-Marit, including email exchanges from 2011 and 2012. Some of the correspondence was described in media reports as personal in tone.
In a recent statement, the crown princess said she regretted the association.
“Jeffrey Epstein was solely responsible for his crimes,” she said. “However, I must take responsibility for not having investigated his background more thoroughly and for not understanding earlier what kind of person he was. I show poor judgment, and I regret having had any contact with him.”
The controversies have fueled broader debate in Norway about the role and judgment of the royal family, whose duties are largely ceremonial under the country’s constitutional monarchy.
Additional attention has centered on Princess Märtha Louise, 53, Haakon’s older sister. In 2002, she relinquished her royal title to pursue private business activities. In recent years, she has drawn criticism for spiritual ventures, including claims that she can communicate with angels, and for her 2024 marriage to Durek Verrett, a self-described shaman.
Separately, historian Tor Bomann-Larsen has raised questions about the lineage of King Harald’s grandfather, King Olav V, suggesting in a recent publication that Olav may have been conceived with the help of a sperm donor in 1902 after years of unsuccessful attempts by his parents to produce an heir. The claim has not been proven and has been rejected by royal supporters. A forthcoming biography is expected to examine the issue further.
King Harald V, 88, has reigned since 1991. Norway’s monarchy, which dates back more than a century in its modern form, remains broadly popular, but the succession of scandals has presented one of its most challenging periods in recent years.

NEW YORK, February 22. /TASS/. Special US Envoy Steve Witkoff expressed hope that a new round of talks on Ukraine could take place within the next three weeks, which would subsequently result in a meeting between Russian leader Vladimir Putin and Vladimir Zelensky.
"We're hopeful, Jared (US President Donald Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner - TASS) and I, that we've put some proposals on the table to both sides that will bring them together in the next three weeks and maybe even result in a summit between Zelensky and President Putin that might end up being a trilateral at some point with the [US] President, we'll have to see. I think he doesn't want to come to a meeting unless he feels that he can consummate this thing and get the best result," he said in an interview with the Fox News TV channel.
Witkoff expressed hope that "some good news" will appear on the issue of the settlement of the Ukrainian conflict in the coming weeks.

Ukrainian resilience remains strong as war enters fifth year

Ukrainian resilience remains strong as war enters fifth year
February 22, 2026The Kyiv International Institute of Sociology (KIIS) published a poll in early February examining Ukrainians' attitudes towards the war. The survey was conducted in late January, when massive Russian attacks on energy facilities caused power outages and disrupted heating and water systems across the country, particularly in Kyiv. These strikes were happening at a time when temperatures dropped as low as minus 25 degrees Celsius.
The KIIS poll found that 88% of respondents thought Russian attacks on Ukraine's energy system were designed to force the country to surrender. Yet, 65% of those interviewed said they were prepared to tough it out as long as necessary. Several months earlier, in September and December 2025, some 62% had said the same.
"This January didn't make me more determined and angry, because I've been very determined and angry since 2022," Julia, a Kyiv resident, told DW. "It's just another stage of an extremely difficult battle that we will win one way or another."
Julia's husband, with whom she has a daughter, has been deployed on the battlefield since 2024.
"My anger helps me to remain steadfast, but also the knowledge that there is no other choice. Anything other than standing firm would be much worse," Julia said.
Justice and survival
One of the most important factors strengthening people's resilience is the realization that Russia's war against Ukraine is an existential one, said KIIS head Anton Hruschezkyj. For the Ukrainians, he explained, the war is not just about justice, but about sheer survival.
"Ukrainian resilience is still high. While they are exhausted and open to making difficult concessions, they are not prepared to cross certain 'red lines.'"
Russian attempts to make everyday life unbearable for normal Ukrainians have not changed this mindset, he said. Ukrainians, he added, have begun describing this hardship as "Cholodomor," or "murder by cold." This term is term derived from "Holodomor", which translated to "death by starvation," and is the name given to the man‑made famine in Soviet Ukraine at the hands of Josef Stalin's regime in 1932 and 1933.
Ukrainians are exhausted from chronic war stress, said psychologist Kateryna Kudrschynska. "It takes its toll on the body, the nervous system and the psyche." She thinks Ukrainian resilience also stems from the refusal to lose more after already giving up so much.
Ukrainians want to rebuild their country
"We want to persevere, because if we surrender, it will be much worse under Russian leadership," Natalia, a Kyiv-based student, told DW. She has come to the capital's Independence Square to place a small flag at an improvised memorial for fallen soldiers in honor of her late father. He recently died in Ukraine's Donetsk region.
The student, who fled abroad at the beginning of the war only to return later, sometimes finds the loss of her father, the extreme living conditions and the country's overall situation difficult to bear. "I draw strength from the fact that I live for my father, who wanted to live and build a future with his family," she said. "I can't give up because of him. I am convinced that Ukraine has a future."
"Ukraine is my home, I don't want to leave. I want to rebuild my country."
Olha is another Kyiv resident toughing it out. "I can't take my child by the hand and walk away," said the mother of a two-year-old. "That would be a betrayal of my husband, who is fighting in the war." Olha's husband volunteered to defend Ukraine at the beginning of the Russian invasion and is currently deployed in the Pokrovsk region. He comes home very rarely. Olha raises their son and also works part-time.
She said her compatriots are seeing Russia facing economic problems and are comforted by the fact that Russia has not managed to achieve any significant military victories in four years. That's why she thinks Ukrainians are optimistic everything will turn out well.
Exhausted but determined soldiers
Serhij* volunteered to join the Ukrainian armed forces as a medic four years ago. He said fighters are growing less motivated and resilient because there are no fixed deployment times, hardly any opportunities for demobilization and inadequate financial provision for soldiers who are not deployed at the front.
Kyrylo serves as a telecommunications specialist with the Ukrainian land forces. He told DW that his comrades have resigned themselves to the lack of rest: "We've settled in so well that you don't even remember what it was like before. If you had plans for the future, you no longer have any now. This is not pessimism. It's more like: 'Whatever will be, will be'. It's a kind of humility, not despondency."
Kyrylos admitted that the mood in the army is strained due to government corruption scandals and cases of misappropriated defense industry funds. Such revelations make him and his comrades feel cheated.
"Personally, when my motivation wanes, all I have left is discipline and the realization that Ukraine, this nation, this identity may no longer exist if we don't persevere and fight," said Mos, who serves in a Ukrainian drone regiment. He, too, deals with burnout and feelings of apathy. Yet Mos said that realizing there is no alternative but to resist helps him regain motivation.
What does Ukraine's future hold
Hrushetsky believes that Ukrainians' ability to fight on as the war enters its fifth year also depends on the knowledge that European partners continue to provide support.
"The current suffering is seen as an investment in the future," he said. "Our latest data shows that more than 60% [of Ukrainians] remain optimistic and believe that Ukraine will be a prosperous member of the European Union in ten years' time."
*The names of the three soldiers quoted in this story have been changed to protect their identities.

US claims China conducting secret tests in race for nuclear superiority

US claims China conducting secret tests in race for nuclear superiority
On the edge of a vast desert in north-west China lies a dried-up salt lake.
Its remote, barren location offers little support for civilisation but makes it the perfect site for secret nuclear testing.
This area, known as Lop Nur, or Lop Lake, is where the US government has alleged China has been conducting hidden nuclear explosive tests.
The revelation potentially signals a new phase in China’s ambitions to win the global nuclear arms race, just as the last remaining treaty between the US and Russia, aimed at preventing catastrophic nuclear war, expired this month.
China wants to expand its arsenal of 600 nuclear warheads to 1500 by 2035, according to official US estimates. This makes it the only party under a global non-proliferation treaty that is significantly expanding its stockpile.
Some of this expansion may be supported by a flurry of construction that has taken place at Lop Nur in recent years, including improved transport infrastructure that could facilitate the transfer of material to the site’s probable eastern testing area, which is visible in satellite imagery.
For China, “geopolitically, having a large nuclear weapons arsenal serves the ‘swagger’ idea,” said Renny Babiarz, a geospatial intelligence expert who specialises in China’s nuclear weapons program.
Nuclear weapons present “a strategic capability to have in the background to help negotiations or to keep other powers out”, he said. “It is a backstop for trying to keep other countries from intervening in the event there is any coercion in the Taiwan Strait. The war on Ukraine has only underscored the importance of that.”
Concerns over China’s nuclear expansion have been around for decades, though allegations of testing related to an apparent nuclear build-up that surfaced in 2020 in a series of arms-control reports by the US State Department.
While details provided by the US government at the time were scarce, Babiarz’s research released the following year revealed extensive expansion at Lop Nur, the site of China’s first nuclear tests in the 1960s.
New construction included large drill-rig activity, a probable underground facility, and numerous “adits” visible in satellite imagery. Adits are excavated areas on the side of a hill or mountain that can serve as an entrance to other underground facilities and chambers, where explosive tests could be conducted.
“Taken together, these observations suggest that China may be preparing for future nuclear weapons testing, which would mark a new phase in the modernisation and/or expansion of China’s nuclear weapons stockpile,” Babiarz wrote in a 2021 report to the State Department, noting that more analysis and study was needed.
Further details about China’s testing activities came from the US government this month, just one day after the nuclear arms control agreement, known as the New Start treaty, between the US and Russia expired.
US officials have since revealed that they believed an explosive nuclear weapons test was conducted on June 22, 2020. They said curious seismic activity registered in neighbouring Kazakhstan indicated such a test and that the Chinese military was preparing for more tests achieving supercritical yields in the range of hundreds of tonnes. Such activity, they said, was being purposefully and expertly concealed.
Experts have rushed to find clues that might present a clearer picture of what China was up to six years ago.
But satellite imagery focusing on the easternmost tunnel test area at Lop Nur analysed by the Centre for Strategic and International Studies, a US think tank, have been inconclusive, as not much activity or change is visible before and after the alleged June 2020 test.
The “Tunnel 5” area, or T5, has been of particular interest given construction and excavation activity in recent years.
Still, CSIS experts noted that it is possible China conducted an underground nuclear test at another tunnel area, or was able to mask the explosion, conducting a covert “decoupling” test, as US officials have alleged.
“Decoupling” is a method in which a device is detonated underground, reducing the magnitude of shockwaves coursing through surrounding rock, and therefore lowering the chance of registering seismic activity.
In other words, it’s one way for China to evade or minimise detection.
An exact determination of what happened on June 22, 2020 could be key in the future, as a test might indicate a “potential violation of the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, which China signed but never ratified, and might become justification for taking more action later”, noted Babiarz.
That China never ratified the treaty is part of Beijing’s playbook: to have plausible deniability, as it allows the government to say it had agreed in theory on the world stage but never in principle at home.
All this comes as President Donald Trump has pushed the US to resume nuclear testing after such activities ended in 1992, and as he continues to seek curbs on China’s nuclear weapons program. Trump has made clear that any renewed nuclear weapons agreement between the US and Russia, given the recent treaty expiry, ought to include China.
Aside from Lop Nur, China has several other secretive nuclear sites, a number of which are located in Sichuan province.
Satellite imagery has captured an increase in construction, including bunkers and facilities that suggested a capability for nuclear weapons production. Two of those sites – Zitong and Pingtong – are just 113 kilometres apart.
Nuclear ambitions in China, Russia, North Korea and Iran – all states hostile to the West, with the first three located in relative proximity – may mean the US seeks to divert resources to counter aggression, leaving Europe exposed.
That “could create uncertainties over the ability of US strategic forces to simultaneously deter aggression in two theatres”, wrote Darya Dolzikova, a senior research fellow specialising in nuclear proliferation and deterrence at UK defence think tank Rusi in a recent report.
“Growing US requirements to deter both China and Russia raise concerns over just how much the US nuclear umbrella can stretch in terms of capabilities before it starts to leak.”
China has vehemently denied US allegations over nuclear testing in 2020, claiming it adheres to a policy of never being the first to use nuclear weapons. Sources have also told the London Telegraph that Beijing refuses to engage on the issue diplomatically.
In 2020, Christopher Ford, the then US under-secretary for arms control, and author of the initial reports raising explosive testing concerns, confronted Fu Cong, the then Chinese ambassador to the European Union, about Beijing’s nuclear activities.
“Fu’s answer was telling: he did not deny that [China] was expanding its arsenal – claiming merely that ‘China will not expand its nuclear arsenal to a large extent’, but declared that Chinese policy was a reaction to China facing ‘more threats from the US’.”
As the US had been reducing its arsenal, Fu thus admitted to Ford that Beijing regarded its stockpile as a deterrent for other nuclear weapons, but also key for countering non-nuclear threats.

The assault, carried out by terrorists locally referred to as bandits, began Thursday night and continued into Friday morning, with attackers on motorcycles setting fire to buildings and shooting residents of the village of Tungan Dutse, who tried to flee
Hamisu Faru, a state lawmaker, confirmed the incident to Anadolu on Saturday.
“No one slept since Thursday and this morning. Some people lost three family members,” Faru told Anadolu.
The victims' bodies have been prepared for a mass burial, with corpses robed in white on Saturday. The number of abductees remains unclear, as local officials continue to account for the missing.
Nigeria's security situation is quite dire, especially in the country’s northwest, where Zamfara is located. The area has been plagued by bandit attacks, kidnappings, and killings, with thousands displaced and many more vulnerable.
The Nigerian government has taken some steps to address the issue. However, the situation remains challenging, with overlapping security threats from armed criminal gangs and rebel fighters.

Polish Sejm Marshal warns against viewing Putin’s camp as good-faith negotiators
This opinion was expressed in an interview with Ukrinform by the Marshal of the Sejm of the Republic of Poland, Włodzimierz Czarzasty, commenting on the trilateral peace talks among Ukraine, the US, and Russia.
"Every real step toward a ceasefire is important. But we cannot pretend that Putin and his gang have suddenly become good-faith negotiators. Our position is clear: A ceasefire, sanctions pressure, and full sovereignty for Ukraine. In other words, a just peace is a situation in which the aggressor and the victim of aggression are clearly identified," Czarzasty emphasized.
The Marshal of the Sejm of the Republic of Poland believes that Europe must participate in the negotiation process. “Countries whose security is directly threatened cannot be mere observers,” he said.
Also, Czarzasty noted that he has no illusions about Moscow's goodwill.
"The issue of accountability cannot depend on Russia's consent. There are international mechanisms, including proceedings in international tribunals, designed to ensure that crimes do not go unpunished. History teaches us that without accountability, there can be no lasting peace. This is the starting point. The ruling coalition in Poland, of which I am a part, understands this well. This is our next common Polish-Ukrainian interest," concluded the Marshal of the Sejm.
As reported by Ukrinform, Volodymyr Zelensky stated that Ukraine is striving to ensure that the next round of trilateral negotiations yields positive results.
On February 18, trilateral negotiations among Ukraine, the United States, and Russia concluded in Geneva.

Afghanistan vows ‘appropriate and measured response’ to Pakistani strikes
Defense Ministry says attacks in Paktika, Nangarhar violate sovereignty, international law; accuses Pakistani military of repeated aggression, intelligence failures
ISTANBUL
The Defense Ministry of Afghanistan said Sunday it would meet the reported Pakistani strikes on its soil with an “appropriate and measured response” at a “suitable time.”
The ministry condemned the attacks "in the strongest possible terms" on US social media company X, describing them as a clear violation of national sovereignty, international law, principles of good neighborliness and Islamic values.
It said targeting civilian and religious centers demonstrates the Pakistani military’s intelligence and security shortcomings, and "such repeated acts of aggression will never be able to conceal their internal shortcomings.
Pakistani forces reportedly carried out airstrikes in several areas of eastern and southeastern Afghanistan, according to Afghan media and the Pakistani Ministry of Information.
“Pakistan in a retributive response, has carried out intelligence based selective targeting of seven Terrorist camps and hideouts belonging to Pakistani Taliban of Fitna al Khwarij (FAK) and its affiliates and Islamic State of Khorsan Province (ISKP) at the border region,” the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting wrote on X early Sunday.
The strikes came in the aftermath of recent suicide bombings in Pakistan, it said.
“Pakistan expects and reiterates the Interim Afghan Government to fulfil its obligations and deny use of its soil by Khwarij and terrorists against Pakistan as the safety and security of people of Pakistan comes first and foremost,” it added.
Pakistan vowed to avenge the killing of two security personnel Saturday in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, warning that it would not allow any attack launched from Afghanistan to go unanswered.

Hong Kong budget must be ‘prudent’, balance social needs and reserves: Paul Chan
Finance chief also reveals purple cover for 2026-27 budget, saying it symbolises Hong Kong’s economic growth amid external volatility
Hong Kong must exercise fiscal prudence, carefully weighing social needs while maintaining adequate reserves to guard against unforeseen circumstances, the finance chief has said as he outlined the principles of the budget he will deliver on Wednesday.
Financial Secretary Paul Chan Mo-po on Sunday also revealed the purple cover for the 2026-27 budget, saying the colour symbolised Hong Kong’s strengthening economic momentum amid a volatile external environment.
The remarks came as the city braced for more global trade uncertainties, with US President Donald Trump announcing on Saturday his decision to raise a temporary global tariff on all imports to the country from 10 to 15 per cent with immediate effect. His move followed a US Supreme Court ruling against his earlier sweeping emergency duties.
“Facing a volatile external environment and uncertainties in the process of economic transformation, we must manage our finances prudently, consider the short, medium and long-term needs of society, and maintain a certain level of reserves to deal with any unforeseen circumstances that may arise,” Chan said in his weekly blog.
The minister said the current administration had been striving to boost the economy, pursue development and improve people’s livelihoods in a way that was “consistent” with residents’ expectations.
He cautioned that the path towards these goals and the allocation of resources often faced real-world constraints, saying the government must inevitably prioritise and make “difficult trade-offs” when drafting the city’s budget blueprint.

Editor's note: This is a developing story and is being updated.
Ukraine struck an oil depot in Russian-occupied Luhansk overnight on Feb. 22, Telegram news channel Exilenova+ reported.
A strong fire erupted at the facility overnight as a result of strikes and continued to burn into the morning, the outlet reported, citing local residents.
Kyiv regularly strikes deep within Russia and the occupied territories of Ukraine in an effort to diminish the Kremlin's fighting power.
Ukraine considers Moscow's energy sites military targets as they fund Russia's war against Ukraine.
In Russia's Udmurt Republic, Ukraine's military launched an overnight operation, striking the Votkinsk Machine Building Plant, a key missile production hub with long-range cruise Flamingo missiles, Ukraine's Armed Forces General Staff confirmed on Feb. 21.
Overnight Feb. 18-19, Ukraine reportedly struck an oil depot in Russia's Pskov Oblast and launched missiles at the Russian city of Belgorod, causing power outages in parts of the city, Telegram news channels and local authorities reported.
A source from the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) told the Kyiv Independent that the attack on the oil depot in Velikiye Luki was the work of their "Alpha" Unmanned Aerial Vehicle unit, which managed to make their way through the anti-drone nets spread over the facility.
"Such operations are an element of systematic weakening of the military potential of the Russian Federation," the SBU source wrote in a statement.
Ukraine successfully attacked a Russian drone warehouse in occupied Luhansk Oblast on Jan. 19, the General Staff of Ukraine's Armed Forces reported.

Iran has designated the armed forces of European Union member states as “terrorist entities” in a tit-for-tat move.

It noted that Iran decided to designate all naval and air forces of EU member states “terrorist organizations.”
- Trump to raise global import tariff from 10% to 15%
US President Donald Trump escalated his renewed tariff campaign by pledging to raise a previously announced 10% global tariff to 15%, even after the Supreme Court ruled against his previous tariff hikes.
"Based on a thorough, detailed, and complete review of the ridiculous, poorly written, and extraordinarily anti-American decision on Tariffs issued yesterday ... by the United States Supreme Court," the global tariff will be raised to 15% "effective immediately," Trump wrote on his Truth Social platform.

Arab countries strongly condemned as “absurd and provocative,” unacceptable, and contrary to international law, the remarks by US Ambassador to Tel Aviv Mike Huckabee, in which he openly accepted Israel’s control over the entire Middle East, including the occupied West Bank.
Huckabee argued on a podcast that Israel has a biblical right to the land stretching from the Nile to the Euphrates rivers, saying, “It would be fine if they (Israel) took it all.”
He made the remarks in an interview with US journalist Tucker Carlson, during which he defended Israel’s actions in the Gaza Strip and voiced support for the idea of “divine providence” giving control of the region to Israel.

Esmaeil Baghaei, spokesperson for Iran’s Foreign Ministry, condemned remarks by Mike Huckabee, the US envoy to occupied Palestine, arguing that Israel could expand its territory across the region from the Nile to the Euphrates.
Baghaei described the comments as evidence of US participation in Israel’s expansionist policies and actions against Palestinians.
"Mike Huckabee's postulation that ‘It would be fine' if Israel 'took it all,’ and expand from the Nile to the Euphrates, is a bold testament to American active complicity in Israeli regime's expansionist wars of aggression as well as its colonial genocide of Palestinians," Baghaei wrote on X.
"The Islamic Republic of Iran condemns, along with the Organization of Islamic Cooperation (OIC), 'such extremist ideological rhetoric' that would only further embolden the occupying regime to persist in its atrocity crimes and illegal measures against Palestinians as well as its constant aggression against the nations of the region," the senior Iranian diplomat stressed.

Man on leave absconds from troubled hospital days after two escapees allegedly kill people
A psychiatric inpatient on “approved leave” has absconded from a Sydney hospital just three days after the state’s mental health minister initiated an urgent review into its security in response to the escape of two patients who allegedly killed people in separate incidents last week.
Madan Pandey, 25, was an inpatient at Cumberland Hospital when he absconded on Saturday morning.
“Western Sydney Local Health District notified police when a patient did not return to Cumberland Hospital. The patient was taking approved leave from the hospital and did not return at the planned time,” the district said in a statement on Sunday evening.
Mental Health Minister Rose Jackson said the planned leave “following an assessment by a senior psychiatrist” was part of Pandey’s recovery process.
“A formal review into the security protocols at Cumberland Hospital is under way. We will thoroughly investigate any process failures and if systematic failures of leadership or culture become clear, I will not hesitate to take action to resolve,” she said.
Police, who hold concerns for Pandey’s welfare, have begun investigating.
Setefano Mooniai Leaaetoa, 25, was arrested after an alleged rampage with a kitchen knife in Merrylands last Tuesday. One man died, and another man and a woman were severely wounded.
Leaaetoa was charged with one count of murder and two counts of attempted murder. He had been an involuntary patient at Cumberland and escaped his escorts during a transfer to Westmead Hospital for medical care on February 7.
Another Cumberland patient, Luke Peter Francis, absconded from one of Cumberland’s locked wards by allegedly threatening a nurse and swiping her access card, before stealing a car in Hurstville on Sunday. The 31-year-old had been released from prison on parole days earlier.
Francis was allegedly driving the stolen Toyota Camry when it crashed into another car during a police pursuit. Two women, driver Lee Casuscelli, 60, and her passenger, Maureen Crosland, 84, died at the scene.
NSW Premier Chris Minns on Thursday said the growing pressure on the public mental health system needed to be addressed, including by implementing recommendations from the Bondi Junction stabbings inquest.
Minns signalled his concerns about the security failings, saying “there needs to be a full investigation into the circumstances relating to these patients”.
“Absconding is common,” said Nick Howson, a mental health clinical nurse consultant and the NSW Nurses and Midwives Association Cumberland branch delegate for mental health.
Cumberland staff would call local police “once a fortnight on average” about absconding patients who were a risk, most often to themselves, he said.
In February 2025, staff said extremely unwell involuntary patients were waiting days on Cumberland’s locked wards to see a specialist at the height of a psychiatrist workforce crisis.
Senior psychiatrists who resigned from Cumberland in 2025 have been replaced by fewer, more junior, part-time psychiatrists.
Jackson initiated an urgent review into Cumberland’s security protocols, and NSW Health will conduct a review of Leaaetoa’s care with the assistance of an external senior psychiatrist.

Blizzard warnings send East Coast scrambling to prepare for heavy snow and strong winds

East Coast blizzard: NYC sees 12,000 flights delayed as nor’easter expected to bring 18 inches of snow
The storm's arrival comes as the icy remnants of a previous snowstorm are finally melting away
- Bookmark
Cities and towns across the East Coast are bracing for a severe winter storm, with forecasters issuing blizzard alerts from Maryland to Massachusetts. The National Weather Service (NWS) has warned that the storm, expected to intensify significantly on Sunday, could prove far more severe than initial projections suggested just days ago.
Blizzard warnings are in effect for major metropolitan areas, including New York City, Long Island, Boston, and coastal communities spanning New Jersey, Connecticut, Delaware, Maryland, Rhode Island, and Massachusetts. The NWS predicts between 1 to 2 feet (30 to 61 centimeters) of snow in many areas, with potential for flooding in parts of New York and New Jersey.
Cody Snell, a meteorologist at the NWS Weather Prediction Center, highlighted the unusual scale of the impending weather event.
"While we do get plenty of these nor'easters that produce heavy snow and strong impacts, it's been several years since we saw one of this magnitude across this large of a region in this very populated part of the country," he stated.
Major carriers, including Delta, American, and United, have grounded flights in the New York City area and Boston’s Logan Airport ahead of a massive nor’easter. JetBlue alone cut 40% of its Sunday schedule, according to FlightAware data.
Over 3,000 flights have been axed and at least 12,000 delayed at New York’s major airports as a historic blizzard threatens to bury the region in at least two feet of snow.
With perilous conditions expected to batter the Northeast on Sunday, several major airlines grounded flights Saturday at key hubs, including JFK, LaGuardia, Newark, and airports in Philadelphia and Boston. The number is expected to skyrocket once snow begins to fall, according to FOX Weather.
The storm is anticipated to begin as rainfall in some locations before worsening, with the heaviest snowfall projected for overnight Sunday into Monday. Some areas could experience up to 2 inches (5 centimeters) of snow per hour before conditions ease by Monday afternoon. Gusts reaching 55 mph (80 kph) are expected, creating whiteout conditions that "will make travel treacherous and potentially life-threatening." The combination of strong winds and heavy snow could also lead to downed power lines and widespread outages.
Officials have been scrambling to adjust their preparations, as earlier forecasts had indicated a much more limited impact.
New York Mayor Zohran Mamdani acknowledged the rapid change in predictions, stating: "We saw on Friday there was expectation that the likelihood was that we were going to face maybe 3 to 4 inches of snow. Quickly that then changed. So we want to make sure that we make a decision based on up-to-date and accurate information."
The city is expanding its snow-clearing efforts, deploying additional equipment and utilising geocoding to manage bus stops and crosswalks.
The impending storm has prompted businesses to prepare for extensive operations. John Berlingieri, who runs Berrington Snow Management on Long Island, canceled a family trip to Puerto Rico to ready his company for what he described as a "mammoth task" of clearing millions of square feet of asphalt.
His employees spent days recharging equipment and replacing wipers, with Berlingieri anticipating "at least one week of work around the clock. We’re going to work 24 to 36 hours straight, sleep for a few hours and then go back."
In Atlantic City, New Jersey, officials have urged residents and casino visitors to avoid streets, particularly in low-lying areas susceptible to flooding.
Scott Evans, the city's fire chief and emergency management coordinator, warned, "I could go on and on probably with a good two dozen streets where we know we will get water and there will be snow on top of that. So you won’t be able to see it until it's too late. So therefore please stay at home."
The storm's arrival comes as the icy remnants of a previous snowstorm were finally melting away. Across the region, many churches have canceled Sunday services and other activities, with St. Veronica Parish in Howell, New Jersey, adding an extra Mass on Saturday evening. The Rev. Peter James Alindogan posted online, urging parishioners: "Please stay safe, avoid unnecessary travel, and keep one another in prayer during the storm."

Pakistan launches strikes in Afghanistan, ‘dozens’ killed and wounded, Kabul says
Pakistan launched multiple cross-border strikes targeting "terrorist training camps and hideouts" in eastern Afghanistan, the information ministry said Sunday. Afghanistan's defence ministry said "dozens" of civilians, including women and children, were killed and wounded as tensions between the two countries escalated at the start of the Muslim holy month of Ramadan.

Pakistan said Sunday it launched multiple air strikes targeting militants in neighbouring Afghanistan, where the government reported children were among dozens of people killed and wounded.
The overnight attacks were the most extensive since border clashes in October killed more than 70 people on both sides and wounded hundreds.

Islamabad said it hit seven sites along the border region targeting Afghanistan-based militant groups "in the aftermath of recent suicide bombing incidents in Pakistan".
The statement said Pakistan carried out "intelligence-based selective targeting of seven terrorist camps and hideouts" belonging to the Pakistani Taliban as well as Islamic State (IS) group's regional affiliate.
Afghanistan's defence ministry said "dozens of innocent civilians, including women and children, were martyred and wounded" when strikes hit a madrasa and homes in Nangarhar and Paktika provinces.
An AFP journalist in Nangarhar's Bihsud district said residents from around the remote and mountainous area joined rescuers in one village, using a digger and shovels to search for bodies under the rubble.
"People here are ordinary people. The residents of this village are our relatives. When the bombing happened, one person who survived was shouting for help," said neighbour Amin Gul Amin, 37.
Nangarhar police told AFP the bombardment started at around midnight and hit three districts.
"Civilians were killed. In one house, there were 23 family members. Five wounded people were taken out," said police spokesperson Sayed Tayeeb Hammad.
'Calculated response'
Afghanistan's defence ministry said it will "deliver an appropriate and calculated response" to the Pakistani strikes.
The two countries have been locked in an increasingly bitter dispute since the Taliban authorities retook control of Afghanistan in 2021.
Pakistani military action killed 70 Afghan civilians between October and December, according to the UN mission in Afghanistan.
Several rounds of negotiations followed an initial ceasefire brokered by Qatar and Turkey, but they have failed to produce a lasting agreement.
Saudi Arabia intervened this month, mediating the release of three Pakistani soldiers captured by Afghanistan in October.
The deteriorating relationship has hit people in both countries, with the land border largely shut for months.
Pakistan said Sunday that despite repeated urging by Islamabad, the Taliban authorities have failed to act against militant groups using Afghan territory to carry out attacks in Pakistan.
The Afghan government has denied harbouring militants.
Islamabad launched the strikes after a suicide blast at a Shiite mosque in Islamabad two weeks ago and other such attacks more recently in northwestern Pakistan.
The IS group had claimed responsibility for the mosque bombing, which killed at least 40 people and wounded more than 160 in the deadliest attack in Islamabad since 2008.
The militant group's regional chapter, Islamic State-Khorasan, also claimed a deadly suicide bombing at a Kabul restaurant last month.

Pakistan launches airstrikes on eastern, southeastern Afghanistan
Islamabad says forces struck 7 targets in response to recent suicide bombings in Pakistan; Afghanistan says 'dozens' of people, including women and children, were killed, vows 'appropriate' response
ISTANBUL / KARACHI
Pakistani jets carried out airstrikes in eastern and southeastern Afghanistan early Sunday, targeting what Islamabad described as militant hideouts, while Afghan officials said civilians were killed and vowed retaliation.
On US social media company X, Pakistan’s Information Ministry said the cross-border strikes hit “seven terrorist camps and hideouts” belonging to the Pakistani Taliban and the ISIS Khorasan group.
The ministry said it had “conclusive evidence” that recent suicide bombings, including one in the capital Islamabad, were planned and launched from Afghan territory.
Pakistan’s State Minister for Interior Talal Chaudhry told local broadcaster Geo News that at least 70 “terrorists” were killed in the strikes, citing preliminary reports.
Afghanistan’s Defense Ministry said “an appropriate and measured response will be taken at a suitable time,” according to a statement posted on X.
Afghan broadcaster Tolo News reported that the airstrikes struck the Khogyani, Ghani Khel, and Behsud districts of the Nangarhar province, as well as the Barmal and Urgun districts in the Paktika province. Citing local sources, it said civilians were among those targeted.
Enayatullah Khwarazmi, a spokesperson for Afghanistan’s Defense Ministry, and government spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid both said the strikes had killed and wounded dozens of women and children.
Pakistan has seen a surge in militant violence in recent years, much of it blamed on the Pakistani Taliban and outlawed Baloch separatist groups.
Islamabad accuses the Pakistani Taliban of operating from Afghanistan, a charge the Taliban-led government in Kabul has repeatedly denied.
Relations between the neighbors have been tense since the deadly clashes last October. A ceasefire mediated by Qatar largely held, but subsequent talks in Istanbul failed to produce a formal agreement.

From abdication to Diana, Harry and ex-Prince Andrew. A look at major British royal scandals
Britain’s monarchy faces fresh strain as police investigate the former Prince Andrew over alleged misconduct as a former trade envoy
- Bookmark
Holding prestige but not power, Britain’s monarchy is finely tuned to public sentiment.
That's been evident with the disgrace of Andrew Mountbatten Windsor, the former prince who was arrested and held in custody for nearly 11 hours Thursday on suspicion of misconduct in public office.
Police are investigating whether Mountbatten-Windsor shared confidential trade information with the late convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein when the then-Prince Andrew was a U.K. trade envoy. The arrest is unrelated to allegations related to Epstein’s sex trafficking.
Mountbatten-Windsor has consistently denied any wrongdoing in his association with Epstein but has not commented on the most recent allegations, which stem from the release of millions of pages of Epstein files by the U.S. Justice Department.
For King Charles III, his younger brother's travails have overshadowed almost everything during his reign, now in its fourth year.
The king, who is also contending with an unspecified form of cancer, has to ensure that it is business as usual. The institution requires nothing less.
But the continuing investigations into Mountbatten-Windsor, the image of him slouched in the back of his chauffeur-driven car, seemingly shocked and confused, will not be easy to dislodge.
The king is doing his best to insulate the monarchy from any further scandals relating to Andrew and his connections with Epstein, who took his own life in a New York jail in August 2019 while awaiting trial on sex-trafficking charges.
He has stripped Andrew of all his titles and honors and banished him from his mansion near Windsor Castle. Now, the king says, the law "must take its course.’’
Where that course leads, nobody knows. For the British monarchy, it's potentially a crisis as grave as any it has experienced since its current iteration — the House of Windsor — was born more than a century ago.
World War I
The House of Windsor was born out of conflict.
The royal families of Europe are intertwined, and Britain’s is heavily German, especially after Queen Victoria married Prince Albert of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha, with whom she had nine children.
When Britain and Germany went to war in 1914, some members of the wider British royal family found themselves on opposing sides.
Britain’s King George V changed the family name from Saxe-Coburg and Gotha to Windsor in 1917, and initiated legislation to strike out the titles of princes and lords who had backed the Germans.
One target was Prince Ernest Augustus, Duke of Cumberland and Teviotdale, who was a U.K. royal and also a prince of Hanover. His title was removed for being an enemy of Britain under the 1917 act, which was enacted in 1919, once the war was over.
According to the House of Commons Library, “this was the first and only time such a title has been removed in this way.”
Mountbatten-Windsor is no longer a prince or Duke of York, but remains eighth in line to the throne. The current British government said Friday it is considering introducing legislation to remove Andrew from the line of succession to the crown.
The abdication
The relationship between Edward, Prince of Wales, and U.S. socialite Wallis Simpson was a headache that turned into a constitutional crisis. Simpson was twice divorced, and Edward, the heir to the throne, was destined to be ceremonial head of the Church of England, which did not allow divorced people to remarry in church.
The prince became King Edward VIII when his father King George V died in early 1936. He continued to say he wanted to marry Simpson, despite the opposition of the British government.
Forced to choose between duty and passion, he gave up the throne in December 1936, announcing in a radio broadcast that “I have found it impossible ... to discharge my duties as king as I would wish to do without the help and support of the woman I love.”
The news was a surprise to many in Britain, though not beyond it. British newspapers had not reported on the relationship, and American magazines had offending articles cut out before going on sale.
The abdication set the monarchy on a new course. Edward’s younger brother took the throne as King George VI. He was succeeded by his daughter, Queen Elizabeth II, and after her 70-year reign by her son, King Charles III. All doubled down on the idea that the monarch’s primary attribute should be a sense of duty — something Edward, in the popular imagination, lacked.
Edward and Wallis, thereafter the Duke and Duchess of Windsor and suspected by some of Nazi sympathies, were sent to the Bahamas, where he served as governor. After the war they mostly stayed away from Britain, living a life of nomadic luxury.
Princess Diana's death
The death of Princess Diana — the ex-wife of Charles — in a car crash in Paris in 1997, at the age of 36, shocked the world and left her family, including sons William and Harry, then 15 and 12, in mourning.
The strength of public feeling caught the royal family by surprise. Mounds of floral tributes piled up outside the gates of Buckingham Palace and Diana’s home at Kensington Palace to mourn a princess who had been ostracized by the royal family after her divorce from Charles in 1992.
The queen was at Balmoral in Scotland on her summer holiday with her husband Prince Philip, Charles, William and Harry. The family kept their grief private and stuck to routine — taking the ashen-faced boys to church on Sunday morning — and the queen did not issue a statement for several days.
She was advised to make a public display of grief by Prime Minister Tony Blair, who perfectly caught the public mood with his own tribute calling Diana “the people’s princess.”
After newspaper headlines urging “Speak to us Ma’am,” and “Show us you care,” the queen made a live televised address to the nation on the eve of Diana’s funeral.
“What I say to you now, as your queen and as a grandmother, I say from my heart,” the queen said, acknowledging the country’s grief, praising Diana and promising to cherish her memory.
The trouble with Harry
Not long ago, Andrew had been trying to regain favor with the family, benefiting indirectly from the trouble with Prince Harry.
Harry became estranged from his father and older brother, Prince William, heir to the throne, when he and his wife, Meghan, stepped down from their working roles and moved to California in 2020. The couple famously aired their grievances with the royal family in a tell-all interview to Oprah Winfrey and a revealing Netflix series. Harry then fueled the tensions by revealing personal conversations in his memoir, “Spare.”
Harry also broke from royal protocol in turning to the courts to sort out his legal problems. He became the first senior royal to testify in court in more than a century in his successful phone hacking lawsuit against the Daily Mirror.
A failed legal effort to restore his police protection detail that was stripped from him when he left royal work, though, was seen as an attack on his father’s government.
When the courts finally rejected the lawsuit, it provided a chance for a reunion between father and son. The two shared a cup of tea at Charles’ London abode, Clarence House, in September 2024. It was their first meeting in over a year.
It lasted less than an hour.

Russia strikes American enterprise in Sumy region, Sybiha says
According to Ukrinform, Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha reported this on the social network X.
“Today, Russia struck another American business in Ukraine—a civilian production facility of Mondelez in Trostianets—one of the first major U.S. investments in Ukraine’s independent economy,” he noted.

Sybiha stated that the missile hit one of the production buildings. Fortunately, there were no casualties.
The minister stressed that this is not a military facility, but an enterprise that has been operating since the 1990s, producing world-famous brands, providing jobs for Ukrainians, and contributing to the economies of Ukraine and the United States.
“When Russian missiles hit such sites, they are not only targeting Ukraine. They are targeting American business interests in Europe,” the foreign minister stated.
Moscow cannot speak about economic dialogue with the United States while attacking US-owned production facilities, he noted.
“Targeting peaceful industry is not warfare—it is deliberate economic terror. Accountability must follow,” Sybiha emphasized.
As reported by Ukrinform, the Ukrainian foreign minister said that Russia is deliberately striking American enterprises in Ukraine, with 47% of such companies affected during the full-scale war and 38% suffering casualties.

US deports gay asylum seeker to a country where homosexuality is illegal

US deports gay asylum seeker to another country where homosexuality is illegal
Same-sex relationships are punishable in Cameroon by up to five years in prison
- Bookmark
Farah, a 21-year-old gay Moroccan woman, is now in hiding in her home country after being deported by the Trump administration.
She had sought asylum in the U.S., fleeing brutal family violence in Morocco, where being gay is illegal and punishable by three years in prison.
Her ordeal began when her family and her partner's family discovered their relationship, leading to severe beatings. Kicked out, she fled with her partner, but her family tracked her down and attempted to kill her, she claimed.
Desperate, Farah and her partner secured visas for Brazil, then trekked through six countries to the U.S. border, requesting asylum. Despite U.S. immigration judge protection orders, she faced a third-country deportation by the Trump administration – to Cameroon, where homosexuality is also illegal.
Now back in Morocco, Farah lives in constant fear. “It is hard to live and work with the fear of being tracked once again by my family,” she said. “But there is nothing I can do. I have to work.”
She requested anonymity due to persecution fears; lawyers verified her account.
A year in detention
Farah and her partner arrived in the U.S. in early 2025. But instead of finding the freedom to be herself, Farah said she was detained for almost a year, first in Arizona, then in Louisiana.
“It was very cold,” she said of detention. “And we only had very thin blankets.” Medical care was inadequate, she said.
She was denied asylum, but in August she received a protection order from an U.S. immigration judge, who ruled she cannot be deported to Morocco because that would endanger her life. Her partner, denied asylum and a protection order, was deported.
Farah said she was three days from a hearing on her release when she was handcuffed by Immigration and Customs Enforcement and put on a plane to an African country she had never visited, and one where homosexuality is illegal: Cameroon. She was put in a detention facility.
“They asked me if I wanted to stay in Cameroon, and I told them that I can’t stay in Cameroon and risk my life in a place where I would still be endangered,” she said. She was flown to Morocco.
Most deportees had protection orders
She is one of dozens of people confirmed to be deported from the U.S. by the Trump administration to third countries despite having legal protection from U.S. immigration judges. The real number is unknown.
The administration has used third-country deportations to pressure migrants who are in the U.S. illegally to leave on their own, saying they could end up “in any number of third countries."
The detention facility in Cameroon's capital of Yaounde, where Farah was held, currently has 15 deportees from various African countries who arrived on two flights, and none is Cameroonian, according to lawyer Joseph Awah Fru, who represents them.
All nine deportees on the first flight in January, including Farah, had received a judge's protection orders, Fru said. He never met Farah but was aware of her case.
Another flight on Monday brought eight people. Two of them, a woman from Ghana and a woman from Congo, said they had protection orders, speaking on condition of anonymity for fear of retaliation. Three freelance journalists reporting on the deportations to Cameroon for the Associated Press were briefly detained there.
Deporting people to a third country where they could be sent home was effectively a legal “loophole,” said Alma David, an immigration lawyer with the U.S.-based Novo Legal Group who has helped deportees and verified Farah's case.
“By deporting them to Cameroon, and giving them no opportunity to contest being sent to a country whose government hoped to quietly send them back to the very countries where they face grave danger, the U.S. not only violated their due process rights but our own immigration laws, our obligations under international treaties and even DHS’ own procedures," David said.
The U.S. Department of Homeland Security earlier confirmed there were deportations to Cameroon in January.
“We are applying the law as written. If a judge finds an illegal alien has no right to be in this country, we are going to remove them. Period,” it said, and asserted that the third-country agreements “ensure due process under the U.S. Constitution.”
Asked about the deportations to Cameroon, the U.S. State Department on Friday told the AP it had “no comment on the details of our diplomatic communications with other governments." It did not reply to further questions.
Cameroon’s Foreign Ministry didn’t respond to a request for comment.
‘They were given two impossible choices’
Farah was one of two women from the first group of deportees to return to Morocco.
“They were given two impossible choices,” David said, and asserted that claiming asylum was not clearly presented as one of them. “This was before the lawyer had access to them. They’d been alone there in that facility without any help from anybody or any indication that there was gonna be an option other than going back to their home countries.”
Fru said he has not been granted access to the deportees. He said the assistant to the country director for the International Organization for Migration, a U.N.-affiliated organization, told him he must apply to speak to them. Fru plans to do that Monday.
The IOM told the AP it was “aware of the removal of migrants from the United States of America to some African countries” and added that it “works with people facing difficult decisions about whether to return to their country of origin." It said its role is providing accurate information about options and ensuring that "anyone who chooses to return does so voluntarily.”
The IOM said the facility in Yaounde was managed by the authorities in Cameroon. It did not respond to further questions.
African nations paid millions by US
Cameroon is one of at least seven African nations to receive deported third-country nationals in a deal with the U.S. Others include South Sudan, Rwanda, Uganda, Eswatini, Ghana and Equatorial Guinea.
Some have received millions of dollars in return, according to documents released by the State Department. Details of other agreements, including the one with Cameroon, have not been released.
The Trump administration has spent at least $40 million to deport about 300 migrants to countries other than their own, according to a report released last week by the Democratic staff of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.
According to internal administration documents reviewed by the AP, 47 third-country agreements are in various stages of negotiation.
In Morocco, Farah said it was hard to hear U.S. officials refer to people like her as a threat.
“The USA is built on immigration and by immigrant labor, so we’re clearly not all threats,” she said. “What was done to me was unfair. A normal deportation would have been fair, but to go through so much and lose so much, only to be deported in such a way, is cruel.”

Germany joins growing ranks of countries considering social media bans

Germany joins growing ranks of countries considering social media bans
Stuttgart: Germany’s ruling conservatives have passed a motion to ban social media use for under 14s and introduce more stringent digital verification checks for teenagers, building momentum for such limits in Germany and elsewhere in Europe.
At a party conference in the city of Stuttgart, Chancellor Friedrich Merz’s Christian Democratic Union also called for fines for online platforms that failed to enforce such limits, and European Union-wide harmonisation of age standards.
A growing number of countries, including Spain, Greece, France and Britain, are looking at similar social media bans or restrictions on accessing platforms like TikTok or Instagram.
It follows the example of Australia, which last year became the first country to force platforms to cut off access for children under 16.
European nations are more broadly ratcheting up pressure on social media companies, risking a backlash from the United States. President Donald Trump has threatened tariffs and sanctions if EU countries impose new tech taxes or online regulations that hit US firms.
“We call on the federal government to introduce a legal age limit of 14 for the use of social networks and to address the special need for protection in the digital sphere up to the age of 16,” said the motion that passed on Saturday (German time).
Merz’s coalition partners the Social Democrats have also backed social media curbs for children. Pressure from both parties in the coalition makes it increasingly likely that the federal government will push for restrictions.
However, under Germany’s federal system, media regulation is a state-level responsibility and states must negotiate with each other to agree consistent nationwide rules.
Last week French President Emmanuel Macron said one of his priorities for the Group of Seven presidency will be protecting children from the harmful effects of social media and artificial intelligence, calling on countries like India to support the measures.
“There is no reason our children should be exposed online to what is legally forbidden in the real world,” Macron said at the India AI Summit in New Delhi on Thursday. “One of our priorities during the G7 presidency will be children’s protection against AI and digital-related abuse.” France holds the rotating presidency of the G7 in 2026.
Macron highlighted France’s initiative to ban social media networks for children under 15.
Modi echoed Macron’s push to protect children online during his own address at the summit on Thursday. “We have to be more alert about children’s safety,” Modi said. “Like their schools’ syllabus is curated, AI space should be child safe and family-guided.”
India’s Technology Minister Ashwini Vaishnaw said last week that the government was holding discussions on “the right way to go forward” with possible age limits for social media and is also addressing the issue of deepfakes with platforms.

After 4 years of war by Russia in Ukraine, peace is still elusive despite a US push for a settlement

After 4 years of war by Russia in Ukraine, peace is still elusive despite a US push for a settlement
When Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine surpassed 1,418 days last month, it officially exceeded a historic milestone — the same span of time it took Moscow to defeat Nazi Germany in World War II
- Bookmark
When Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine surpassed 1,418 days last month, it officially exceeded a historic milestone — the same span of time it took Moscow to defeat Nazi Germany in World War II.
And unlike the Red Army that pushed all the way to Berlin eight decades ago in what it called the Great Patriotic War, Russia's 4-year-old, all-out invasion of its neighbor is still struggling to fully capture Ukraine’s eastern industrial heartland.
After Moscow failed to seize the capital of Kyiv and install a puppet government in February 2022, the conflict turned into trench warfare with tremendous cost. By some estimates, nearly 2 million soldiers are dead, wounded or missing on both sides in Europe’s most devastating conflict since World War II.
Russia has occupied about 20% of Ukrainian territory since illegally annexing Crimea in 2014, but its gains after the Feb. 24, 2022, invasion have been slow. NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte this month likened Moscow's advance to “the speed of a garden snail.”
Russian troops have moved only about 50 kilometers (about 30 miles) into the Donetsk region of eastern Ukraine in the past two years in a grinding battle for control of a few strongholds.
Despite the slow pace and high cost, President Vladimir Putin has maintained his maximalist demands in U.S.-mediated peace talks, saying Kyiv must pull its forces from the four Ukrainian regions that Moscow illegally annexed but never fully captured. He has repeatedly brandished his nuclear arsenal to prevent the West from boosting military support for Kyiv.
A war of attrition
Initially involving quick movements of large numbers of troops and tanks in Russia's opening blitz and Ukraine’s counteroffensive in fall 2022, the fighting morphed into bloody positional warfare along the 1,200-kilometer (750-mile) front line.
The Washington-based Center for Strategic and International Studies estimated Russian military casualties at 1.2 million, including 325,000 killed. It put Ukrainian troop casualties at up to 600,000, including up to 140,000 killed.
“Russia has suffered the highest casualty rate of any major power in any war since World War II, and its military has performed poorly, with historically slow rates of advance and little new territory to show for its efforts over the last two years,” it said, noting Russian troops were advancing an average of 70 meters (76 1/2 yards) a day in two years to capture the transport hub of Pokrovsk.
For the first time in military history, drones are playing a decisive role, making it effectively impossible for either side to covertly mass significant numbers of troops.
Since early in the conflict, Ukraine has relied on drones to offset Moscow's edge in firepower and stem its advances, but Russia has drastically expanded drone operations and introduced longer-range optical fiber-tethered drones to avoid electronic jamming. They widened the kill zone to 50 kilometers (about 30 miles) from the front, leaving the terrain tangled in strands of filament.
The mixture of high-tech drones and World War I-style trench fighting has seen small groups of infantry — often just two or three soldiers — try to infiltrate enemy positions into towns flattened by Russian heavy artillery and glide bombs. Ferrying supplies and evacuating the wounded is a major challenge as drones target supply routes.
Long-range attacks
Ukrainian officials described this winter as the most challenging of the war. Russia exponentially increased its strikes on the country's energy system, causing blackouts in Kyiv where power supplies to many were cut to a few hours a day amid bitter cold.
Russia also has increasingly targeted power lines aiming to halt energy transfers and split Ukraine's power grid into isolated islands, increasing pressure on the grid.
Ukraine retaliated with long-range drone attacks on oil refineries and other energy facilities deep inside Russia, aiming to drain Moscow's export revenues.
Its drones and missiles sank several Russian warships in the Black Sea, forcing Moscow to redeploy its fleet from Russia-occupied Crimea to Novorossiysk. And in an audacious attack code-named “Spiderweb,” Ukraine used drones from trucks to hit several air bases hosting long-range bombers across Russia in June, a humiliating blow to the Kremlin.
US pressure, conflicting demands
U.S. President Donald Trump, who once promised to end the war in a day, has pushed to end the fighting, but mediation efforts have run into sharply conflicting demands.
Putin wants Ukraine to pull its troops from the part of the Donetsk region it still controls, abandon its bid to join NATO, curb its military and grant official status to the Russian language, among other demands Ukraine has rejected.
Russia left the door open to Kyiv's prospective European Union membership, but it firmly ruled out any European peacekeepers deployed to Ukraine as part of a settlement.
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy wants a ceasefire along the existing line of contact, but Putin rules out a truce, demanding a comprehensive peace agreement.
“The territorial issue is important to the Kremlin, but the war has a more ambitious goal: to create a Ukraine that would be entirely within Russia’s sphere of influence and not perceived by Moscow as ‘anti-Russia,’” observed Tatiana Stanovaya of Carnegie Russia Eurasia Center.
Ukraine and its allies accuse Putin of dragging out talks while he seizes more territory. The Kremlin accuses Kyiv and its European supporters of trying to undermine a tentative agreement reached by Trump and Putin at their Alaska summit.
While sticking to their positions, Putin and Zelenskyy have praised U.S. mediation and tried to curry favor with Trump.
After a disastrous White House meeting a year ago, Zelenskyy has adopted a more practical negotiating stance, emphasizing Ukraine’s goodwill.
After Trump called for a presidential election in Ukraine, Zelenskyy signaled readiness for it even though it’s banned under martial law. The election could be coupled with a referendum on a peace deal, he said, but insisted the vote was only possible once a ceasefire is established and Ukraine gets security guarantees from the U.S. and other allies.
Elusive settlement
Zelenskyy said the White House has set a June deadline for the war's end and will likely pressure both sides to meet it. But even as Trump appears eager for a peace deal before the U.S. midterm elections, challenges remain.
With Putin insisting on Ukraine’s pullback from Donetsk and Zelenskyy ruling it out, a quick deal appears unlikely. Zelenskyy also expressed skepticism about a compromise U.S. proposal to turn the eastern region into a free economic zone.
The Kremlin expects its attacks eventually will force Kyiv to accept Moscow’s terms. Ukraine hopes it can hold on until Trump loses patience and increases sanctions on Russia, forcing Putin to halt his aggression. But Trump often appears to be losing patience with Zelenskyy instead.
The war and Western sanctions have increasingly strained Russia’s economy. Growth has slowed to a near halt, due to persistent inflation and labor shortages. The latest U.S. sanctions on Russian oil exports have added to the strain.
But even with the economic challenges, Russia's defense plants have increased weapons output and its government has shielded key social groups like soldiers and industrial workers from hardship.
“Its economy is poorer, less efficient and less promising than it might otherwise have been,” wrote Richard Connolly of the Royal United Services Institute. “But it remains capable of sustaining the war. Its elites are more dependent on the regime, not less. Its political system is insulated from the transmission of economic discontent into pressure for regime change.”

Homeland Security suspends TSA PreCheck and Global Entry airport security programs
The U.S. Department of Homeland Security is suspending the TSA PreCheck and Global Entry airport security programs as a partial government shutdown continues
- Bookmark
The U.S. Department of Homeland Security is suspending the TSA PreCheck and Global Entry airport security programs as a partial government shutdown continues.
The programs are designed to help speed registered travelers through security lines. Suspending them could cause headaches for fliers.
Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said in a statement that “shutdowns have serious real world consequences.” She also said that “TSA and CBP are prioritizing the general traveling population at our airports and ports of entry and suspending courtesy and special privilege escorts.”
The partial government shutdown began Feb. 14 after Democrats and the White House were unable to reach a deal on legislation to fund the Department of Homeland Security. Democrats have been demanding changes to immigration operations that are core to President Donald Trump’s deportation campaign.
Democrats on the House Committee on Homeland Security criticized the decision about airport security.
They said on social media that the administration was “kneecapping the programs that make travel smoother and secure” and accused them of “ruining your travel on purpose.”

Trump ‘curious’ why Iran hasn’t capitulated, Witkoff says

Steve Witkoff, President Donald Trump’s special envoy to the Middle East, said Saturday that Trump is questioning why Iran has not agreed to a deal on its nuclear program.
In an interview with Fox News, Witkoff told Lara Trump, the president’s daughter-in-law, that Trump is “curious” about Iran’s position.
“He's curious as to why they haven't ... I don't want to use the word capitulated, but why they haven't capitulated,” Witkoff said.
He added that Trump is asking why, “under this sort of pressure with the amount of naval power that we have over there,” Iran has not approached the United States to state it does not seek a nuclear weapon and outline what it is prepared to do.
Witkoff said Trump’s red lines require Iran to maintain “zero enrichment” of uranium. He added that Iran has enriched uranium beyond levels needed for civilian purposes.
The interview came as Trump has called on Iran to reach a nuclear agreement while maintaining a US military presence in the Middle East in case diplomacy fails.
On Friday, Trump urged Iran to “better negotiate a fair deal.” He also cited a figure of 32,000 protesters killed in Iran, a number advanced by Iranian opposition groups that is significantly higher than other estimates.

Eight bodies recovered in Libya, Greece as Mediterranean death toll rises
Bodies of five asylum seekers wash ashore in Libya as three others die in a separate incident off the coast of Greece.
Police in Libya have recovered the bodies of five asylum seekers that washed ashore near the capital, Tripoli, as authorities in Greece announced the deaths of three others in a separate incident off the coast of Crete.
The bodies in Libya were found on Saturday by residents of the coastal town of Qasr al-Akhyar, according to a police officer.

Hassan al-Ghawil, head of investigations at the Qasr al-Akhyar police station, told the Reuters news agency that the bodies were all of “dark-skinned people”. Two of them were women.
He said people in the area had reported seeing a child’s body wash ashore before the waves returned it to sea.
“We reported to the Red Crescent to recover the bodies,” said Ghawil. “The bodies we found are still intact, and we think there are more bodies to wash ashore.”
The tragedy came as Greek authorities were responding to a separate incident in the eastern Mediterranean.
The Athens News Agency reported on Saturday that authorities had recovered three bodies and rescued at least 20 people after a wooden boat carrying migrants and asylum seekers capsized off the coast of Crete.
Most of the survivors were Egyptians and Sudanese people, the agency reported. They also included four minors.
According to the Greek public broadcaster ERT, the wooden boat capsized when passengers were trying to climb up the ladders during a rescue effort involving a commercial ship.
The search for survivors was continuing with four patrol boats, an aircraft, and two ships from the European border agency Frontex, a spokesperson for the Greek coastguard told the AFP news agency.
According to ERT, survivors said about 50 people had been on board the wooden boat.
A second boat carrying about 40 migrants and asylum seekers was spotted in the area, leading to another rescue operation.
The deaths come after the International Organization for Migration (IOM) said on February 9 that some 53 migrants, including two babies, were dead or missing after a rubber boat carrying 55 people capsized off the coast of Zuwara city.
In January alone, the IOM said, at least 375 migrants were reported dead or missing following multiple “invisible” shipwrecks in the central Mediterranean due to extreme weather, with hundreds more deaths believed to be unrecorded.
“These repeated incidents underscore the persistent and deadly risks faced by migrants and refugees attempting the dangerous crossing,” the group said.
Thousands of people attempt the perilous crossing from Libya to Europe over the Mediterranean every year. Libya has become a transit route for people fleeing conflict and poverty to Europe since the fall in 2011 of longtime ruler Muammar Gaddafi.
Last week, a United Nations report said migrants in Libya, including young girls, are at risk of being killed, tortured, raped or put into domestic slavery, and called for a moratorium on the return of migrant boats to the country until human rights are ensured.
Many of the migrants and asylum seekers departing Libya seek to arrive in Crete, the gateway to the European Union.
According to the UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), more than 16,770 people seeking asylum in Europe arrived in Crete in 2025.
Faced with the surge in arrivals, the conservative Greek government suspended the processing of asylum applications for three months last summer, particularly for those arriving from Libya.
The UNHCR says 107 people died or went missing in Greek waters in 2025.

Thailand moves to cut sugar in popular drinks amid health drive

A crowd of customers, holding phones aloft, watch intently as Auntie Nid mixes up her bestseller: an iced Thai tea.
Condensed milk is poured into a glass, followed by three heaped tablespoons of sugar, and then freshly strained tea. The end product – a deep orange, creamy treat – is poured into a plastic bag filled with ice.
“I want to spoil my customers,” says Auntie Nid, 68, who prefers to be known by her nickname.
The Thai government, however, is trying to reduce the amount of sugar added to the country’s most popular drinks.
This month, nine of the country’s major coffee chains committed to halving the amount of sugar that is considered “normal sweetness” in some of their drinks as part of a new campaign to reset people’s taste buds and improve public health.
Thai people consume an average of 21 teaspoons of sugar a day – far more than the World Health Organization’s recommended daily limit of six teaspoons.
Sugary drinks are a major culprit, with Thailand historically being one of Asia’s biggest consumers of calories from sweetened drinks.
Thailand has taken other steps to tackle sugar, including a sugar tax, which was introduced gradually from 2017, with the last phase rolled out last year. This targets pre-packaged sugary drinks.
The tax has helped, said Pojjana Hunchangsith, assistant professor at Mahidol University. “One of the biggest impacts has been product reformulation, with many manufacturers lowering sugar levels to avoid higher tax rate,” she said.
However, the tax does not affect street vendors or cafes, where menus are packed with a dazzling array of sweet options – from boba milk teas and iced cocoa, to lemon tea and pink milk, a Thai drink made from sala syrup. “They are very important sources of sugar intake in Thailand,” Pojjana added, but freshly made drinks are far more difficult to regulate.
The latest government initiative will include some of the country’s biggest cafe chains. Many shops already display cards offering customers different levels of sweetness: 0%, 25%, 50%, 75% and 100%. Under the new campaign, for certain drinks, 100% sweetness will be half as sugary as it once was.
Ann Thumthong, 55, a taxi driver in Bangkok, welcomes the measures, saying it is difficult to avoid sweet things when buying food and drinks.
It is possible to retrain your sweetness preferences so you need less sugar, Thumthong said, adding that she has become more health conscious with age. “For me, in the past, when I finished the meal I went straight for the desert, but now I opt for fruits instead,” she said.
Phumsith Mahasuweerachai, associate professor at the faculty of economics in Khon Kaen University, said it was possible to encourage customers to make better choices even with simple adjustments. He conducted a study, which found that simply giving customers the option to choose how sweet their drinks would be prompted them to opt for less sugary drinks. Providing calorie information did not significantly change their choices, he added.
“If we don’t nudge [customers] or prompt them, it’s difficult for them to make the change,” he said. “They go to the coffee shop and it’s automatic.”
At Auntie Nid’s shop, customer Phakamas, 39, has just bought an iced cocoa on her lunch break, a relief in the Bangkok heat.
“I think consuming sugar is OK, I don’t consume it very frequently – I might consume a cup or two during the week,” she says.
Auntie Nid, whose shop has served teas and coffees in Bangkok’s old town for 30 years, can’t comprehend changing her recipe.
“No, no, no,” she says, as a queue of tourists, as well as some locals workers and students stretches out the door. The shop has always been popular, she says, but has become especially famous among foreign visitors thanks to social media.
“The reasons why these drinks are popular is because of their strong, intense taste,” she says. “Without sugar, the coffee and tea will be bland and bitter.”

Pakistan’s military has carried out air strikes in Afghanistan, targeting what it called “camps and hideouts” belonging to armed groups behind a spate of recent attacks, including a deadly suicide bombing at a Shia mosque in Islamabad.
Taliban's Ministry of Defence condemned Sunday’s attacks, arguing they “hit a religious school and residential homes” in the border provinces of Nangarhar and Paktika, “resulting in dozens of deaths and injuries, including women and children”.
Afghan sources told Al Jazeera that at least 17 people were killed in Nangarhar.
Pakistan’s Ministry of Information and Broadcasting said in a statement on X that the country’s military conducted “intelligence-based, selective operations” against seven camps and hideouts belonging to the Pakistan Taliban, also known as Tehrik-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), and its affiliates.
It said Pakistan has repeatedly urged Afghanistan’s Taliban government to take action to prevent armed groups from using Afghan territory to launch attacks, but that Kabul has failed to “undertake any substantive action”.

Peace in Europe possible only with Russia’s participation — Germany’s ruling AfD party

BERLIN, February 22. /TASS/. Co-chair of the Alternative for Germany (AfD) Alice Weidel stated that peace in Europe is possible only in cooperation with Russia and called the current approach to relations with Moscow erroneous.
She has landed sharp criticism regarding the foreign policy rhetoric voiced by the current German government as part of the CDU/CSU and SPD bloc.
"I have no clue which course the federal government of Germany pursues, but it is definitely not a peaceful one," she said. "As an Alternative for Germany, we want harmonious relations with our neighbors and with our European partners. And that's what we stand for."
Weidel stressed that the Gernam political party of Alternative for Germany strives to reach mutual understanding with its partners.
"We seek a dialogue, an exchange of opinions, and a certain level of communication both with the United States and Russia," she continued. "It is because that peace in Europe is possible only with Russia, not without it"
"That is why we have always considered the current approach to relations with Russia to be erroneous," Weidel added.
Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said earlier that President Vladimir Putin has never refused from direct contacts and if German Chancellor Friedrich Merz and French President Emmanuel Macron want this, all they have to do is just call.
Trilateral talks on Ukraine involving Russia, the United States, and Ukraine were held in Geneva on February 17 and 18. On the first day, they lasted about six hours, on the second about two. Head of the Russian delegation presidential aide Vladimir Medinsky described the negotiations as difficult, but businesslike. According to him, a new meeting on the Ukrainian settlement will be held soon.
The first round was held in Abu Dhabi on January 23-24, followed by the second round on February 4-5.

Bypassing court ruling, Trump imposes 15% US global tariff under alternative mechanism

Bypassing court ruling, Trump imposes 15% US global tariff under alternative mechanism
After US Supreme Court nullified previous program, president invokes Section 122, giving him 150 days before congressional extension is needed, to search for other legal avenues
WASHINGTON (Reuters) — US President Donald Trump said on Saturday that he would impose a 15% global tariff on US imports from all countries, the maximum level allowed under the law, after the country’s Supreme Court struck down his previous tariff program.
The move came less than 24 hours after Trump announced a 10% across-the-board tariff on Friday after the court’s decision. The president on Saturday upped the rate to 15%.
The ruling found that Trump had exceeded his authority when he imposed an array of higher rates under an economic emergency law.
The new levies are grounded in a separate but untested law, known as Section 122, that allows tariffs up to 15% but requires congressional approval to extend them after 150 days. No US president has previously invoked Section 122, and its use could lead to further legal challenges.
Trade experts and congressional aides are skeptical that the Republican-majority Congress would extend the tariffs, given polls that show growing numbers of Americans blame the duties for higher prices.
Trump eyes other ways to impose tariffs
In a social media post on Saturday, Trump said he would use the 150-day period to work on issuing other “legally permissible” tariffs. The administration intends to rely on two other statutes that permit import taxes on specific products or countries based on investigations into national security or unfair trade practices.
“I, as President of the United States of America, will be, effective immediately, raising the 10% Worldwide Tariff on Countries, many of which have been ‘ripping’ the US off for decades, without retribution (until I came along!), to the fully allowed, and legally tested, 15% level,” he wrote in a Truth Social post.
The Section 122 tariffs include exemptions for certain products, including critical minerals, metals and energy products, according to the White House.
Wendy Cutler, a former senior US trade official and senior vice president at the Asia Society think tank, said she was surprised Trump had not opted for the maximum Section 122 rate on Friday, adding that his rapid-fire change underscored the uncertainty trading partners faced.
The Supreme Court’s decision, authored by Chief Justice John Roberts, concluded that the law Trump had used for most of his tariffs, the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, did not grant the president the powers he claimed.
Roberts was joined in the majority by fellow conservatives Neil Gorsuch and Amy Coney Barrett, both Trump appointees, and the court’s three liberal justices.
Trump reacted with fury to the ruling, calling the justices in the majority “fools” and describing Gorsuch and Barrett in particular as “embarrassments,” while vowing to continue his global trade war.
Some foreign leaders applauded the decision. French President Emmanuel Macron said on Saturday that the ruling showed it is good for democracies to have counterweights to power and the rule of law.
German Chancellor Friedrich Merz said he expected the decision would ease the burden on German companies. He said he would use his upcoming US trip to reiterate that “tariffs harm everyone.”
Trump aide says trade deals must be honored
Trump has used the tariffs, or the threat of imposing them, to extract trade deals from foreign countries.
After the court’s decision, Trump’s trade representative, Jamieson Greer, told Fox News on Friday that those countries must honor agreements even if they call for higher rates than the Section 122 tariffs.
Exports to the US from countries such as Malaysia and Cambodia would continue to be taxed at their negotiated rates of 19%, even though the universal rate is lower, Greer said.
Indonesia’s chief negotiator for US tariffs, Airlangga Hartarto, said the trade deal between the countries that set US tariffs at 19%, which was signed on Friday, remains in force despite the court decision.
The ruling could spell good news for countries like Brazil, which has not negotiated a deal with Washington to lower its 40% tariff rate but could now see its tariff rate drop to 15%, at least temporarily.
With November’s midterm elections looming, Trump’s approval rating on his handling of the economy has steadily declined during his year in office, with 34% of respondents saying they approve and 57% saying they disapprove in a Reuters/Ipsos poll that closed on Monday.
Affordability remains a top concern for voters. Democrats, who need to flip only three Republican-held seats in the US House of Representatives in November to win a majority, have blamed Trump’s tariffs for exacerbating the rising cost of living.

Stars descend on the BAFTA film awards, with 'One Battle' and 'Sinners' leading the race
The BAFTA Film Awards have a tight race, with “One Battle After Another” and “Sinners” leading the nominations
- Bookmark
TO MOVE AT 0500GMT SUNDAY
Politically charged thriller “One Battle After Another” and blues-steeped epic “Sinners” lead the race for Sunday’s British Academy Film Awards as the two movies jostle for awards-season supremacy.
Oddsmakers suggest Shakespearean family tragedy “Hamnet” could beat them to best picture if British film industry voters respond to the emotionally rich story, earthy English setting and intense performances of Chloé Zhao’s adaptation of Maggie O’Farrell’s historical novel.
“One Battle” has 14 nominations, including best picture and acting nods for five of its cast. “Sinners” is just behind with 13, while “Hamnet” and the ping-pong odyssey “Marty Supreme” each have 11 nominations.
Guillermo del Toro’s reimagining of “Frankenstein” and Norwegian family drama “ Sentimental Value” each got eight nominations.
The British prizes, officially called the EE BAFTA Film Awards, often provide hints about who will win at Hollywood’s Academy Awards, held this year on March 15. In the Oscar nominations, “Sinners” leads the race with a record 16 nominations, followed by “One Battle After Another” with 13.
Stars including Emma Stone, Cillian Murphy, Glenn Close and Ethan Hawke are expected on the red carpet outside London’s Royal Festival Hall before a black-tie ceremony hosted by Scottish actor Alan Cumming.
Cumming, who hosts the U.S. version of reality show “The Traitors,” pledged to strike a “balance between celebration and mischief.”
The BAFTA best film nominees are “One Battle After Another,” “Hamnet,” “Marty Supreme,” “Sinners” and “Sentimental Value.” The BAFTAs also have a distinctly British accent, with a separate category for best British film. Its 10 nominees include “The Ballad of Wallis Island,” “Pillion,” “I Swear” and “Bridget Jones: Mad About the Boy.”
Directing contenders are Paul Thomas Anderson for “One Battle,” Josh Safdie for “Marty Supreme,” Ryan Coogler for “Sinners,” Yorgos Lanthimos for dystopian tragicomedy “Bugonia,” Joachim Trier for “Sentimental Value” and Zhao for “Hamnet.” Zhao will be the first female director to win two BAFTAs if she takes the prize. She won the directing award in 2021 for “Nomadland.”
Best leading actor nominees are bookies’ favorite Timothée Chalamet for “Marty Supreme,” Leonardo DiCaprio for “One Battle After Another,” Ethan Hawke for Broadway biopic “Blue Moon,” Michael B. Jordan for “Sinners,” Jesse Plemons for “Bugonia” and Robert Aramayo for playing a man with Tourette’s syndrome in biographical drama “I Swear.”
The leading actress category includes the strongly favored Jessie Buckley for her performance as Agnes Hathaway, wife of William Shakespeare, in “Hamnet.” She’s up against Rose Byrne for “If I Had Legs I’d Kick You,” Kate Hudson for “Song Sung Blue,” Chase Infiniti for “One Battle After Another,” Renate Reinsve for “Sentimental Value” and Emma Stone for “Bugonia.”
“One Battle” actors Teyana Taylor, Benicio del Toro and Sean Penn are all nominated for supporting performances.
The Associated Press was recognized in the best documentary category with a nomination for Mstyslav Chernov’s harrowing Ukraine war portrait “2000 Meters to Andriivka, ” co-produced by the AP and Frontline PBS.
Most BAFTA winners are chosen by 8,500 members of the U.K. academy of industry professionals. Contenders for the Rising Star award – the only prize decided by public vote and a reliable picker of future A-listers – are Infiniti, Aramayo, “Sinners” star Miles Caton and British actors Archie Madekwe and Posy Sterling.
Donna Langley, the U.K.-born chairwoman of NBCUniversal Entertainment, will be awarded the British Academy’s highest honor, the BAFTA fellowship.
The ceremony airs on BBC in the United Kingdom starting at 1900GMT (2 p.m. EST) and on E! in the U.S. at 2000EST.

Trump says sending 'great hospital boat' to Greenland

Greenland says 'no thanks' to Trump's 'great hospital boat'
February 22, 2026US President Donald Trump said Saturday he was sending a hospital boat to Greenland, a semi-autonomous Danish territory.
He said the boat would treat many "sick" people in the island.
Trump did not provide any additional details about which people he was referring to or how many people the boat would help.
"We are going to send a great hospital boat to Greenland to take care of the many people who are sick, and not being taken care of there," Trump wrote on his Truth Social platform.
"It's on the way!!!" he added.
What did Greenland and Denmark say about the boat?
Greenlandic Prime Minister Jens-Frederik Nielsen said "no thanks" in response to Trump's statement on Sunday.
"President Trump's idea of sending an American hospital ship here to Greenland has been noted. But we have a public health care system where treatment is free for citizens. It is a deliberate choice," Greenland's premier said in a social media post.
Nielsen said Greenland was open to cooperation with the United States, but criticized the US president's chosen means of communication.
"Talk to us instead of just making more or less random outbursts on social media," Nielsen said.
Meanwhile, Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen said in an Instagram post she was "happy to live in a country where access to health care is free and equal for all. Where insurance or wealth does not determine whether one receives dignified treatment."
There are five regional hospitals in Greenland, with a hospital in the capital, Nuuk, serving patients from across the territory.
Access to health care is free in Greenland and in Denmark.
Denmark's defense minister also stressed that Greenland does not need medical assistance from other countries in response to Trump's statement.
"The Greenlandic population receives the health care it needs. They receive it either in Greenland, or, if they require specialized treatment, they receive it in Denmark," Defense Minister Troels Lund Poulsen told Danish broadcaster DR. "So it's not as if there's a need for a special health care initiative in Greenland."
Lund Poulsen told DR he was not aware of the US hospital ship's possible arrival.
"Trump is constantly tweeting about Greenland. So this is undoubtedly an expression of the new normal that has taken hold in international politics," he said.
Danish Arctic Command evacuates US submariner
Trump's post on Saturday came after Denmark's Joint Arctic Command said it had evacuated a US submarine crew member who required urgent medical attention.
The submarine was in Greenland's waters, seven nautical miles outside of Nuuk.
It was not clear if Trump's post about sending a hospital ship was connected in any way to the evacuation.
Trump's Greenland push ratchets up tensions
The announcement, however, gains significance amid a deep rift between the Trump administration and Europe over control of the territory.
Greenland, the world's largest island, is a mineral-rich, strategically important Arctic territory. It is self-governing but remains part of the Kingdom of Denmark.
Trump says the island is crucial for US national security and that he wants to acquire it. He previously even threatened to seize it by force if necessary.
The rhetoric has ratcheted up tensions between Washington and its European NATO allies.
Greenland, Denmark and the US have engaged in talks to resolve the situation.
Trump dialed back his threats after reaching a "framework" deal with NATO chief Mark Rutte to ensure greater US influence over Greenland.
Earlier this week, Denmark's King Frederik X visited Greenland.
It was his second visit to the island in a year, an attempt to demonstrate unity with the territory in the face of Trump's push to acquire control of the vast island.

AI agent invasion has people trying to pick winners
Sign up now: Get ST's newsletters delivered to your inbox
NEW YORK – An onslaught of artificial intelligence agents that handle tasks from writing code to dispensing tax advice has the tech world and financial markets scrambling to pick winners and shed losers.
Gone are the days of being satisfied with OpenAI’s ChatGPT simply creating responses to text prompts.
Makers of leading AI models have embraced “agentic” capabilities that provide software assistants capable of independently tending to tasks, such as creating software applications, based on simple descriptions.
Futurum chief strategist Shay Boloor sees the moment as an “inflection point”, where millions of AI agents will soon be routinely handling tasks long tended to by people.
“We’ve never had a tech disruption at this scale before,” Mr Boloor told AFP.
“It’s extreme. The market is underwriting that future uncertainty in a doom-based scenario.”
The turning point has been marked by rapid-fire releases of ever-improving AI models, including recent new versions from OpenAI and Anthropic.
Add to that the November debut of autonomous AI agent OpenClaw that some have equated to the fictional “Jarvis” AI assistant from the Iron Man superhero films.
The creator of OpenClaw was snapped up by ChatGPT-maker OpenAI, signalling that the San Francisco-based start-up has even more ambitious agentic aspirations.
Future or fiction?
Investors quickly saw AI agents as a threat to software publishers, particularly those serving businesses.
Monday.com, which specialises in workplace collaboration, along with Salesforce and Thomson Reuters with its tax, accounting and trade software arms, saw their stock value plummet 30 per cent or more on Wall Street in a matter of days.
Georgetown University management professor Jason Schloetzer recounted a recent chat with a chief executive who remarked about no longer needing consultants since there was “one in my pocket” thanks to AI.
Wedbush analyst Dan Ives said: “There’s paranoia around AI in every industry. I believe it’s way overdone.”
He viewed the concept of AI models replacing enterprise software and cybersecurity firms as “a fictional tale”.
Too much?
As AI agents begin shaking up work, creators of the large language models powering them continue to pour hundreds of billions of dollars
Claude-maker Anthropic has OpenAI, Google’s Gemini and even Grok from xAI nipping at its heels in the market for professional AI.
Even though massive spending on AI infrastructure has some investors worried, Mr Boloor contends that “the risk is not over-investing, but under-investing” in the transformative technology.
Prof Schloetzer reasons that the economic impact of AI may not be clear for several years, the same way it took time for the internet itself to become a vital part of daily life.
“Suddenly, entirely new businesses that had no economic attractiveness without the internet started to exist, like Netflix,” Prof Schloetzer said.
“I’m waiting to see these new companies or industries that are created (by AI).”
AI angst is spreading way beyond the tech industry.
A recent blog post by US entrepreneur Matt Shumer titled Something Big Is Happening includes a prediction that AI will be tackling jobs in law, finance, accounting, consulting, medicine and other fields.
The experience that tech workers had of seeing AI go from a “helpful tool” to something that “does my job better than I do” will ripple through the service sector, Mr Shumer predicted.
Some observers have criticised Mr Shumer’s post. In an opinion piece at the Mind Matters website, technology consultant Jeffrey Funk called it “hype” driven by fear.
“The markets are a rational mechanism,” analyst Mr Ives said of company shares being punished by AI worries.
“We’re going to get to a crossroads here pretty soon where things will settle down.” AFP

I was charmed by a respected school principal. I’m devastated to discover his evil secret

Opinion
I was charmed by a respected school principal. I’m devastated to discover his evil secret
I met Richard Barren a few times while he was the principal of Langwarrin Park Primary School, in Melbourne’s south-east. He was gregarious, enthusiastic, professional and proud of his school.
I particularly noticed the fondness with which he spoke about his students. I raked through my old meeting notes and found I’d written the words “potential” and “full of possibilities” as being how Barren described the children in his school.
I fell for it.
Last week, Barren was sentenced to effectively three paltry months of prison time for having some of the most disgusting child abuse material on his phone that anyone – let alone a school principal – might have.
And, despite more than three decades of working with teachers and teaching myself, collaborating with principals and also being one – my meetings with Barren didn’t raise a single red flag. I admit to being both confused and ashamed about that.
The meek and feeble nature of the Barren sentence has landed with incredulity on many of the school’s parents. They’re rightly confounded that a man afforded the trust of being a safe figure in the entire community’s eye could have betrayed them so deeply.
I remember, from my principal days, seeing the nervous faces of parents as they handed their children into my care – a bloke running a primary school. I felt the gravity of that responsibility and I accepted it.
The notion that a fellow member of the principal fraternity could have content on his phone revealing that he “love[s] perving on pool change rooms” sickens me.
Barren’s reply to a fellow Grindr user inquiring as to his age limits for potential prey was that there’s “no limit. the younger the better” left me stunned.
When I read further of the vile imagery and videos saved on a second phone of his, of grown men with girls around 12 years of age, I was enraged.
Principals are not just extractors of the best possible NAPLAN scores from our children. We are the custodians of a precious community trust. Barren’s indiscretions are far more than a crime. They’re a breach of a relational covenant.
While I’d loathe to be a judge considering the full plethora of factors in such cases, three months’ jail feels grotesquely meagre. I guess it’s another simple case of courts sentencing crimes, but communities carrying the consequences.
Beyond the parents of one school, the wider teaching community is also shamed by the full revelation of Barren’s offences. Each of the 141,000 registered and dedicated teachers across Victoria now stands in the shadow of his conduct.
Each now must strive that little bit harder for the parents of their students to trust them. Each knows what that lingering stare over a parental shoulder as they walk away from an early childhood classroom is really all about.
The outrage of our educators is also justifiable, as they must now accept that one predator has the power to unfairly stain their entire profession. Already living and working under intense scrutiny and strict ethical standards, their efforts to meet safeguarding requirements are already exhaustive.
This is why the Langwarrin Park PS story is awful, but equally important as it draws us to confront a hideously inconvenient truth. Deep down, we know there’s no way to psych test evil away. There’s no survey or observation that can weed out every paedophile.
Screening can always be made more robust – but it will remain as fallible as I was when I chatted cheerily with Barren over coffee. Even the tightest of systems will fail to eliminate human deception.
Allowing our outrage to lead us to the complete mistrust of every school employee welcomes a different and permanent harm upon our school communities.
Turning a blind eye is also no alternative.
And so, the community of Langwarrin Park PS is left with a dual burden. They have a rightful outrage to carry, at the same time as they hope to build a future for their children that requires deep trust in their school.
Fortunately, I’ve met most of the staff in that wonderful school and that trust – of my informed, experienced and imperfect observation – is well-placed.
Without trust, parents hover unhelpfully over qualified teachers and school leaders. Those teachers are then prone to retreating, removing the personal connection that underpins the best growth and learning.
Our schools become frightened, defensive institutions and children absorb the anxiety flowing through their corridors.
Trusting relationships are the foundations of learning and the fuel of growth. No school can thrive in a climate of entrenched suspicion.
When this happens, we need to grieve, denounce and ensure full accountability without abandoning our commitment to trust.
For if we stop trusting our schools, it’s our kids who will pay twice for the crimes of an infinitesimally small number of perpetrators.

Trump’s CIA pulls 19 intelligence reports, including analyses of white nationalism and LGBT+ issues
The reports ‘failed to be independent of political consideration,’ according to agency

The Central Intelligence Agency has withdrawn more than a dozen intelligence reports, including some that cover LGBT+ activism, white nationalism and contraception.
Director John Ratcliffe ordered the “official retraction or substantive revision” of 19 CIA intelligence reports that the agency claims “did not meet” intelligence community standards and “failed to be independent of political consideration,” the agency said Friday.
These documents were identified by the President’s Intelligence Advisory Board, which recently reviewed hundreds of analytic reports published over the last decade, the agency noted.
The CIA completely retracted 17 of those reports — which predate President Donald Trump’s second term — and pulled two for revisions, according to The Washington Post. The agency publicly shared redacted versions of three affected reports.
One of the reports — titled “Women Advancing White Racially and Ethnically Motivated Violent Extremist Radicalization and Recruitment” — was released in October 2021 under former President Joe Biden.
Racially motivated violent extremists were considered a significant security threat under Joe Biden’s administration and Trump’s first administration. Federal law enforcement under his second administration has focused on left-wing movements including antifa, which he labeled a domestic terrorist organization last year.
The White House also claimed in September that “radical left violence” has “permeated the nation in recent years.”
Another report — “Middle East-North Africa: LGBT Activists Under Pressure” — was issued under former President Barack Obama in January 2015.
A third report, “Worldwide: Pandemic-Related Contraceptive Shortfalls Threaten Economic Development,” was published in July 2020, during Trump’s first term.
The CIA said these documents “exhibit substantial deviations from the President’s expectations that CIA’s workforce remains independent from a particular audience, agenda, or policy viewpoint.”
A senior CIA official who spoke to journalists on the condition of anonymity said the reports dealt with inappropriate topics for the agency to cover, and in some instances relied on biased sources, according to The Washington Post.
The official added that training for analysts has been “retooled.”
“The intelligence products we released to the American people today — produced before my tenure as [CIA director] — fall short of the high standards of impartiality that CIA must uphold and do not reflect the expertise for which our analysts are renowned,” Ratcliffe said in a statement.
“There is absolutely no room for bias in our work and when we identify instances where analytic rigor has been compromised, we have a responsibility to correct the record,” he added.
Democratic Senator Mark Warner, vice-chair of the Senate Intelligence Committee, criticized the move.
“The President’s Intelligence Advisory Board plays an important advisory role, but it is not a substitute for the independent analytic judgment of the CIA and the broader Intelligence Community,” he said.
“When a politically appointed body appears to be dictating what analysis is acceptable, it risks eroding confidence in the objectivity of our intelligence,” he added.
Republican Senator Tom Cotton, who chairs the Senate Intelligence Committee, praised Ratcliffe’s announcement and said he’s “been sending these kind of reports back to the CIA for years and observing that they contain no intelligence.”
“Our intelligence agencies have too often missed critical national-security developments to waste time on, for instance, how ‘pandemic-related contraceptive shortfalls threaten economic development.’ Honestly,” Cotton wrote on X.

Tehran announces reciprocal action after EU move against IRGC

The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Islamic Republic of Iran announced in a statement that it has designated the naval and air forces of all member states of the European Union as terrorist entities.
According to the statement, the measure constitutes reciprocal action in response to the “illegal and unjustified” decision by EU governments to label the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) as a terrorist organization.
The decision follows a move adopted by EU member states on February 19, 2026. Iran’s Foreign Ministry stressed that the European action contravenes fundamental principles of the United Nations Charter and international law, noting that the IRGC is an official branch of Iran’s armed forces.
The ministry cited Article 7 of Iran’s 2019 law titled “Countermeasures Against the Designation of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps as a Terrorist Organization by the United States.” Under this legislation, any country that follows or supports the United States’ designation of the IRGC may be subject to reciprocal measures by Iran.
Based on this legal framework — including Article 4 of the same law — Iran has formally identified the naval and air forces of all EU member states as subject to countermeasures and designated them as terrorist organizations under its domestic legal system.
The statement concluded by emphasizing that the measure was taken within the framework of Iran’s national laws and in response to the clear violation of international legal principles by European governments.

Tar Halva: Traditional Iranian Ramadan dessert

As Ramadan arrives in southern Iran, the atmosphere shifts. In the historic city of Shiraz, the scent of fresh bread, dates, and homemade sweets fills homes before sunset. Among the many foods prepared for iftar, one traditional sweet continues to hold a special place on the table: Tar Halva.
Tar Halva has long been a staple of iftar tables in Shiraz. Made from wheat flour, natural syrups, and oil, the sweet is valued for its energy-boosting properties and what locals describe as its “warming” nature — qualities considered beneficial after a full day of fasting.
Despite the growing popularity of modern desserts and industrial sweets, Tar Halva has retained its place in Ramadan traditions.
More than just a sweet dish, Tar Halva forms part of the collective memory of Ramadan in Iran's Shiraz — recalling family gatherings before the sunset call to prayer, when households would break their fast with simple, homemade foods.
Mohammad Ramazani-Pour, a veteran Shirazi cook who prepares Tar Halva each Ramadan, says the essence of the sweet lies not only in its ingredients but in the process.
“Before it is a food, it is patience,” he explains.
The preparation begins with high-quality, sifted wheat flour. The flour is poured into a large pot or pan and toasted slowly over gentle heat. This stage is critical: the flour must not burn but gradually lose its raw aroma and turn a light golden-cream color.
Continuous stirring is essential. According to traditional wisdom, if the cook’s arm does not tire, the Tar Halva will not turn out properly.
Once the flour reaches the correct color, oil is added gradually while stirring continues to prevent clumping. Some use animal fat, others liquid oil, and some a combination of both.
The sweetness comes from strained grape syrup or date syrup, which is incorporated slowly. At this stage, the mixture darkens, and its aroma intensifies. Spices such as saffron and cardamom are added at the end to preserve their fragrance.
The sweet is ready when it thickens and begins to pull away from the sides of the pot — neither too soft nor too firm.
From a food science perspective, Tar Halva aligns with the nutritional needs of fasting.
Zahra Mohammadi-Nia, a senior food industry specialist, describes it as a simple yet purposeful snack suited to Ramadan. The toasted wheat flour not only improves flavor but also enhances digestibility. Gentle heat partially alters the starch structure, making it more accessible while removing the raw taste — a factor that significantly influences final quality.
Grape or date syrup serves as a natural source of simple, easily absorbed sugars. After hours of fasting, these sugars help restore lost energy quickly.
Unlike many sweets that contain refined sugars, artificial colors, and preservatives, homemade Tar Halva contains no additives. When prepared hygienically and with controlled amounts of oil and syrup, it can be considered a more natural alternative to processed desserts.
Moderate fat content also contributes to satiety and helps prevent rapid blood sugar drops.
The continued presence of Tar Halva on Ramadan tables reflects more than taste preference. It signals the preservation of culinary heritage at a time when processed foods dominate many markets.

Trump approves emergency declaration over massive Washington, DC, sewage spill

Trump approves emergency declaration over massive Washington, DC, sewage spill
Washington: US President Donald Trump has approved an emergency declaration for the District of Columbia, permitting federal agencies to provide disaster assistance to tackle a massive sewage spill in the Potomac River.
The spill began in mid-January, when part of a major DC Water sewage pipeline called the Potomac Interceptor collapsed, flooding the Potomac River with about 886 megalitres of wastewater. The sewer line carries about 227 megalitres of wastewater daily from the Virginia and Maryland suburbs to DC for treatment. The cause of the spill remains under investigation.
The US Environmental Protection Agency will lead the federal response to the spill, according to a news release from the agency. The EPA is co-ordinating with DC Water to ensure measures are taken “to protect public health and prevent additional overflows until the pipe is repaired and the Potomac Interceptor is fully functional again”. Repairs are due to be completed by mid-March, before events in the region celebrating the 250th anniversary of the US are set to begin.
The Federal Emergency Management Agency will also be “deploying a team to support incident management” and “working directly with local officials and federal partners to co-ordinate federal resources”, a social media post from Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said.
FEMA said the assistance would be directed to DC and the area where the district has responsibilities in Maryland and Virginia.
Washington Mayor Muriel Bowser declared a public emergency on Wednesday (Washington time) and requested federal help with the clean-up. She also requested a presidential disaster declaration and asked the federal government to reimburse the DC government and DC Water for costs associated with the spill and recovery effort.
DC Water chief executive David Gadis estimated the repair and remediation would cost $US20 million ($28 million).
Trump, who previously criticised Bowser and other Democratic elected officials in the region over mishandling the spill, signalled on Thursday that the federal government would help with the recovery.
Bowser had faced questions over the timing of her emergency declaration, coming a month after the spill began. She said she took the actions, in part, after recent signals from the Trump administration that federal officials might support the request, and maintained that the response to the spill had been urgent from the start.
In his Truth Social post last week indicating that he would respond to Bowser’s request for aid, Trump continued to rail against Democratic governors Wes Moore (Maryland) and Abigail Spanberger (Virginia).
“Governors of Virginia and Maryland must get moving, quickly,” he wrote. “If they can’t do the job, all they have to do is call, be polite and respectful, and the federal government will handle it, and bill them for services rendered, at a later date.”
Authorities have advised against boating, fishing and touching the Potomac River since the spill, but DC officials said last week that they hoped to lift the guidance on March 2, subject to change based on water quality, as testing has shown the level of E. coli in the DC portion of the river consistently hovering under safe recreational limits.
There has not been sewage overflow into the river since February 8.
Officials with DC Water, the public utility responsible for water and sewage in the region, have said drinking water remains safe. But officials have issued warnings for people and pets to stay out of the water near the spill site and downstream in the district.

IDF celebrates new search and rescue unit amid growing tensions with Iran

Amid the rising tensions between the United States and Iran this week, the Home Front Command is set to receive major reinforcements, in the form of a brand new search and rescue unit. The first company of the Fifth Battalion of Home Front Command's Rescue Brigade completed its eight-month training course last week, while the second company began its advanced training last week and will soon follow suit in becoming fully operational.
Nicknamed "The Lion Battalion," the unit was originally formed in response to the October 7th attack. During routine operations, the battalion’s fighters serve as a light infantry unit, handling security tasks in one of the sectors. However, in an emergency, they transition to their role as the Home Front Command’s search-and-rescue unit, operating within IDF training zones or in civilian areas.
Although the battalion was not yet fully operational during the 12-Day War with Iran, its commanders were already deployed in disaster zones in Rishon Lezion, Bnei Brak, Bat Yam, and Ramat Gan, rescuing trapped civilians. In this way, the battalion began to accumulate a combat record, even before its official formation.
Capt. A, commander of the first company, has overseen the integration of the first recruits into the new battalion over the past eight months.
He explained that, if Israel faces missile attacks from Iran or other regions like Lebanon, Yemen, or Syria, and large-scale destruction requires rescue operations, a battalion like his could be called into action. "We are prepared starting this week for any rescue event," said Capt. A.
At just 23 years old, Capt. A grew up in Nahariya and enlisted in the IDF in August 2020 with the "Shahar" 498 battalion - the IDF's search-and-rescue battalion comprised of soldiers in their mandatory service. Throughout his service, he progressed through various command roles, including squad commander, platoon commander, and deputy company commander.
As part of preparations for leading the first company of the "Lion" battalion, Capt. A conducted search-and-rescue operations during the 12-Day War.
Ready to jump into action at any moment
Capt. A told Ma'ariv about the Home Front Command's Rescue Brigade's unique nature.
"We are capable of conducting rescue operations under rubble and saving the lives of civilians," he said, adding, "We are going to be holding a position in the West Bank. But the moment we are needed [elsewhere], we will leave the West Bank to carry out the mission." He continues, "Right after the war [with Iran] began, we were deployed as a rescue force. We left our houses and began the rescues."
Capt. A excitedly described the festive atmosphere and the historic significance within the unit: "The motivation here is sky-high. Yesterday, after more than seven months of intense, grueling training, the company received the orange beret during an emotional march – just before transitioning to operational status. Next week, we will go for training ahead of our operational deployment, and on Sunday, the new platoon commander will hold a ribbon-cutting ceremony.
"In addition to the final march of the training course, a company march will be held at Mt. Eitan to mark the battalion's inauguration and the unveiling of the company's official name, which will start with the letter 'A.'"

Israel Police arrested five suspects in an illegal crypto operation on Monday, along with the confiscation of weapons, drugs, and cash.
According to a police spokesperson, the National Cyber Crime Unit of Lahav 433 has been conducting a covert investigation over the last few months into an illegal cryptocurrency financial service, as well as suspected possession of illegal weaponry.
On Monday, police raided the homes and office of the suspects in Rishon Lezion. There, they arrested the five suspects, aged 30-50, and took them in for interrogation.
During the raid, police located around 80,000 shekels in cash, as well as guns, stun grenades, plastic explosives, ammunition, and a substance suspected to be cocaine.
The explosive materials were safely brought to a lab for further investigation.
Illegal business suspected of loaning cash to criminals
Police also announced on Monday that Lahav 433 had arrested seven people in Kafr Kassem for running an illegal change operation.
Police stated that the suspects were thought to have conducted financial services without a license, including an illegal money loaning business, which may have extended tens of millions of shekels in loans to criminals.
During raids on the change operation, police confiscated blank checks, seals, invoices, real estate documentation, high-end cars, a substance suspected to be cocaine, and around NIS 430,000 in cash.

Trump’s Carlson outreach was worth trying, but it ultimately failed - editorial

The Trump administration’s involvement in arranging an on-camera conversation between Tucker Carlson and US Ambassador to Israel Mike Huckabee was not a throwaway media gesture.
It was a recognition that a specific problem on the American Right has grown too large to ignore: the steady normalization of Israel-baiting conspiracies and antisemitic insinuations, pushed not only from the margins but by influential voices with massive audiences.
For an administration that owes much of its political energy to the Right’s media ecosystem, nudging one of that ecosystem’s biggest stars into a public exchange with its ambassador was a sign that the issue is very real and being taken seriously.
The Jerusalem Post has pointed out the Israel and antisemitism divide on the American Right time and time again. This paper has also criticized prominent Republicans, including JD Vance, for avoiding direct confrontation with right-wing antisemitic rhetoric, even as they posture as champions of moral clarity.
That avoidance has consequences: it tells activists, streamers, and opportunists that they can lace their arguments about Israel with familiar tropes and still be welcomed as part of a respectable coalition.
That is what made the Carlson-Huckabee meeting worth attempting. The hope was obvious: expose Carlson, in Israel, across from a Trump-appointed ambassador, to facts and context that could puncture the worst caricatures.
Carlson flew in for only a short visit, conducted the interview at Ben-Gurion Airport, and did not travel farther into the country. The idea seemed to be to create a clear, controlled moment of engagement, without theatrics and without the friction of a full trip.
Instead, the interview and what followed showed that good intentions alone won’t solve this problem.
Prosecutor with a pre-written indictment
Carlson arrived not as a curious interviewer but as a prosecutor with a pre-written indictment.
One of the starkest moments came when he insinuated that President Isaac Herzog “apparently was at Pedo Island,” a smear-by-association tied to Jeffrey Epstein. It was not presented with evidence, context, or restraint, just a baseless claim formulated from an AI photo that has been heavily debunked. Huckabee did not validate it, but the damage was in the act itself: a mainstream right-wing celebrity floating a defamatory insinuation about Israel’s president as though it were a responsible inquiry.
Carlson also pushed a claim about Christians in Israel that collapses under the most basic demographic reality. He asserted that Christians are “far fewer in absolute numbers” than at Israel’s founding, using the line to frame Israel as a place that shrinks and endangers Christian life.
The record shows something different: the Christian population has grown in absolute terms over the decades, while its percentage share shifted as other communities grew faster. The point is not to litigate a spreadsheet. It is to show a pattern: take a complicated reality, sand off the nuance, and present it as evidence of moral rot.
Then came the broader framing that has made Carlson a central node in the Right’s anti-Israel turn: the suggestion that American support is not a strategic partnership but a kind of civilizational subsidy, underwriting Israel’s “cultural and religious life” and, by implication, its internal social choices.
This is a familiar maneuver. It encourages viewers to see Israel not as an ally facing Iran, Hezbollah, and Hamas, but as an alien project extracting resources and imposing values. It is the gateway drug to the older insinuations that always follow: who benefits, who controls, who pulls the strings.
If the interview revealed the posture, the airport episode revealed the strategy. Just a few hours after the conversation was filmed, Carlson claimed he was “detained” at the airport for undergoing a routine security check that all passengers go through.
Footage spread on social media later showed what really happened: routine questioning in a private setting, Carlson smiling, signing paperwork, and posing for photos.
That sequence shows the bridge was never meant to hold. Even when offered a controlled, face-to-face conversation with the administration’s ambassador, Carlson always intended to provoke even further. That is not a failed conversation. It shows that the conversation was never the point.
The administration deserves credit for recognizing the seriousness of antisemitism on the Right and the Israel divide feeding it. But the Carlson–Huckabee experiment also taught a lesson: outreach to a bad-faith megaphone does not tame the megaphone. It sharpens it.
The intention was good. The experiment failed. The next step must be something firmer than another invitation.

Pakistan strikes Afghanistan targets after blaming attacks on Afghan terrorists

Pakistan said it carried out cross-border strikes on targets inside Afghanistan after blaming a series of recent suicide bombings - including attacks during the holy month of Ramadan - on fighters it said were operating from Afghan territory.
The strikes mark a sharp escalation in tensions between Pakistan and Taliban-ruled Afghanistan, days after Kabul released three Pakistani soldiers in a Saudi-mediated move aimed at easing tensions following months of border clashes along the rugged frontier.
In a statement dated February 21 that was released early on Sunday, the ministry said it had "conclusive evidence" the attacks were carried out by what it calls Khwarij, its term for the Pakistani Taliban, acting on instructions from "their Afghanistan-based leadership and handlers."
It said Pakistan carried out "intelligence-based selective targeting of seven terrorist camps and hideouts" belonging to the Pakistani Taliban as well as Islamic State Khorasan Province along the border with Afghanistan.
Reuters could not immediately reach Afghanistan's Taliban authorities for comment. Kabul has repeatedly denied allowing terrorists to use Afghan territory to stage attacks inside Pakistan.
Pakistan sees spate of terror attacks
The government said recent attacks included a bombing at a Shi'ite mosque in Islamabad and violence in the northwestern border districts of Bajaur and Bannu, where the military on Saturday said a suicide bomber targeted a convoy of security forces, killing five terrorists in a gun battle and two soldiers when an explosives-laden vehicle rammed into a military vehicle.
Tensions have repeatedly forced key border crossings to shut, disrupting trade and movement along the 2,600-km (1,600-mile) frontier.
Dozens were killed in clashes in October before the two sides agreed to a fragile ceasefire, but Pakistan continues to accuse Afghanistan's Taliban rulers of harboring terrorists who stage attacks inside its territory - a claim Kabul denies.

Where is Kim Ju Ae? Kim Jong-un’s daughter absent from key party congress amid succession rumours
Kim Ju Ae’s presence at the conference was hotly anticipated after South Korean intelligence briefings suggested she had entered ‘successor-designate stage’
- Bookmark
- CommentsGo to comments
North Korean leader Kim Jong Un’s daughter was absent as the country opened its key party congress in Pyongyang this week, prolonging ambiguity over the state’s succession plans.
The ninth congress of the ruling Workers’ Party of Korea, convened only once every five years, is North Korea’s most important political gathering and is expected to steer policy on the economy, defence, and foreign relations through the end of the decade.
Kim Ju Ae, believed to be about 13 years old, has been seen regularly by her father’s side at major military parades, weapons tests, party celebrations, and high-profile construction projects since she first entered public view in November 2022.
Her lack of appearance at the congress is significant because South Korea’s National Intelligence Service (NIS) told lawmakers earlier this month that Kim Ju Ae had entered what it described as a “successor-designate stage”.
Ms Kim has increasingly been viewed as Mr Kim’s most likely successor, particularly after a high-profile trip to China in 2025.
The South Korean spy agency briefing raised expectations that the congress might offer the clearest signal yet on Mr Kim’s succession.
The South Korean National Intelligence Service was initially sceptical that Kim Ju Ae could be chosen as a North Korean leader, owing to the country’s deeply conservative culture and male-dominated leadership dating back to its founding under Kim Il Sung, the current leader’s grandfather.
But the sheer volume of high-profile appearances she has made since then alongside the North Korean leader has shifted that assessment, and Seoul now sees them as part of an effort to build a “narrative” paving the way for the country to accept its first female leader.
North Korean state media outlets have never published her name, referring to her as Mr Kim’s “respected” or “most beloved” child. The belief that she is named Kim Ju Ae is based on an account by former NBA champion Dennis Rodman, in which he recalled holding the North Korean leader’s baby daughter during a trip to Pyongyang in 2013.
The party conference opened on Thursday, with the leader delivering a speech in Pyongyang declaring that the last five years had been a “proud period” for North Korea, since the country had achieved its goals “in all realms such as politics, the economy, national defence, culture, and diplomacy”.
“In view of the external relations, too, the position of our state was firmly consolidated as an irreversible one, bringing about a great change in the global political landscape and in the influence on our state,” he said, according to the state-run Korean Central News Agency.
Those comments appear to reference Pyongyang’s growing ties with China, where Mr Kim attended his first-ever multilateral diplomatic talks alongside a military parade in Beijing last year, and Russia, where North Korea became the first third-party ally in the world to commit thousands of frontline troops to take part in the Russia-Ukraine war.
At least 5,000 members of the ruling party are attending the meeting, and congratulatory letters were sent from Russia, China, Vietnam, and Laos.
Mr Kim’s regime presides over one of the most impoverished nations in the world, with more than 45 per cent of the population undernourished according to a 2023 UN report. Later data is not available due to a lack of access to a kingdom that is almost completely shut off from the outside world.
Mr Kim blames external factors for the challenges the country faces, citing “hostile forces [that] grew more reckless in their schemes for harsh blockades and sanctions against us”.
Natural disasters and the Covid-19 pandemic also “severely hindered the development of all our sectors, and it also seriously threatened the security of our state and the safety of our people,” he said.
On Saturday, Mr Kim delivered a report to the congress on the work done by the party. The central committee, he said, “fulfilled its important mission and role as the vanguard of the revolution, ushering in a new era of unprecedented changes and upsurge in the scope and depth of struggle and speed of development”.
The report, according to KCNA, laid out longer-term objectives and the methods for achieving them, though specific targets were not disclosed.
The congress endorsed Mr Kim’s report, and reportedly described it as a “revolutionary guideline” that will lead to “more rapid development, faster change, and greater progress”.
It is still possible that Kim Ju Ae could make an appearance in the latter stages of the conference, despite her father having delivered two major addresses already without her. It is not known exactly when the event will conclude, with the previous two party congresses lasting four and eight days respectively.

A long-acting HIV drug arrives in Zimbabwe for some at highest risk
Zimbabwe is one of the world's first countries to roll out lenacapavir, a long-acting HIV prevention drug that is administered only twice a year
- Bookmark
Young women, mothers holding babies and some men lined up in a dusty field on the outskirts of Zimbabwe’s capital, Harare. They came for injections of a new HIV prevention drug launched in the country on Thursday, one that only needs to be administered twice a year.
Zimbabwe, where HIV has led to tens of thousands of deaths over the past two decades, is one of the first countries to roll out lenacapavir, a long-acting drug that authorities hope will slow new infections.
With clinical studies demonstrating near-total protection, the drug has been described by some health officials as a turning point for high-risk groups. Others warn that turning scientific promise into broad impact will require overcoming funding constraints, infrastructure gaps and the challenge of keeping patients engaged.
At the Zimbabwe launch, Constance Mukoloka stepped out of a mobile clinic, beaming with relief after receiving one of the first doses.
“I am safe, I can work with confidence now,” said the 27-year-old sex worker, describing how daily preventive preexposure prophylaxis, or PrEP, pills often created tension with clients and proved difficult to take consistently — putting her and others at risk.
Could reshape HIV prevention strategies
Mukoloka is among the first beneficiaries of a donor-supported rollout of lenacapavir across 10 African countries. Health officials and advocates say the drug could reshape HIV prevention strategies if governments can navigate barriers of cost and fragile health systems.
Developed by California-based Gilead Sciences, lenacapavir’s introduction in selected high-risk countries is being supported through the United States President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief, or PEPFAR, in partnership with the Global Fund.
The injection is offered for free in Zimbabwe to high-risk people such as sex workers, adolescent girls and young women, gay men and pregnant and breastfeeding women.
For Mukoloka, the drug represents more than convenience.
“When I took tablets, customers would see a container of pills and leave. They would never return due to fear,” she said. “They couldn’t tell the difference between PrEP and treatment drugs. With the work we do, that stigma costs you money.”
Daily oral PrEP has long been available in Zimbabwe alongside condoms, vaginal rings and shorter-acting injectables. Yet adherence has remained a challenge, particularly for people facing stigma or unpredictable schedules.
“I work in beer halls looking for clients. Sometimes I would get drunk and forget to take my drugs,” Mukoloka said. “Sometimes I would work all night and not have time. Some clients refuse protection. They say ... 'Why should I use protection when I have paid?’”
Extended duration an advantage
Health authorities see lenacapavir’s discreetness and extended duration as a critical advantage for key populations such as sex workers and therefore a boost in fighting the spread of HIV.
“Prevention must fit into real life. If a health solution is too complicated, too demanding, or too visible, people simply won’t use it,” Douglas Mombeshora, Zimbabwe’s health minister, said at Thursday's launch. “Lenacapavir represents a new way of doing things.”
The drug has been rolled out in other southern African nations like Zambia and Eswatini.
Zimbabwe, Eswatini and Zambia, once global HIV epicenters, have emerged in recent years as among the world’s most successful models in controlling the epidemic, achieving World Health Organization testing, treatment and viral suppression targets.
Yet despite these gains, new infections remain a concern, particularly among adolescent girls and young women.
According to the United Nations children’s agency, HIV prevalence among adolescent girls and young women aged 10-24 is “persistently” triple that of their male counterparts in sub-Saharan Africa, driven by gender inequality, poverty and uneven access to health services.
In sub-Saharan Africa, women and girls of all ages accounted for 63% of all new HIV infections in 2024, according to UNAIDS. In all other geographical regions, about 73% of new infections in 2024 occurred among men and boys.
In Zimbabwe, authorities say about 46,000 people across 24 sites are expected to benefit in the early phase of the lenacapavir rollout, a fraction of potential demand in a country of roughly 15 million.
High cost of mass rollouts
Details for the next phase are not clear. The government says it hopes the number of beneficiaries will increase as more donor-funded doses arrive. It also hopes to acquire its own doses for a mass rollout but, like many other African governments, lacks enough money.
Health officials, experts and activists warn that practical realities could tamper the drug's early promise in Africa, a continent of over 1.5 billion people, not least due to the high cost of mass rollouts for governments.
In Kenya, which received its first 21,000 lenacapavir doses this week, the government said the injectable would be offered at a negotiated price of about $54 per person per year, still a heavy cost for many.
Gilead Sciences has said it would sell its drug at no profit to low and middle-income countries heavily affected by HIV.
Bellinda Thibela, who works on health justice and access at Health GAP, an international advocacy organization, described the move as “a bit comforting” but hardly enough on its own on a continent where health systems have heavily relied on external funding that is diminishing, particularly after U.S. President Donald Trump’s foreign aid cuts.
Challenges will remain in countries that were "80% to 90% dependent on U.S. funding,” Thibela said. “What’s the point of having a reduced price if there is no staff and equipment in clinics?”
While many clinicians describe lenacapavir as a significant advance, they stress it must complement, not replace, prevention tools.
“Condoms remain key. They are cheap and they also prevent other sexually transmitted infections,” said Enerst Chikwati, Zimbabwe program director at AIDS Healthcare Foundation.
But for early recipients such as Mukoloka, the drug’s impact already feels profound.
“I am elated. I can go for a whole six months feeling safe,” she said.

Trump sends ‘great’ hospital boat to treat ‘sick’ people in Greenland
The move comes amid simmering US-Denmark tensions over the mineral-rich Arctic territory
US President Donald Trump said on Saturday he was sending a hospital boat to Greenland, an autonomous Danish territory that he has long coveted and threatened to seize by force.
Trump’s rhetoric has ratcheted up tensions between the United States and Denmark, while putting the global spotlight on the Arctic as he insists mineral-rich Greenland is vital for US and Nato security against Russia and China.
He said the boat would treat many “sick” people in Greenland, without providing any details on who he was referring to or the number of people the vessel would help.
“We are going to send a great hospital boat to Greenland to take care of the many people who are sick, and not being taken care of there,” Trump said in a social media post.
“It’s on the way!!!,” he added.
The post on his social media platform carried an apparent AI image that depicted the USNS Mercy – a 272-metre (894-foot) vessel that is typically stationed in southern California – sailing towards snowcapped mountains on the horizon.

HK$261 million of frozen crime funds may take 7 years to reach Hong Kong coffers
Trials and other legal procedures must first be completed before funds can be deposited into treasury, insider says
Hong Kong authorities froze HK$261 million (US$33.4 million) in suspected criminal proceeds linked to money laundering and drug trafficking last year, but experts say it may take as long as seven years for any of the funds to reach government coffers.
According to data from the Joint Financial Intelligence Unit, run by police and customs, a total of HK$869 million confiscated criminal proceeds landed in the coffers between 2018 and 2024, with the annual amount fluctuating between HK$284 million in 2018 and HK$18 million in 2024.
Last year, 927 people were convicted of money laundering, with the joint unit freezing HK$261 million.
“After we freeze suspected criminal assets upon arrest, we still have to investigate the case and bring it to court,” a source told the South China Morning Post.
The insider added that suspected criminal proceeds could be confiscated and deposited into the treasury after trials were wrapped up, but other legal procedures would have to be completed before any money could be channelled into government coffers.
The sum frozen last year did not include HK$2.75 billion in cash, stocks and funds allegedly linked to the network of Fujian-born Cambodian businessman Chen Zhi and his Prince Holding Group.

"Oh! The beautiful, the fond memories of my childhood. My earliest memories took place in the port of Mariupol, on the Sea of Azov. When I was just a little boy – 6 years old – I could recognize the ship that would appear far away on the horizon, heading for our port (...). The cab drivers with their horse-drawn carriages on the quays often asked me:
'Hey! Yossia! Is that the Maria, or is it the Ivan Demiakin coming in?'
'It's the Maria!'
I was never wrong (...). I knew all the particularities of 'my' ships, having seen them dock before my eyes so many times. We lived at the port (my father was a schoolteacher, and the Tsar's good rubles never filled our pockets). I loved those roughly cobbled quays, where I spent long and beautiful days playing, facing that southern Russian sea."
These lines, written in 1970, open a tawny faux-leather notebook that's now tucked away in the gentle clutter of a drawer near Porte Dauphine, in Paris's 16th arrondissement. Its cover bears the title Voici déjà l'hiver ("Already, Winter Is Here") − the winter of a life. The author, Joseph Ginsburg (little Yossia), died a year later. He was the father of Serge Gainsbourg and of his elder sister, Jacqueline, who is approaching her 100th birthday. She welcomed us into her home and let us read roughly 40 or so pages, filled with black and blue ink.
Through faded photographs, 25 years of the life of the man who passed on his passion for music to Serge Gainsbourg unfold – a quarter-century of travels through cities once unknown to the French, but which now resonate differently in their ears: Kharkov (Kharkiv), Mariupol, Lougansk (Luhansk), Ekaterinoslav (Dnipro)...

Chen Mo – the man behind Heroes of Jin Yong – on AI and making a blockbuster game
Creator of new incarnation of martial arts epic says connection to the game is more than commercial – it is personal
On the large screen, characters called Eastern Heretic, Western Venom, Southern Emperor and Northern Beggar appeared in exquisitely rendered martial arts duels. Rising above it all with a sinister smile was Dongfang Bubai, a martial artist who castrated himself to learn the secrets of the skills in the legendary Sunflower Manual.
The game brings characters from all 14 of the author’s wuxia novels, works that have been enjoyed by generations of people within China and in Chinese communities around the world.
The game is still in development and, with its billion-yuan price tag, already on track to be the most expensive ever made in China.
But just days after the trailer’s release in late January, its producer came under fire from fans, who queried elements of the storyline and whether the makers were using artificial intelligence (AI) – an accusation akin to plagiarism in the gaming world.
In an interview with the South China Morning Post, Chen Mo, the 42-year-old founder of CreateAI, the company behind the new incarnation of the game, defended the new venture and said that while AI was in the firm’s name, it was not in the animation process.

WASHINGTON, February 22. /TASS/. The United States has dispatched a hospital vessel to the shores of Greenland to provide medical assistance to all local residents, "who are sick," US President Donald Trump stated.
"Working with the fantastic Governor of Louisiana, Jeff Landry, we are going to send a great hospital boat to Greenland to take care of the many people who are sick, and not being taken care of there. It’s on the way!!!" the US president stated on his Truth Social network account.
On December 21, 2025, Trump appointed Louisiana Governor Jeff Landry as the US special envoy for Greenland. Following his appointment, Landry said on the X media platform that he would seek to bring the island under US control. The statement triggered a diplomatic scandal in Copenhagen that prompted the Danish Foreign Ministry to summon US Ambassador Kenneth Howery.
On March 13, 2025, Trump stated that the United States would annex Greenland, a self-ruling territory of Denmark. On March 4, he said he would approve a decision by the island’s people to join the United States.
The US leader has repeatedly said that Greenland should become part of the United States. He threatened to impose high tariffs on Denmark if it did not give up the island. Even during his first term, Trump offered to buy Greenland. Denmark and Greenland rejected the idea.

Minnesota Vikings wide receiver Rondale Moore died Saturday in southern Indiana, according to officials. He was 25 years old.
New Albany police chief Todd Bailey said Moore was found in a garage with a suspected self-inflicted gunshot wound, according to local network WLKY. The Floyd County Coroner’s Office confirmed his death Saturday evening.
An autopsy will be performed, and his death remains under investigation, the network reports.
Moore, a star receiver at Purdue University, was drafted into the NFL by the Arizona Cardinals in 2021. He played with the team for three years before a series of knee injuries stalled his career for several seasons.
He signed with the Vikings before the 2025 season and tore his ACL in the first preseason game.
Tributes have poured in from across the NFL and from his alma mater.
University of Louisville head coach Jeff Brohm, who coached Moore at Purdue, said Moore was “a complete joy to coach.”
“The ultimate competitor that wouldn’t back down from any challenge,” he wrote. “Rondale had a work ethic unmatched by anyone. A great teammate that would come through in any situation.”
“We all loved Rondale, we loved his smile and competitive edge that always wanted to please everyone he came in contact with. We offer all of our thoughts and prayers to Rondale and his family, we love him very much,” he added.
“Bro ain’t no way brotha you just messaged me few hours ago,” wrote Kansas City Chiefs receiver Hollywood Brown, who played for the Arizona Cardinals with Moore.
New York Giants quarterback Russell Wilson said he’s “heartbroken” for Moore’s “family, friends, & teammates.”
Sauce Gardner, a cornerback for the Indianapolis Colts, re-shared a post about Moore’s death. He added: “Bro..... what is going on in the world right now?”
Purdue Football said the community is “deeply saddened by the news of Rondale Moore’s tragic passing.”
“An All-American with an infectious smile, Rondale was a joy on and off the field. Someone who left this world too soon, Rondale will be remembered as a legendary Boilermaker. Our thoughts and prayers are with Rondale’s family and loved ones during this difficult time,” the organization said in a statement.
The NFL Player’s Association said the union is “devastated” by the news.
“This immense loss is felt deeply across our union, and we value his service as a player rep. Our condolences and prayers are with Rondale’s family, teammates, and loved one during this incredibly difficult time,” the organization said. “In moments like this we are reminded of how much our players carry, on and off the field. To our members: Please know that support is always within reach.”

North Korea’s Hollywood-style thriller unveils taboo plot against Kim’s father
‘Days and Nights of Confrontation’, which depicts a plot to kill Kim Jong-il, was released for the first time on state television last month
The film Days and Nights of Confrontation, which had been screened at cinemas in Pyongyang since last year, was released for the first time on state-run Korean Central Television in January.
The perpetrator of the plot to murder Kim Jong-il is a son of the man who attempted to kill Kim Il-sung. Both of the offenders are depicted as counter-revolutionary elements.
According to South Korean media, the new suspenseful thriller, which reportedly won three awards at the Pyongyang International Film Festival, features Hollywood-style action sequences, including train fights, car chases and explosions.
In 2024, the film 72 hours about lessons learned from the Korean war was released in North Korea. Kim Jong-un was closely involved in the production of the film featuring violent action scenes and computer graphics. He reportedly wrote the script and directed the acting.

Islamic State slams Syria's president as 'puppet without a soul,' urges new attacks

The Islamic State group has blasted Syria's interim president, Ahmad al-Sharaa, calling him a "puppet without a soul" controlled by Western countries, adding that his fate eventually will be similar to that of ousted leader Bashar Assad.
In an audio message released late Saturday by the group's spokesman, who identifies himself as Abu Huzaifa al-Ansari, he called on IS followers around the world to attack Jewish and Western targets as they have in past years.
Al-Ansari sent greetings to IS fighters from the group's leader Abu Hafs al-Hashemi al-Qurayshi, who was named as the head of the group in August 2023.
The audio is the first to be released by the group in months and comes after IS was blamed for attacks that left dozens dead or wounded in recent months in Syria, Iraq, Pakistan and other parts of the world.
In December, the group was blamed for an attack in central Syria that left three Americans dead and triggered intense U.S. airstrikes on the extremists' suspected hideouts in the country.
Despite its defeat in Iraq in 2017 and in Syria two years later, IS sleeper cells still carry out deadly attacks in both countries, where they once declared a caliphate.
The UN chief said earlier this month in a report on threats posed by IS that Syria's president, interior minister and foreign minister were the targets of five foiled assassination attempts last year.
In December 2024, insurgents led by now-interim President Ahmad al-Sharaa's Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, or HTS, marched to Damascus and removed then-President Bashar Assad from power, striking a severe blow to Iran's influence in the war-torn country. Assad belonged to the minority Alawite sect in the predominantly Sunni Muslim country.
Since then, al-Sharaa, a former leader of al-Qaida's branch in Syria, has improved his relations with Western countries and last year became the first Syrian head of state to visit Washington since Syria's independence in 1946.
Al-Ansari said that Iran and Assad in Syria were replaced "with a regime that is subjected to American influence."
"Syria today is ruled by the Crusaders after they placed a leader who is a puppet without a soul," al-Ansari said. He vowed new attacks in the country, saying that "Syria has entered a new era of defense and the convoys of jihad will eventually march in Syria."
The audio, which is supposed to mark the beginning of the Muslim holy month of Ramadan, did not mention the transfer of 5,704 suspected IS detainees from prisons in northeast Syria to Iraq in recent weeks. Al-Ansari only said that everyone is scared of the detainees, whom the Americans, Shiites and Kurdish fighters are doing all they can to make sure they don't escape.
Al-Ansari also did not mention the al-Hol camp that used to house more than 24,000 people, mostly women and children linked to IS, that is now almost empty after government forces took control of it last month from the U.S.-backed and Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces.
He acknowledged that IS lost fighters over the past two years because of attacks by the U.S.-led coalition against IS. The Syrian government officially joined the coalition in November.

The rise of Polymarket, the cryptocurrency-based betting site for current events

Will the United States strike Iran? Who will win the Super Bowl? The Oscars? The municipal elections in Paris? These uncertainties can pay off big on Polymarket. With a rather austere appearance, the American website presents thousands of questions, allowing bettors to wager on the outcome of current events and collect winnings if they choose correctly.
In the United States, such prediction market platforms are booming. In November 2025, the volume of bets on Polymarket and Kalshi, the two leaders in the sector, was estimated at nearly $13 billion (€10.9 billion). By early 2026, Polymarket has claimed tens of millions of visitors and hundreds of thousands of active traders.
Molly White, a researcher and engineer from Northeastern University in Boston, Massachusetts, described "a powerful trend" in the United States, "where everything becomes an excuse for gambling." Nikos Smyrnaios, a professor of social sciences at the University of Toulouse, added that there are issues raised by "risk speculation," which he described as characterized by "a total absence of ethics."

Naive pacifism today promoting wars of tomorrow – Merz
He made the statement at a congress of the Christian Democratic Union (CDU) in Stuttgart, Ukrinform reports, citing Tagesspiegel.
“We stand by the Ukrainian people without any ifs, ands, or buts. We will never accept how a criminal Russian regime systematically wages war against the civilian population of this country, against the elderly, against women, and against children.,” the Chancellor said.
Merz also strongly condemned Russian propaganda, which he said combines Russia’s aggression against Ukraine with “an almost unbearable Nazi propaganda against the Ukrainian people – a people who have suffered under German and Russian tyranny like almost no other in the world.”
According to him, Russia’s war against Ukraine is “a test of our values and our resolve.” Merz urged people to remember the lessons of history: “Appeasement does not create peace. It only emboldens the aggressor.
The chancellor warned that “a naive pacifism today is promoting the wars of tomorrow.”
As reported by Ukrinform, Germany will provide Ukraine with more than €11.5 billion in direct military assistance this year.

Thousands of dance music fans streamed into the bigger venue at Wellington Square on a cool Saturday evening and were treated to a smorgasbord of high BPM and deep wubs.
It’s the first time the English DJ and producer has played Perth since Wildlands Festival in 2023.
With the event bearing his name so this time, he came with plenty of audiovisual goodies to accompany his fast-paced set, including a large light ring that lowered above him at several points.
He opened his set with his breakout 2009 hit from his eponymous album Rock It and from there launched into hit after hit across his impressive 17-year discography.
Highlights were the air-punching Illuminate from his 2020 album Portals produced with his fellow UK drum and bass pal Wilkinson, which was mixed into a rework of 2000s dance anthem Toca’s Miracle by Fragma.
Sub Focus’ sound is driven heavily by big atmospheric female vocals.
Tracks like 2018’s Desire and Wildfire from his latest album Contact whipped the Wellington Square crowd into a heaving mess.
A personal favourite was the boppy earworm On & On with British singer bbyclose.
Earlier in the evening, dubstep royalty Nero started with a bang - dropping their heavy anthem Innocence from their iconic 2011 album Welcome Reality. What followed was a fairly subdued set with some standout bangers like Promises, Me and You and their remix of UK rapper Plan B’s The Recluse.
Wellington Square was a great venue and a smart choice to give a drum and bass evening like that the grandeur it deserved, but lost points for a lack of toilets resulting in some very desperate people spending more time looking at a closed portaloo door than their favourite artist.

It is one of the most popular tourism spots in Victoria, but locals face a deadly risk

It is one of the most popular tourism spots in Victoria, but locals face a deadly risk
When the dense fog rolls over the Wild Dog Valley obscuring the panoramic view of the Apollo Bay coastline below, Lindsay Grayson knows the mobile phone reception will be terrible. Even reliable spots within metres of his home might go blank or barely register.
In these conditions, Grayson depended on the landline that was his key connection to the outside world. That simple piece of technology, connected to the phone network by underground copper wire, could mean the difference between life and death.
When Grayson, an infectious disease expert, and his wife bought the farming property in the Apollo Bay hinterland about 25 years ago, there was no phone line connected. They decided to install a landline for safety in their shearing shed – in case of snake bites, fires or farming accidents.
“I know a copper landline may be an old-fashioned idea, but it was developed because it’s safe, and it works,” Grayson said.
Until recently, Grayson also had a landline to the house he bought in 2019 – a steep and windy two-kilometre drive from his shearing shed. But this year Grayson was told that NBN Co, which maintains the landline to his home, wanted to cease operating that phone service due to the cost of maintaining it.
“I’m not asking for a new copper line,” he said. “This copper line’s been here all along. All we’re asking for is maintenance in a high-risk bushfire zone. Here in bushfire zones, the copper line is absolutely vital because it works even when the power supply is cut off.”
Grayson said the landline to his house had been disconnected for the past three months and there were sections of wire lying on the ground and clearly damaged.
Throughout the region, the companies that operate and maintain the telecommunications infrastructure want to phase out copper landlines.
But local advocates for retaining them are urging the corporations to keep the copper wires amid fears replacement services are vulnerable to power failures and interference from smoke and fog.
As climate change increases the likelihood of more catastrophic events, communities are facing new challenges in how they communicate and receive information during disasters.
Early this year, Grayson’s family received a phone call from a Telstra representative notifying them that NBN Co did not want to repair the existing copper service to his home and seven other nearby properties as this would require 500 metres of new cable at a cost of $36,000 to the company.
While Grayson’s landline to his home is maintained by NBN Co, the landline to his farm shed nearby is maintained by Telstra. Despite the complexity of this arrangement, Grayson deals with Telstra to report faults and damage to both landlines.
He said losing the landline to his home could leave him dangerously isolated in an emergency because landline alternatives proposed by Telstra, including satellite-based services, were expensive and reliant on power, which often failed during fires and storms.
“I just need to be able to call the ambulance or CFA,” he said.
NBN Co is responsible for maintaining and restoring its network infrastructure, but the company insists its responsibility for copper assets does not extend to preserving or replacing ageing infrastructure indefinitely.
A spokeswoman for NBN Co said some properties in Apollo Bay continued to rely on “legacy” copper lines originally built and operated by Telstra.
She said NBN maintained some sections of this infrastructure to support the continuity of existing landlines provided by Telstra under arrangements established during the rollout of the NBN.
“NBN recognises the importance of reliable communications, particularly in regional and high-risk areas,” she said.
The spokeswoman said NBN Co was working with Telstra and its customers to explore alternative options where infrastructure, like degrading copper lines, could no longer be feasibly maintained.
Apollo Bay resident Jane Gross said she was aware of 31 households out of 55 in two main Apollo Bay valleys who still relied on their landlines, particularly when disasters threatened.
Although her landline is managed by Telstra, she said the company also wanted to phase out the service.
She said having a landline was critical when the electricity failed because the copper wires were powered independently.
“It’s reliable when everything else goes out,” Gross said.
She has poor mobile reception at her home and uses an internet connection to make calls over Wi-Fi from her mobile. But Gross said she and her neighbours still regularly shared information about bushfires via their landlines.
A Telstra spokeswoman said the copper network was ageing and increasingly prone to faults, with repairs becoming harder as parts were no longer available.
“Where copper is damaged beyond repair, we will work with customers to move to newer technologies,” she said.
The spokeswoman said a satellite-based service provided more reliable voice and data services.
But RMIT senior research fellow Daniel Featherstone said heavy rain, fog or smoke could interfere with satellite or microwave signals to mobile towers, contributing to the challenges disaster-prone communities already faced.
He said extreme weather also resulted in power outages, which could sever phone reception when batteries ran flat in mobile towers.
“The challenge is ensuring reliability of services through these periods, so people can access emergency information and contact emergency services,” he said.
Featherstone, who lives in Castlemaine, said his community lost mobile reception during the recent Harcourt fires.
“These issues are real,” he said. “People couldn’t communicate with family or get messages from the police or service providers during that period.”
For Lindsay Grayson, the landline remains the best back-up system during an emergency in his hillside community. “We all rely on it,” he said.
He is frustrated that NBN Co appears unwilling to maintain the landline.
“I think it’s incredibly lame. Pathetic, actually,” he said.
Grayson believes $36,000 is a reasonable price for the multibillion-dollar company to pay for maintaining the existing system.
Scrimping for savings in a fire zone, he said, was just not worth it.

RECAP: U.S.-Iran talks to take place Thursday, Oman confirms; dozens gather in Tel Aviv to protest settler violence
Here are Sunday's key updates on Israel, the West Bank, Gaza and the Middle East:
■ Another round of negotiations between the United States and Iran is confirmed for this coming Thursday in Geneva, Switzerland – Oman said in a post on X.
■ Iran's Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, has named successors for himself and key positions within the military amid ongoing tensions with the United States and domestic turmoil, according to a new report.

■ Thirty-four people suspected of involvement in shootings and other violent crimes were arrested overnight in northern Israel's Kafr Kana, hours after a drone dropped a grenade on a house that was also sprayed with gunfire, wounding four residents.
■ The Shas, United Torah Judaism and Otzma Yehudit parties announced Sunday they will support a bill to ban egalitarian prayer at Jerusalem's Western Wall, just hours after Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu cancelled a government vote on the legislation.
Demonstrators chant 'Free Palestine' in Arabic while marching through Tel Aviv to protest settler violence
About 100 people marched through Tel Aviv Sunday to protest a surge in settler violence in the West Bank.
Protesters began their march after Israel Police forcibly dispersed a demonstration outside the Tel Aviv government complex. Police declared the protest illegal, stating organizers did not have the necessary permit
Chants of "From Gaza to Jenin, Free Palestine" were heard in Arabic as demonstrators convened around the Tel Aviv Cinematheque. Others shouted, "The Zionists are cruel occupiers, every occupation ends," and "settler violence under the cover of soldiers."
A group of right-wing activists confronted the demonstrators, calling them "traitors" and "whores of the Arabs." Other protesters shouted back, "On the front and on the home front, every soldier is a partner to murder."
Right-wing activist arrested for shoving participants of Jewish-Arab peace conference
Dozens of right-wing activists protested at the entrance to a peace conference held Sunday in Pardes Hannah.
The event is sponsored by Peace Partnership, a coalition of Jewish and Arab groups. Far-right activists have been waging a campaign against the conference since learning about it and have pressed both the municipality and the police to cancel it.
The protesters shouted "traitors" and waved signs bearing a photo of Rabbi Meir Kahane. One protester called out, "Welcome to the conference of terror supporters." One activist was arrested by police after pushing participants as they arrived at the event.
Kahane was a U.S.-born rabbi and politician known for his advocacy of the expulsion of Arabs from Israel and the Palestinian territories. He founded the Kach party, which was banned in Israel for its racist platform and later designated a terrorist organization by Israel, the U.S., and other countries. Kahane was assassinated in New York in 1990.
U.S.-Iran Negotiations set for Thursday in Geneva, mediator Oman confirms
Another round of negotiations between the United States and Iran is confirmed for this coming Thursday in Geneva, Switzerland – Oman confirmed Sunday evening in a post on X.
Oman's Foreign Minister Badr bin Hamad Al Busaidi, who has mediated previous rounds of talks between Iran and the U.S., wrote he is "Pleased to confirm" the talks are set, "with a positive push to go the extra mile towards finalizing the deal."
Minutes after the talks were confirmed by Oman, Iran's president Masoud Pezeshkian said that recent talks with the U.S. "yielded encouraging signals," and added that Iran will "continue to closely monitor U.S. actions and have made all necessary preparations for any potential scenario."
Police declare West Bank violence protest 'illegal' as demonstrators attempt to block road
Israel Police forcibly dispersed demonstrators gathered in Tel Aviv Sunday to protest a surge in settler violence in the West Bank and Saturday's attacks on the village of al-Mughayyir, northeast of Ramallah.
About 100 people gathered outside the Tel Aviv government complex, as some protesters attempted to block the road. Police declared the protest illegal, saying organizers did not have the necessary approvals. Officers gave demonstrators two minutes to clear the scene before they began forcibly removing those blocking traffic.
'Zionism is terrorism!': Protesters in Tel Aviv denounce settler violence, Al-Mughayyir attacks
About 100 people gathered outside the Tel Aviv government complex Sunday to protest a surge in settler violence in the West Bank and Saturday's attacks on the village of al-Mughayyir, northeast of Ramallah.
Activists chanted "Free Palestine" in Arabic as the crowd repeated the slogan, "Murder and abuse, it's all because of Zionism." Others shouted, "Hasbara won't help, Zionism is terrorism!" and "Free the prisoners, arrest the settlers."
One demonstrator, who identified himself only as Ethan, said "state-sanctioned settler violence" in the West Bank is a "form of ethnic cleansing." He added that the violence amounts to a pogrom. "I don't want that to keep happening," he said.
Al-Mughayyir is a Palestinian village northeast of Ramallah with a population of about 4,000. According to village officials, residents once owned nearly 11,000 acres of land. They say about 238 acres remain accessible today, largely the built-up area.
Residents say roughly 10 Israeli settler outposts have been established on surrounding hilltops over the past decade. Village officials say the outposts have restricted access to most of the community's farmland.
Israeli troops kill Palestinian man armed with explosives near Nablus, IDF says
Israeli troops shot and killed a Palestinian man armed with an explosive device Saturday, the Israeli military said Sunday.
According to the IDF, two men carrying an explosive device approached soldiers operating in the West Bank village of Beit Furik, near Nablus. The soldiers opened fire, killing one man and wounding the other, the statement said.
Iranian students protest for second day at some universities
Students held protests which led to clashes at several Iranian universities for a second day on Sunday, according to local news agencies and social media posts, with Iran facing a U.S. military buildup as it seeks to reach a nuclear deal with Washington.
The fresh unrest follows anti-government demonstrations last month in which thousands of people were killed in the worst domestic unrest since Iran's 1979 Islamic Revolution.
Iran's state TV carried videos of what it said were individuals "pretending to be students" attacking pro-government students in Tehran who were taking part in protests to condemn January's disturbances, with these individuals allegedly injuring students by throwing rocks.
Protests also took place at universities in Mashhad in the northeast, according to videos published by the U.S.-based rights group HRANA, which said the intervention of security forces in the protests led to injuries.
On Saturday a video purportedly showed rows of marchers at Tehran's Sharif University of Technology condemning Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei as a "murderous leader", and calling for Reza Pahlavi, the exiled son of Iran's toppled shah, to be a new monarch.
The recent protests, which started in December over economic hardships and quickly turned political, were repressed in the most violent crackdown since the 1979 Islamic Revolution.
U.S. says Huckabee's comments on Israel and the Middle East were taken out of context
An uproar continued Sunday after the U.S. ambassador to Israel, Mike Huckabee, said Israel has a right to much of the Middle East, as more Arab and Muslim countries objected and the U.S. said his comments were taken out of context.
Huckabee spoke in an interview with conservative commentator Tucker Carlson that aired Friday. Carlson said that according to the Bible, the descendants of Abraham would receive land that today would include essentially the entire Middle East, including parts of modern-day Jordan, Syria, Iraq and Lebanon. He quoted from Genesis Chapter 15 and asked Huckabee if Israel had a right to that land.
Huckabee responded: "It would be fine if they took it all."
A spokesperson for the U.S. Embassy said Sunday that Huckabee's comments were taken out of context and that there is no change to U.S. policies on Israel.
In the interview, Huckabee added: "They're not asking to go back and take all of that, but they are asking to at least take the land that they now occupy, they now live in, they now own legitimately, and it is a safe haven for them." He added that Israel isn't trying to take over Jordan, Lebanon, Syria, or Iraq but is trying to protect its own people.
A joint statement Sunday by Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Jordan, Bahrain, United Arab Emirates, Qatar, Indonesia, Pakistan, Turkey, Syria, Kuwait, Lebanon, Oman, the Palestinian territories and several Arab governing bodies called Huckabee's remarks "dangerous and inflammatory" and ones that endanger the region's stability.
"These statements directly contradict the vision put forward by U.S. President Donald J. Trump … based on containing escalation and creating a political horizon for a comprehensive settlement that ensures the Palestinian people have their own independent state," the statement said.
Israel and India building 'axis of nations,' Netanyahu says ahead of Modi visit
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Sunday that Israel and India are building an "axis of nations committed to stability and progress," ahead of Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi's Jerusalem visit on Wednesday.
According to Netanyahu, the axis will include Arab, African, Asian and Mediterranean states, creating a "hexagon of alliances within and around the Middle East." The goal of the alliance was to oppose the "radical Shiite axis ... and the emerging radical Sunni axis," the prime minister said
"The goal is to create an axis of nations that share a common view of the reality, challenges and goals, standing in opposition to radical axes," Netanyahu said. "These countries share a different vision, and our cooperation can yield significant results while ensuring our resilience and our future."
Netanyahu's statement comes amid domestic tension over Modi's visit. On Wednesday, Opposition leader Yair Lapid warned the opposition would snub Modi's Knesset speech should the coalition continue its boycott of Supreme Court President Isaac Amit.

WASHINGTON - US President Donald Trump said on Feb 21 he was working with Louisiana Governor Jeff Landry to send a hospital boat to Greenland, a Danish territory that Mr Trump has said he wants to acquire.
Mr Trump announced the plan on social media moments before hosting a dinner for Republican governors at the White House, where he sat next to and chatted with Mr Landry.
“Working with the fantastic Governor of Louisiana, Jeff Landry, we are going to send a great hospital boat to Greenland to take care of the many people who are sick, and not being taken care of there. It’s on the way,” Mr Trump said.
Neither the White House nor Mr Landry’s office responded to queries about the post, whether the ship had been requested by Denmark or Greenland and which sick people needed help.
The Department of War had no immediate comment.
Danish King Frederik paid a second visit to Greenland
Greenland, Denmark and the US in late January held talks to resolve the situation following months of tensions within the NATO defence alliance.
Mr Trump’s post came hours after Denmark’s Joint Arctic Command said it had evacuated a crew member who required urgent medical treatment from a US submarine in Greenland’s waters, seven nautical miles outside of Greenland’s capital, Nuuk.
It was unclear what connection Mr Landry had with the matter or if the post had any connection to the evacuation.

Pakistan Launches Fresh Attacks Inside Afghanistan Amid Rising Tensions

Afghanistan's Taliban rulers said they are preparing "an appropriate and calculated response" to Pakistani air strikes that killed at least 18 people in Nangarhar and Paktika provinces.
Afghan officials said "dozens of people" were injured in the overnight attacks on February 22, "including women and children."
Pakistan said it had launched strikes on seven militant sites inside Afghanistan in a "retributive response" to recent suicide attacks it said were carried out by Afghan-based extremists. Pakistan claimed the strikes killed as many as 80 militants. Taliban-run Afghan security structures rejected the claim as "false."
As tensions escalated between the two South Asian neighbors, Islamabad said it had "conclusive evidence" that recent attacks inside Pakistan were carried out by Afghan-based extremists from the Tehrik-e Taliban (TTP) who were allegedly acting on instructions from "their Afghanistan-based leadership and handlers."
The Pakistani ministry said it targeted the Islamic State (IS) extremist group, along with the TTP, also known as the Pakistani Taliban, in the strikes. It did not immediately provide details of the attacks or describe the evidence it said its intelligence agencies had gathered.
The claims from either side could not immediately be verified.
The renewed violence comes after hopes had been raised for an easing of tensions days earlier when Kabul released three Pakistani soldiers in a Saudi-mediated move following months of border clashes in the remote regions.
A Village Mourns
In the district of Bihsud in Nangarhar Province, 18 members of one family were killed in the strikes, according to authorities and local residents.
Nezakat, a 35-year-old farmer in Bihsud, who only gave one name, told RFE/RL's Radio Azadi that bodies of 13 members of his family were recovered following the attack, while five more were missing.
"It was midnight when the attack happened. I was in my room, and my wife was with me. When I came out, I carried my aunt out and heard my son calling for me to carry him as well. He was injured," he said.
As residents joined rescue workers to search for bodies under the rubble, they told Radio Azadi that the youngest of the dead was 1 year old and the oldest was 80.
"We came and pulled out four people from the rubble who were unfortunately dead. Later, we called a squatter to pull out the other bodies," said Raz Wali, an eyewitness to the incident.
"People here are ordinary people. The residents of this village are our relatives. When the bombing happened, one person who survived was shouting for help," said Nezakat's neighbor Amin Gul Amin, 37.
Local police said that the bombing started around midnight and hit three districts in the region.
Suicide Attacks Inside Pakistan
A least four suicide attacks have been carried out in recent weeks. Three were in Pakistan's northwestern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Province, and one was in the capital, Islamabad, killing dozens of civilians and security personnel.
Islamabad alleged the extremist Taliban leaders of Afghanistan had failed to take "substantive action" against TTP militants despite repeated requests.
It urged Kabul to prevent the use of its territory for attacks against Pakistan by terror groups.
Afghanistan denies Pakistan's accusations that it is sheltering the Pakistani Taliban, which is an offshoot of the Afghan Taliban but appears to operate separately.
Tensions have escalated between the two countries since Pakistan conducted air strikes on Kabul in October 2025 and followed up with additional attacks on Afghan territory.
Dozens of soldiers from both sides were killed in artillery clashes and heavy gunfire last year before a cease-fire was agreed through Qatari mediation.
Lack Of Long-Term Solution
However, several rounds of talks mediated by Qatar and Turkey aimed at easing the tensions along the border have failed to bring about a long-term breakthrough.
Among the most serious attacks was a February 6 suicide bombing at a Shi'ite mosque in Islamabad that killed at least 32 people as they observed Friday Prayer.
The Islamic State claimed responsibility for that attack, which was the deadliest terror strike since 2008 in the Pakistani capital.
Fighting along the 2,600-kilometer frontier has forced the closing of several key border crossings and disrupted trade and movement.
Afghan's Taliban rulers have not been recognized by most of the world community as the legitimate government in the country and have been accused of extensive human rights abuses, especially against women and girls.

Ukraine explosions kill policewoman, wound 15 in 'terror' attack
Explosions in the western Ukrainian city of Lviv killed a policewoman and wounded at least 15 people overnight in what local authorities on Sunday called an "act of terror".
The blasts occurred shortly after police responded to a report of a break-in at a shop in the city centre around 12:30 am (2230 GMT Saturday), according to the Lviv regional prosecutor's office.
A first explosion struck as the initial patrol arrived, followed by a second blast moments later when another crew reached the scene.
Officials said a 23-year-old woman police officer was killed, while a patrol car and a civilian vehicle were damaged.
"This is definitely an act of terror," Lviv mayor Andriy Sadovy said in a Facebook post. "We have 15 people currently receiving medical aid, some of them are in very serious condition.
"One policewoman died. My condolences to the family and close ones," he added.
Lviv, close to the Polish border and far from the front line, has faced sporadic strikes and security incidents since Russia's full-scale invasion in February 2022, but deadly explosions in the city centre remain rare.

Explosions rock Ukraine’s capital and outskirts as Russia launches mass missile attack, killing 1, injuring 17
One man was killed after Russia launched a large-scale combined missile and drone attack on Ukraine in the early hours of Feb. 22.
Fifty missiles and 297 long-range kamikaze drones targeted the country, most of them at Kyiv and its suburbs. The Ukrainian Air Force reported downing 33 missiles and 274 drones.
Wall-shaking explosions first took place in Ukraine's capital at around 4:00 a.m. local time, according to Kyiv Independent journalists on the ground. More blasts were heard at approximately 4:30 a.m. local time and continued intermittently throughout the early morning.
The attack caused a building to collapse in the town of Fastiv, 60 kilometers southwest of Kyiv, killing a 49-year-old man and injuring seven others, according to Kyiv Oblast governor Mykola Kalashnyk. A total of 17 people were injured across the oblast as a result of the attack, including four children, he said.
Kyiv city mayor Vitali Klitschko also reported that a woman and a child were injured in the attack.
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said early on Sunday afternoon that the attack not only targeted energy facilities, but also water supply and railway infrastructure.
"This week alone, Russia launched more than 1,300 attack drones against Ukraine, over 1,400 guided aerial bombs, and 96 missiles of various types, including dozens of ballistic ones," he added.
Since October, Russia has systematically targeted Ukraine’s energy and heating infrastructure, as the country goes through one of its coldest winters in years.
The attack also targeted seven other oblasts, according to Zelensky, including the coastal region of Odesa in the south of Ukraine. Kamikaze drone attacks caused damage and fires to energy infrastructure, according to the oblast governor's, Oleh Kiper.
Ukraine's largest private energy company, DTEK, reported that Russia hit an electrical substation in the attack on Odesa. The strike inflicted "severe damage," DTEK Spokesperson Pavlo Bilodid told the Kyiv Independent.
Crews are already on the ground working to repair the facility, he said.
In response to Russia's strikes, the Polish Air Force said it had deployed fighter jets to protect Polish airspace overnight.
"On-duty fighter pairs and an early warning aircraft were scrambled, and ground-based air defense and radar reconnaissance systems were brought to the highest level of alert," the statement read.
Russia regularly strikes Ukrainian civilian infrastructure, including residential buildings and energy infrastructure, as it continues to wage its war.
A Russian drone attack in northeastern Ukraine’s Sumy Oblast killed two brothers and a married couple, while a missile strike damaged a production facility belonging to U.S. multinational company Mondelez, authorities reported Feb. 21.
The two brothers were first injured by an explosive device dropped by a drone and taken to the hospital, Sumy Oblast Governor Oleh Hryhorov reported.
"On the way to the hospital, the Russians deliberately attacked the emergency vehicle with a strike drone," he added. The second Russian strike killed the siblings.

CARACAS, February 22. /TASS/. Venezuela should assume the course of stability, national reconciliation, cohesion and the people’s unity, Venezuela’s authorized President Delcy Rodriguez said.
"The path to national stability stretches through the unity of the people, the protection of the homeland and the provision for the future of the younger generation," she said on air of Venezuela’s Venezolana de Television TV channel.
Rodriguez pointed out that the strategic importance of the Program of Democratic Coexistence and Peace was the main tool for the national reconciliation. According to her, this program is aimed at countering hate propaganda promoted by extremist circles both inside and outside Venezuela.
She stated that "those who call for the destruction of Venezuela with the help of fascism should know that this option is not suitable for our country."
On January 3, Washington announced a military operation in Caracas, as a result of which US servicemen captured Maduro and his wife. On January 5, they appeared before a federal court in the Southern District of New York. They are charged with involvement in drug trafficking. Neither Maduro nor his wife pleaded guilty.
Rodriguez, who served as executive vice president under Maduro, is currently acting as head of state in Venezuela. The US administration has stated that Washington will temporarily take over the administration of Venezuela.

Powerful explosions shook Ukraine's capital, Kiev, early Sunday, after officials warned of a possible ballistic missile attack and ordered residents into shelters.
The city's military administration issued the alert shortly before 0200 GMT, urging people to take cover immediately. Moments later, AFP journalists in Kiev heard several loud blasts.
"Attention! An air alert has been declared in Kiev due to the threat of the enemy using ballistic weapons," the administration said, calling on residents to remain in shelters until the alarm is lifted.
Regional authorities said air defence units were engaging drones detected over the wider Kiev region and reminded civilians not to film or post images of ongoing military activity.
There were no immediate reports of casualties.
Kiev, regularly targeted by Russian missile and drone attacks since February 2022, has faced waves of overnight strikes in recent weeks as Russia and Ukraine have intensified their winter assaults on each other’s energy and military infrastructure.
Last month, Russia agreed to a request from US President Donald Trump to halt air strikes on Kiev until February 1 amid harsh winter temperatures, and Ukraine said it was ready to reciprocate as Washington pushes for a diplomatic solution to end the war.
But after February 1, the two sides exchanged strikes and blame as talks mediated by the US have yielded little till now, except for occasional prisoner exchanges.

Rescue forces were sent to Nahal Amud Nature Reserve in the Upper Galilee on Friday after three teenagers encountered a dead body while hiking in the area, Maariv reported.
According to a post made on Facebook by Inbal Shoham, the mother of one of the teens who found the body, rescue forces refused to climb down the hiking path in order to reach the body. Instead, she wrote, they directed the teens remotely while a helicopter from the IDF search and rescue Unit 669 was en route.
"The gap... conduct of authorized bodies is simply disappointing," the mother wrote, describing how her son and his friends documented the body as instructed by police, directed the helicopter, and received contradictory instructions on how to handle the body.
"My son was asked to check its pulse," she wrote, "Afterwards he was instructed not to check, so that he wouldn't interfere with any evidence before a forensics team arrived - a logical decision on its own, but in the end forensics never came to the site, and the rescue was conducted."
Rescue forces label retrieval complex operation
Rescue forces announced that the operation had been complex, involving a series of rope systems in a difficult environment.
"Unfortunately, this is the fifth rescue in less than a week that the unit's volunteers have carried out, and two of them involved a person found dead," the unit stated.
N12 stated that the body had been present in the area for around 12 hours before being found, and that his car was found in a nearby parking lot.

Israeli Muay Thai (Thai boxing) fighter Ahavat Hashem Gordon beat his Turkish opponent on Saturday evening after the two had a tense face-off the day before.
On Friday after the weigh-in, Gordon, who wore an Israeli flag over his shoulders, faced Ali Konyuncu, and the two exchanged the customary threats before high-profile boxing matches.
During the heated exchange, Konyuncu lunged at Gordon's neck, and the two were both immediately restrained. Both tried to break free of the men holding them back, according to video of the event which circulated on social media. Despite the restraints, Konyuncu managed to kick Gordon in the midsection before the two were effectively separated.
The fight, held in Kaunas, Lithuania, on Saturday night, lasted only two rounds. The first round was inconclusive, with neither side able to gain a clear advantage.
In the second round, Konyuncu socked Gordon with an uppercut before Gordon knocked him to the floor with a blow to the head. When the two were pulled apart, Konyuncu was seen bleeding profusely from a wound on the side of his head, and the judges made the call to end the fight there, awarding the victory to Gordon.
Israel's Culture and Sports Minister Miki Zohar (Likud) responded to Gordon's win in a Twitter/X post late on Saturday night, saying: "Another brilliant victory for our Israeli fighter."
Israelis in combat sports
Israel has produced a number of excellent athletes in combat sports over the last several decades, including judokas Yael Arad and Oren Smadja, who won Israel its first two Olympic medals (silver and bronze, respectively), at the 1992 Summer Olympics. Since then, Israel has won several other Olympic medals in judo, and sent athletes - including world champion Muay Thai fighters Sarah Abraham and Nili Block - to a variety of high-level boxing competitions.
In November, the Israeli kickboxing delegation put on a strong showing at the World Championships in Abu Dhabi, returning home with 7 medals. The event featured around 2,000 athletes from approximately 85 countries.

Trump to raise US global tariff to 15% after Supreme Court ruling
Move comes as businesses seek repayment for the estimated $133bn the Trump administration has already collected.
United States President Donald Trump has doubled down on his new global tariffs, raising them from 10 percent to 15 percent, days after the Supreme Court struck down his sweeping levies on imports.
The move on Saturday came as businesses and governments around the world sought repayment for the estimated $133bn that Washington has already collected.

- list 4 of 4Trump’s tariff regime has been ruled unlawful. What are the implications?
In a post on his Truth Social platform, Trump announced the raise “effective immediately” and said the move was based on a review of the “ridiculous, poorly written and extraordinarily anti-American decision” issued by the Supreme Court on Friday.
By a six-to-three vote, the court had ruled that it was unconstitutional for Trump to unilaterally set and change tariffs, because the power to tax lies with the US Congress.
The court’s decision struck down tariffs that Trump had imposed on nearly every country using an emergency powers law, known as the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA).
Trump railed against the majority justices as “fools and lapdogs” in a news conference after the ruling, calling them an “embarrassment to their families”. He quickly signed an executive order – resting on a different statute, Section 122 of the Trade Act of 1974 – to impose the blanket 10 percent tariff, starting on Tuesday.
The 15 percent hike announced on Saturday is the highest rate allowed under that law.
However, those tariffs are limited to 150 days unless they are extended by Congress. No president has previously invoked Section 122, and its use could lead to further legal challenges.
It was not immediately clear whether an updated executive order was forthcoming.
The White House said the Section 122 tariffs include exemptions for certain products, including critical minerals, metals and energy products, according to the Reuters news agency.
Lawsuits
Trump wrote on Saturday that his administration will continue to work on issuing other permissible tariffs.
“During the next short number of months, the Trump Administration will determine and issue the new and legally permissible Tariffs, which will continue our extraordinarily successful process of Making America Great Again,” he said.
The president has already said his administration intends to rely on two other statutes that permit import taxes on specific products or countries based on investigations into national security or unfair trade practices.
Tariffs have been central to Trump’s economic agenda, which he has used as a tool to address a range of goals – from reviving domestic manufacturing to pressuring other nations to crack down on drug trafficking, and pushing warring countries toward peace.
He has also wielded tariffs, or the threat of them, as leverage to extract trade concessions from foreign governments.
Federal data shows the US Treasury had collected more than $133bn from the import taxes the president has imposed under the emergency powers law as of December.
Since the Supreme Court’s ruling, more than a thousand lawsuits have been filed by importers in the US to seek refunds, and more cases are on the way.
While legally sound, the path forward for such claims is not straightforward, especially for smaller firms, said John Diamond, director of the Center for Tax and Budget Policy at Rice University.
“It’s pretty clear that they will win in court, but it’ll take some time,” Diamond said. “Once we get the court orders in effect, I don’t think those refunds will be all that messy for larger firms. Smaller firms are going to have a much more difficult time getting through the process.”
But foreign governments are managing “the real mess”, Diamond said.
“What do you do if you’re Taiwan, or Great Britain, and you have this existing trade deal, but now it’s kind of been turned upside down?”
The US-Taiwan trade deal lowers the general tariff on Taiwanese goods from 20 percent to 15 percent, the same level as Asian trade partners South Korea and Japan, in exchange for Taipei agreeing to buy about $85bn of US energy, aircraft and equipment.
The US-United Kingdom deal imposes a 10 percent tariff on imports of most UK goods, and reduces higher tariffs on imports of UK cars, steel and aluminium.
‘Pickpocketing the American people’
After the Supreme Court’s decision, Trump’s trade representative, Jamieson Greer, told Fox News on Friday that those countries must honour their agreements even if they call for higher rates than the Section 122 tariffs.
Exports to the US from countries such as Malaysia and Cambodia would continue to be taxed at their negotiated rates of 19 percent, even though the universal rate is lower, Greer said.
Indonesia’s chief negotiator for US tariffs, Airlangga Hartarto, said the trade deal between the countries that set US tariffs at 19 percent, which was signed on Friday, remains in force despite the court decision.
The ruling could spell good news for countries like Brazil, which has not negotiated a deal with Washington to lower its 40 percent tariff rate but could now see its tariff rate drop to 15 percent, at least temporarily.
Governments around the world have reacted to the Supreme Court decision – as well as Trump’s subsequent tariff announcement – with a mix of cautious optimism, trepidation and frustration.
German Chancellor Friedrich Merz said he would coordinate a joint European stance before talks with Trump in early March, while Hong Kong’s secretary for financial services and the Treasury, Christopher Hiu, described the situation surrounding Trump’s new tariff moves as a “fiasco”.
With the November midterm elections in the US looming, Trump’s approval rating on his handling of the economy has steadily declined during his year in office.
A Reuters/Ipsos poll that closed on Monday showed 34 percent of respondents saying they approved of Trump’s handling of the economy, while 57 percent said they did not approve.
Democrats, who need to flip only three Republican-held seats in the US House of Representatives in November to win a majority, have blamed Trump’s tariffs for exacerbating the rising cost of living.
They were quick to condemn Trump’s new tariff threat on Saturday.
Democrats on the House Ways and Means Committee accused Trump of “pickpocketing the American people” with his newly announced higher tariff.
“A little over 24 hours after his tariffs were ruled illegal, he’s doing anything he can to make sure he can still jack up your costs,” they wrote on social media.
California Democratic Governor Gavin Newsom, a Trump nemesis, added that “he [Trump] does not care about you”.

Ancient Chinese astrology gets a Gen Z rebrand in Southeast Asia
Forget rituals and superstitions, today’s young professionals are using ‘bazi’ 10-year luck forecasts to plan their next career pivot
Yik Wai Chee doesn’t think of himself as a believer.
Yet for years, he has consulted bazi, the ancient Chinese system of elemental forecasting, as a kind of strategic gut check on his life.
“For me, it is just a long-term ‘luck check’ to see if there are general strategies I can adapt to get through some life challenges,” he said. “If it doesn’t cost me at all to adapt to new strategies, I will try it.”
He is careful not to overstate its influence. Bazi sits closer to tarot in its interpretive vagueness than to any hard forecast, he says. It doesn’t drive his decisions so much as occasionally inform them.
But in a region where young professionals are increasingly confronted with hectic schedules, rising living costs and the relentless pressure to get ahead, even interpretive vagueness has its appeal.
Across Southeast Asia, this ancient practice is finding a distinctly modern second life.

Hong Kong, UAE solidify financial links with deeper regulatory ties, digital assets focus
Transaction volume under Project mBridge surged over 2,500-fold from the early 2022 pilot levels to more than US$55 billion by November 2025
Deeper regulatory ties and a shared push for new growth sectors are expected to give fresh impetus to cross-border investment flows between China and the Middle East, according to industry players and a United Arab Emirates (UAE) regulator.
Hong Kong would benefit from the increased China-Middle East cooperation as the city develops into “a key hub for Middle Eastern capital to deploy in Asia and an important gateway for Chinese capital to go global to the Middle East,” said Linda Cai, inbound and outbound leader and head of China corporate finance at PwC China.
Transaction volume under Project mBridge, which makes settlements more direct and efficient between mainland China, Hong Kong, Thailand, the UAE and Saudi Arabia, surged over 2,500-fold from the early 2022 pilot levels to more than US$55 billion by November 2025, according to the US think tank Atlantic Council. Digital yuan, or e-CNY, accounted for over 95 per cent of the tally.
The January announcement to promote digital yuan’s cross-border payment role would “greatly facilitate bilateral economic and trade activities and personal exchanges”, according to Cai.
Combined with the mBridge project, China and the Middle Eastern countries would have formed a “multilevel financial cooperation framework of ‘currency-fund-digital assets’, laying a foundation for the mutual recognition of more cross-border products, such as exchange-traded funds and green bonds, in the future”, she said.

How a messianic movement is changing the Israeli military
France

12:00:06 KST

This is the story of two Israeli soldiers – a career officer and a reservist – who share the distinction of belonging to one of the most radical movements in the Jewish world. The first is Brigadier General David Bar Khalifa, commander of the 36th Division. Before Israel's ground offensive in the Gaza Strip in October 2023, following the Hamas attack on Israel, he rallied his troops by quoting a biblical passage invoking vengeance and calling to "pulverize" the "cursed plot" from which the enemy would emerge. The second is Rabbi Avraham Zarbiv, who serves in the Ariel settlement in the occupied West Bank. In January 2025, he boasted on an Israeli television channel of destroying 50 buildings a week in the Palestinian enclave. That spring, the religious figure posted a video of himself operating an armored D9 bulldozer, demolishing a building in Khan Yunis, in the southern Gaza Strip.
Both Bar Khalifa and Zarbiv identify with the Hardal movement, a current within the religious Zionist movement marked by ultra-Orthodox rigorism. Adherents of this messianic doctrine have increasingly occupied centers of Israeli power, starting with the military, whose culture they are gradually changing. "The hardalim [the plural term for followers of the movement] remain a very small minority among all religious nationalists, but they are highly organized and see themselves as the vanguard of what Israel – and the army – should be," explained Yagil Levy, a professor at the Open University of Israel and a specialist in military affairs.
Hardal ideology, a blend of religious fundamentalism (haredi) and ultranationalism (leumi), calls for the restoration of a biblical kingdom, governed by Torah law, over the entirety of the Land of Israel – an area with deliberately vague borders that could encompass not only the Palestinian territories but also part of the Sinai and Jordan. The objective is the rapid colonization of the West Bank and the return of settlers to Gaza, leaving Palestinians with only three options: submission, exile or death.

Tourists love this European paradise, but locals fear for its future

Tourists love this European paradise, but locals fear for its future
Valletta: Small boats are motoring across the grand harbour of Malta on a winter morning beneath a cloudless sky. The waves are low and the wind is down as the boatmen take their passengers, five or six at a time, across the gleaming blue water.
The only challenge for a tourist is to keep the balance in the traditional boat, known as a dghajsa tal-pass, and watch out for someone leaning out to take a selfie – a shift in weight that can tip the vessel on its side.
The conditions, in other words, are perfect. Malta looks like a nation free of troubles.
But this small part of Europe is showing the strain from years of strong growth, high migration, surging tourism and rapid cultural change. It also has a nagging problem that makes some of its citizens anxious about the future.
“I weep for my country,” says one business owner. He thinks it is too hard to find young Maltese workers to fill jobs, and he does not like the heavy reliance on migrant workers to run basic services.
Growth is good. The economy grew by about 4 per cent last year and is tipped to expand by 3.8 per cent this year, while major European countries drift. The national debt is 47 per cent of economic output; in France it is almost 120 per cent.
However, Kevin Cassar, a professor of surgery at the University of Malta and a regular commentator on national life, believes a shock is looming.
“The truth is that the lifestyles that people enjoy now cannot be sustained into the future unless there are radical changes,” he says.
“And those radical changes, with regards to income, will be painful changes. This is why no political party wants to go down that route.”
“People have become used to a certain quality of life, a certain level of earnings, and yet we have this bizarre situation where people are earning more, but the buying power of that income is significantly reduced.”
Malta is now having an urgent debate about family policies to make it easier for young couples to have children. Anna Borg, a professor at the University of Malta, is arguing for more paternity leave, extended maternity leave and greater action on gender equality.
“This can’t just be a responsibility for mothers. There must be opportunities for men to take an active role in caregiving,” she told The Times of Malta last year.
Housing is a key issue. Property prices have risen by about 75 per cent over the past decade, according to the Central Bank of Malta, and parents worry that their children will not be able to own their own homes.
Incomes are up, so the bank is not alarmed about affordability. The increase in migration, however, is a factor.
“Malta cannot rely indefinitely on population growth to maintain momentum,” the International Monetary Fund said this month. It noted that Malta’s population density was 15 times greater than the EU average and that this put a strain on housing.
From 2000 to 2023, the population grew from 391,000 to 563,000. One policy, a “golden passport” scheme to sell citizenship to foreign investors, rankled with the community and was stopped last year. But the biggest factor was the demand for workers to run essential services.
This means that 28 per cent of the population is of foreign nationality. From hospitals to hotels, the country relies heavily on its new residents.
Tourism keeps the demand strong. Malta hosted just over 4 million tourists last calendar year, up 13 per cent on the previous year. While the migrant intake in Malta is about the same as in Australia as a proportion of the population, the change feels too fast for some.
“It’s been a massive jump in a short space of time,” says Cassar. “So the main problem that we’re facing is the radical change.”
This kind of debate has fuelled the rise of the far-right in countries like Germany, but Malta has two major parties, Labour and the Nationalists, that dominate the parliament. Labour is in power. Cassar has family ties to the Nationalists, but his commentary in The Times of Malta criticises both sides.
Visitors can see how important migration has become. In Valletta, the capital, it is possible to eat at a restaurant serving Maltese food served by waiters from India who work for a manager from Albania and an owner from Malta.
As long as tourism grows, the demand for foreign workers will increase. As their society changes, some Maltese even worry about whether their language will survive in a digital world of artificial intelligence.
“The continuation of the country as a nation depends on the younger people,” says Cassar. “I think the measures that need to be taken need to be quite radical.”
He suggests restrictions on foreign investors buying property, tighter rules on short-term property rentals to tourists, a halt to the rapid migration of recent years and changes to inheritance rules so that grandparents can pass their assets to grandchildren, skipping a generation.
Malta is not alone in facing these challenges. Most countries in Europe are debating their welfare spending, education policies, migration settings and housing supplies. No EU nation has a fertility rate above the replacement rate, generally seen as 2.1 births per woman.
Australia is experiencing some of the same trends. The fertility rate in Australia is 1.5, also below replacement. Parents in Australia worry about housing affordability for their children, just as parents do in Malta.
The pressures, however, seem all the greater on these beautiful islands in the Mediterranean.
Malta is a small but tough nation that has defied conquering armies and navies for centuries. It will have to adapt to these changing times as well.

‘Technically British’: UK visa rule change unleashes confusion for dual citizens
Updated ,first published
Dual Australian-British citizens are discovering that nearly forgotten family links to the UK and Ireland may prevent them from entering the countries with a cheap online pass and instead require them to take out a foreign passport or certificate costing more than $1000.
The rule change, which affects anyone who is technically a British or Irish citizen regardless of whether they have taken steps to claim that nationality in practice, comes into effect on February 25 and has already upended itineraries.
As a result, dual citizens are ineligible for the inexpensive £16 ($30.50) ETA that now lets them travel to Britain. Instead, they will need a British or Irish passport.
“British citizens, including those who hold dual nationality, are not eligible to apply for an ETA, even if their other nationality (such as Australian) would normally require one,” the British High Commission stated. “This is because British citizens already have the right of abode in the UK.”
Dual citizens also have the option of obtaining a Certificate of Entitlement from the British government for a one-time fee of £589 ($1135), which can be used alongside a non-UK passport to enter the country. The Certificate of Entitlement can be applied for whether someone is within the UK or abroad.
The rule change has set off a string of panicked conversations between travel providers and Australians heading to the UK who may be unwitting British citizens by descent.
Lynton Jones, of Sydney-based travel agency The Savvy Traveller, said he had one customer born in 1943 to a father from the UK who immigrated to Australia in 1913 as a toddler.
The customer “never had, nor thought he could have, nor wanted” a UK passport, Jones said. “Now in his 80s, it would seem that he is technically classed as British by the UK government.”
More than 1.1 million people who were born in the United Kingdom were living in Australia in 2023, which makes it the largest migrant community in Australia, on ABS figures.
More than 2 million people in Australia have one or both parents born in the UK, 2021 Census figures show.
The UK government warns: “If you or your parents were born in the UK, you might automatically be a British citizen.” Irish-Australian dual citizens are also included in the rule change because of the long-standing Common Travel Area that provides reciprocal arrangements and shared travel area between the UK and Ireland.
Jones, the travel agent, says that although his client successfully applied for his ETA online, Jones noted that “his information is technically wrong”.
“If it was queried, he could be denied entry under the new rules upon arrival, even with his approved ETA in place.” With less than two months until departure, it is not clear what he should do.
“As a travel professional, I don’t want to give him wrong information, especially with the trip costing tens of thousands of dollars,” Jones said.
In another instance, a travel agent had to cancel and rebook a family’s long-awaited UK holiday when the travellers realised too late that they required UK passports and could not obtain them in time. The postponement came at “considerable financial and emotional expense”, the Australian Travel Industry Association wrote.
One affected traveller posted on a UK visa forum that they were born in the UK but had lived in Australia for 15 years. They applied for British passports for their two sons at the start of the year but have seen no progress. “It has been nearly a month since any update on our applications after sending them every bit of supporting documentation they need. I’m starting to panic now,” they wrote.
A UK passport – which requires periodic renewal – costs £108 for an online adult application in Australia and £70 for a child, plus a £19.86 courier fee (about $240 all up for an adult renewal). A typical four-week turnaround begins once initial documents are received. An Australian adult passport costs $422.
While the change affects 85 countries, it has sparked a firestorm among British and Irish Australians. “I think there is some confusion,” said Anthony Goldman, joint managing director of the Goldman Group, a travel agency that focuses on corporate and luxury travel. “Not everyone is going to register the change.”
The changes will also affect Australians with no claim to British citizenship. While ETAs have been used since October 2023, the new rule means they will be strictly enforced by British customs effective February 25. The ETA will become mandatory to board a plane for the UK.
Flight Centre notes: “Airlines will be legally required to verify an ETA before allowing travel for short visits, including tourism, business and transit.”
Despite the confusion, bookings remain strong. Flight Centre Corporate data shows bookings in January 2026 are up compared with a year ago. The British government maintains that “the introduction of ETAs is in line with the approach many other countries have taken to border security ... and helps prevent the arrival of those who present a threat to the UK”.
Goldman noted that Australians are generally “used to different visa entry requirements”, citing recent updates to European travel rules. “The difference is that this affects a lot of Australians because they’re British citizens by descent,” he said. “If someone has a father born in the UK 80 years ago, theoretically they will now need a UK passport.”
To clear up the confusion, the government has provided a “Check if you’re a British citizen” webpage, allowing travellers to confirm which documents they need and which queue they should join upon arrival.
Underscoring the complexity of citizenship rules, numerous Australian politicians were ejected from office in 2017-18 because they unwittingly were subjects of other countries. The constitution requires parliamentarians to hold only Australian citizenship.

‘Unjustified’: Australia rejects Trump’s latest tariff hit
Trade Minister Don Farrell will press the case against US President Donald Trump’s decision to increase the tariff rate on Australian goods from 10 to 15 per cent when he visits the United States this week.
Farrell’s long-planned trip, beginning on Tuesday, has coincided with the aftermath of Trump’s decision to strike back against the US Supreme Court’s rejection of his broader tariff regime by imposing a blanket 15 per cent tariff rate on the whole world.
Farrell said in a statement that Australia had “consistently advocated against these unjustified tariffs”.
“Australia believes in free and fair trade,” he said. “We are working closely with our embassy in Washington to assess the implications and examine all options.”
Trump’s late night announcement of the global tariff escalation, following the legal defeat of his first global tariff in a Supreme Court ruling that found the president did not have the power to impose import taxes unilaterally, has not moved past the stage of a social media post on Truth Social.
A second global tariff has not been issued as an executive order.
Farrell will depart on Tuesday for a previously scheduled trade mission to support the G’Day USA tourism event in Los Angeles, where he is expected to also meet with senior US government officials.
Australia had the lowest baseline tariff rate available under Trump’s previous regime at 10 per cent, though the administration had also negotiated varying deals on different types of imports with a range of countries.
Innes Willox, chief executive of industry representative group AiG, said the tariffs would have mixed consequences for Australian businesses.
“Some will get an immediate advantage, others will miss out, depending on how they trade and who they compete with,” Willox said. “But one experience will be universal, and that is dealing with the consequences of the uncertainty, which is cruelling investment, delaying purchasing decisions and creating unnecessary red tape.
“Almost 20 years ago, the top 20 economies came together to collectively respond to the Global Financial Crisis. The US is host of the G20 this year, and the rules-based trading system needs to be on the agenda. Businesses’ capacity to endure this kind of economic volatility is diminishing.”
CSL, one of Australia’s largest exporters to the United States, was contacted for comment, as were several mining, manufacturing and agricultural groups and companies.
A BlueScope spokesperson said the company didn’t provide running commentary on possible tariff changes. “We’ve been navigating tariffs since the previous Trump administration and we’ll continue to do so,” he said.
Opposition frontbencher James Paterson said Trump’s tariffs were contrary to Australia’s free trade agreement with the US and the nation’s long history of friendship with the superpower.
“I would hope that the president would consider an exemption for Australia from that tariff, and I hope that the Albanese government, with their new ambassador, Greg Moriarty, shortly to start in Washington DC, are able to secure that exemption for Australia,” Paterson said.
Canada and Mexico are exempt from Trump’s latest round of tariffs, though the president has also quarrelled with those nations.
Australia’s exports to the US totalled $23.8 billion in 2024. More recent data has swung wildly as gold exporters have raced to get ahead of changing tariff rules.
Last year, the Albanese government removed a major biosecurity barrier (that the White House had complained about) to US beef exports to Australia. The government described the move as the result of a science-based review but it also used it in talks with the Trump administration.
As cost-of-living fears rose in the United States in November, the White House exempted beef shipments from tariffs.

Iran’s FM says country’s missiles hit Israel in last war ‘and can do it again’
Iran is a “in a better situation” defensively than in the June 2025 war with Israel and is prepared to strike Israel again with its missiles should it come under attack, Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi told CBS News.
“Yes, we had problem with our air defense, but Israelis had also problem with their air defense and our missiles were able to hit targets inside Israel,” he said in the interview that aired earlier.
“They started the war, but after 12 days, they asked for a ceasefire, unconditional ceasefire,” he claims. “Why? Because they couldn’t defend themselves against our missiles. So we have a very good capability of missiles, and now we are even in a better situation than previous war.”

During the 12-day war last June, six missiles are said to have struck military bases, while 36 others impacted elsewhere inside Israel, having evaded interception by Israeli and US air defenses, killing 28 people and damaging 2,305 homes in 240 buildings, along with two universities and a hospital, and leaving over 13,000 Israelis displaced.
Border Police trainee killed in accidental discharge is 18-year-old Ori Mechtaiev
The Border Police trainee fatally shot this afternoon in Azor is 18-year-old Ori Mechtaiev, a resident of the central town, police announce.
The teenager enlisted in the Border Police in November and was still in training when he was shot and killed, reportedly by his friend in the army, in an apparent case of accidental discharge.
Mechtaiev leaves behind his parents and two siblings. He is the son of Ronen Mechtaiev, deputy chief of the Fire and Rescue Service.
Earlier, police said that two people involved in the lethal incident were detained. One of the detainees is a soldier in the Givati Brigade, Haaretz reports.
Police and the IDF’s Military Police are investigating the circumstances of the shooting.
Netanyahu holds meeting on Hezbollah – report
Ahead of tonight’s security cabinet meeting, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu held a meeting with a small circle of advisers and security officials on the question of what Hezbollah might do if the US strikes Iran, Channel 12 reports.
There is a disagreement among Israeli official over whether Hezbollah wants to enter a fight with Israel, according to the outlet.
Israel believes that Iran is trying to play for time by submitting draft proposals to the US and then going back and forth on the details, the report says, and assesses that the chances of a deal remain low.
Israel is taking pains not to be seen as pushing for a strike on Iran, but believes that there is an historic opportunity to change the regime and the region for years to come, it says.
Report: Netanyahu says he’s ‘worried’ about Trump on Iran
After meeting US President Donald Trump in Washington earlier this month, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu told a senior US official that he could not get a handle on what the president wanted to do vis-a-vis Iran, Channel 12 reports.
“Is he still with us?” Netanyahu reportedly asked the US official. “I’m worried.”
Security cabinet convenes in Jerusalem
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu convenes his security cabinet in Jerusalem.
The meeting, pushed off from last Thursday, comes amid intensive US preparations for a potential military strike in Iran.
Former Givati commander takes charge of IDF’s Gaza Division from Brig. Gen. Barak Hiram
Former Givati Brigade commander Brig. Gen. Liron Betito takes the reins of the IDF’s Gaza Division — the regional division responsible for the border with the Strip — from Brig. Gen. Barak Hiram, who served in the role for the past 16 months.
A handover ceremony took place earlier today near the Gaza border.
Hiram, known for his controversial involvement in the battle at Kibbutz Be’eri during the October 7 onslaught, will soon head the Operations Directorate’s Operations Division.
An IDF tactical investigation into the battle at Be’eri has since cleared Hiram of any wrongdoing.
Bar-Ilan University launches research center to study post-traumatic effects of Oct 7
Bar-Ilan University says it is establishing a groundbreaking multidisciplinary research center dedicated to studying the post-traumatic consequences of the October 7 attacks and the subsequent war in Gaza, Lebanon, and other fronts.
The research in trauma and resilience will be designed for eventual clinical practice. The center will also serve as a major hub for academic and research training in trauma studies.
The center will be headed by Bar-Ilan University researchers Prof. Rivka Tuval-Mashiach, Prof. Danny Horesh, and Dr. Yael Shoval-Zuckerman.
Technion ranked 1st in Israel and Europe in international computer sciences index
Haifa’s Technion-Israel Institute of Technology is ranked first in Israel and Europe and 21st worldwide in the international CSRankings index for computer sciences, the university says.
The ranking is based on the number of peer-reviewed conference papers published by Technion researchers between 2005 and 2025 at the world’s leading conferences in a variety of AI subfields, placing it among the world’s top 60 universities in each.
In Machine Learning, the Technion is ranked first in Israel, first in Europe, and 10th worldwide.
“Hundreds of our faculty members apply advanced AI-based methods across a wide range of fields, including data science, medical research, mechanical engineering, civil engineering, architecture, and biology,” says Prof. Danny Raz, Technion’s senior executive vice president.
6-year-old child dies of measles, 16th fatality in latest outbreak
A 6-year-old child died of measles today, the Health Ministry says, marking the 16th fatality in a months-long outbreak that has swept through ultra-Orthodox communities and areas with low immunization rates.
The boy arrived in critical condition at a hospital, where, after resuscitation efforts, doctors were forced to declare him dead.
Most of the 15 deaths have been previously healthy children with no underlying conditions who were not vaccinated against measles.
The country is in the midst of its worst measles epidemic since 2018-2019, but the current outbreak has seen significantly more deaths, indicating that the disease is reaching more vulnerable populations and that sick babies may not be getting medical care in time.
According to Health Ministry data, 25 people are currently hospitalized with measles, including seven in intensive care.

158 giant tortoises reintroduced to Galapagos island after more than a century

QUITO – More than 150 giant tortoises have been reintroduced to Floreana Island in Ecuador’s famed Galapagos archipelago where they disappeared more than a century ago, the Environment Ministry said on Feb 20.
Park rangers carried large crates containing the 158 tortoises on their backs, hiking 7km across volcanic terrain and hard-to-access areas before releasing them, the ministry said in a statement.
“For the first time in over a century, Floreana is once again home to giant tortoises, a species that plays a strategic role as ecosystem engineers: seed dispersers, vegetation regulators and promoters of natural habitat regeneration,” it said.
The Galapagos Islands, a World Heritage Site, are situated some 1,000km off the coast of Ecuador. They are famous for their unique flora and fauna and are where British scientist Charles Darwin developed his theory of evolution.
An NGO, Island Conservation, said it was the first time that giant tortoises have walked on Floreana since the native species, Chelonoidis niger niger, was driven to extinction there in the mid-1800s after the introduction of invasive mammals.
There are 13 living species of Galapagos tortoises on other islands in the archipelago, according to National Geographic. They can weigh more than 250kg. The oldest on record lived to be 175 years old.
The Ecuadoran ministry said the released tortoises come from a breeding centre of the Galapagos National Park, where a specialised programme was developed using tortoises with a high genetic load of the island’s endemic species that was found on Isabela island, which lies about 180km from Floreana.
Each tortoise underwent an extensive quarantine and was microchipped for identification before its release.
For a decade, researchers have been working to reintroduce 12 other endemic species to Floreana as part of a rewilding programme.
Floreana, covering 173 sq km, was the first to be inhabited by humans in the entire archipelago. AFP

Tehranis brace for ‘inevitable’ US-Iran war: ‘I am getting more scared’
‘I don’t want war to happen, but one should not fool around with the realities on the ground,’ a resident in the Iranian capital says
Tehran resident Hamid struggles to sleep as fears of renewed conflict haunt the Iranian capital after last year’s 12-day war with Israel.
“I don’t sleep well at night even while taking pills,” Hamid said, as he expressed concern for his “family’s health … my kids and grandchildren”.
The city woke up to blasts overnight from June 12 to 13 last year as Iran’s arch-enemy Israel launched an unprecedented military campaign.
The war erupted as Iran was preparing for another round of talks with the United States, which briefly joined Israel in attacking major Iranian nuclear sites.
The attacks prompted Iran to respond with drone and missile strikes, with thousands of people killed in Iran and dozens in Israel.
Iran has now resumed talks with Washington, with Iran insisting they be limited to the nuclear issue, though Washington has previously pushed for Tehran’s ballistic missiles programme and support for armed groups in the region to be on the table.

Investments expert explains ‘three pot’ method for building savings
As the new tax year approaches in April, some people may be considering starting a new habit to build a pot of cash.
- Bookmark
Some people who are considering starting a new savings habit or building on an existing one as the new tax year approaches in April may be able to get a clearer idea of their savings goals by grouping them into separate “pots”, according to an investments expert.
Lucy Smith, an investment manger at Killik & Co, said that a “helpful” way to consider structuring savings can be to consider building an emergency pot of cash that can be accessed easily if needed.
Some people may want to aim to build up at least three months’ worth of spending in it, depending on their own circumstances and what they feel comfortable with, she said.
A “planned spend” fund could be a second pot, with money put by for foreseeable goals in the next few years, such as a home purchase, a big holiday or any other life expense.
Longer-term “lifetime” savings that will not be needed for around five years or more could be put into a third pot, Ms Smith suggested.
She said: “This is your pot of money where investing can play a key role as you can benefit from compounding over time since it is not money that you will need over the next few years.”
Ms Smith also said a consistent approach can help with building a savings habit.
She said: “One of the simplest ‘set and forget’ behaviours is using your Isa allowance regularly.”
Some savers might feel comfortable gradually moving from a cash Isa towards a stocks and shares Isa over time, she said.
Investments may potentially grow more strongly than savings held in cash over time. But the value of stocks and shares can go down as well as up, so people may want to consider the risk level they feel comfortable with.
Ms Smith said of the potential for funds to fall in value: “It’s worth considering whether this is something that would keep you up at night or if you would see it as a buying opportunity – and what you’d do if markets fell further.”

Ms Smith added that some people may want to get financial advice.

Ms Smith said: “The type of investment habit you build can also be adapted by life stages, such as buying a home, starting a family or approaching retirement.”
She said of building wealth: “It’s about developing good habits over time.”

Ofgem price cap – what is happening to my energy bill?

Ofgem price cap – what is happening to my energy bill?
Changes following a promised £150 average cut to domestic bills mean households should become familiar with how much they pay per unit of energy.
- Bookmark
Latest predictions suggest Ofgem will reduce the energy price cap by £117 to £1,641 a year for a typical dual fuel household from April 1 when it makes its announcement on Wednesday.
– What is Ofgem’s price cap?
The energy price cap sets a maximum price that suppliers can charge customers in England, Scotland and Wales for each unit of gas and electricity they use.
It also sets a maximum daily standing charge – the cost of having your home connected to the grid.
The headline price cap figure provided by Ofgem indicates what a household using gas and electricity, and paying by direct debit, can expect to pay if their energy consumption is typical.
It is important to note that it does not limit a home’s total bills because people still pay for the amount of energy they use – so if it is above the average they will pay more, and if it is below they will pay less.
Energy is regulated separately in Northern Ireland.
– What’s changing with my energy bill this time?
The next price cap, which will take effect from April 1, will be the first to reflect Chancellor Rachel Reeves’ promise last November that £150 would be cut from the average household bill.
She is achieving this by shifting 75% of the Renewables Obligation (RO) costs from household energy bills into general taxation, and scrapping the Energy Company Obligation (Eco) scheme introduced by the Tories in government which was funded by bills and designed to tackle fuel poverty by improving housing conditions, but which has been beset with delivery problems.
This will mainly translate through to customer bills by a cut to households’ electricity unit rates, with an expected reduction of around 3.37p per kilowatt hour (kWh) from the previous quarter.
– Why won’t I see a £150 discount on my bill?
The discount will be applied via a lower unit rate rather than a one-off amount.
It should also be stressed that the £150 figure is an average, and amounts will vary based on the size and type of household and how much energy they use.
Also, industry analysts Cornwall Insight have said the changes are likely to reduce the cap by about £145 a year once VAT and other pricing allowances are taken into account.
It added that increases in costs associated with the operation and maintenance of gas and electricity networks, which are paid for from customer bills, have offset part of these savings.
– Do I need to do anything?
Households should look out for information arriving from their suppliers after the price cut is announced, particularly around the rates they pay for each unit of gas and electricity.
This information will be important for those considering switching away from the price cap to a cheaper fixed tariff, and those looking for a new fixed tariff, as comparing unit prices is key to finding a good deal.
– Is now a good time to switch?
It is always worth investigating fixed deals, taking into account any length-of-time obligations that could result in exit fees.
As a rule of thumb, Which? recommends looking for deals cheaper than the price cap (this is where comparing gas and electricity unit rates is important, rather than looking at headline figures), not longer than 12 months and without significant exit fees.
However, the End Fuel Poverty Coalition said it understood that some fixed tariffs will include announced cuts from February 25, and some will not.
It warned that this could make switching and fixing – that is already confusing – “even more difficult to gauge”.
It said households may prefer to wait for the dust to settle on Wednesday’s announcement before signing up to a fixed term deal or changing supplier.
– Are prices going to keep going down, or should we expect increases in the future?
Cornwall Insight currently expects the price cap to remain relatively steady throughout 2026, with a small fall forecast in July.
However, it said these predictions may shift as wholesale markets change and potential policy cost announcements happen.

Households set for lower energy bills amid price cap shake-up

Price cap: Energy bills set to plummet from April – what it means for you
Rachel Reeves said last November that £150 would be cut from the average household bill from April
- Bookmark
- CommentsGo to comments
Households are poised to see their energy bills fall by approximately 7 per cent from April, following a government pledge for an average £150 reduction.
Industry predictions suggest energy regulator Ofgem will announce a £117 cut to the energy price cap on Wednesday, bringing the annual cost for a typical dual fuel household down to £1,641 from 1 April.
This anticipated reduction aligns with earlier government indications of a £150 saving, partly achieved by discontinuing the Energy Company Obligation (Eco) scheme, originally introduced by the Conservative government.
However, consumers are cautioned not to anticipate a straightforward £150 discount, as the actual saving will fluctuate depending on household size, type, and energy consumption. The primary method for this reduction is expected to be a lower price per unit of electricity.
Households are advised to await information from their suppliers following the cap announcement for specific details.
Energy analysts Cornwall Insight project the changes will ultimately reduce the cap by around £145 annually, once VAT and other pricing allowances within the cap methodology are considered.
It added that increases in charges associated with the operation and maintenance of Britain’s energy networks have offset part of the savings.
Wholesale prices had also risen slightly since its last forecast in December, with the cost of gas particularly volatile due to “geopolitical factors”.
Looking further ahead, Cornwall said wholesale costs were still lower than when Ofgem set the January cap level and it expected the cap to remain “relatively steady” throughout 2026, “with only a small rise forecast in July”.
Ned Hammond, deputy director of customer policy at Energy UK, which represents firms, said: “At a time when many households are struggling with their bills, action taken by the Government to provide a considerable discount on energy bills is hugely welcome.
“While the saving will be £150 for the average household, it is important to note that the discount is applied to the unit rate. Therefore, households will experience significantly different savings depending on their energy consumption, some much higher and others substantially lower than £150.
“In addition, other moving parts, such as network charges and wholesale costs, mean energy bills will not necessarily fall in line with the saving provided. Indeed, the price cap is projected to drop by around £115 from 1 April.”
Which? energy editor Emily Seymour said: “Households can expect a significant cut to their energy bills in April, which will come as a relief to millions of people struggling with cost-of-living pressures.
“The bulk of this change is expected to be applied to your electricity price per unit, so your exact savings will depend on your usage; look out for communications from your energy provider in the coming weeks to see how it will affect your bills.”
Simon Francis, co-ordinator of the End Fuel Poverty Coalition, urged households to note the changes in unit costs and standing charges, rather than focus on the headline “average energy bill”.
He said: “We know that energy bills can be confusing and trying to decide when to switch tariffs or change supplier is a big decision which can overwhelm people.
“As well as setting the price cap, Ofgem should play a greater role in ensuring that the tariffs reaching the market are fair and don’t discriminate against specific customer groups.
“Sadly the responsibility currently falls to households to pay careful attention to any changes in their unit costs and standing charges.”

Man charged with driving forklift through Perth shopping centre, attempting to steal ATM
A Perth man who stole a forklift and drove it through a local shopping centre in a bid to steal an ATM has been charged with dozens offences.
Detectives from Mirrabooka and Joondalup said on Sunday they had jointly charged the man after finding him allegedly responsible for a number of incidents in Balcatta and Greenwood earlier this month.
Police said detectives from both districts realised they were looking for the same man after he broke into a shopping centre on Calectasia Street in Greenwood on February 11.
It is alleged he used power tools to break in to an ATM, and stole a “large sum of money”.
Five days later, police say he stole a forklift from a Balcatta business before he drove it to Centuria Northlands on Wanneroo Road.
It is alleged he drove through the centre and tried to remove an ATM, but was ultimately unsuccessful. There was significant damage to both the shopping centre and the teller machine.
Police said they worked together and soon determined the same man was wanted over both of the incidents, and they executed a search warrant at a home in Alexander Heights this week.
The man was staying at the property and he was arrested, and a search of the house found an allegedly stolen truck, drugs and cash.
“Further inquiries identified the truck had been stolen from a business in Balcatta in early January 2026
and had been used in a series of commercial burglary offences,” a WA police spokesperson said.
The 52-year-old man has been charged with more than a dozen offences, including drug possession, aggravated burglary and theft.
WA police metropolitan assistant commissioner Martin Haime said the arrest showed good work by the detectives involved.
“If you choose to offend, understand this clearly: our squads work together, we share intelligence, and we will find you,” he said.
“If you target our community, expect to be caught.”

Migraine is more than just a headache. A neurologist explains the four stages

Migraine is more than just a headache. A neurologist explains the four stages
A migraine attack is not just a "bad headache".
Migraine is a debilitating neurological condition that can cause nausea, vomiting, and sensitivity to light or sound, in addition to severe headaches.
Migraine affects roughly five million Australians, but few people understand the different stages of a migraine attack.
Knowing the four distinct phases can help you recognise the symptoms and manage pain at each stage.
Phase 1: Premonitory
The first phase of migraine development is the "premonitory" or "prodrome" phase. It functions like a warning period, which begins 24 to 48 hours before a migraine attack fully sets in.
The premonitory phase has a lot to do with the hypothalamus. The hypothalamus is the part of the brain that regulates key functions such as body temperature, appetite, mood and sleep.
When a person experiences a migraine attack, their hypothalamus becomes abnormally activated. The hypothalamus is connected to other parts of the brain with different functions, so this abnormal activation can also disrupt how those parts function.
This can lead to symptoms such as poor concentration, food cravings, irritability and insomnia. If you notice these early signs, you're more likely to "catch" the start of a migraine attack and be able to treat it early.
Phase 2: Aura
The second phase of a migraine attack is called "aura". Aura refers to various neurological symptoms that affect your vision, speech or ability to feel sensations. Visual auras, which mainly affect your vision, are the most common kind.
Visual aura symptoms can include seeing flashing lights, swirling shapes or blind spots. A sensory aura can lead to numbness or tingling in your face or limbs. In severe cases, people may even have trouble speaking.
Research suggests a process called cortical spreading depression contributes to aura symptoms. During this process, a wave of electrical activity spreads very slowly through the brain and can impact how certain brain regions function.
Only 30 per cent of people experience migraine with aura.
Phase 3: Headache
The third phase of a migraine attack is the headache. This is when people typically experience a throbbing or pulsating headache, alongside other symptoms like nausea and sensitivity to light and sound.
This phase usually lasts between four and 72 hours if untreated.
When different brain networks become activated during a migraine attack, other symptoms can develop in addition to headache.
When the medulla or "vomit centre" of the brain is abnormally activated, it can lead to nausea and vomiting.
The trigeminal nerve, the nerve, which allows you to feel sensations on your face, can also become abnormally activated. This causes the release of chemicals that may be perceived by the brain as pain.
One of these chemicals is a protein called calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP). Some injectable types of migraine medication block this protein to reduce pain.
Phase 4: Postdrome
The fourth and final phase is the "postdrome". It is also known as the "migraine hangover".
During this recovery phase, your brain is working hard to return to its normal functioning. That is why you may feel even more fatigued or have difficulty concentrating after a migraine attack.
So, how can I manage a migraine attack?
It helps to know the symptoms and stages of migraine development.
If you have predictable symptoms, particularly during the premonitory phase, it's best to carry pain medications or anti-nausea tablets with you. That way you can treat early symptoms as soon as they arise. It can also be a sign to rest, ideally before the headache phase sets in.
In the aura phase, taking migraine-specific pain medications such as triptans, aspirin or anti-inflammatory pain killers may stop the headache phase from starting.
If you have more than four migraine attacks each month, you may also consider taking preventive medications. These are usually daily tablets that help control the baseline level of head pain you experience. Injectable options are also available.
Finally, don't ignore the postdrome phase. If you push yourself too hard during this recovery period, you may experience overlapping migraine attacks. This is when one migraine attack starts before the last one resolves itself. Overlapping migraine attacks are much harder to treat.
You may also experience other symptoms related to the migraine attack. These can include dizziness, neck pain, or ringing in the ears. If you have any of these additional symptoms, you should consult your neurologist to check they are not caused by a more serious underlying condition.
And if you are a woman who experiences migraine with aura, speak to your doctor before starting hormone-based contraception. This is because you may need different treatment to someone who does not experience aura symptoms.
By understanding the different phases and symptoms of migraine, you will be better equipped to tackle any future attacks.

Trump’s in a presidential pickle as the Supreme Court finds a spine
Now that the third branch of the US government has explained to the second branch that the first branch matters, President Donald Trump is in a pickle.
He may need a distraction even bigger than bombing Iran and releasing secret files on UFOs and aliens. He may need to produce Marvin the Martian for an Oval Office meeting and install him on the “Board of Peace”. (Maybe it should be spelled “Bored of Peace,” since Trump seems itchy to attack Iran, and security guards protecting the Azerbaijani president, who’s on the board, were apparently beating up protesters outside the Waldorf Astoria Hotel in Washington.)
Friday was a landmark day in the Trump reign. It was refreshing to finally see someone tell this petulant man-child: “No, you can’t do that!” And it was especially refreshing that the Supreme Court, which has been awash in its own ethics crises and acting subservient to the megalomaniac in the White House, suddenly found a spine.
The highest court firmly instructed the Emperor of Chaos on why his tariffs were unconstitutional without the blessing of Congress. And the president responded in the way he always does when he doesn’t get his way: with a Regina George hissy fit.
In a news conference on Friday afternoon, with the lights dimmed to be more flattering, Trump made clear that he was “absolutely ashamed” of Chief Justice John Roberts, Justice Amy Coney Barrett, Justice Neil Gorsuch and their three brethren-sisters on the left who shut down his erratic, perverse — sometimes personally vindictive — tariff antics.
Trump railed that the court’s liberals were “a disgrace to our nation” and that the conservatives who joined the majority opinion were merely “fools and lapdogs for the RINOs (Republicans in name only) and the radical left”. He whined that the majority did not have “the courage to do what’s right for our country”. The man who expects fealty singled out two of his picks, Gorsuch and Barrett, calling their decision “an embarrassment to their families”.
As usual, Trump absurdly conflated what he wants with what’s best for the country. And as usual, he projected, charging that the justices who blocked his tariffs were “unpatriotic and disloyal to our Constitution” — and controlled by foreign interests. Actually, that critique is probably more applicable to the president, not the Supreme Court justices who put the brakes on Trump’s mad careening.
And Trump was barking up the wrong tree on lapdogs. Until now, Roberts, Gorsuch and Barrett have been lapdogs for Trump, helping to upend Roe, giving him immunity for nearly all official acts, weakening the Voting Rights Act, letting DOGE get its grimy little hands on private data and allowing Elon Musk’s backpack wolf pack to slash the federal workforce.
The Constitution is vague on so much, and that has allowed Trump to shimmy through wormholes and do things we assumed he would be barred from doing — like tearing down the East Wing without checking with anyone and letting foreign oligarchs enrich him, his family and his cronies. But the Constitution is clear on tariffs: They are the purview of Congress.
Trump has called tariffs “the most beautiful word to me in the dictionary”. And having his toy yanked away — even for the time it took him to figure out some other ploy to punish countries — brought out his fiendish side. After his unhinged news conference, he let fly a couple of long, unhinged Truth Social posts.
No sooner did moderate Republicans exhale, because they would no longer have to defend Trump’s mercurial tariff scheme — essentially a tax on consumers — than the president signed an executive order on Friday night invoking the Trade Act of 1974, imposing a “Global 10% Tariff on all Countries”. (On Saturday morning, he said he was upping it to 15 per cent.) He had crowed earlier at the news conference that he can not only destroy the trade of any country but also that he “can destroy the country”.
“I’m allowed to destroy the country,” he pouted to reporters, “but I can’t charge them a little fee.”
With Trump’s power grabs, the court finally provided some accountability. Meanwhile, the awful wait to assign blame in the Jeffrey Epstein case, involving powerless young women, continues. The only real justice so far, in this lurid saga of bad, bad men from all around the globe, is that a predatory woman is in jail.
Sure, Les Wexner, the former Victoria’s Secret mogul who gave Epstein power of attorney over his vast fortune, was deposed by the House Oversight Committee this past week. But he played Mr Magoo, crying that Epstein had “conned” him. It was totally unbelievable. Clearly, Wexner was infatuated with Epstein and enabled the monster to acquire the private plane and private island that lured so many famous people into his web.
King Charles, too, gave us a rare blast of accountability this past week. He didn’t stand in the way when British police arrested his brother, the former prince Andrew, for reportedly passing confidential information to Epstein. It was gratifying to see the stunned, slack look on Andrew’s face as police took him away from his mansion in Norfolk. He is still, however, dodging accusations that he committed sex crimes.
Trump has been madly deflecting from his friendship with Epstein, acting as though he barely knew him, even though it’s clear that hound recognised hound. Trump, Melania, Mar-a-Lago and other related words or phrases are mentioned over 38,000 times in the Epstein files.
And now, the president will also have to distract from his humiliation at being slapped back by a conservative Supreme Court. He’s no doubt going to spend the weekend rewriting his State of the Union address and thinking of more nasty jibes for the justices who choked his leash.
And who knows? We may even see Marvin the Martian show up in the Oval Office, carrying a cookbook titled How to Serve Man.

US govt probes Netflix’s power over filmmakers in Warner deal review
Sign up now: Get ST's newsletters delivered to your inbox
WASHINGTON – The US Justice Department’s (DOJ) investigation of Netflix’s proposed US$72 billion (S$91.1 billion) takeover of Warner Bros.
Discovery includes scrutiny of the streaming giant’s behavior and whether it wields anticompetitive leverage over creators in negotiations for acquiring programming.
The department is seeking to determine whether the deal “may substantially lessen competition or tend to create a monopoly in violation of Section 7 of the Clayton Act or Section 2 of the Sherman Act”, according to a copy of a civil investigative demand reviewed by Bloomberg News that was sent on Feb 20. It went to an independent movie studio, according to people familiar with the matter.
The language in the demand, an administrative subpoena that has not been previously reported, is the clearest sign yet that the Trump administration is going beyond a standard deal review as it investigates the merger, refuting an argument by Netflix in recent weeks that the government is not engaged in anything beyond the typical process.
The broad scope of the review is also a strong indication that it will take many more months before the government decides whether to challenge the Netflix-Warner Bros. deal in court – a delay that may benefit rival bidder Paramount Skydance.
“Netflix operates in an extremely competitive market. Any claim that it is a monopolist, or seeking to monopolise, is unfounded,” Netflix Chief Legal Officer David Hyman said in a statement. “We neither hold monopoly power nor engage in exclusionary conduct and we’ll gladly cooperate, as we always do, with regulators on any concerns they may have.”
The application of both laws has precedent, and the investigation may not result in any federal action. But deal reviews are typically conducted by US antitrust enforcers using just the Clayton Act, which is specifically for merger investigations. The Sherman Act is a statute more typically used to target illegal monopolization by a single company such as Alphabet’s Google, Live Nation Entertainment and Visa.
The DOJ is asking questions about Netflix’s ability to leverage its market power in negotiations with independent content creators such movie studios and filmmakers, according to the people. Netflix operates the largest paid video streaming service in the world and is one of the largest buyers of film and TV programming in the world.
Netflix is spending about US$20 billion on programming in 2026, which is split between original series and licensed reruns. Many of its most popular original programs, including Wednesday and Nobody Wants This, are produced by third-party studios. In buying HBO and Warner Bros., Netflix would acquire one of the largest studios as well as a major competitor in streaming.
The Wall Street Journal first reported that the DOJ’s review includes Netflix’s business practices and whether the deal would give the streaming giant monopoly power in the future.
“We have not been given any notice or seen any other sign that the DOJ is conducting a monopoliaation investigation,” Mr Steve Sunshine, head of Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom LLP’s global antitrust/competition group representing Netflix, said in a statement.
The Justice Department did not immediately respond to request for comment outside of normal business hours. Warner Bros. declined to comment.
Monopoly cases can require market concentration of more than 50 per cent, a number that exceeds Netflix’s share with or without Warner Bros. Netflix accounts for about 9 per cent of TV viewing in the US and a larger share of the streaming market, and its spending on programming is comparable to peers such as Disney and Comcast.
Warner Bros. earlier this week committed to resume talks with Paramount after a representative of the company indicated a willingness to raise its offer price by US$1 per share to US$31. Warner Bros. has given Paramount a deadline of Feb 23 to submit its “best and final” offer.
Paramount, which launched a hostile bid for Warner Bros.
However, the offer could still be slowed down by an ongoing review in the EU, and US enforcers in the past have sued to block deals that they had initially waved through. Paramount could also face a gauntlet of US state attorneys general. BLOOMBERG

Arab, Muslim countries slam US ambassador's Israel remarks
Arab and Islamic countries issued a joint condemnation on Sunday of remarks by US ambassador to Israel Mike Huckabee, who suggested Israel had a biblical right to a vast swath of the Middle East.
Huckabee, a former Baptist minister and a fervent Israel supporter, was speaking on the podcast of right-wing political commentator and Israel critic Tucker Carlson.
In an episode released Friday, Carlson pushed Huckabee on the meaning of a biblical verse sometimes interpreted as saying that Israel is entitled to the land between the river Nile in Egypt and the Euphrates in Syria and Iraq.
In response, Huckabee said: "It would be fine if they took it all."
When pressed, however, he continued that Israel was "not asking to take all of that", adding: "It was somewhat of a hyperbolic statement."
The backlash widened sharply on Sunday as more than a dozen Arab and Islamic governments - alongside three major regional organisations - issued a joint statement denouncing the US diplomat's comments as "dangerous and inflammatory".
The statement, released by the United Arab Emirates' foreign ministry, was signed by the UAE, Egypt, Jordan, Indonesia, Pakistan, Turkey, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Kuwait, Oman, Bahrain, Lebanon, Syria and the State of Palestine, as well as the Organization of Islamic Cooperation, the Arab League and the Gulf Cooperation Council.
They said the comments contravene the UN Charter and efforts to de-escalate the Gaza war and advance a political horizon for a comprehensive settlement.
Earlier, several Arab states had issued unilateral condemnations.
Saudi Arabia described the ambassador's words as "reckless" and "irresponsible", while Jordan said it was "an assault on the sovereignty of the countries of the region".
Kuwait decried what it called a "flagrant violation of the principles of international law", while Oman said the comments "threatened the prospects for peace" and stability in the region.
Egypt's foreign ministry reaffirmed "that Israel has no sovereignty over the occupied Palestinian territory or any other Arab lands".
The Palestinian Authority said on X that Huckabee's words "contradict US President Donald Trump's rejection of (Israel) annexing the West Bank".
On Saturday, Huckabee published two posts on X further clarifying his position on other topics touched upon in the interview, but did not address his remark about the biblical verse.
The speaker of the Israeli parliament, Amir Ohana, praised Huckabee on X for his general pro-Israel stance in the interview, and accused Carlson of "falsehoods and manipulations".
Carlson has recently found himself facing accusations of antisemitism, particularly following a lengthy, uncritical interview with self-described white nationalist Nick Fuentes - a figure who has praised Hitler, denied the Holocaust and branded American Jews as disloyal.

Berlin International Film Festival winners blast Israel in award speeches, ignore Iran

The 76th Berlinale, the Berlin International Film Festival, which opened with a press conference in which the International Jury, headed by master director Wim Wenders, was blasted for refusing to condemn Israel, ended Saturday night with an awards ceremony in which multiple winners had harsh words about the war in Gaza.
Abdallah Al-Khatib, who won the Best Feature Debut prize for his film Chronicles From the Siege, criticized the German government, saying it was complicit in Israel’s conduct in the war against Hamas.
“People have told me to be careful… but I don’t care,” he said. “You are partners in the genocide of Gaza by Israel, but you choose not to care. Free Palestine from now until the end of the world.”
He went on to say, “I’m happy to be here to get this prize, but I’m Palestinian, so I have to use this moment to speak about Palestine. I was under a lot of pressure to participate in the Berlinale for one reason only, to stand here and say that Palestinians will be free and one day, we will have a great film festival in the middle of Gaza, in the middle of other Palestinian cities… Our festival will stand in solidarity with the people living under siege, under occupation and under dictatorships around the world. We will speak about politics before cinema. We will speak about resistance before art, about freedom before beauty, and about a human being before culture, the long-awaited day is coming.”
Given the persecution of the LGBT community in Gaza, though, it is hard to imagine the film festival Al-Khatib envisioned welcoming such movies as What Will I Become?, a movie that explores “the vulnerability of their transmasculine community” and that won the Amnesty International Award at the Berlinale.
Co-director Logan Rozos said, accepting the award, “Thank you to trans women all over the world for being the model and the blueprint for how to destabilize the patriarchy.” It would seem that the “long-awaited day” that a film like Rozos’s will be shown in Gaza will not be coming anytime soon.
Few film festival winners mention Iran
Not surprisingly, many fewer prizewinners chose to criticize the Iranian government, where numerous filmmakers have been arrested, harassed, and killed in recent weeks as they took part in recent demonstrations against the regime.
Among the few who did mention Iran was Emin Alper, whose movie, Salvation, set in the Kurdish region of Turkey, won the Grand Jury Prize. In his acceptance speech, he spoke about, “People in Iran suffering under the most terrible tyranny,” and also about “the genocide in Palestine.”
The movie that won the Golden Bear, the festival’s highest profile award, was German-Turkish filmmaker İlker Çatak's Yellow Letters, about a playwright and actress engaged in political theater in Turkey who find themselves targeted by the state.
At the awards ceremony, Wenders addressed the controversy sparked by his refusal to speak out politically at the beginning of the festival, by saying, “The language of cinema is empathetic, the language of social cinema is effective. The dignity and protection of human life - these are our causes as well. You do necessary and courageous work, but does it need to be in competition with ours? Do our voices need to clash?”
The Berlinale’s director, Tricia Tuttle, also brought up the issue at the awards ceremony, saying, “Criticism and speaking up is part of democracy, and so is disagreement. If this Berlinale has been emotionally charged, that’s not a failure of the Berlinale, and it’s not a failure of cinema. That’s the Berlinale doing its job, and that’s cinema doing its job.”

China may be in work on development of nuclear weapons’ new generation — CNN

NEW YORK, February 22. /TASS/. US intelligence agencies believe that China is developing a new generation of nuclear weapons and has already conducted at least one test as part of the process to upgrade its nuclear arsenal, CNN reported citing its unnamed sources.
According to the sources, granted investments in the nuclear arsenal will enable China to be allegedly able to have technical capabilities that none of the dominant nuclear powers currently possess.
"China secretly conducted an explosive nuclear test in June 2020 at the Lop Nur facility, in the country’s northwest - despite a self-imposed moratorium on such activity that has been in place since 1996 - and was planning to do more in the future, according to the sources and recent statements from US officials," CNN stated in its report.
"Evidence collected as part of a subsequent review of the June 2020 event, has led US officials to conclude the test was motivated by China’s pursuit of next-generation nuclear weapons," the US-based broadcaster continued citing sources familiar with the situation.
"That includes efforts to develop additional weapons systems capable of delivering multiple, miniaturized nuclear warheads from a single missile… China also appears to be developing low-yield, tactical nuclear weapons - something the country has never previously produced…," CNN added.
Earlier, Russian envoy to international organizations in Vienna Mikhail Ulyanov pointed out at his meeting with CTBTO (Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty Organization) Executive Secretary Robert Floyd that US attempts to accuse China of conducting nuclear tests are groundless.

Huckabee fires back at Tucker Carlson after interview descends into Israel-smearing

US Ambassador to Israel Mike Huckabee responded to conservative commentator Tucker Carlson in a series of posts on X/Twitter, after an interview at Ben-Gurion airport on Wednesday resulted in several unverified claims and assertions made by Carlson to discredit Israel.
"If Tucker was really a 'journalist,' he could have found out what I easily did later," Huckabee stated on Friday evening in response to one claim by Carlson that Israel had sheltered accused sex offender Tom Alexandrovich.
Carlson used Alexandrovich as an example of what he claimed were “dozens and dozens” of accused sex offenders in the United States who had fled to Israel. Huckabee, however, accused Carlson of intentionally misleading the public on the issue.
According to Huckabee's post, Alexandrovich, an Israeli citizen, had not violated any court orders by returning to Israel after his arrest in Nevada in August 2025 - he had been released on bail, and appeared before the court as scheduled via Zoom, pleading not guilty.
"Tucker's question wasn't because he was concerned about a child being solicited for sex," Huckabee accused, "He was playing 'gotcha.'"
Carlson also claimed that President Isaac Herzog had visited Epstein Island and challenged the ambassador to check for himself. Huckabee refuted Carlson's claims, adding that, "Tucker may need to talk to his lawyers. Libel & defamation of a good & honorable man is reckless."
In a video posted on X/Twitter in the early hours of Sunday morning, Carlson backtracked his claims about Herzog, stating that he had received a letter from the president's office claiming unequivocally that Herzog had never had any interaction with Epstein. Carlson issued a formal apology for stating otherwise and admitted to having acted without concrete information on the accusation.
Huckabee also reacted to a conversation the two had over the meaning of Zionism, describing the discussion as "very twisty and frankly confusing."
Carlson, Huckabee said, insisted on inserting topics which "have nothing to do with theology and certainly not with Israel, Zionism, or anything else." In his response on X/Twitter, Huckabee provided Carlson with what he believed to be a straightforward definition of Zionism: "Zionism is the belief that Israel has a right to exist in safety and security."
"Why can't you just say that?" Huckabee asked Carlson, claiming that he'd asked the commentator the question several times during the interview without receiving a clear answer. "You refused to say whether or not Israel has a right to exist. I hope you will state your answer to that simple question soon."
Huckabee accuses Carlson of spreading antisemitic conspiracy theories
Huckabee accused Carlson of muddying the waters of their conversation with the so-called "Khazar theory" of modern Jewish origin, a debunked idea that claims that most Ashkenazi Jews today trace their lineage to the population of Khazaria.
"This odious conspiracy theory is peddled by the likes of Candace Owens and Nick Fuentes and by people who love David Duke," Huckabee stated, "as well as Islamist accounts that make up false smears about Israel non-stop and are run out of countries like Pakistan and Turkey."
Huckabee also commented on Carlson's history of interviewing Nazis, saying, "I was expecting a thoughtful conversation and that he would ask questions and give me the opportunity to actually respond - just like he did with the little Nazi sympathizer Nick Fuentes or the guy who thought Hitler was the good guy and Churchill the bad guy."

Crutches in hand and her left foot in a brace, Chloé Harrouche, founder and artistic director of Loulou de Saison, quickly brushed aside the inconvenience when she met M Le magazine du Monde a few days before Christmas at her women's ready-to-wear brand's headquarters.
With its majestic wrought-iron staircase, herringbone parquet flooring, moldings, tasteful furniture and bright spaces, the Parisian offices where she set up her design studio in July 2024 reflect the style of the clothes she designs; elegant and minimalist. Still, they are far from austere, despite what the succession of black, white or gray pieces lined up in the showroom might suggest.
Before making its way into wardrobes, Loulou de Saison was the name of an Instagram account like hundreds of others. The page was run by a young Parisian passionate about fashion, showcasing her sense of style. But unlike many influencers who try, often unsuccessfully, to turn their dream into reality – namely, designing a wardrobe and building a lasting brand – Harrouche appears to have achieved her goal.

Australia denies it is working to repatriate Islamic State family members

Australia's center-left government on Sunday rejected a local media report that said it was working to repatriate Australians in a Syrian camp holding families of suspected Islamic State terrorists.
The 34 women and children were released on Monday from the camp in northern Syria, but returned to the detention center due to technical reasons. The group is expected to travel to Damascus before eventually returning to Australia, despite objections from ruling and opposition lawmakers.
On Sunday, Home Affairs Minister Tony Burke rejected claims made in a report in the Sunday Telegraph, asserting that official preparations were under way for the cohort’s return.
"In that report, it makes a claim that we are conducting a repatriation. We are not," Burke told Australian Broadcasting Corp television.
"It claims we have been meeting with the states for the purposes of a repatriation. We have not," Burke added.
Albanese says government will not help Islamic State family return to Australia
Prime Minister Anthony Albanese, who leads Australia's Labor Party, said this week his government would not help the group return to Australia.
The return of relatives of suspected IS terrorists is a political issue in Australia, which has seen a surge in popularity of the right-wing, anti-immigration One Nation party led by Pauline Hanson.
Islamic State, the Sunni Muslim terrorist group, is listed as a terrorist organization in Australia, with membership of the group punishable by up to 25 years in prison. Australia also has the power to strip dual nationals of citizenship if they are an Islamic State member.

Market hall, light rail and cable cars: How the City of Perth could shed the “dull” tag

Market hall, light rail and cable cars: How the City of Perth could shed the “dull” tag
A new report to be presented to Perth city council recommends making the central business district home to light rail, a market hall, more bikes lanes and introducing a cable car to bring tourists down from Kings Park.
The report Shaping Perth city centre: towards 2036 and beyond was developed by urban design and strategy firm Ghel throughout last year and will come before council on Tuesday for consideration.
It highlighted a number of challenges currently being dealt with by the city - including its well known “dull” moniker.
“Many Perthlings still view it as quiet and dull and this study aims to change that, creating a city centre that is lively, exciting, and the most attractive place to live, work, and visit in the metropolitan area,” the report said.
It found there had been a 390 per cent growth in the City of Perth’s residential population between 2009 and 2023, with the number expected to climb after Edith Cowan University opened its city-based campus this year.
“Despite recent growth in the number of people calling the city centre home, residential density remains relatively low compared to other Australian cities,” the report said.
“This lack of a critical mass of residents combined with changing retail trends means the 24/7 energy expected from a city centre is often missing.”
Researchers said Perth should aim to draw inspiration from shopping malls in Berlin, main pedestrian thoroughfares in Sydney, opportunities to embed Indigenous culture from Auckland, street design from Vienna and cycling paths from Copenhagen.
The report said one of Perth’s biggest challenges was the continued over-reliance on private transport. It found the CAT bus system was hard to navigate, fragmented cycling paths and key thoroughfares being used as freeway on and off ramps.
It suggested on-street parking should be mainly for short-users or loading docks, the speed limit should be lowered to 30 kilometres an hour and potentially sink the freeway under tunnels to “reconnect the urban fabric”.
The report’s authors also said light rail - such as trams - could be put on St George’s Terrace and Wellington Street to ease traffic, and recommended a cable car from Kings Park down to the city for tourists.
It also acknowledged Perth’s long-maligned retail spaces, and recommended a market hall be established in the city.
“Hay Street Mall has struggled as a retail-only precinct and should evolve into a vibrant street centred around food and beverage offerings, and entertainment-based offerings,” the report said.
“This transition should be actively curated, with a focus on small-scale independent operators offering unique WA culinary and artisan products.”
Specific plans to help Perth’s homeless population were only mentioned once in the report, saying the city should “collaborate with relevant agencies to ensure vulnerable groups, including people experiencing homelessness, are supported through well-resourced public amenities and visible services, particularly around transport hubs and the malls.”

Ukraine war briefing: Kyiv condemns ‘blackmail’ by Hungary and Slovakia in energy supplies dispute

Ukraine’s foreign ministry has condemned what it describes as “ultimatums and blackmail” by Hungary and Slovakia on Saturday, after both governments threatened to stop electricity supplies to Ukraine unless Kyiv restarts flows of Russian oil. Hungary has also threatened to block a €90bn Ukrainian war loan.
-
Shipments of Russian oil to Hungary and Slovakia have been cut off since 27 January, when Kyiv says a Russian drone strike hit pipeline equipment in western Ukraine. Hungary and Slovakia both accuse Ukraine of delaying the restart, without evidence. The Ukrainian foreign ministry said in a statement the country “rejects and condemns the ultimatums and blackmail by the governments of Hungary and the Slovak Republic regarding energy supplies between our countries”. “Ultimatums should be sent to the Kremlin, and certainly not to Kyiv.”
-
Slovakia and Hungary are the only two EU countries that still rely on significant amounts of Russian oil shipped via the Soviet-era Druzhba pipeline over Ukraine. The issue has become one of the angriest disputes yet between Ukraine and two neighbours that are members of the EU and Nato but whose leaders have bucked the largely pro-Ukrainian consensus in Europe to cultivate ties with Moscow. The Slovak leader, Robert Fico, has accused Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy of acting “maliciously” towards his country.
-
Russia attacked Ukraine overnight with dozens of strike drones and ballistic and cruise missiles, focusing on energy infrastructure, officials said on Sunday. The strikes hit Kyiv and the region around the capital, the Black Sea port Odesa and central Ukraine, they said.
-
Powerful explosions shook Kyiv early on Sunday, after officials warned of a possible ballistic missile attack. The alert, just before 4am, urged people to take cover immediately. Moments later, several loud blasts were heard, according to reports. Authorities said air defence units were engaging drones detected over the wider Kyiv region. Kyiv mayor, Vitali Klitschko, said a woman and a child were injured in the attack.
-
Poland’s Operational Command said early on Sunday it had scrambled jets after detecting “long-range aviation of the Russian federation conducting strikes on the territory of Ukraine”.
-
The attacks on Kyiv followed explosions in the western Ukrainian city of Lviv which killed a policewoman and wounded at least 15 people in what local authorities called an “act of terror”. The blasts in Lviv occurred just after police responded to a report of a break-in at a shop in the city centre, according to officials. A first explosion struck as the initial patrol arrived, followed by a second blast moments later. “This is definitely an act of terror,” the Lviv mayor, Andriy Sadovy, said in a Facebook post.
-
Volodymyr Zelenskyy says “real opportunities to end war with dignity still exist”, calling for another round of talks, and hinting at a fresh leaders’ meeting. After he was debriefed on this week’s peace talks with Russia and the US in Geneva, Zelenskyy called for another round of talks to be held “very soon, as early as this February”. He said “Ukraine’s responses to the most difficult questions ahead of the next meeting are ready,” and that they still want to raise some issues at the leaders’ level with Trump and Putin. “It is the leaders’ format that could prove decisive in many respects, and Ukraine is ready for such a format,” he said.
-
Former British prime minister Boris Johnson says the UK and its European allies should immediately deploy noncombat troops to Ukraine to show the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, that western nations are committed to the nation’s freedom and independence. Speaking ahead of the fourth anniversary of Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, Johnson told the BBC that the troops should be sent to peaceful regions in non-fighting roles.
-
A strike by Ukraine against a major missile factory deep inside Russia wounded 11 people, officials in Russia’s Udmurt Republics said. Ukraine’s General Staff confirmed it used Ukrainian-made FP-5 “Flamingo” cruise missiles against the Votkinsk plant. Unofficial Russian Telegram channels also pointed to that site. Russia suspended flights at airports in and near the region. Ukraine also reported a strike on a gas plant in Samara, Russia.
-
About 2,000 people marched in Paris on Saturday, according to police, to show their support for Ukraine. European parliament member Raphael Glucksmann told Agence France-Presse there was “massive” support for Ukraine in France which “has not wavered since the first day of the full-scale invasion”. “On the other hand, in the French political class, sounds of giving up are starting to emerge. On both the far left and the far right, voices of capitulation are getting louder,” he said.

Mark Bailey on his brushes with death, cabinet dumping, and plans to win back Queensland voters

Mark Bailey on his brushes with death, cabinet dumping, and plans to win back Queensland voters
Mark Bailey doesn’t think he’s been handed a poisoned chalice, despite being given a portfolio historically perceived as a burden reserved for political rivals.
Following the late 2023 resignation of former premier Annastacia Palaszczuk, who had loyally stuck by Bailey through periods of intense scrutiny, the former transport minister quit cabinet before almost certainly being dumped by incoming leader Steven Miles.
But less than 12 months later, he was back on the frontbench as the shadow health spokesman following Labor’s election loss.
“I took it on the chin,” Bailey said of his cabinet resignation, in a wide-ranging interview with this masthead in his electoral office in Yeerongpilly.
“That’s politics. Sometimes things happen.”
Bailey says his promotion to the health portfolio shows Miles “has a lot of faith in me” – and he’s adamant the role is an opportunity.
“[Health is] something that does touch everybody’s lives in so many ways.
“Sure, [it’s] one of the hardest portfolios … but that should be something to aspire to.
“It’s not something to complain about. It’s something to get results in.”
The LNP, meanwhile, have based their health sector “results” on Labor’s failures, as they pledge to reduce ambulance ramping rates, cut long elective surgery waitlists, and deliver infrastructure within budget.
With near-weekly regularity over the past year, Premier David Crisafulli and Health Minister Tim Nicholls have said these undertakings are needed to “heal Labor’s health crisis” and revive services after a “decade of decline”. And a large number of voters agree.
Polling in the lead-up to the 2024 state election showed healthcare and aged care ranked as one of the top issues influencing Queenslanders.
Despite a misstep on abortion that nearly saw Crisafulli’s campaign come unstuck, voters ultimately entrusted the LNP to manage the state’s health system for the next four years.
It leaves a long road ahead for the shadow health spokesman, who now has three years to convince Queensland that Labor can return to the driver’s seat in a portfolio that has traditionally been an area of strength. But Bailey is confident he’s got the gumption for it.
“We are going back to the grassroots, reconnecting with the community, and we intend to earn that trust by the next election,” he says.
Bailey’s office sits on the corner of King Arthur Terrace in Yeerongpilly’s Green Riverside Village, a short ride from his home on Brisbane’s southside, an area in which he’s lived since moving with his family from the Gold Coast at the age of six.
His parents divorced seven years after relocating, leaving his mum to raise the household as a single parent. “That was a bit more challenging, but my mum always provided,” he says.
Bailey’s interest in politics – “the contest of ideas” – was stirred during his time at Cavendish Road State High School. By his final year, he was meeting with a group of students in the library every day before school to “dissect The Courier-Mail and debate the issues of the day”.
“We realised we were progressive people, so we all joined the Labor Party the year after,” he says.
Two brushes with death during adolescence have lent extra weight to Bailey’s current political ambitions.
While riding to school along Logan Road, aged 15, he was struck by a car door and “catapulted” into oncoming traffic. In an ambulance to the Princess Alexandra Hospital, paramedics were only convinced that the teen had been run over after seeing black tyre marks on the back of his legs.
Two years later, Bailey spent more than a week in the Mater Hospital’s intensive care unit with salmonella food poisoning.
“The health system saved my life twice,” he says. “I’m not from a wealthy background, it was [because of] a strong public health system and fantastic staff and doctors.”
After high school, Bailey studied at the University of Queensland. Despite graduating with a teaching degree, he spent the next nine years as the deputy chair of Brisbane City Council’s planning committee.
He left council after almost a decade to spend time out of the “political bubble”, moving briefly to Byron Bay before relocating to New York City to pursue acting.
“I kind of felt it in my bones that I wanted to be in a major city,” Bailey says of his 2½-year sabbatical. “It was a great experience … I don’t regret a single day.”
But politics eventually lured him back to Australia. “In the world, there are a lot of actors [but] there aren’t enough activists … there are not enough people getting progressive change done. I thought that’s where I’m most needed.”
He returned to Queensland during the height of Campbell Newman’s reign as LNP premier. “We rapidly went back to the 1980s almost overnight in terms of the meanness [and] the disrespect for people,” Bailey says.
“That made me riled up … and then I decided I’d come back and run for state politics again.”
Bailey won the seat of Yeerongpilly and was given the roads, ports and energy portfolios after Labor ousted Newman in 2015.
Two years later, he replaced Jackie Trad as minister for transport and main roads.
He cites efforts under those portfolios – accelerating the Gold Coast’s light rail project and the Coomera Connector – as some of his proudest political achievements. But the years were not without controversy.
During his time as transport minister, Bailey faced criticism for cost blowouts on key projects, notably a $960 million excess on Brisbane’s Cross River Rail.
He was briefly stood aside from cabinet during a Crime and Corruption Commission investigation into his use of a personal email address in 2017, though was later cleared of corruption.
Last week, he was named in the ongoing CFMEU inquiry, accused of directing his department and its contractors to negotiate with the embattled union, and of running a “sham” consultation on the government’s Best Practice Industry Conditions policy.
When asked about the recent scrutiny, Bailey said it wouldn’t be appropriate to comment at this early stage. “I’m obviously watching, as many people are, the inquiry closely.”
Bailey was among the crowd on Tuesday when Nicholls delivered a keynote speech outlining the LNP’s Hospital Rescue Plan, drafted after a review of Labor’s Hospital Expansion Program found significant budget blowouts and delays.
Such critique, Bailey says, overlooks the challenges wrought by the COVID-19 pandemic. “The criticisms were politically convenient, but the reality was, the pandemic had huge impacts on construction costs, both public and private,” he says.
“We said the criticism was code for cuts and costs. What’s the first thing [the LNP] did? They did a review and cut a whole lot of the hospital expansion programs.”
If Bailey sees his current portfolio as a redemption arc for past misgivings, he’s not wasting time pitching his case to Queenslanders.
Returning serve on the LNP’s “decade of decline” claim, he’s been vocal about the Crisafulli government’s mishandling of last year’s flu season, its ban on pill testing and gender services for children, and its wage negotiations with public healthcare workers.
“You need a government where, from the top down, public health is the first priority that drives every single decision,” he says. “That’s not happening [in Queensland] right now.
“And you need a premier and health minister on the same page … and a health minister who will back best-practice medicine over ideology.
“In opposition, there are a range of things you can achieve through pressure and advocacy … and [the LNP] will get maximum pressure from me.”

China’s vocational degrees rising as students seek skills over prestigious universities
Job-placement rates for vocational undergraduate colleges now outpace traditional universities, as youth unemployment drives pivot to more reliable employment path
When the results of China’s gruelling National Higher Education Entrance Examination – or gaokao – were released last summer, Lin Gangming was surprised to learn that he had scored high enough to attend some of the country’s top universities.
But instead of chasing prestige, the student from Yangjiang, a small coastal city in Guangdong province, chose a different path: Shenzhen Polytechnic University – a public undergraduate vocational college in the province.
Stories like Lin’s, covered by the Shenzhen Special Zone Daily and other publications last year, have become increasingly common in domestic media. Lin was quoted while speaking at a symposium in July for the university’s incoming freshmen.
Amid an oversupply of traditional college graduates, China’s undergraduate vocational track – once seen as a backup plan for underperforming exam-takers – is now a strategic choice for some.
While these institutions grant bachelor’s degrees, their curriculum is geared towards equipping students with technical skills – a major draw for students seeking a more reliable pathway to employment.
“China is making an effort to integrate rather than segregate the academic and vocational-technical components of higher learning,” said Gerard Postiglione, a professor specialising in education in China at the University of Hong Kong. He noted that the recalibration follows economic diversification and accelerating technological development.

Up close and personal: Brisbane clubs commit to getting Gen Z offline
The 20-somethings and late teens of Generation Z often get a bad rap for being addicted to their phones. But these groups are proving young people want to get off the apps to connect face to face.
When Magnus Murray-Douglass felt social media had let him and fellow members of Generation Z down, he turned to something else he thought could bring people together: Brisbane’s rubbish.
Technology has been claimed to connect people, but Murray-Douglass believes it actually drives young people further apart.
He isn’t alone in feeling that way.
About 91 per cent of Gen Zers polled for the Foundation for Social Health in 2025 believed social media adversely affected the strength of their real-life interactions.
The same poll found more than half said their social media usage left them feeling distressed and distracted, and seriously impacted their mental health.
That was one big reason that Murray-Douglass founded Rubbish Club.
“Dating apps claim to have solved that problem [of connection]. Social media claims to bring us closer together,” he says. “But we feel like Rubbish Club is the place that actually brings people closer together.”
His social club is just one of many popping up throughout Brisbane, getting Generation Zers offline and bringing them together.
Here are the stories of a few more.
Three sisters open to a new chapter
Sisters Tayler, Miller and Sienna Kerta are behind the popular BNE Chapters book club.
With monthly events attracting up to 180 attendees and an online community of more than 6000 people on Instagram, the club has become an institution for Brisbane ladies who love reading.
Or as Miller puts it, “every BNE Chapters event is simply chaotic but fun, inviting and relaxing”.
“When we kicked off BNE Chapters, there weren’t many places or social clubs in Brisbane for people to make new friends,” she says.
“The turnout and engagement we receive each month just shows the strong demand for communities and spaces such as BNE Chapters.
“We have absolutely loved watching girls connect at our events.”
The sisters have also started social community We Are WMN, a nod to their Balinese heritage standing for Wayan, Made and Nyoman, which translates to first, second and third born.
The community has hosted bathhouse, Pilates, breath work, trivia and formal ball events.
“We are always trying to include other small businesses and venues in Brisbane, so love to curate events to work alongside these opportunities when they arise,” Miller says.
Tickets are $35 and include a drink on arrival.
Bonding over trash talk
Murray-Douglass, the founder of Rubbish Club, remembers growing up in a school environment where collecting rubbish was punishment for doing something wrong.
He’s hoping to change that script with his Saturday morning meet-ups, which start with a coffee and offer a chance to meet new people while cleaning up Brisbane suburbs in a casual and low-commitment way.
“If we live in such a beautiful landscape and have amazing waterways, why wouldn’t you want to keep those looking amazing?” he says.
“If you can be yapping to your friends while doing it, why wouldn’t you?”
Each week the club wanders around a different suburb and collects rubbish, with plastics being recycled at Murray-Douglass’ company Boe Design – a recyclables company that manufactures furniture.
Attendance is free and members often get a discount at the coffee shop where they meet beforehand.
It’s on the cards
As more young people experience disenchantment with dating apps, 22-year-old Sarah Ellis was inspired to create a card game that connects singles in real life.
“Most single people I speak to are experiencing serious dating app fatigue,” Ellis says.
“The constant pressure to curate the perfect profile, keep conversations interesting and compete for attention has made dating feel more like a chore than something exciting.”
Her game, WE MET AT A BAR, aims to reignite the dating process – the initial spark, the body language – to create opportunities for spontaneous interactions.
It is designed to be played in a bar with prompts such as: “go and compliment a stranger” and “compliment someone’s smile, then walk away”.
Beyond the bar, WE MET AT A BAR has resulted in lasting connections.
“People regularly DM us with stories and photos of the people they’ve met through the game, which is incredibly rewarding to see,” Ellis says.
The game can be bought online for $49.99.
Drop the phone, raise a glass
Another Brisbane-based club aiming to foster face-to-face relationships and allow Generation Zers to explore the city is Social Sips, created by Sasha Kratzmann and Emma Fitzgerald.
The club was inspired by Kratzmann’s time studying abroad in Dublin.
“When I came back to Brisbane, I noticed we were all going to the same familiar spots, and it made me realise that we tend to explore so much when we travel, but rarely do the same in our own city,” she says.
This sparked the creation of the low-commitment social club.
Each month attendees meet at a Brisbane bar with the goal of getting outside their comfort zones and off their phones.
“We’ve had people tell us they’ve met lifelong friends, found housemates, and even met their partners through Social Sips,” Kratzmann says.
She says Gen Z’s shift away from being online is playing a big role in the success of the club.
“I think that’s why we’re seeing more social clubs pop up – people are craving real-life interaction without a screen involved,” Kratzmann says.
Social Sips events are $25 and include a drink on arrival and nibbles.

Deadly explosions rock Ukraine's Lviv city

Explosions in the western Ukrainian city of Lviv have killed a policewoman and wounded at least 15 people overnight in what local authorities on Sunday called an "act of terror".
The blasts occurred shortly after police responded to a report of a break‑in at a shop in the city centre around 2230 GMT Saturday, according to the Lviv regional prosecutor's office.
A first explosion struck as the initial patrol arrived, followed by a second blast moments later when another crew reached the scene.
Officials said a 23‑year‑old woman police officer was killed, while a patrol car and a civilian vehicle were damaged.
"This is definitely an act of terror," Lviv mayor Andriy Sadovy said in a Facebook post. "We have 15 people currently receiving medical aid; some of them are in very serious condition.
"One policewoman died. My condolences to the family and close ones," he added.
Lviv, close to the Polish border and far from the front line, has faced sporadic strikes and security incidents since the Russia-Ukraine war started in February 2022, but deadly explosions in the city centre remain rare.

Huckabee’s Israel land remarks condemned as ‘dangerous and inflammatory’

Governments from across the Islamic world have condemned remarks by the US ambassador to Israel, Mike Huckabee, suggesting it would “be fine” for Israel to claim a broad swath of the Middle East.
Huckabee, an evangelical Christian pastor and former Arkansas governor, has long been an outspoken supporter of Israeli settlements in occupied Palestinian territories.
In an interview with the conservative US commentator Tucker Carlson published on Friday, the ambassador pointed to verses in the Bible that some Jews and evangelical Christians interpret as signifying the divine right of Jews to claim the land from the Nile to the Euphrates.
“It would be fine if they took it all. But I don’t think that’s what we’re talking about here today,” Huckabee said, suggesting that it was Israeli restraint that prevented the Jewish state from exercising its biblical claim.
He added: “We’re talking about this land that the state of Israel now lives in and wants to have peace in. They’re not trying to take over Jordan, they’re not trying to take over Syria, they’re not trying to take over Iraq or anywhere else. They want to protect their people.”
Huckabee later said his remark had been “somewhat of a hyperbolic statement”. But the suggestion that Jews had a divine right to a large part of the Middle East drew a furious response from Muslim governments around the world.
A joint statement signed by a list of countries including Jordan, the United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Turkey, Indonesia and Pakistan, said the ambassador’s comments were “dangerous and inflammatory remarks, which constitute a flagrant violation of the principles of international law and the Charter of the United Nations, and pose a grave threat to the security and stability of the region.”
The US embassy in Israel insisted the comments had been taken out of context by the states making the complaint.
“US policy has not changed,” the embassy said in a statement. “The narrative was based on an edited portion of a response. If one listens to the full context, Ambassador Huckabee clearly says that Israel has no desire to change their current boundaries. Any characterization otherwise is a misrepresentation of the full and unedited response.”
In other comments in what appeared to be an unedited video of the interview with Huckabee that Carlson published online, the ambassador appeared to claim that the roughly 60% of the West Bank under direct Israeli control (known as Area C) was an integral part of Israel, in apparent contradiction to Washington’s official position opposing annexation of any or all of the occupied territories.
“Area C is Israel,” Huckabee said.
The ambassador also gave an expansive interpretation of the biblical areas of Judea and Samaria, ancient geographical terms that Israel uses to refer to the West Bank. Huckabee seemed to go even further.
“Well, you basically take the Jordan River, and it’s west of the Jordan River to the Mediterranean Sea to the Lebanon border,” Huckabee said, again suggesting that Israel had been generous in ceding territory. “Israel did have control of the Sinai. They gave that to Egypt. They had control of it. They gave it away in 1979 in the peace agreement.
“Israel has shrunk the land. They have made that decision. That’s why they gave away Gaza. They’ve given away a lot of things.”
The often tense and combative interview illustrated a rift within the American right over how far the US should go in its support for Israel.
Carlson challenged Huckabee repeatedly on whether his claim about the biblical rights of all Jews to settle in the territory between the sea and the River Jordan was defined ethnically or religiously. Huckabee appeared to argue that it was both, meaning that someone who was born Jewish but converted out of the faith would hold the right to settle there, as well as someone who converted to Judaism.

Russia strikes US-owned production facility in Sumy Oblast
Ukraine's Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha has reported that Russian forces struck a production facility belonging to the US-owned company Mondelez in the town of Trostianets in Sumy Oblast on 21 February.
Source: Sybiha on X (Twitter)
Quote: "Today [21 February – ed.], Russia struck another American business in Ukraine – a civilian production facility of Mondelez in Trostianets – one of the first major US investments in Ukraine's independent economy.
The missile hit one of the production buildings. Fortunately, there were no casualties."
Details: Sybiha noted that the facility "is not a military target but a factory that has operated since the 1990s, producing globally known brands".
Quote: "When Russian missiles hit such sites, they are not only targeting Ukraine. They are targeting American business interests in Europe.
Moscow cannot speak of economic dialogue with the United States while attacking US-owned production facilities."
Background: Oleh Hryhorov, Head of Sumy Oblast Military Administration, reported that Russian forces carried out a missile strike on a civilian business in the Trostianets hromada in Sumy Oblast on 21 February.

Ukraine calls on European partners to boost anti-ballistic missile production

Ukraine calls on European partners to boost anti-ballistic missile production
According to Ukrinform, this was reported by the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine.
Participants in the meeting discussed priorities for strengthening missile defense.
The conference was attended by Polish Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of National Defense Władysław Kosiniak-Kamysz, German Defense Minister Boris Pistorius, French Minister of the Armed Forces Catherine Vautrin, EU High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy Kaja Kallas, and NATO Deputy Secretary General Radmila Shekerinska.
Fedorov emphasized that Europe’s defense industry must urgently increase production capacity for ballistic missile defense systems, as current output levels remain critically low.
He proposed launching joint projects with European countries to develop and manufacture anti-ballistic solutions, adding that Ukraine is already implementing its own initiatives in this area.
Fedorov also stressed the need to continue funding the PURL program, which he described as a key mechanism for obtaining PAC-3 interceptor missiles for Patriot air defense systems.
He thanked partners for the concrete decisions taken during the Ramstein-format meeting.
Separately, Fedorov expressed gratitude to Pistorius for initiating additional deliveries of PAC-3 missiles, noting that Ukraine has already begun receiving them under these agreements.
“Implementation of agreements within hours is an example of how we should work,” Fedorov stressed.
In addition, he said Ukraine is preparing proposals to increase economic pressure on Russia, including asymmetric measures targeting Russia’s shadow fleet.
According to Fedorov, Ukraine is counting on European leadership to implement these measures.
The minister also emphasized the importance of fast and flexible use of the EU defense credit for Ukraine, noting that the funds must serve the primary goal – bringing the war to a successful conclusion for Ukraine.
As Ukrinform previously reported, the goal of E5-format defense ministers’ meetings is to reaffirm Europe’s unity and shared responsibility for security in the Euro-Atlantic area.

Israel prepared for imminent US strike on Iran, but now it’s on hold
Unknown

10:35:17 KST

After a postponement Thursday, the Security Cabinet is set to convene Sunday to discuss preparations for a possible U.S. strike on Iran, addressing both defensive readiness and potential offensive coordination.
Israeli officials are operating under the assumption that Israel would assist the United States in the event of an attack, with responsibilities divided between the two countries.
Israel had prepared for possible action over the weekend, but by Thursday it became clear that any strike had been delayed to an unspecified — though likely near-term — date.
While a diplomatic arrangement between Washington and Tehran remains on the table, officials say the prospects for military escalation currently appear higher.
Deep gaps in the sides’ fundamental positions have complicated efforts to bridge differences. Some officials in Washington view Iran’s leadership as weakened and under economic and political pressure, potentially vulnerable to substantial concessions. Iranian leaders, however, appear reluctant to risk being seen domestically as yielding to U.S. demands, even at the cost of military confrontation.
Ultimately, whether any Iranian compromise proposal is deemed sufficient to avert conflict may rest largely with President Donald Trump. If he concludes that proposed concessions fall short, options ranging from a limited agreement to a broad military strike remain under consideration.
Hoping for the best, preparing for the worst
Should a military confrontation ultimately materialize, Iran’s capacity to inflict significant damage on Israel, U.S. forces in the Middle East and Gulf states should not be underestimated. Iran’s arsenal of ballistic missiles, drones and allied proxy forces could enable Tehran to mount a painful response.
Meanwhile, public discourse in recent years has at times overstated the strength of Iran and allied terrorist groups such as Hezbollah, while downplaying Israeli and U.S. offensive and defensive capabilities.
A confrontation, if it occurs, would not necessarily develop into a prolonged war of attrition without clear outcome. Israel and the United States maintain significant advantages in airpower, intelligence and technology, which could allow for relatively short and focused operations targeting missile and nuclear infrastructure, even if such strikes do not immediately bring about regime change.
The U.S. decision-making process has also drawn scrutiny. It began with public expressions of support for protesters in Iran, continued with sustained negotiations and was accompanied by simultaneous military threats and operational preparations. In previous years, Iran’s missile and nuclear programs were not broadly treated by Washington as sufficient grounds for an all-out war.
From Israel’s perspective, officials see the current moment as a potential opportunity. Jerusalem's concerns extend beyond Iran’s nuclear program to the expansion of its precision-guided missile capabilities. Close coordination with the United States could enable strikes on production, storage and launch infrastructure, and potentially undermine regime stability by targeting centers of power and mechanisms of repression.
A strategic shift — and the possibility of targeting Khamenei
The clearest sign of a strategic shift is the move away from plans for a “short, decisive strike” toward a more prolonged campaign aimed at sustained pressure, military analyst Ron Ben-Yishai wrote Saturday.
The expected arrival of the USS Gerald R. Ford aircraft carrier to the region, capable of launching up to roughly 150 combat sorties per day, underscores the depth of the buildup. Significant additional naval and air forces are also expected to operate alongside it.
Unlike a limited strike, a campaign of attrition would aim at the systematic degradation of regime assets: nuclear facilities, Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps bases, missile arrays and command centers. According to this approach, only sustained military pressure — rather than a one-time strike — could compel Iran’s leadership to consider far-reaching concessions, or at least sharply reduce its strategic capabilities.
At the same time, a broad military operation would not guarantee the collapse of Iran’s government. History shows that ideological regimes can survive severe blows. Still, sustained targeting of senior leadership, security apparatuses and key repression mechanisms could undermine stability and weaken the regime’s hold on the public. Some assessments do not rule out the possibility of targeting Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei or his son, who is widely viewed as a potential successor.
Iranian society has been experiencing an unprecedented level of unrest since the 1979 Islamic Revolution. A combination of heavy external pressure and growing internal instability could create a new dynamic, though its outcome would be unpredictable.
Iranian concerns were reflected in remarks broadcast Saturday on Al Mayadeen, a network aligned with the pro-Iran axis. A source described as close to decision-making circles was quoted as saying: “Any war against Iran would mark the beginning of an inevitable unraveling of the global order. It would open the door for other powers to exploit the change to implement their geopolitical agendas. Such a war would alter the calculations of China and Russia. Fundamental shifts could push China and Russia to impose new geographic realities that serve their interests. Any military confrontation with Iran would not remain confined to its borders but would affect the entire international balance.”
Timing of a potential strike
The timing of any action would depend on military readiness as well as political and regional considerations, including religious sensitivities during the Muslim holy month of Ramadan, concerns about potential disruption to shipping through the Strait of Hormuz and pressure from regional governments.
There is also the risk of unintended escalation, including a possible Iranian preemptive move or a miscalculation that could ignite hostilities.
President Trump may prefer to wait until mid-March, after the end of Ramadan. At the same time, he has publicly referenced a timeframe of 10 to 15 days, raising the possibility that action could come sooner.
The arrival of the USS Gerald R. Ford in the eastern Mediterranean toward the end of the coming week also factors into the decision. Its deployment effectively signals the completion of the U.S. force buildup, aside from the possible dispatch of B-2 strategic bombers, which the United States could send directly toward Iran in an effort to surprise its leadership.
Seizing a historic opportunity
Israeli officials are preparing for the possibility that a U.S.-Iran confrontation could provide an opportunity to significantly weaken Tehran’s missile capabilities and those of its regional allies.
Potential targets include ballistic missile stockpiles and production facilities, as well as missile infrastructure linked to Hezbollah in Lebanon and the Houthis in Yemen. Senior Israeli officials have spoken of removing what they describe as long-term strategic threats to Israel.
Ultimately, options remain under consideration: a limited agreement allowing each side to claim an achievement, a restrained strike or a broad and sustained campaign. The decision will be made in Washington, but its consequences will be felt in Jerusalem, Tehran and capitals across the region.

Pakistan says militant hideouts struck along Afghan border

Pakistan says militant hideouts struck along Afghan border
February 22, 2026Pakistan said Sunday it had carried out strikes against multiple militant hideouts along the Pakistan-Afghanistan border region.
Islamabad did not say precisely which areas it targeted or provide additional details.
The Taliban authorities in Kabul said the Pakistani strikes had killed and wounded "dozens of people."
"Last night, they bombed our civilian compatriots in Nangarhar and Paktika provinces, martyring and wounding dozens of people, including women and children," local media quoted Taliban spokesperson Zabihullah Mujahid as saying.
What did Pakistan say about the strikes?
Pakistan "has carried out intelligence-based selective targeting of seven Terrorist camps and hideouts," a statement by the country's Ministry of Information and Broadcasting said.
It noted that the camps belonged to the Pakistani Taliban, also known as Tehrik-e-Taliban Pakistan, or TTP, and its affiliates.
Pakistan said the strikes were carried out in response to recent security incidents in the country, including asuicide blast at a Shiite mosque in Islamabad two weeks ago and other more recent suicide bombings in northwest Pakistan.
The mosque bombing killed at least 31 people and wounded more than 160.
It was the deadliest attack in Pakistan's capital since the 2008 Marriott hotel bombing.
An affiliate of the so-called "Islamic State" group had claimed responsibility for the bombing.
After the latest suicide bombings, Pakistan's military warned that it would not "exercise any restraint” and that operations against those responsible would continue "irrespective of their location."
What's behind tensions between Pakistan and Afghanistan?
Pakistan has seen a surge in militant violence in recent years.
Islamabad blames Afghan-based elements for the attacks and has accused the Taliban of allowing Afghan soil to be used to harbor militants.
Pakistan wants Kabul to clamp down on the TTP, which is a separate group but closely linked to the Afghan Taliban.
The TTP seeks to impose a hard-line interpretation of Islam, particularly on Pakistan's northwestern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, which borders Afghanistan.
According to Pakistan's government, the group operates from Afghan soil with impunity.
The Afghan Taliban deny the allegations and say they cannot be held accountable for security incidents inside Pakistan.
Fierce fighting erupted between the Pakistani military and Afghan Taliban forces last October, marking the deadliest conflict between the neighbors since the Taliban seized power in Kabul in 2021.
The clashes killed dozens of soldiers, civilians and suspected militants.
Relations between the neighboring countries have remained tense ever since.

Four Years On, Ukraine Supporters Rally in Washington, Call for ‘Rock-Solid’ Western Unity

WASHINGTON -- Four years after Russia launched its full-scale invasion of its neighbor, hundreds of Ukraine's supporters gathered on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial, transforming the heart of the US capital into a sea of blue and yellow.
What began in 2022 as a spontaneous outpouring of shock and solidarity has evolved into what participants on February 21 described as a "heartbreaking tradition."
For the fourth consecutive year, Ukrainians and their supporters assembled in the US capital to mark the anniversary of the war with prayer, song, and defiant chants before marching toward the Russian ambassador's residence.
Organizers said the aim was to demonstrate a united front in Washington and to urge continued US engagement in efforts to end the largest armed conflict in Europe since World War II.
For many Ukrainians in attendance, the rally was more than a symbolic gesture; it was a painful reminder of the destruction still unfolding at home.
One woman, who relocated her family to the United States during the war, said it remains vital to remind the American public of the daily hardships and existential threats Ukrainians endure.
The message repeated throughout the afternoon was clear: The war is about more than territory -- it is about survival.
'A Heartbreaking Tradition'
The rally was organized by leading Ukrainian-American organizations in cooperation with the Ukrainian Embassy in Washington.
Maryna Baydyuk, president of United Help Ukraine, which has held annual events to mark the invasion's anniversary, argued that Ukraine must be viewed not as a supplicant but as a strategic partner.
"We need the support of Americans, but we also need the support of the US government and the current administration," she told RFE/RL.
"We should see Ukraine not just as a country at war, a beggar. We should see Ukraine as an ally…standing in front of a massive Russian army, holding the line -- not just for Ukraine, but for the rest of Europe and for the rest of the free world."
Nova Ukraine, one of the largest US charities providing humanitarian aid to the country, also participated.
Its chief executive officer, Ambassador Erin McKee, told RFE/RL that its goal was to highlight urgent winter needs on the ground -- ranging from basic humanitarian assistance to amplifying the voices of children, teachers, and doctors living through the conflict every day.
Since 2014, the organization says, it has disbursed approximately $150 million in assistance.
European Support on Display
European diplomats joined the rally, underlining what speakers described as essential transatlantic unity.
Jovita Neliupsiene, the EU's ambassador to Washington, echoed the sentiment that the annual gathering has become a "heartbreaking tradition."
"Sometimes we forget that this war is really happening," she told RFE/RL, warning that Moscow continues to "weaponize the winter."
She urged a sustained effort to "push back" and ensure international voices remain united in support of Kyiv.
Asked about the state of Western unity, Neliupsiene noted that while no one wants the war to persist, the challenge lies in achieving a "sustainable, long-lasting, and fair peace."
"If we continue to support Ukraine, if we continue to put massive pressure on Russia via sanctions and other economic measures…and if the aggressor knows that aggression cannot just go away without accountability for war crimes, that would be the right message and the show of unity," she said.
Her message to Russian President Vladimir Putin was direct: "This war can actually stop right now if Russia stops the aggression."
Calls for Peace -- And Accountability
Among the speakers was Pastor Mark Burns, a prominent spiritual adviser to President Donald Trump. Addressing the crowd, Burns questioned how Russia's leadership could justify attacks on civilians and houses of worship while claiming to uphold Christian values.
"How can you be a Christian when you bomb little children who are just walking to church to worship the name of the Lord Jesus?" Burns asked.
"How can you be a Christian when you allow Russian soldiers to rape women? How can you be a Christian when you bomb more than 700 churches in Ukraine?.… That's not the kind of Christianity that I believe in."
Speaking to RFE/RL, Burns said he had visited Ukraine and shared his firsthand accounts of the atrocities he witnessed -- including in Bucha -- with Trump.
"The last conversation I had with the [US] president was a couple of days ago, and he said to me, 'We are very, very close to having a cease-fire,'" Burns said.
He rejected suggestions that Trump favors Moscow, calling such claims false, and asserted that the president is working toward a resolution.
"President Trump wants peace," Burns said. "He knows you cannot trust Russia."
Denys Sienik, deputy chief of mission at the Ukrainian Embassy in Washington, said Kyiv seeks a "credible, lasting, and just” peace backed by clear security guarantees.
“That’s all Ukrainians want,” he told RFE/RL, while accusing Russia of continuing to wage a campaign of terror against civilians.
Sienik stated that Ukraine remains committed to negotiations and expressed gratitude to the Trump administration and other partners involved in peace efforts. However, he stressed the necessity of strengthening Ukraine’s defenses to save lives while talks proceed.
‘Washington Should Not Look Away’
Some demonstrators expressed fears that American attention is waning as the war enters its fifth year. Others argued that Ukraine’s fate has implications reaching far beyond its borders.
Sienik pointed to the size and diversity of the crowd as evidence of enduring support in the United States. "I'm really proud to see not only Ukrainians, but Americans, with us today, as well as Europeans and nationals from other countries," he said. "Every word matters."
As the sun set over the National Mall, thousands began their march from the Lincoln Memorial toward the Russian ambassador’s residence -- a visible show of unity tinged with grief.
Four years ago, few in this crowd imagined they would be standing there again, pleading for the world's attention.

Investment gold retailers move into vacant Hong Kong high-street shops on metal’s rise
‘We see overwhelming demand for investment gold coins and bars,’ retailer San Gold Coins’ Sophia Chen says
These retailers – which sell gold coins and bars, rather than ornamental pieces – have taken up ground-floor store spaces that were left vacant during the city’s post-pandemic recovery.
Their rapid expansion has been followed by the return of high-end jewellery vendors, a development that has helped stabilise rents in some of the city’s most expensive districts.
San Gold Coins, a mainland Chinese bullion retailer with about 100 stores across its home market, has expanded quickly in Hong Kong over the past 18 months. It opened three street-level stores in Central, Causeway Bay and Tsim Sha Tsui, and planned to add up to three more shops this year.
“We see overwhelming demand for investment gold coins and bars, that’s why we decided to ramp up [store expansion],” said Sophia Chen, the retailer’s sixth-generation heir and general manager overseeing overseas business.
While jewellery merchants are common in both Hong Kong and mainland China, investment gold retailers like San Gold Coins remained relatively rare, she said.

Opinion | Executive-led governance in Hong Kong must start by listening to the people
As the head of the Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office has stressed, an executive-led system must be coherent to be effective, and this requires building consensus
Under the Basic Law, the chief executive is the head of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region and the head of the SAR government. Standing at the apex of the executive, legislative and judicial branches of government, the chief executive bears dual accountability – accountable to both the central people’s government and to Hong Kong.
This dual responsibility is central to the governance philosophy. A sound structure does not automatically produce good governance; the governance philosophy of engaging the governed is vital.
If the chief executive is the head of the system, the civil service is its backbone and operational limbs. Hong Kong’s civil servants have long been admired for their efficiency and competence. They are one of Hong Kong’s most valuable governance assets.
Yet given Hong Kong society’s sophistication and rising expectations, administrative competence alone is insufficient. A system may still falter if it does not embed effective channels for aggregating public opinion and building consent in policy formulation and implementation.

The bodies of nine backcountry skiers killed earlier this week were recovered Saturday after an avalanche struck the California side of Lake Tahoe, according to officials.
Authorities said the group was on a day-trip skiing expedition on Tuesday when the avalanche struck.
Six of those killed were close friends described as “passionate, skilled skiers", along with three professional guides.
Relatives identified the victims as Carrie Atkin, Liz Clabaugh, Danielle Keatley, Kate Morse, Caroline Sekar and Kate Vitt.
The Nevada County Sheriff’s Office confirmed that three employees from the Blackbird Mountain Guides, Michael Henry, 30, Andrew Alissandratos, 34, and Nicole Choo, 42, also died in the avalanche.
“We are grateful that we can bring them home,” said Shannan Moon, the sheriff of Nevada County, California, as reported by NBC News.
Five of the victims were recovered and airlifted on Friday by helicopter.
Fifteen skiers were caught in the avalanche. Six survived, including two who sustained non-life-threatening injuries.
Multiple agencies have launched investigations into the avalanche.
The Sierra Avalanche Centre will prepare an incident report and is examining possible workplace safety violations, and the sheriff’s office is conducting its own inquiry.
The storm has dumped 1.7 metres of snow in the past week alone, with wind gusts reaching 90 kilometres per hour.
The Colorado Avalanche Information Centre noted that this season has already seen six other avalanche fatalities in the US.

Ex-PM Gordon Brown tells police to investigate Andrew’s use of jets and bases

Ex-PM Gordon Brown tells police to investigate Andrew’s use of jets and bases
Former British prime minister Gordon Brown has demanded a police investigation into whether Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor used taxpayer-funded jets and RAF bases to meet paedophile Jeffrey Epstein.
The Telegraph can reveal that Brown wrote letters to six police forces suggesting that civil servants be questioned about Mountbatten-Windsor’s time as a trade envoy. The royal was an envoy from 2001 to 2011, including almost three years when Brown was in No. 10.
He has also demanded a full investigation into the trade envoy role, its cost to taxpayers and any evidence that links Mountbatten-Windsor’s government work to Epstein.
His five-page letters were sent individually to police in London, Surrey, Sussex, Thames Valley, Norfolk and Bedfordshire this week, but their contents were not publicly disclosed. Brown said only that they contained “new and additional information”.
The Telegraph can now reveal that they show his deep concern that Mountbatten-Windsor had used chartered RAF flights to transport him to personal engagements that could have involved Epstein, and that the former prince might have leaked confidential information from the trips in a “wholly unacceptable” use of public money.
At the time, Mountbatten-Windsor was nicknamed “Airmiles Andy” for using taxpayer-funded flights to make private leisure or business trips, usually on the way back from a government engagement.
Brown believes that given the close relationship between the two men, the planes may have been used to facilitate meetings with Epstein.
Mountbatten-Windsor has been accused of sexually abusing Virginia Giuffre, who was then 17, after she was introduced to him by Epstein – a claim the former prince has always denied.
Brown wants police to interview officials at four government departments – the Ministry of Defence, the Department for Transport, the Foreign Office and the Treasury – over Mountbatten-Windsor’s trade envoy role, in an attempt to uncover any link to the disgraced financier.
The former prime minister is also understood to be concerned about a flight the convicted paedophile took on a Gulfstream jet that landed at RAF Marham air base in Norfolk in December 2000, which The Telegraph revealed more than a decade ago.
Emails and flight logs that the US Justice Department have disclosed show that the jet, carrying Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell, initially landed at Luton Airport on December 6. The following day, it made the 129-kilometre hop to RAF Marham, this time with two additional passengers, one of whom is listed only as an unnamed “female”.
It reported that after landing at a Ministry of Defence base, Epstein and Maxwell travelled the 32-kilometre journey to the Queen’s Sandringham Estate, where they were entertained by Mountbatten-Windsor, who is alleged to have arranged their access to the base.
The public only learned of Mountbatten-Windsor’s alleged role in facilitating the use of the military airbase after the release of the Epstein files.
Emails show Maxwell raising queries from a Telegraph reporter with Epstein, telling him: “I think that’s crap and not true and you should say so”. He replied: “Just spoke to Larry [Visoski, his pilot], it’s true”.
“S--t..,” Maxwell responded.
In light of the apparent use of British military facilities, Brown has requested that police examine whether Epstein was given access to RAF bases after his conviction for soliciting child prostitution in Florida in 2008.
His letter to police makes reference to a photograph of the former prince lying on the laps of unnamed guests at Sandringham, flanked by Maxwell, Epstein’s “lieutenant”.
The Epstein files revealed how deeply enmeshed the House of York had become with the convicted paedophile. Emails show Epstein and his associates sought to exploit the former prince’s “aura and access” as UK trade envoy, while also dazzling him with offers of female company and lucrative business deals.
Mountbatten-Windsor was arrested on Thursday night (AEDT) on suspicion of misconduct in a public office, after the release of emails that are alleged to have shown he passed sensitive information to Epstein while working for the government.
Brown believes that Mountbatten-Windsor’s use of hundreds of thousands of dollars of taxpayers’ money to fly to the trade envoy meetings may exacerbate the seriousness of his conduct.
In this week’s letters, he gave an extensive list of runways used by Epstein in the UK, including those at commercial airports in Edinburgh, Belfast, Liverpool, Birmingham, Norfolk, Gatwick, Heathrow, Luton and Stansted.
He believes airline employees and staff at the nine airports should be questioned about Epstein’s flights to the UK, after his own analysis of the Epstein files released by the US Department of Justice uncovered emails between Epstein’s pilots and other members of staff discussing flights.
He has called for any records held by the UK Ministry of Defence to be handed to the police, and for a thorough investigation establishing what diligence checks were carried out on Epstein before he was cleared to land.
Brown has said publicly that he is concerned about the complicity of the British state in Epstein’s offences, arguing that Britain’s “unacknowledged role” in the Epstein saga “is by far the biggest scandal of all”.
Mountbatten-Windsor is under investigation for misconduct in public office. The King stripped him of his titles last year, and he now also faces losing his position in the line of succession, following an unprecedented intervention from Downing Street on Friday.
On Saturday, police continued to search Mountbatten-Windsor’s former home, Royal Lodge.
Two of his private bodyguards were photographed stocking up on supplies in King’s Lynn, close to his new Sandringham home, carrying boxes of beer under their arms.
A Ministry of Defence spokesman said it was “standard practice” for private or commercial aircraft to use RAF airfields, “subject to fees which cover all costs”.
The spokesman added: “Such use is not automatic and will only be approved when there is no adverse impact to military aircraft and where approval would not interfere with the security or smooth running of the airfield.”
Mountbatten-Windsor was approached for comment.

Pakistan strikes seven militant camps in Afghan border region
Islamabad said Sunday it had carried out strikes on seven sites along the Pakistan-Afghanistan border region targeting Afghan-based militant groups it blames for recent suicide attacks.
Citing three attacks since the start of Ramadan last week, Pakistan "has carried out intelligence-based selective targeting of seven Terrorist camps and hideouts belonging to Pakistani Taliban" and its affiliates in the border region, a statement by the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting said.
The statement posted on X by Information Minister Attaullah Tarar said Pakistan had also targeted an affiliate of the Islamic State group.
It did not indicate where the strikes were carried out or give further details on them.
The ministry said they were carried out in response to a suicide blast at a Shia mosque in Islamabad two weeks ago and other more recent suicide bombings in northwest Pakistan.
The Islamic State group had claimed responsibility for the mosque bombing which killed at least 31 people and wounded more than 160 in the deadliest attack on Islamabad since the 2008 Marriott hotel bombing.
Pakistan has accused Afghanistan's Taliban authorities of allowing Afghan soil to be used to harbour militants and the relationship between the two countries has deteriorated sharply with deadly border clashes in recent months.

STOCKHOLM, February 22. /TASS/. A dialogue between Russia and Finland is still possible, Finnish Foreign Minister Elina Valtonen said in an interview with Finland’s television and radio broadcaster Yle.
"Well, definitely, at some point... However, we need to come to terms regarding what we want to achieve via this dialogue and determine the responsibilities," Valtonen said in response to a question whether a dialogue with Moscow is still possible in the future.
The Finnish top diplomat said she believed that Europe should play a more significant role in the peace process.
Valtonen also noted that Finland was considering at the moment the possibility of involving former President Sauli Niinisto in negotiations with Russia.
"We have experienced negotiators, and Niinisto is certainly one of them. However, it's not relevant at the moment," she stated.
The Finnish foreign minister also pointed out that it was important to launch a European Union aid package for Ukraine worth 90 billion euros ($106.03 billion), which was previously blocked by Hungary.
According to her, Finland has already helped Ukraine having allocated from its reserves "everything possible, including defense materials and assistance to overcome the energy crisis."
Finnish Prime Minister Petteri Orpo stated in late January that he was ready to sit down at the negotiating table with Russian President Vladimir Putin, however, according to him, the time for such talks has not yet come.
Earlier, Politico reported, citing sources, that European Union countries are discussing the possibility of appointing a special envoy for negotiations on a Ukrainian settlement, who would engage in dialogue with the Russian side on behalf of the bloc. Finnish President Alexander Stubb has been mentioned as a potential candidate for the role.

Afghanistan promises ‘appropriate response’ after deadly Pakistani strikes
At least 17 killed and six missing as Pakistan attacks a school and homes in an operation against the Pakistan Taliban’s camps and hideouts.
Pakistan’s military early on Sunday carried out air raids in Afghanistan, targeting what it called “camps and hideouts” belonging to armed groups behind a spate of recent attacks, including a deadly suicide bombing at a Shia mosque in Islamabad.
Pakistan’s Ministry of Information and Broadcasting said in a statement on X on Sunday that the country’s military conducted “intelligence-based, selective operations” against seven camps and hideouts belonging to the Pakistan Taliban, also known by the acronym TTP, and its affiliates.

The ISIL (ISIS) affiliate in Khorasan Province, or ISKP, which claimed responsibility for a suicide attack in the capital earlier this month, was also targeted in the operation, the ministry said.
The Pakistani ministry said it had “conclusive evidence” that recent attacks in Islamabad, as well as in the northwestern Bajaur and Bannu districts, were perpetrated by fighters at the “behest of their Afghanistan-based leadership and handlers”.
The Afghan Ministry of Defence condemned the attacks that “hit a religious school and residential homes” in the border provinces of Nangarhar and Paktika, “resulting in dozens of deaths and injuries, including women and children”.
The Defence Ministry condemned the attacks as “a breach of international law and the principles of good neighbourliness”, and promised to respond.
“We hold the Pakistani military responsible for targeting civilians and religious sites. We will respond to these attacks in due course with a measured and appropriate response,” it said.
Reporting from the scene of an attack in Nangarhar’s Bihsud district, Al Jazeera’s Naser Shadid said at least 17 people were confirmed killed and six others are missing, feared trapped under the rubble of an attacked house.
“A religious centre was also hit in this area, according to Afghanistan’s authorities, and there are an unknown number of casualties there as well,” he said.
There was no information on any casualties in Paktika yet.
The attacks threaten a fragile ceasefire between the South Asian neighbours, negotiated following deadly border clashes that killed dozens of soldiers, civilians and suspected fighters in October last year.
Pakistan said it has repeatedly urged Afghanistan’s Taliban government to take action to prevent armed groups from using Afghan territory to launch attacks, but that Kabul has failed to “undertake any substantive action”.
Pakistan “has always strived to maintain peace and stability in the region”, it added, but said the safety and security of Pakistani citizens remained its top priority.
“The Pakistanis continue to insist that these are intelligence-based operations against camps located inside Afghanistan and hideouts of the TTP and its affiliate groups. It has warned the Afghan authorities on several occasions that they gave their commitment in the Doha agreement that Afghan soil will not be used by any other country,” Al Jazeera’s Kamal Hyder said, referring to the 2020 agreement the Taliban signed with the United States in the Qatari capital.
The Pakistani air raids on Afghanistan came hours after a suicide bomber attacked a security convoy in the Bannu district of the northwestern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, killing two soldiers, one of them a lieutenant colonel.
On Monday, a suicide bomber, backed by armed men, rammed an explosives-laden vehicle into the wall of a security post in the nearby Bajaur, killing 11 soldiers and a child. Authorities later said the attacker was an Afghan national.
On February 6, another suicide bomber detonated his explosives during noon prayers at the Khadija Tul Kubra mosque in Islamabad’s Tarlai Kalan area, killing at least 31 worshippers and wounding 170 others.
The ISKP had claimed responsibility for the Islamabad attack.
While bombings are rare in the heavily guarded capital, it was the second such attack on Khadija Tul Kubra in three months, raising fears of a return to violence in Pakistan’s major urban centres.
At the time, the Pakistani military said the “planning, training, and indoctrination for the attack took place in Afghanistan”.
In its statement on Sunday, the Pakistani Information Ministry reiterated its call for the international community to press the Taliban to uphold its commitments under the Doha deal. The ministry said the move was “vital for regional and global peace and security”.
Pakistan has seen a surge in violence in recent years, much of it blamed on the TTP and outlawed Baloch separatist groups. Islamabad accuses the TTP of operating from Afghanistan, a charge the group denies.
The Taliban government has also consistently denied sheltering anti-Pakistan armed groups.
Relations between the neighbouring countries have remained tense following the deadly clashes in October. The fighting followed explosions in Kabul, which Afghan officials blamed on Pakistan.
A ceasefire mediated by Qatar on October 19 has largely held, but subsequent talks in Turkiye’s Istanbul failed to produce a formal agreement.

Karyna Shuliak was Jeffrey Epstein's last partner and main heiress. She won't benefit from his will

A loyal companion of sexual predator Jeffrey Epstein, Karyna Shuliak was the last person to speak to him on the phone shortly before his suicide in prison on August 10, 2019. Close to the disgraced financier, to whom she was simultaneously a lover, manager and dependent, she appears as his main beneficiary in the will he wrote in his cell before his death.
According to that document, Shuliak was supposed to inherit $100 million (€85 million) and the criminal's properties: his Manhattan townhouse, his apartment on Avenue Foch in Paris, his private islands, his ranch in New Mexico, as well as a 32-carat ring purchased for $1.2 million. Despite this lavish inheritance, the 36-year-old, who currently lives in New York, will not see a penny, as American and French authorities have decided to freeze the estate to allocate it to a victims' compensation fund.
It all began in 2009. Shuliak, then a 20-year-old student of dental medicine at Minsk University, started corresponding with the billionaire, who was 36 years older than her. Known for his preference for women from Eastern Europe, Epstein invited her – all expenses paid – to the United States, promising help with her studies and support for her visa application. Arriving in New York in August of that year, the young woman became part of the financier's life, just after he had served his first prison sentence for procuring minors for prostitution. He liked her, and he kept his promises.

Hong Kong budget 2026-27: what’s holding back the city’s tech and talent schemes?
Finance chief’s blueprint seen as gauge for officials’ ‘reform mindset’ following Beijing’s 15th five-year plan recommendations
Hong Kong’s coming annual budget must address critical bottlenecks in technology and talent attraction to pave the way for the city’s first five-year development framework in line with national priorities, according to observers.
Against a backdrop of geopolitical tensions, the plan – expected to be officially endorsed next month – prioritises technological self-reliance, “new quality productive forces” and expanding domestic consumption, with “comprehensive reform” as a guiding principle.
The framework outlines Beijing’s support for transforming Hong Kong into an international innovation and technology centre and a global destination for top talent, while consolidating the city’s role as an international financial, aviation and trade hub.
While Chief Executive John Lee Ka-chiu recently said he had instructed all policy bureaus to work “in full force” to devise a “Hong Kong five-year plan” within this year, Chan hinted the budget would include measures to help mainland Chinese innovation and technology enterprises “go global” and promote the clustering of key businesses in the city.
Observers said the government should address critical bottlenecks in Hong Kong’s own tech ecosystem first, as its slowdown did not just affect the city’s competitive edge but extended more broadly to the Greater Bay Area, which covers Macau and nine mainland cities.

No advice from ASIO to block passports of women with alleged IS links, Burke says

Australian officials don't want women and children allegedly linked to the self-proclaimed Islamic State (IS) group to return to the country, but the threshold hasn't been reached to bar them from receiving passports.
Some 34 women and children tied to Australians who travelled to the Middle East to fight for the terrorist group have been trying for days to travel home from a Syrian refugee camp.
The cohort has been issued with Australian passports, a right afforded to citizens, but one of the women has been given a temporary exclusion order, barring their re-entry for up to two years.
Home Affairs Minister Tony Burke said security agencies had not passed on any advice that would block the group from receiving the required travel documents to return to Australia.
"There's been no advice from ASIO that the Passports Act provisions have been activated," he told ABC's Insiders program on Sunday.
"On the information that we have, the best way to protect Australians has not involved any further temporary exclusion orders.
"We don't want them to come back ... we're actively making sure we do nothing to help them."
The 34-strong cohort was not a coherent group, Burke added, but enough information was available to issue the single exclusion order.
"We know the different individuals, we know the state of mind and effective ideology of different individuals," he said. "Our agencies have been following them for a long time."
The minister noted a majority of the cohort were born in Australia and he confirmed state and federal agencies had been working together to mitigate any potential risks from their return.
Burke also rejected claims made in a report in the Sunday Telegraph asserting that official preparations were underway for the cohort’s return.
"In that report, it makes a claim that we are conducting a repatriation. We are not," Burke said.
"It claims we have been meeting with the states for the purposes of a repatriation. We have not," Burke added.
Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said the government was not in contact with any member of the cohort, but he threatened charges would apply if they came back to Australia.
"Australian citizens have rights and they also have responsibilities, and those responsibilities mean that the Australian government, like with anyone else, will apply the full force of the law to anyone who has broken Australian law," he told Sky News.
"Is Australia providing repatriation, which did occur in 2019 and 2022? No is the answer to that."
Labor has been under pressure from the opposition to block the entire group from entering Australia, however Albanese said his government was operating under laws introduced by the Coalition.
"When it comes to the issue of citizenship, that has rights as well under our constitution," the prime minister said. "There are issues there and the Coalition know that is the case."
Opposition defence spokesman James Paterson reiterated that the government should do more to stop the cohort's arrival.
"It is very clear that the government can refuse a passport to an Australian citizen if they receive advice from a competent authority like ASIO or the AFP if a person is a threat to security," he said. "Denying their passport would deal with that threat to security."
The granting of a temporary exclusion order to one of the cohort meant further orders could be granted, Paterson added. "Those powers need to be used and this government seems very reluctant to use them," he said.

Teens find body in northern Israel ravine during climb

09:52:33 KST

Three teenage boys on a rock-climbing training hike in northern Israel made a grim discovery Friday when they found the body of a man in his 20s in the Amud Stream nature reserve.
The teens, residents of the Galilee community of Kahal, spotted the body among rocks and dense vegetation in the early afternoon. Authorities said a preliminary assessment indicates the man fell to his death from a significant height roughly 12 hours before he was found.
Security forces rushed to the scene despite the initial report that a body had been located, holding out hope that the man might still be alive. An Israeli Air Force helicopter carrying a team from the elite 669 search-and-rescue unit was dispatched to the area. A physician who was lowered to the rugged site pronounced the man dead at the scene.
The victim’s car was later located in a nearby parking lot at the Moshel Kahal area, and his family was notified. The body was transferred from the Upper Galilee to the National Center for Forensic Medicine in Tel Aviv for examination to determine the precise cause of death. Police said they are investigating the circumstances.
The task of recovering the body was assigned to volunteers from the Galil-Golan police search-and-rescue unit, who were responding to their fifth life-saving callout in the past week. Working in difficult and complex terrain, rescuers used rope systems in an operation that required advanced technical skill. The unit said the mission was carried out under real risk to volunteers, reflecting their commitment to retrieving every person from the field, even when rescue is no longer possible.
Behind the scenes, the operation sparked controversy. Inbal Shoham, the mother of one of the teenagers who found the body and a candidate in the Democrats party primary, criticized the conduct of authorities at the scene.
In a social media post, Shoham alleged that her son and his friends were left alone at the site for hours and were instructed by police and the Magen David Adom emergency service to photograph, document and help guide responders. She said the teens were required to repeatedly climb up and down the ravine to assist arriving forces and claimed that adult hikers in the area refused to help. “They stayed there and managed the incident until forces arrived,” Shoham wrote.
Speaking to ynet, Shoham clarified that her criticism was not directed at the volunteer rescue unit but at police officers who she said did not immediately descend to the rocky, brush-covered ravine where the body lay. She said the teens found themselves near the scene for about two hours, effectively “managing” the situation while assisting search and rescue teams who had difficulty accessing the site. She also alleged that forensic investigators did not descend to collect documentation or investigate the fall and instead relied on photographs the teens were asked to take.
Israel Police and the Galil-Golan rescue unit rejected Shoham’s claims, saying management of the scene and the recovery operation were conducted in accordance with established operational protocols for such complex terrain. Volunteers from the unit said rescue and recovery personnel were alongside the body at all stages, from the arrival of Unit 669 and the police rescue team until the body was extracted.

Artist creates ‘Latin American Mona Lisa’ with plastic bottle caps

SAN SALVADOR - Call it a Renaissance in recycling.
A massive mural made of plastic bottle caps depicts Latin America’s version of the famed Mona Lisa, adorning a modest apartment building in a working class neighbourhood outside the capital of El Salvador instead of the walls of the Louvre.
Using a rainbow of colours and various sizes of caps, Venezuelan artist Oscar Olivares’s latest installation is 13m tall and takes inspiration from Renaissance master Leonardo da Vinci as well as the pointillist paintings of French artist Paul Signac.
“I wanted to portray a Latin American Mona Lisa,” Mr Olivares told AFP.
The mural is in Zacamil, in the Mejicanos suburb of San Salvador – an area that was once controlled by violent gangs, whose activity has been curbed by President Nayib Bukele’s controversial security crackdown.
“The Mona Lisa is an ordinary woman, and she’s an icon of the Italian Renaissance” – and now “we are living through a new Renaissance, both in El Salvador and the world,” Mr Olivares said.
Completed in three weeks, the composition is made of more than 100,000 recycled bottle caps, after they were gathered by local residents over several months, washed and sorted.
Instead of the muted palette of the Italian countryside, Mr Olivares replaced da Vinci’s pastoral background with bright depictions of homes, a bold blue mountain and a colorful checkerboard sky.
And it wouldn’t be the Mona Lisa without her penetrating gaze and that ever-elusive smile, this time seen on a sun-kissed face rendered with red, orange and yellow caps.
Her jewelry, hairstyle and colorful dress evoke a modern Latina woman’s graces.
Mr Olivares has created murals using plastic caps in Venezuela, Mexico, Saudi Arabia, France and Italy, finding use for over 2 million caps in more than two dozen murals.
He hopes his work will give viewers “a completely different view of plastic waste.” AFP

Nine bodies recovered in deadly California avalanche, officials say

LOS ANGELES - The bodies of nine skiers who were killed in an avalanche in the mountains near Lake Tahoe
A ninth victim who had been missing was found and recovered along with four other victims on Feb 20, Lt. Dennis Haack of the Nevada County sheriff’s office said at an afternoon news conference.
Four other victims were recovered on the morning of Feb 21, according to the sheriff’s office.
“While we wish we could have saved them all, we are grateful that we can bring them home,” said Ms Shannan Moon, the sheriff.
The avalanche on Feb 17 was the deadliest in modern California history. The victims were part of a group of 15 people, including four professional guides, finishing up a three-day backcountry trek through Castle Peak, a remote part of the Sierra Nevada.
The group had set out on its expedition on Feb 15 even as the region anticipated its first big blizzard of the year and an avalanche prediction center had warned of a “high” danger level for travel in avalanche-prone areas.
Officials for the first time identified the victims, including a group of six women and three of the group’s guides, two men and one woman. The six women were Carrie Atkin, 46; Liz Clabaugh, 52; Danielle Keatley, 44; Kate Morse, 45; Caroline Sekar, 45; and Kate Vitt, 43.
Family members, who had previously identified the women, said they were a friend group, including two sisters, who regularly took trips to the Lake Tahoe area. Several were from the Bay Area. The three guides, who worked for Blackbird Mountain Guides, were Andrew Alissandratos, 34; Michael Henry, 30; and Nicole Choo, 42.
Officials said on Feb 21 that the recovery operations began on Feb 20, after they took steps to reduce the threat of further avalanches in the area and deemed conditions safe enough to send in rescuers. A storm that passed on Feb 19 also had complicated recovery efforts.
All of the bodies were hoisted out using helicopters and taken to a staging area near Frog Lake huts, where the group of skiers had been lodging before their trip, officials said. The ninth victim, who had been missing, was found “relatively close to where everyone else was located”, Mr Haack said.
Officials had previously said the ski group had been caught in an avalanche about the size of a football field around 11.30am on Feb 17. Six survivors, four men and two women, were rescued after using avalanche beacons and the SOS satellite function on their iPhones.
Rescuers had travelled for several hours in a snowcat, a treaded vehicle, over difficult terrain before finally reaching the survivors around 5.30pm on Feb 17, according to the county sheriff’s office. The survivors led the rescue team to the remains of three people, and rescuers later located five other victims. NYTIMES

Epstein survivor slams Les Wexner’s ‘abhorrent’ testimony
Maria Farmer says she ‘suffered abuse at the hands of Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell’ at Wexner’s estate
- Bookmark
- CommentsGo to comments
A survivor of Jeffrey Epstein’s abuse has spoken out against billionaire Leslie Wexner, describing his recent deposition to members of Congress as “abhorrent.”
Wexner, the 88-year-old founder of retail conglomerate L Brands, sat for a nearly five-hour deposition Wednesday with members of the House Oversight Committee. Lawmakers subpoenaed Wexner after the latest release of the so-called Epstein files by the Department of Justice revealed new details about his relationship with the dead sex offender, who once worked as his financial adviser.
Appearing in the Epstein files does not imply wrongdoing, and Wexner has never been charged with a crime. Wexner has also denied knowing about Epstein’s criminal activity.
“I was naive, foolish, and gullible to put any trust in Jeffrey Epstein,” Wexner said in a statement ahead of the interview. “He was a con man. And while I was conned, I have done nothing wrong and have nothing to hide.”
Maria Farmer, who said she was abused by Epstein and his convicted co-conspirator Ghislaine Maxwell at Wexner’s estate decades ago, has now accused the retail mogul of “downplaying his relationship with Epstein” during his deposition.
“I am glad Wexner’s deposition, this lever of power, is being used to try to achieve some accountability and justice for the many survivors whose trauma has for so long been ignored, dismissed, or discounted,” Farmer said in a statement shared with The Independent Saturday.
“Wexner’s reported downplaying of his relationship with Epstein is abhorrent, particularly given Maxwell’s own description of him as Epstein’s closest friend. I am also troubled by Wexner’s stated lack of knowledge about my abuse and suffering on his property,” she added.
Farmer said the abuse began 30 years ago.
“In the summer of 1996, I served as the artist-in-residence at Les Wexner’s estate. I was instructed to obtain a driver’s license using the address of Wexner’s home,” she said. “Later that summer, while working and living on Wexner’s estate, I suffered abuse at the hands of Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell.”
Farmer’s statement included a photo of her driver’s license at the time, which appears to list an Ohio address.
She also said Epstein stole photographs of her and her minor sisters, which she described as “private anatomically-revealing photographs I used for artistic reference and kept numbered in a lockbox.”
“When I attempted to escape Wexner’s estate, I was threatened by his employees and associates, sharpshooters, guns and guard dogs, and held against my will,” she added.
Farmer said she eventually escaped and reported Epstein and Maxwell to law enforcement.
“I told the FBI about Epstein and Maxwell’s sexual abuse of me on Wexner’s estate, the theft there of the images, and being held on Wexner’s estate,” she said.
Farmer’s report to the FBI was included in a trove of Epstein-related files released late last year. The document reveals Farmer told the agency Epstein stole photos she had taken of her 12- and 16-year-old sisters. Farmer later said in an interview this included nude photos, according to The New York Times
A spokesperson for Wexner directed The Independent to his opening statement to the committee, during which he acknowledged “the survivors of Epstein’s terrible crimes and the devastation that each of them has endured as a result,” and said his “heart goes out to each of them.”
“As Mr. Wexner testified, he never even heard of Maria Farmer until her account surfaced in the media,” the spokesperson told The Independent. “Ms. Farmer’s statement is incorrect in many respects. Contrary to her statement, Epstein’s house, where the abuse is said to have occurred, was not on land owned by the Wexners, was nearly one half mile away from the Wexner home, and was accessed through a separate driveway not controlled by Wexner security. There were no sharp shooters or guard dogs policing Epstein’s property.”
The Independent has requested additional comment from a representative for Farmer.
Wexner, the former CEO of Victoria’s Secret, has said he cut ties with Epstein in 2007 after discovering the financier was stealing from him. Epstein pleaded guilty to state-level charges of soliciting prostitution in Florida in 2008.
He told lawmakers Wednesday he was “conned by the World Olympic, all-time con artist.”
“As far as I was concerned, once we knew how bad he was, he was dead,” he said.
When asked about Farmer, Wexner replied: “I never met her, didn’t know she was here, didn’t know she was abused.”
The deposition also made headlines after Wexner’s attorney, Michael Levy, was caught on a hot mic telling him, “I will f***ing kill you if you answer another question with more than five words.”
The Independent has contacted Maxwell’s attorney for comment.

Huckabee draws backlash over claim Israel has right to much of Middle East

Muslim and Arab nations on Saturday condemned remarks by U.S. Ambassador to Israel Mike Huckabee, who said in an interview that Israel has a biblical right to control territory described in the Bible as the “Promised Land,” an area that would encompass much of today’s Middle East.
In the interview with conservative commentator Tucker Carlson, Huckabee was asked about the biblical promise to Abraham that his descendants would inherit land stretching “from the Nile to the Euphrates,” a territory spanning from Egypt through parts of modern-day Syria and Iraq. Carlson asserted that such a description would effectively include most of the Middle East and asked whether Israel was entitled to that land.
“That would be the Levant. So that would be Israel, Jordan, Syria, Lebanon. It would also be big parts of Saudi Arabia and Iraq,” Carlson said. “It would be,” Huckabee replied, appearing somewhat uncomfortable.
“Israel is a land that God gave through Abraham to a people that he chose. It was a people, a place and a purpose,” added Huckabee, an evangelical Christian. Pressed again by Carlson on whether the Jewish people have a right to all the territory mentioned in the Bible, Huckabee responded: “It would be fine if they took it all.”
Huckabee emphasized that Israel has no intention of expanding into those areas, but the comments quickly drew backlash.
Saudi Arabia called the ambassador’s remarks “dangerous” and “irresponsible.” In a statement, the Saudi Foreign Ministry said it “strongly condemns the statements of the U.S. ambassador to Israel, in which he recklessly suggested that Israeli control over all of the Middle East would be acceptable.” The ministry said the comments violated international law, the UN Charter and diplomatic norms.
“This extremist rhetoric portends grave consequences and threatens international peace and security by antagonizing the countries and peoples of the region and undermining the foundations of the international order,” the statement said.
“In this regard, the Kingdom reiterates its firm and longstanding position rejecting any actions that undermine the sovereignty, borders, and territorial integrity of states. It stresses that the only path toward a just and comprehensive peace is ending the occupation based on the two-state solution and the establishment of an independent Palestinian state along the 1967 borders, with East Jerusalem as its capital.”
Jordan described the remarks as “an infringement on the sovereignty of the countries of the region.” Egypt’s Foreign Ministry said Israel “has no sovereignty over the occupied Palestinian territory or other Arab lands,” calling the statement a “blatant violation of international law.”
The Palestinian Foreign Ministry protested Huckabee’s agreement with the idea that Israel has a biblical right to rule from the Nile to the Euphrates, saying the remarks contradict religious and historical facts, international law and the declared position of President Donald Trump opposing annexation of the West Bank.
The Arab League and the Organization of Islamic Cooperation also issued condemnations, saying the comments were extreme and provocative and do not reflect official U.S. policy. The Arab League said such statements “serve only to inflame sentiments and stir religious and national emotions.”
Later, Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Jordan, the United Arab Emirates, Indonesia, Pakistan, Turkey, Qatar, Kuwait, Oman, Bahrain, Lebanon, Syria and the Palestinian Authority, along with the Organization of Islamic Cooperation, the Arab League and the Gulf Cooperation Council, released a joint statement expressing “strong condemnation and deep concern” over Huckabee’s remarks. The statement said it would be unacceptable for Israel to exercise control over territories belonging to Arab states, including the West Bank.
The interview also drew attention for additional controversial comments by Carlson. During the exchange, Carlson questioned whether Jews are truly descendants of Abraham and suggested conducting DNA tests on all residents of the land to determine who the “real” descendants are.
Neither the Israeli government nor the Trump administration immediately responded to the criticism.
The interview gained additional attention after Carlson claimed that members of his team had been detained for questioning at Israel’s Ben Gurion Airport, an assertion denied by both Israeli authorities and the U.S. administration.
Carlson, who for years hosted a popular prime-time program on Fox News and was once considered relatively mainstream within the U.S. conservative movement, was dismissed by the network in 2023 following a defamation lawsuit tied to false claims about the 2020 presidential election. Since then, he has become a prominent podcaster whose videos on the social media platform X draw tens of millions of views.
In recent years he has adopted a more hard-line and isolationist stance within the pro-Trump MAGA movement and has frequently criticized Israel, at times promoting conspiracy theories, including allegations that Israel’s Mossad intelligence agency operated disgraced financier Jeffrey Epstein.

Islamic State claims two attacks on Syrian army, announce new operations
Islamic State claimed responsibility on Saturday for two attacks targeting Syrian army personnel in northern and eastern Syria, as the militant group signalled what it described as a new phase of operations against the country's leadership.
The militant group said on its Dabiq news agency that it had targeted "an individual of the apostate Syrian regime" in the city of Mayadin in Deir az-Zour province using a pistol, and attacked two other personnel with machine guns in the northern city of Raqqa.
Syria's Defence Ministry said in a statement that a Syrian army soldier and a civilian were killed on Saturday by "unknown assailants." A military source told Reuters the soldier belonged to the army's 42nd Division.
The attacks come amid a sharp escalation by IS against Syria's leadership under President Ahmed al-Sharaa, the former leader of an al Qaeda affiliate who broke with the group in 2016 before leading a coalition of Islamist factions that overthrew President Bashar al-Assad at the end of 2024.
On Saturday evening, IS released a recorded statement by its spokesperson, Abu Hudhayfa al-Ansari, who said Syria had "moved from Iranian occupation to Turkish-American occupation."
The group said it had begun a "new phase of operations" in Syria, describing Sharaa as a "watchdog" of the global coalition and vowing that his fate would be no different from that of Assad.
Sharaa signed Syria's accession to the global coalition to defeat IS during a visit to the US last November, when he met President Donald Trump.
The latest incidents come two days after IS claimed responsibility for another attack in Deir az-Zour that killed a member of the Interior Ministry's internal security forces and wounded another.
Several social media accounts and Telegram channels supporting IS have in recent hours called for intensified attacks using motorcycles and firearms.
IS has carried out six attacks against Syrian government targets since the fall of Assad.
A report by the UN Office of Counter-Terrorism released last week said Sharaa and two senior cabinet ministers had been targeted in five foiled assassination attempts by IS.

Is it time for the EU to stop funding the Palestinian Authority?

Is it time for the EU to stop funding the Palestinian Authority?
The European Union and its member states have long presented themselves as supporters of the Palestinian people, mainly through their backing of the Palestinian Authority (PA). But is this actually ‘solidarity’ with Palestinian aspirations, or a tool to perpetuate the Israeli occupation?
In reality, the consistent support that the EU has given the PA is more of a token gesture, rather than a true effort toward Palestinian liberation and justice. Rather than challenging and confronting the Israeli occupation and its complicity through sanctions, the EU’s support has become a tool for managing it.
In 1980, the EU’s position on Palestine was officially formed in the Venice declaration. That declaration articulated the “two-state” logic by recognising Israel’s “right to exist” along with other vague statements around “justice for all the people” and Palestinian rights to self-determination and right to return.
In the 1990s, during the negotiations leading to the Oslo Accords, the EU solidified its position. It viewed this period as a key opportunity to position itself as a champion of Palestinian statehood, invoking “international law and the principles of Oslo.” However, at its core, the EU understood the creation of the Palestinian Authority (PA), established as a temporary administrative body under Israeli occupation, as a mechanism to ensure the continuity of the Zionist project, with little or almost no regard for Palestinian rights.
Former Israeli foreign minister Shlomo Ben-Ami described the role of the Palestinian Authority following Oslo as “Israel’s collaborator”, tasked with oppressing any political or social uprisings against the Israeli occupation and reducing the Palestinian struggle to economic reforms and security issues.
In 1997, the EU signed the Interim Association Agreement on Trade and Cooperation with the PA. This agreement has served as the legal basis of the EU-PA relations. Since then, the EU started offering up to €300 million a year to the PA, focused on projects related to economic development and infrastructure - a code for PA stability amidst Israel’s occupation.
Doubling down
Under Ursula von der Leyen’s leadership, the European Commission has understood that the Zionist project, realised through the state of Israel, faces existential threats.
As European public opinion and civil mobilisation grow increasingly critical of the EU–Israel strategic alliance, Brussels has doubled down on sustaining that project by further instrumentalizing the Palestinian Authority (PA). It has increasingly presented the PA as the sole legitimate representative of the Palestinian people.
Almost two months into Israel’s genocide in Gaza, in late November 2023, former EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell argued that a Palestinian state offers Israel's best security guarantee, linking it to the stability of the PA. December 2023 saw €118 million provided for PA stability; July 2024 brought €400 million in emergency grants and loans tied to governance reforms, anti-corruption, and education.
On April 14, 2025, the EU hosted its first high-level dialogue with the PA in Luxembourg, proposing a €1.6 billion 2025-27 program - €620 million as direct PA budget support - for recovery and resilience. June 2025 added over €150 million, channelled via mechanisms like PEGASE for salaries and fiscal gaps. In 2025 alone, the PA has received €172 million in financial assistance from the EU.
In doing so, the EU seeks to mislead millions of Europeans who have taken to the streets demanding an end to EU-Israel relations. It attempts to convince audiences that the EU’s support for the Palestinian Authority (PA) equates to backing the Palestinian struggle.
In reality, the PA has long lost its legal and moral legitimacy. Its president has remained in power since 2005 without elections, and the institution is widely seen by Palestinians as a symbol of corruption, nepotism, clientelism, and the repression of dissent.
A staggering 87% of Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza believe that the PA is corrupt.
To sympathetic observers abroad, it may appear as a government-in-waiting, steadily building the institutions of a future state. But on the ground, and for the majority of Palestinians, it is widely perceived as an elite clinging to power, serving Israel’s interests (and its Western allies), and maintaining a façade of economic progress under an ever-expanding settler-colonial project that devours the West Bank, Gaza, and Jerusalem piece by piece, day after day.
Under Israel’s control at all times
Following the US‑backed peace plan, supported by Israel and allies like the EU, which identified education reform as a central element, the PA recently introduced major changes to the national school curriculum. The revisions remove much of the national content and adjust historical and cultural narratives, softening or eliminating references to the occupation, expulsion, and injustice while promoting narratives of peace and coexistence.
Lessons that previously focused on Palestinian political prisoners have been replaced with topics on extremism and broader social issues.
As Israel deepens its de facto annexation of the West Bank, the European Union’s billions in aid, taken from European taxpayers and given to the PA, are being wasted. Stripped of any real political or sovereign authority, the PA is only a local administrator of services under Israeli military control.
The EU, including its left-leaning parties, must face an uncomfortable truth: the Palestinian Authority represents no one but itself. It wields no power on the ground and cannot gain any while Israel’s military occupation endures and corruption eats its institutions.
Equally, the EU must confront reality: the so‑called two‑state solution, long used to justify political and financial support for the PA, is no longer viable. Decades of impunity for Israel’s settler‑colonial and apartheid regime have rendered it obsolete. Moreover, allowing anyone other than Palestinians to determine their future denies them their fundamental right to self‑determination, a right that belongs to them alone.
Instead of clinging to a failed model that entrenches injustice, the EU must first end its complicity in Israel’s occupation and then support the emergence of new, accountable Palestinian leadership. Only when the occupation ends can a truly representative leadership, reflective of people’s realities and wishes, arise to lead the struggle for justice, and ultimately lasting peace.

Kemi Badenoch pledges to cut interest paid on student loans
The Tories have promised to limit the rate on Plan B loans
- Bookmark
- CommentsGo to comments
Kemi Badenoch has pledged to cut the amount of interest paid on some student loans amid widespread concerns over costs.
The Tories have promised to limit the rate on Plan B loans to the retail price index (RPI) in a move that will heap further pressure on the Treasury.
Following Chancellor Rachel Reeves' November budget, the salary threshold at which repayments kick in under the system will be frozen at £29,385 for three years, leading to many having to pay more.
Interest on Plan 2 loans is charged at the rate of RPI inflation plus up to 3%, depending on how much a graduate earns.
The Conservative leader has announced plans to restrict this to RPI only, which the Tories argue would help higher numbers of graduates pay off their debt.
Ms Reeves has suggested the Government will be able to cut repayments on student loans by bringing down inflation, after a backlash to last November's budget announcement.
She said earlier this month: "By getting inflation down, we can also reduce the interest on student loans and I think that will make a big difference in making that more affordable."
Campaigners have accused the Treasury of acting like a loan shark, while Labour's deputy leader, Lucy Powell, described existing interest rates on Plan B loans as egregious and suggested the burden was unfair.
The Conservatives want to cut the number of university entrants by 100,000, which they say would save the Government £3.6 billion, and fund the same number of extra apprenticeships for 18 to 21-year-olds, as part of a "new deal for young people", the Sunday Times reported.
Young UK citizens starting their first full-time job would also see the first £5,000 of national insurance they pay put into a personal savings account, which could be used to buy a home.
Writing for the Telegraph, Mrs Badenoch said: "I am horrified at what graduates today are dealing with, and this is one of the reasons millions of young people feel they've been stitched up.
"Plan 2 student loans, the system most people who started university from 2012 to 2023 are on, increasingly feel like a scam."
She added: "If we want a country that rewards work, builds skill, and restores pride in practical achievement, we have to stop looking down on the very training routes that build the country."
The Treasury has been contacted for comment.

BERLIN, February 22. /TASS/. The United States may play a key role in the potential resumption of the Nord Stream pipelines’ work, German daily Berliner Zeitung reported citing its sources.
According to the daily, Washington may start delivering the Russian natural gas to Europe again, hoping to expand the United States' control over the energy infrastructure in the region. The German daily reports that negotiations, which are closed to the public and media, are allegedly underway on the possible resumption of the Nord Stream pipelines’ work.
French daily Le Monde diplomatique also reported earlier that informal contacts regarding the possible resumption of Nord Stream work are held without the participation of international institutions and are closed to the public. The daily called it "behind-the-scenes diplomacy."
Unprecedented damage to three strings of the Nord Stream 1 and Nord Stream 2 offshore gas pipelines was recorded on September 26, 2022. The Russian Prosecutor General’s Office opened a criminal case into an act of international terrorism.

'The attack was organized by Russia' — Suspected terrorist strike in Lviv kills police officer, injures 25
Editor's note: This is a developing story.
The explosions that killed one police officer and injured 25 other victims in western Ukraine's Lviv on Feb. 22 were part of a terrorist attack planned by Russia, President Volodymyr Zelensky said in a video address.
"It was indeed a terrorist attack, cynical and cruel," he said after being briefed by law enforcement and the Interior Affairs Ministry.
Two blasts rocked Lviv's historic Old Town in the early hours of Feb. 22, shattering windows in the area.
The explosions took place after officers arrived at the scene responding to a reported store intrusion, Ukraine’s National Police said in a statement. A second explosion took place after another police crew arrived at the scene, Lviv Oblast's Prosecutor's Office added.
Explosions were heard by a Kyiv Independent journalist on the ground at approximately 12:25 a.m. local time.
One officer was killed and 25 people were injured in the blasts. Ukraine's national police identified the officer killed as 23-year-old Viktoria Shpylka.
A 33-year-old woman has been arrested and charged with committing a terrorist attack, according to the General Prosecutor's Office. Ihor Klymenko, Ukraine's Interior Minister, announced the detention of a suspect on Sunday morning.
"The police, in cooperation with the Security Service of Ukraine, have arrested a suspected saboteur," Klymenko said.
The woman is a resident of Kostopil in northwestern Rivne Oblast, the Prosecutor's Office said. There is "objective evidence" that the suspect committed a terrorist attack, according to Nazar Markiv, head of the department for monitoring compliance with the law by regional security agencies.
The woman had been temporarily residing in Lviv since September 2025. She is suspected of planting the explosive devices at the scene of the attack the day before the blasts, fleeing by taxi, and detonating the devices remotely.
She was arrested in Staryi Sambir, a Lviv Oblast city close to the Polish border. According to Lviv Mayor Andrii Sadovyi, the detainee is a citizen of Ukraine.
Zelensky said the attack was still being thoroughly investigated, but that some facts about the case had already been confirmed.
"The perpetrators were recruited via Telegram," he said. "The attack was organized by Russia."
Zelensky said that the full details would be presented to the public by the Interior Ministry, the National Police, and the State Security Service (SBU) after the investigation.
"My condolences to the families. All necessary resources have been provided to the investigation," Zelensky said.
The president also said he had given orders to develop new measures to prevent similar crimes.
"We have intelligence indicating that the Russians intend to continue carrying out such actions — in effect, attacks on Ukrainians," he said. "We must strengthen protection for our people."
As of the evening of Feb. 22, 12 people have been hospitalized due to injuries sustained in the explosions, with two in serious condition. All of the injured victims, with the exception of one teenager, are law enforcement employees who responded to the call, Mayor Sadovyi said.
"This is a hostile special operation aimed at killing as many law enforcement officers as possible," he said.
Klymenko echoed this sentiment, pointing out that Russia has previously targeted Ukrainian law enforcement in similar plots.
"There is every reason to believe that the crime was carried out on the orders of Russia. It's not the first time that the enemy has deliberately set up deadly traps for Ukrainian law enforcement officers," Klymenko said.
Marco, a 38-year-old Lviv resident walking his dog on the morning of Feb. 22, told a Kyiv Independent journalist at the scene that the attack was "nothing new," recalling terrorist attacks in Lviv in 2014–2015 suspected to be connected to Russia.
"Give long-range weapons to Ukraine so that we can finish this war," he said.

NYC nursing walkout ends as last striking nurses approve new contract
Thousands of nurses at a major New York hospital system have approved a new contract, voting to end a strike after more than a month
- Bookmark
Nurses at a big New York hospital system approved a new contract Saturday, voting to end a major nursing strike after more than a month.
More than 4,000 nurses in the privately run NewYork-Presbyterian system went on strike Jan. 12. They are now due to start returning to work in the coming week. The union, called the New York State Nurses Association, said 93% of its members at NewYork-Presbyterian voted to ratify the three-year contract.
Two other big private hospital systems, Montefiore and Mount Sinai, ended their nurses’ walkout earlier this month by inking contract agreements with the same union.
“We are so happy with the wins we achieved, and now the fight to enforce these contracts and hold our employers accountable begins,” union President Nancy Hagans said in a statement Saturday.
NewYork-Presbyterian said that it looked forward to its nurses' return and that the contract "reflects our respect for our nurses and the critical role they play as part of our exceptional care teams.”
Both sides had said Friday that they had reached a tentative deal. Union members voted on it Friday and Saturday.
Provisions included staffing improvements, raises topping 12% over three years and safeguards on the use of artificial intelligence, according to the union.
The union has said the strike initially involved about 15,000 nurses overall at Montefiore, Mount Sinai and NewYork-Presbyterian. It affected only some facilities within the three systems and didn't involve any city-run hospitals.
During the strike, Montefiore, Mount Sinai and NewYork-Presbyterian brought on thousands of temporary nurses, transferred some patients and canceled some procedures. The hospitals insisted they were smoothly delivering care, including complex surgeries. But some vulnerable patients and their families said some routine tasks took longer.
The strikers complained of unmanageable workloads and accused the hospitals of trying to chip away at health benefits. The hospitals contested those claims and said the union’s demands were exorbitant.
Nurses at some Mount Sinai and Montefiore hospitals also walked out in 2023. That strike ended in three days.

Minister reveals process has started to ban Hizb ut-Tahrir under new hate laws
In short:
Home Affairs Minister Tony Burke says ASIO has determined the Islamist group Hizb ut-Tahrir meets the threshold to be banned under new hate group laws.
This is the first of two steps to ban the group under the laws passed last month.
Mr Burke also gave an update on the 34 Australians in Syria, saying the one woman he had temporarily blocked from entering the country was "very different" to the others.
The first step towards banning the Islamist group Hizb ut-Tahrir under new hate laws is complete, Home Affairs Minister Tony Burke has revealed.
The minister has also defended the government's handling of the group of Australians with links to Islamic State, saying it had been guided by the advice of ASIO.
Mr Burke told the ABC's Insiders he had been advised by ASIO that Hizb ut-Tahrir met the threshold to be listed under the new legal regime, which was established after the Bondi attack to capture those deemed to spread hate but not captured by existing laws.
Hizb ut-Tahrir was one of two groups the government had named as its main targets. The other, neo-Nazi group the National Socialist Network, disbanded in January.
Mr Burke said the next stage was a departmental briefing to satisfy him that the group increased the risk of hate-motivated violence, after which the opposition leader would be briefed and the attorney-general could sign off on a ban.
"The ASIO advice is now in. This is the first time we have been able to ban, potentially, a group which falls short of a terrorist listing," he said.
"It says you don't have to be specifically calling for, but you do have to be acting in a way that increases the risk of communal violence or politically-motivated violence."
The laws were passed in January with the support of the Liberal Party, but were opposed by the Nationals and the Greens who argued the scope was too broad.
Jonathon Duniam, the Coalition's home affairs spokesperson, welcomed the news, describing Hizb ut-Tahrir as a "hideous and insidious organisation".
"We've talked about it long enough … We are pleased this is happening, this is what we wanted to see with the laws," he said.
One member of Syria cohort a higher risk than others, Burke says
Mr Burke also responded to criticism from the Coalition that the government should be doing more to prevent a cohort of Australian citizens from leaving a refugee camp in Syria and returning to Australia.
The group of 34 women and children with links to former Islamic State fighters made a first, unsuccessful, attempt to leave Syria last week. A group of Australians has travelled to assist them and has Australian passports for them.
On Monday, Mr Burke issued one of the women with a temporary exclusion order, an effective blocker on an Australian return which he has the power to impose when an individual is deemed to pose a security threat.
But the opposition has questioned whether further exclusion orders should apply, and whether the government should have used its powers under the Passport Act to deny passport applications on security grounds.
"It's very clear… that the government can refuse a passport to an Australian citizen if they receive advice from a competent authority like ASIO or the AFP [Australian Federal Police] that that person is a threat to security," shadow defence spokesperson James Paterson told Sky News.
Mr Burke said none of the other 33 members of the group had been assessed by ASIO as meeting the bar for a temporary exclusion order.
"The cohort is not consistent," he said. "There are very different people in that cohort with different histories, and different states of mind if I put it in those terms.
"They are quite different, but our agencies have been following them for a long time. The fact that one person has been pulled out… for a temporary exclusion order is because, quite specifically, of what we know about that individual."
Mr Burke said the last time Australian officials had been on the ground in Syria and able to interview members of the cohort was in 2022, but that agencies "never stopped collecting information on people" and he would be guided by their advice.
While the minister does have powers to impose a temporary exclusion order without advice from ASIO, Mr Burke noted his decisions were subject to independent review and would be "thrown out" if he did not have sufficient grounds.
He added that the threshold for blocking a passport was higher than the threshold for imposing a temporary exclusion order and suggested none of the 34 met the bar, but did not elaborate on the difference.
Mr Burke denied a report in The Australian suggesting the government had written to Kurdish authorities overseeing the al-Roj camp, where the group remain, describing them as "terrorists", suggesting this was a misunderstanding due to "language issues".
He also denied a report in the Daily Telegraph that the federal government had held meetings with state governments to discuss repatriating the group.
Mr Burke said federal and state authorities had met to discuss security arrangements when it became apparent the group might return, but that the government was not assisting with repatriation.
Senator Duniam said the government was "not doing enough" and that the opposition was willing to work with the government to pass new laws to stop the return of the cohort.
"They are coming and this government is letting it happen … The best outcome here would be for these people not to come back to Australia," he said.
Senator Duniam said Mr Burke should "not hide behind advice" if his view was that the other members of the cohort were not a security threat.
"If he's so confident … he should say so," he said.

Kuwait summons Iraqi diplomat over Baghdad’s filing of maritime coordinates with UN

Kuwait has summoned Iraq’s chargé d’affaires to protest Baghdad’s submission to the UN of maritime coordinates and a map, saying the submission “infringes on Kuwaiti sovereignty” over established maritime areas.
The Kuwaiti Foreign Ministry said on Saturday that Iraq “had deposited a list of coordinates and a map with the UN that included claims regarding Iraqi maritime domains.”
It said the coordinates and map affect its sovereignty over maritime areas and fixed water elevations, including Fasht Al-Qaid and Fasht Al-Aij, which it described as not subject to any dispute regarding Kuwait’s full sovereignty.
The ministry said Acting Deputy Foreign Minister Aziz Rahim Al-Daihani summoned Zaid Abbas Shanshal “to deliver a formal protest note over Iraqi claims affecting Kuwait’s maritime sovereignty and related water elevations.”
Kuwait urged Iraq to take into account the historical ties between the two countries and to act responsibly in accordance with international law, including the 1982 UN Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) and bilateral understandings and agreements.
The UNCLOS entered into force in 1994 and establishes a comprehensive legal framework governing the world’s oceans, setting rules for the allocation of states’ rights and jurisdiction in maritime zones, the peaceful use of seas and oceans, and the management of marine resources.
Earlier Saturday, Iraq’s Foreign Ministry said it had deposited updated lists of coordinates for Iraq’s territorial sea baselines and maritime zones with the UN secretary-general on January 19 and February 9, in accordance with UNCLOS provisions.
It said the submission includes the determination of straight baselines and baselines drawn along the low-water line for measuring the breadth of the territorial sea, as well as the delimitation of the territorial sea, the contiguous zone, the exclusive economic zone and the continental shelf of Iraq, in accordance with the internationally recognised World Geodetic System 1984 (WGS-84).
Baghdad said the deposit replaces previous submissions dated December 7, 2021, and April 15, 2011, and aims “to update Iraq’s maritime data in line with the provisions of international law and enhance the legal clarity of the boundaries of maritime zones subject to Iraq’s sovereignty and sovereign rights.”
Iraq also said the coordinates and chart have been published on the website of the UN Division for Ocean Affairs and the Law of the Sea and reiterated its commitment to international law and regional stability.

All nine bodies of skiers killed in California avalanche recovered

Officials announced on Saturday that the bodies of all nine missing skiers who were killed in a devastating avalanche in California had been recovered, following days of search efforts.
The avalanche happened in the Sierra Nevada mountains in northern California near Lake Tahoe, a popular skiing and winter sport destination. No more people are left missing after Tuesday’s deadly avalanche.
“While we wish we could have saved them all, we are grateful that we can bring them home,” said Nevada county sheriff Shannan Moon during a news conference on Saturday afternoon.
Moon praised the collective efforts of the numerous agencies that helped recover the bodies – from the California Highway Patrol to the National Guard to the Pacific Gas and Electric utility company – and 42 volunteers who helped on the last day of the operation.
“We are fortunate in this mountain community that we are very tight-knit, and our community shows up in times of tragedy,” Moon said.
The sheriff named for the first time the three guides from Blackbird Mountain Company who died: Andrew Alissandratos, 34, Nicole Choo, 42, and Michael Henry, 30.
Saturday’s recovery of the bodies marked the end of a five-day effort to locate nine missing skiers after one of the deadliest avalanches in recent history.
On Saturday morning, officials and agencies were able to finish the rescue operations with the assistance of a Black Hawk helicopter in the snowy region. Earlier in the week, six survivors were rescued, with eight others discovered dead and one declared missing and presumed dead. Four of the bodies were recovered on Friday evening and the last five were recovered on Saturday morning.
Among those dead were six women and three professional guides. More than 40 rescuers from various local and federal agencies took part in the effort on Saturday, including the Nevada county sheriff’s office and the California highway patrol, along with the Pacific Gas & Electric Company. Difficult weather and snowy conditions prevented the crews from rescuing the bodies earlier this week.
The avalanche has been the deadliest since 1981, with experts estimating the slide path was roughly the size of a football field, the AP reported.
In calls to dispatchers on Tuesday, it was reported that multiple skiers were reportedly buried by the avalanche. Later that night, rescuers and teams made contact with the six survivors and discovered others who had died. The teams were unable to recover the bodies due to brutal snowy conditions. The snow lab near Donner Pass had recorded 28in of snow that day with more expected and more avalanche risk warnings.
“I want to recognize the strength in the volunteers of all the search-and-rescue units that our agencies truly rely on,” Moon said. “They are pretty amazing people, and it’s an honor to work with them.”
The skiers had come from different parts of the US to enjoy a guided skiing tour last weekend. Their families said they were a close-knit group of friends who were experienced backcountry skiers and knew how to navigate the Sierra Nevada wilderness. The group had skied out to cabins near Frog Lake, where they stayed for two nights before starting on their return trip when the avalanche hit.
They were identified as Carrie Atkin, Liz Clabaugh, Danielle Keatley, Kate Morse, Caroline Sekar and Kate Vitt, all in their 40s. They lived in the San Francisco Bay Area, Idaho and the Lake Tahoe area.
“We are devastated beyond words,” the families said in a statement. “Our focus right now is supporting our children through this incredible tragedy and honoring the lives of these extraordinary women. They were all mothers, wives and friends, all of whom connected through the love of the outdoors.”
The terrain will be off-limits to visitors until mid-March, said Chris Feutrier, forest supervisor for the Tahoe national forest. Officials intended to restore public access once the investigation is complete.
“We are investigating the incident to determine if there were any factors that would be considered criminal negligence,” said a spokesperson for the sheriff’s office. “It is too early to know if criminal charges will be applicable, as the investigation is preliminary and remains active and ongoing. The district attorney’s office would ultimately be the determining authority for any criminal charges to be filed.”

Ukraine accuses Hungary, Slovakia of ‘blackmail’ over threats to cut electricity
Sign up now: Get ST's newsletters delivered to your inbox
KYIV - Ukraine’s Foreign Ministry condemned what it described as “ultimatums and blackmail” by the governments of Hungary and Slovakia on Feb 21, after they threatened to stop electricity supplies to Ukraine unless Kyiv restarts flows of Russian oil.
Shipments of Russian oil to Hungary and Slovakia have been cut off since Jan 27, when Kyiv says a Russian drone strike hit pipeline equipment
Slovakia and Hungary say Ukraine is to blame for the prolonged outage.
Slovakia’s Prime Minister Robert Fico said on Feb 21 that he would cut off emergency electricity supplies to Ukraine within two days unless Kyiv resumes Russian oil transit to Slovakia over Ukraine’s territory.
Hungary’s Viktor Orban made a similar threat days earlier.
The issue has become one of the angriest disputes yet between Ukraine and two neighbours that are members of the EU and NATO but whose leaders have bucked the largely pro-Ukrainian consensus in Europe to cultivate warm ties with Moscow.
Slovakia and Hungary are the only two EU countries that still rely on significant amounts of Russian oil shipped via the Soviet-era Druzhba pipeline over Ukraine.
“Ukraine rejects and condemns the ultimatums and blackmail by the governments of Hungary and the Slovak Republic regarding energy supplies between our countries,” the Ukrainian Foreign Ministry said in a statement.
“Ultimatums should be sent to the Kremlin, and certainly not to Kyiv.”
Between them, Hungary and Slovakia have been providing around half of European emergency electricity exports to Ukraine, which Kyiv increasingly relies on as Russian attacks have damaged its grid.
“If oil supplies to Slovakia are not resumed on Monday, I will ask SEPS, the state-owned joint-stock company, to stop emergency electricity supplies to Ukraine,” Mr Fico said in a post on X.
Kyiv said that such actions were “provocative, irresponsible, and threaten the energy security of the entire region.”
Throughout the war that began with the full-scale Russian invasion whose fourth anniversary falls on Feb 24, Ukraine has allowed its territory to be used for Russian energy exports to Europe, which have been sharply curtailed but not halted.
Ukraine has proposed alternative transit routes to ship oil to Europe while emergency pipeline repair works are under way.
In a letter seen by Reuters, the Ukrainian mission to the EU proposed shipments through Ukraine’s oil transportation system or a maritime route, potentially including the Odesa-Brody pipeline linking Ukraine’s main Black Sea port to the EU.
Since October 2025, Russia has intensified its drone and missile attacks on the Ukrainian energy system, knocking out electricity and heat and plunging millions of Ukrainians into long blackouts during bitterly cold winter temperatures. REUTERS

The U.S.’s Olympic Legacy in Figure Skating Will Be More Profound Than Medals
Unknown

In the end, Ilia Malinin chose to rely on the medium he knows best to express his deepest thoughts. And despite his struggles at the 2026 Milano Cortina Olympics, his skate at the Feb. 21 exhibition gala helped him to address those challenges and speak directly with the audience who had supported him along the way.
Malinin had been the heavy favorite to win gold at his first Olympics Games. During the men’s figure skating free program, he set out to make Olympic history by planning to land seven quadruple jumps in a single program—a technical feat that would have underscored his dominance in the skating world and landed him on top of the podium. He popped the first one he intended, the quad axel, which only he has landed in competition, but wasn’t able to muster enough of his remaining skills to stay ahead of his competitors. The self-styled “Quad God,” thought to be one of the sure things in the always unpredictable Olympics, finished eighth overall.
How Malinin skated that program, it turns out, was a message to the world—one that grappled with the weight of expectations that Malinin was dealing with. He hadn’t spoken publicly about the pressure he has been feeling, he says, throughout this Olympic season. Touted as the next Olympic champion, Malinin experienced extraordinary demands on his time and mental energy that eroded his confidence and led to his first loss in nearly two years.
More than a week later, skating in the Olympic exhibition gala, Malinin again chose to speak on the ice, with a program he has been working on for a few months with a friend who cut the music, called Fear, from one of his favorite artists, NF. The program is a sober representation of the loss of control Malinin says he’s been feeling as the hype and expectation around his Olympic debut built. He teased the routine following his free program, posting on his account a clip that depicts an overwhelming cascade of pinging social media alerts. He opened the program with the sounds of that flood of messages, and mimed scrolling through them before putting his hands to his head and flipping the hood of his grey sweatshirt, stamped with the word ‘Fear,’ over his head.
“I really just wanted to share an extension of my thoughts and something that I’ve been feeling for this whole Olympic season,” he says. “There’s been so much pressure, so much doubt, and everything around me, the noise, the media, the people, the environment—it’s been so overwhelming.”
The lyrics are especially poignant for Malinin: “Like a puppet, with strings, I just don’t have the choice. What’s the truth? What’s a lie? … “On the verge, on the edge, Is this what you wanted? Petrified, scared to death, Is this what you wanted?...Breakin’ down, spiralin’, Is this what you wanted? What you wanted? Is this what you wanted?”
The program was an emotional appeal to the public to see him as “a human being,” he said. “We also have real thoughts, real feelings, even though it looks like we’re completely like robots and [have] superhuman abilities. But in the end, deep inside, we’re still similar [to] all of you.”
Malinin, of course, isn’t the first to address the nearly impossible expectations that people put on celebrities or elite athletes, in particular Olympians. Gymnast Simone Biles has used similar words in describing the dangers of forgetting that athletes are people too—individuals who experience the same pressure, anxieties, and pain from hurtful remarks and uninformed criticism as anyone else.
But perhaps more than any previous Olympics, these Games, and this U.S. figure skating team in particular, have taken up the mantle of mental health, making it a priority, rather than an afterthought. The U.S. women’s squad of Alysa Liu, Amber Glenn, and Isabeau Levito has been making headlines for its uniquely close relationship, and questioning why they can’t successfully balance friendship and competition. When asked after making the Olympic team about the novelty of the strong bond between them, Liu seemed baffled, apparently not understanding why it was considered so unusual for them to be so close and supportive of one another.
But in skating—and among women in particular, such camaraderie hasn’t been the norm. Young girls are taught from early in their careers to hide their feelings, smile no matter what they’re experiencing inside, and never allow their rivals to see their weaknesses. The rigidity of that system is one of the reasons Liu quit the sport at 16, before deciding to return, on her own terms, two years later.
When Glenn missed a jump combination in the short program that put her in 13th place going into the final, it was Liu who was among the first to give her a hug and comfort her. She helped Glenn put the mistake behind her and skate a strong free program to pull up to fifth. And that supportive instinct extends beyond just her teammates. When Japan’s Kaori Sakamoto missed a jump in the free program and realized she would miss earning gold, her emotions overtook her and couldn’t stop the tears. Glenn stepped in to hug her and shield her from prying cameras that had zoomed in on the distraught Sakamoto.
To Glenn, Liu, and Levito, such expressions take precedence over medals or standings. “I’m thankful for the amount of success that we’ve had with that, because it’s not made us less competitive, it’s not led to any falters on the ice,” Glenn said. “That’s one of the most beautiful things about sport, it’s not just what we do out there when we perform, but the journey and the people who surround us during it. I think that is something that will improve so many athletes’ lives, and that’s what I’ve wanted to do.”
One of them will be Malinin, who will leave Milan “learning to get back up and keep going,” he says. “It’s still just figure skating. And sometimes the medals don’t mean as much as who you are as a person and what you truly bring to the world around you.”

‘We are not’: Burke rejects claims government repatriating IS brides

Coalition wants to make criminals of anyone helping ISIS brides return to Australia
Updated ,first published
The Coalition will challenge Prime Minister Anthony Albanese to take further steps that stop the return of so-called Islamic State brides to Australia, seeking the introduction of laws that criminalise the actions of NGOs or advocates who help people linked to terrorism come back into the country.
New Liberal leader Angus Taylor sought to turn up the pressure on Labor after Home Affairs Minister Tony Burke insisted on Sunday that the government was not assisting the 34 Australian women and children linked to Islamic State who are trying to return, aside from what was legally required.
The proposed laws signal Taylor’s first move to “shut the door to people who do not share our values” – the pledge he made when he seized the Liberal leadership this month as polls indicated Coalition voters were switching to One Nation.
Burke and Albanese have taken a hard line on the women and children who have been trying to leave the deteriorating al-Roj camp in north-east Syria, but point to legal requirements and bureaucratic processes to explain why the group has received Australian passports.
“We do not want the individuals in Australia,” Burke said on the ABC’s Insiders program. “Legally, you can’t stop a citizen from entering your country. Legally, if a citizen applies for a passport and the authorities don’t think thresholds are reached to be able to block it, then a passport gets issued.”
The Coalition is also pressuring the government to use temporary exclusion orders to deny the group re-entry. The orders are designed to protect Australians from national security risks.
One of the women will be prohibited under such an order from entering the country because she was deemed by intelligence agencies to pose a higher risk than the rest of the group, Burke said on Sunday, but none of the other 33 group members had met the threshold for an exclusion order.
Asked if that meant they did not pose a threat, he said: “That’s right ... If at any point the agencies decide that a further brief should come to me, I would deal with that immediately.”
Burke said agencies had been following the women and children for a long time, and each had different histories and states of mind.
“One of my concerns with how the opposition have handled this, is they’ve effectively said the minister should be able to make it up... as though somehow in a national security portfolio you should ignore your national security intelligence and law enforcement agencies.”
Still, he said: “We do not want them to come back.”
When asked if he was acting to stop their arrival, Burke said the government was making sure it was doing “nothing to help them at all”.
“Other than a temporary exclusion order, there isn’t a legislative power to be able to stop an Australian citizen from entering Australia,” he said. “So, effectively, that question goes to are we breaking the law, and the answer’s no.”
Coalition home affairs spokesman Jonno Duniam said the opposition was willing to work with the government to write new laws as needed to prevent the group’s arrival.
“These are people we don’t think should be back in this country and that pose a risk to our country. Now, if the government are serious, and the minister himself said it again today, ‘We don’t want them back here’, do something about it,” he said.
The bill floated by the Coalition on Sunday would make it a criminal offence to facilitate the re-entry of people linked to terrorist hotspots or terrorist organisations, or who have committed terror-related offences.
This would target the non-government organisations and advocates who have been trying to help the women and children leave Syria as their situation there worsens, such as the charity Save the Children and Dr Jamal Rifi, a man close to Burke and the families who has been in Damascus trying to organise the ill-fated family repatriation.
“We will take action and refuse to let people come here who abandoned Australia to support Islamic extremist terror overseas,” Taylor said in a statement on Sunday. “Anthony Albanese should come to the table and support these laws.”
Burke rebuffed reports in a News Corp article that claimed high-level briefings had been ongoing for months between NSW, Victoria and federal agencies to repatriate the Syria group.
“In that [News Corp] report, it makes a claim that we are conducting repatriation. We are not. It claims we have been meeting with the states for the purposes of a repatriation. We have not,” Burke said.
“Our authorities meet with the state authorities to make sure that we are prepared if there is any chance of there being a heightened risk to national security.
“As soon as the conditions of the camp started to deteriorate, and there was a possibility some people would be getting out, which has happened … the national security teams, the joint counterterrorism teams, meet, as they did under the previous government, as they do now, as is essential for public safety.”
A NSW Premier’s Department spokesperson confirmed state agencies were working with the federal government on law enforcement and security arrangements for the group’s potential return.
“NSW has well-established arrangements in place to manage any returnees, with community safety as the overriding priority. These arrangements were successfully implemented in 2019 and 2022 [when other cohorts returned to Australia].”
Former Home Affairs Department head Mike Pezzullo told a parliamentary inquiry in 2022 that the states and the federal government worked collaboratively on these issues.
“If a state government chose to say, ‘We don’t want to proceed’, then I would have thought the Commonwealth would take that pretty seriously, because we have to rely on them for schooling, trauma support, counselling, public health support and the like,” he said. “So it’s done consensually. All that information is put to them, and then they’ll give us the authority to proceed or otherwise.”

Maccabi Tel Aviv fan ban may have been politically influenced, say MPs
New report on the row also criticises Keir Starmer for heightening tensions

Local political pressure may have influenced the decision to prohibit Maccabi Tel Aviv football fans from attending a match against Aston Villa, a parliamentary committee has concluded.
The Home Affairs Committee said that Birmingham councillors had a “disproportionate opportunity to exert influence”, which undermined confidence that the decision was based on evidence and safety.
Supporters were barred from the 6 November game at Villa Park by the local safety advisory group (SAG), citing safety concerns based on advice from West Midlands Police (WMP).
A subsequent review revealed an "AI hallucination" generated by Microsoft Copilot had helped police to justify the ban.
Copilot erroneously referenced a non-existent match between Tel Aviv and West Ham.
Chief Constable Craig Guildford has since resigned from his position amid significant pressure following the controversy.
In a new report on the row, the Home Affairs Committee said it could not rule out that political pressure had played a part in the decision.
The report said WMP’s concerns about disorder “combined with local political pressure and community tensions related to the international situation” led to the move.
The report continued: “While we cannot conclude that the Safety Advisory Group’s decision was made because of political pressure, on the basis of the evidence we have seen we also cannot conclude with any confidence that the decision was not politically influenced.
“It is clear that on this occasion councillors, with a stated political aim, had a disproportionate opportunity to influence Safety Advisory Group decision-making on a deeply divisive political issue.
“While the presence of elected politicians on Safety Advisory Groups has potential benefits in terms of local representation, it also risks decision-making becoming politically motivated, undermining trust in the process.”
The Cabinet Office should ban local councillors from sitting on SAGs, the group of MPs said.
Chair of the Home Affairs Committee Dame Karen Bradley said: “It is an extraordinary measure to decide to ban fans from attending a fixture, particularly in the cultural and political climate that this occurred in.
“It is vital that trust is rebuilt. West Midlands Police must repair the damage that has been done by working hard to reach out to local communities, particularly Jewish communities.
“They must also ensure that there is a cultural shift around decision making where assumptions are tested and evidence fully checked.”
Elsewhere, the committee criticised ministers, including the prime minister and home secretary, for heightening tensions by criticising the move too late.
By intervening after the decision to ban away fans had already been publicly announced, the Government escalated the situation and was “ineffectual” in enabling the Israeli fans to attend, it said.
The Home Office and the Department for Culture, Media and Sport were told on 8 October 2025 that Maccabi fans were likely to be barred – a week before the decision was announced.
The Israeli team’s fans could still have been able to come “if the Government had intervened privately at this point”, the committee concluded.
On the day the decision was made public, Sir Keir Starmer posted on X calling it “the wrong decision” and saying the Government “will not tolerate antisemitism on our streets”.
The same day, Shabana Mahmood posted on X that the Government “is doing everything in our power to ensure all fans can safely attend the game”.
The public interventions increased the profile of the subsequent fixture, “which in turn increased risk”, the report concluded.

Malaysia’s vape ban plan leaves 1.4 million users in regulatory limbo
An estimated 1.4 million Malaysian adults vape, despite existing curbs. Many say new laws will simply push them back to cigarettes
The vapes used to be obvious. Bright displays of flavoured liquid, a shop just down the road, a transaction as unremarkable as buying shampoo. Batrisyia, 28, remembers how easy it was.
Those days are gone. Or rather, in Malaysia at least, the trade has moved under the table.
“It’s definitely less open now,” said Batrisyia, a Johor native who asked to be identified by a pseudonym for fear of backlash. “You don’t see big vape displays like before, and we can’t buy online any more. But it hasn’t disappeared. Some shops sell quietly behind the counter or in the back.”
She paused, holding a slim, pen-like device in her hand. “You just have to ask for it.”
The device is almost elegant in its simplicity: swap out the small pod cartridge, pick a flavour, inhale the vapour. It leaves no lingering smell on clothes or hands, none of cigarettes’ telltale signs. For Batrisyia, discretion was always part of the appeal.
In her small town of Pontian, at the southern tip of Peninsular Malaysia, that discretion has taken on a new dimension.

British submarine arrives for ‘extraordinary’ AUKUS visit

British submarine arrives for ‘extraordinary’ AUKUS visit
A British nuclear-powered submarine has arrived in Australia for an unprecedented month-long visit despite the well-chronicled problems plaguing the British navy’s ability to send its vessels to sea.
The British and Australian governments are holding up the visit as a sign of the countries’ commitment to the AUKUS pact, even as the United Kingdom views Russia as its most pressing security threat.
HMS Anson, an Astute-class nuclear-powered submarine, arrived on Sunday at the HMAS Stirling naval base in Perth for a month-long maintenance visit.
Defence Minister Richard Marles and Defence Industry Minister Pat Conroy described the first such visit by a UK nuclear‑powered submarine in Australia as a “historic step in our nation’s readiness to operate and maintain conventionally armed, nuclear‑powered submarines”.
HMS Anson, which was commissioned in 2022, is reportedly the only available submarine in the British navy’s fleet of five Astute-class boats, highlighting the significance of the extended deployment to Australia.
British defence publication Navy Lookout has written that the “timing of the deployment seems extraordinary” as the British navy does not have any other Astute-class submarines available.
“The UK must continue to play its part in AUKUS, but in the short term, perhaps more local concerns should be the priority,” the publication argued this month.
“Placing the sole attack submarine on the other side of the globe appears to be at odds with vigorous official warnings to Russia that ‘any threat will be met with strength and resolve’.”
Navy Lookout said the British navy’s other four Astute-class submarines were “all at low or very low readiness”.
Conroy described the visit as “an important milestone that will build confidence in our strategic partners that we have the workforce able to deliver AUKUS submarines, and also lays ground for more jobs for locals”.
Two Australian navy officers have been embedded on the submarine to gain a better understanding of how nuclear-powered submarines operate.
The Australian navy will also conduct tests of its Speartooth large underwater drone to see how it operates with the British submarine at sea.
Britain’s deputy high commissioner to Australia, Brian Jones, said the visit “sends a simple message of our water-tight commitment to AUKUS”.
“Our security as the UK is global, and we are committed to contributing to the security and stability wherever that might be,” he said.
“Our shared prosperity with Australia depends on that security ... Deploying one of our most capable defence assets into this region reflects our commitment to work with our close partners to uphold peace, security and stability.”
According to the British navy, the Astute-class submarines “are the largest, most advanced and most powerful attack submarines ever operated by the Royal Navy, combining world-leading sensors, design and weaponry in a versatile vessel”.
While nuclear-powered, these submarines do not carry nuclear weapons.
American nuclear-powered submarines made similar maintenance visits to Australia in 2024 and 2025, following the announcement of the AUKUS delivery plan in 2023.
The plan involves the US selling Australia at least three Virginia-class submarines while the UK and Australia partner on the development of a new class of submarine known as the SSN-AUKUS.
US senator Tim Kaine told this masthead last week he believed there was a “100 per cent chance” the US would provide the submarines to Australia as promised despite sluggish production rates at American shipyards.
Retired rear admiral Philip Mathias, a former director of nuclear policy with the UK Ministry of Defence, told this masthead last month he feared Australians were not adequately informed about how the troubles plaguing the British navy could scuttle the SSN-AUKUS plan.
“Whilst the United States may sell some [nuclear-powered submarines] to Australia, there is a high probability that the UK element of AUKUS will fail,” he said.
Mathias, who led a 2010 review of the UK Trident nuclear-weapons system, said: “It is clear that Australia has shown a great deal of naivety and did not conduct sufficient due diligence on the parlous state of the UK’s nuclear submarine program before signing up to AUKUS – and parting with billions of dollars, which it has already started to do.”
The head of the British navy, First Sea Lord Gwyn Jenkins, ordered an urgent 100-day drive to tackle systemic delays in the UK submarine program in October.
UK publication Defence Eye reported that the British navy “has struggled to put more than one of its five Astute boats to sea at a time” and that “for a number of months over the past two years, no Astute boats have been at sea”.

Australian dual citizens scramble as UK border crackdown set to begin

UK passport changes leave Australians with dual citizenship scrambling before border rules kick in
In short:
Australians with British or Irish dual citizenship may be denied travel to the UK from February 25 unless they carry a valid British or Irish passport, or certificate of entitlement.
The rules were formally announced by the UK Home Office last year but many say they only became aware of the change via news reports in recent weeks.
What's next?
Travel industry leaders are calling on the UK government to delay the rollout, warning Australians could miss long-planned trips.
There are calls for the British government to delay tough new border rules set to take effect in days.
From Wednesday, dual citizens of the UK and Ireland will have to follow new passport regulations when entering the UK.
Travellers with dual citizenship will need to present a British or Irish passport, or a certificate of entitlement at border control checkpoints and airlines will enforce the new rules prior to departure.
The Australian government's Smartraveller advice is that these requirements will be strictly enforced, and Australians with dual citizenship may not be able to board flights to the UK unless they carry the right travel documents.
The rules also apply from non-Australian departure points, including by international rail, coach or ferry, with carriers required to check that passengers hold valid UK entry permission before boarding under the new UK Home Office "no permission, no travel" system.
Loading...The rules were formally announced by the UK Home Office last year but many say they only became aware of the change via news reports in recent weeks.
For many, the changes prompted a frantic search for documents needed to begin passport applications throwing long-planned trips into doubt, with critics slamming the government for poor communication.
Adding to frustrations, British passports and Certificates of Entitlement (COE) can take between three and six weeks to process.
Australian Travel Industry Association (ATIA) CEO Dean Long said the changes were "unethical" and he'd written to the UK Home Office urging them to extend the February 25 deadline.
"It is causing chaos … it's an ill-thought-through strategy that has unfortunately created massive disruption for thousands of people,"Mr Long said.
The British government said the new regulations were in line with other countries' border policies and would strengthen national security.
A holiday turned nightmare
For Laura Burke, from the New South Wales Central Coast, the rules have turned what should have been a joyful family trip into a logistical nightmare.
Laura, an Australian citizen born in England, booked non-refundable flights for a March trip to the UK with her husband and their two young children, including three-month-old Masie, for her step-father's 70th birthday.
What she thought would be routine — applying for an Electronic Travel Authorisation (ETA) using their Australian passports — quickly turned into a last-minute scramble.
"I was scrolling Facebook and saw a post about the new rules," Ms Burke said.
"At first, I thought we could just get ETAs. But then I realised Masie and our older daughter are considered British citizens by descent, even if they've never held British passports, so they have to have UK passports too."
She said efforts to reach the UK Passport Office and the British High Commission brought mixed responses and a lot of stress.
"I'd call one department and get told to call another," she said. "No-one would give a straight answer."
The family rushed to apply for overseas documents including the birth certificate of Laura's father and her parents' marriage certificate. They're still waiting on British passports for their children.
"We still don't know if we'll get them in time," she said.
"It's incredibly stressful … you don't want to cry, but it just means a lot, seeing family, meeting babies for the first time."
Race against time
Stephen Davis said his experience was similar.
Having left the UK decades ago, the Sydney Blue Mountains resident assumed he could enter the country on his Australian passport as he always had.
It was only after reading an ABC article outlining the new rules that he realised his fast-approaching trip to celebrate his friend's 70th birthday was in doubt.
"The travel agents I spoke to didn't know, my British friends and family didn't know. It makes you wonder how many others will get caught out," he said.
He initially tried to get an Emergency Travel Document but his British passport, which expired in 2008, was considered too old, meaning he had no choice but to apply for a full passport renewal.
"It's been incredibly stressful,"he said.
"I'm relatively tech-savvy and persistent but I can't imagine how challenging it would be for someone who isn't," he said.
"The lack of communication has been the frustrating part, it's been incredibly difficult to get the information I needed, I've spoken to so many different people, webchats, it's just been a nightmare."
Industry warns of chaos
The ATIA has written to Australia's Foreign Minister Penny Wong about their concerns.
"We're seeing significant disruption, cancellations and financial loss because people did everything right when they booked but have been blindsided by this change," Mr Long said.
"Many people don't even realise they are considered UK citizens until they're confronted with these requirements.
"They need time to decide whether to renew their passports, apply for certificates, or renounce citizenship altogether."
Confusion and calls to delay
Across social media and travel forums, frustration is mounting.
Hundreds of Australians contacted the ABC saying they feel misled, unaware of their dual citizenship status, or confused by contradictory online information about travel eligibility.
Some are even considering renouncing their UK citizenship to avoid the passport process, though doing so is neither straightforward nor inexpensive — the renunciation process can take months, involves significant fees, and may not be approved by the UK government.
The parents of dual citizens also cannot renounce their children's British citizenship on their behalf — applicants must be over 18.
The British government said the changes were necessary as part of modernising border controls.
In a statement to ABC, the British High Commission said the updated rules reflect the UK's move to a more digitised immigration system and are designed to improve security and efficiency.
What travellers should know
Australians planning travel to the UK from February 25, 2026 should be aware:
- Dual British/Irish citizens must enter the UK on a valid British or Irish passport or have a Certificate of Entitlement.
- Dual citizens will be required to carry both their Australian passport for exiting and entering Australia, and their British passport, for entering the UK.
- Dual citizens cannot use an ETA or visa to enter the UK.
- Airlines and carriers will enforce the requirements at check-in, not just at border control.
- Processing times for passports and certificates can take weeks, so travellers should act now.
More information is available at the Australian Government's Smartraveller site.

Russian missile strikes Oreo factory in Ukraine, foreign minister says

Feb 21 - An Oreo cookie plant in eastern Ukraine was struck by a Russian missile on Saturday, Ukrainian Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha said in a post on X, the second time the factory has been damaged since the war began in 2022.
No one was killed, but a production building was damaged, Sybiha wrote. The facility, located in Trostyanets, is owned by snack giant Mondelez International.
The Chicago-based company, which also makes Ritz crackers, Toblerone chocolate and Trident gum, did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Saturday evening. The Kremlin did not immediately respond to a request for comment overnight on Saturday.
"When Russian missiles hit such sites, they are not only targeting Ukraine," Sybiha wrote. "They are targeting American business interests in Europe."
The same factory was badly damaged in 2022 during Russia's invasion of Ukraine. The plant partially reopened in 2023 to make chocolate and then resumed manufacturing Oreos in 2024.
Mondelez has faced criticism for continuing business operations in Russia during the war. REUTERS

Trump pulls endorsement of Colorado Republican Jeff Hurd over tariff votes
Sign up now: Get ST's newsletters delivered to your inbox
WASHINGTON – US President Donald Trump withdrew his endorsement of US representative Jeff Hurd for reelection after the Colorado Republican voted against the president’s tariffs.
“Congressman Hurd is one of a small number of Legislators who have let me and our Country down. He is more interested in protecting Foreign Countries that have been ripping us off for decades than he is the United States of America,” Mr Trump wrote in a Truth Social post Feb 21, saying that it was “a difficult decision” for him.
Mr Trump is instead endorsing Ms Hope Scheppelman, a critical care nurse and Navy veteran who previously served as vice-chair of the state Republican Party.
Ms Scheppelman “knows the America First Policies required, and will do everything necessary to Defend our Country, Support our Military/Veterans, and Ensure PEACE THROUGH STRENGTH,” Mr Trump wrote.
Mr Hurd, a first-term congressman sided with Democrats to pass legislation on Feb 12 aimed at ending the White House’s duties on Canada.
Republicans Brian Fitzpatrick of Pennsylvania, Thomas Massie of Kentucky, Don Bacon of Nebraska, Kevin Kiley of California and Dan Newhouse of Washington state also voted to end the Canadian tariffs.
“If we normalise broad emergency trade powers today, we should expect that a future president – of either party – will rely on the same authority in ways many of us would strongly oppose,” Mr Hurd wrote in a statement after his vote.
“My responsibility is to defend the separation of powers regardless of political convenience.”
Since the vote against tariffs, the Supreme Court has ruled that Mr Trump’s use of emergency powers to impose levies around the world was unconstitutional and required Congress’s approval. BLOOMBERG

Israeli modeling tycoon linked to Epstein Affair claims 'I did not know about criminal activity'

Jean-Luc Brunel, owner of the international modeling agency MC2, and Ofer Raphaeli, who owns the agency's Tel Aviv branch, allegedly helped Jeffrey Epstein recruit underage models, according to a Channel 12 report aired on Saturday night.
Channel 12 presented emails between Epstein and Brunel as evidence for these claims. In response, Raphaeli stated that he was consulting with a lawyer and was considering filing a defamation lawsuit against those involved in order to protect both his own reputation and the agency's standing in Israel.
Ofer Raphaeli, who founded the Israeli branch of MC2, gave an exclusive statement to Ma'ariv, saying: “I met Jeffrey Epstein only twice, by chance, for a few minutes. There was no friendship, business connection, or any other connection between us. The emails with New Year greetings and "Happy Holidays" were routinely sent to many recipients, including Epstein’s email address."
“I had a relationship with agent Jean-Luc Brunel," Raphaeli added. "I was unaware of any criminal activity by the agency in New York, and to the best of my knowledge, he was never convicted [of any crime]. The agencies in Miami and New York were closed several years ago. The agency in Israel has been under my ownership and management since its establishment in 2000, and I have never managed the New York branch except during my visit in 2004 for work purposes only."
Latest Epstein files release unleashes wave of antisemitic conspiracy theories on social media
Since the financial advisor and sex trafficker’s arrest by federal authorities in July 2019 and alleged death by suicide a month later, antisemitic conspiracy theories about him have circulated widely, often invoking his Jewish identity and connections with Jewish and Israeli leaders.
But the Justice Department’s newly released batch of Epstein files on February 6, which contained over 3 million pages of documents, took things to a new intensity.
“If you think Epstein was just some rich pedo, you’re missing the big picture,” wrote the X/Twitter account Clandestine, which has more than 734,000 followers. “Epstein was part of the satanic global elite that pulls the strings from the shadows. Epstein was a Deep State puppet master.”
Among the real revelations in the documents are a variety of exchanges of relevance to the broader Jewish world. Those include revelations that various Jewish nonprofits had courted Epstein for donations even after his conviction, evidence of Epstein’s financial ties with several Orthodox yeshivas, and new details about his well-known relationship with former prime minister Ehud Barak.
Some of the largest conspiracist personalities seized on the new document dump, claiming that it confirmed their longstanding beliefs about secret Jewish control.
“Remember the end of last year when I was called antisemitic for telling you this is the literal, religious worldview of many people in power?” Candace Owens, right-wing commentator turned conspiracist, wrote in a post on X responding to a photo of an email where Epstein used the term "goy." “Type in ‘goy’ or ‘goyim’ in the Epstein files and be sure to tag a Christian who needs to wake up and leave the Zionist cause.”

Islamic State begins new phase of operations against Syrian regime with two terror attacks

Islamic State claimed responsibility on Saturday for two attacks targeting Syrian army personnel in northern and eastern Syria, as the terrorist group signaled what it described as a new phase of operations against the country’s leadership.
The terrorist group said on its Dabiq news agency that it had targeted “an individual of the apostate Syrian regime” in the city of Mayadin in Deir al-Zor province using a pistol, and attacked two other personnel with machine guns in the northern city of Raqqa.
Syria’s Defence Ministry said in a statement that a Syrian army soldier and a civilian were killed on Saturday by “unknown assailants.” A military source told Reuters the soldier belonged to the army’s 42nd Division.
The attacks come amid a sharp escalation by IS against Syria’s leadership under President Ahmed al-Sharaa, a former al Qaeda leader who broke with the group in 2016 before leading a coalition of Islamist factions that overthrew President Bashar al-Assad at the end of 2024.
On Saturday evening, IS released a recorded statement by its spokesperson, Abu Hudhayfa al-Ansari, who said Syria had “moved from Iranian occupation to Turkish-American occupation.”
The group said it had begun a “new phase of operations” in Syria, describing Sharaa as a “watchdog” of the global coalition and vowing that his fate would be no different from that of Assad.
Sharaa signed Syria’s accession to the global coalition to defeat IS during a visit to the US last November, when he met President Donald Trump.
Islamic State intensifying attacks on Syrian regime
The latest incidents come two days after IS claimed responsibility for another attack in Deir al-Zor that killed a member of the Interior Ministry’s internal security forces and wounded another.
Several social media accounts and Telegram channels supporting IS have in recent hours called for intensified attacks using motorcycles and firearms.
IS has carried out six attacks against Syrian government targets since the fall of Assad.
A report by the UN Office of Counter-Terrorism released last week said Sharaa and two senior cabinet ministers had been targeted in five foiled assassination attempts by IS.

WASHINGTON – The Supreme Court may have ruled 6-3 against US President Donald Trump’s use of an international emergency law to impose tariffs. But Mr Trump seems intent on continuing the experiment he has run with the US economy over the past year, in which he has raised tariffs to levels not seen since the 1930s.
In a news conference at the White House on Feb 20, Mr Trump made a series of false claims about the economic impact of tariffs, and he promised to replace, or even increase, them using laws other than the one the court rejected.

Berlin film festival: Ilker Çatak's 'Yellow Letters' wins the Golden Bear award

Yellow Letters, directed by German filmmaker Ilker Çatak, won the Golden Bear for best film at the Berlin Film Festival on Saturday, February 21, in a ceremony reflecting the controversy over Gaza that has dogged this year's edition of the event. A political drama, Çatak's film tells the story of a Turkish director and his actor wife, suddenly barred from working because of their political opinions.
Jury president Wim Wenders called the film "a terrifying premonition, a look into the near future that could possibly happen in our countries as well."
"This is a movie that speaks up very clearly about the political language of totalitarianism as opposed to the empathetic language of cinema," Wenders said.
Çatak called Wenders "one of my teachers," adding: "It's such an incredible thing to receive this award from you."
The runner-up Silver Bear Grand Jury Prize went to Salvation by Emin Alper, who in his speech mentioned his solidarity with several high-profile opposition figures in prison in Turkey, including jailed Istanbul mayor Ekrem Imamoglu. Alper also took the opportunity to speak up for "the people of Iran suffering under tyranny" and "the Palestinians in Gaza living and dying under the most terrible conditions."
'Part of democracy'
Speaking at a press conference at the beginning of the festival last week, Wenders answered a question about the German government's support for Israel by saying: "We cannot really enter the field of politics." At the same press conference, he had said that films had the power to "change the world" but in a different way from politics. His comments in response to the question on Israel prompted a storm of outrage.
Award-winning Indian novelist Arundhati Roy, who had been due to present a restored version of a 1989 film she wrote, pulled out of the event, branding Wenders' words "unconscionable" and "jaw-dropping."
On Tuesday, an open letter signed by dozens of film industry figures, including actors Javier Bardem and Tilda Swinton and director Adam McKay, condemned the Berlin festival's "silence on the genocide of Palestinians" and accused it of being involved in "censoring" artists who oppose Israel's actions.
Director Tricia Tuttle, in her second year at the helm of the Berlinale, has firmly rejected the accusations. In a speech at the beginning of Saturday's ceremony, she said that "speaking up is part of democracy."
"We respect people speaking out because it takes a lot of courage to do it," she said, adding: "We don't always agree with every claim that's made about us."
'Queen at Sea'
Other big award winners included German actress Sandra Hüller, who received the Silver Bear for Best Performance for her title role in Markus Schleinzer's Rose. The black-and-white drama tells the story of a woman passing herself off as a man in rural 17th-century Germany to escape the constraints of patriarchy.
Queen at Sea, by American director Lance Hammer, which stars Juliette Binoche as a woman caring for her mother with dementia, picked up two awards. The film sensitively portrays the devastation Alzheimer's disease inflicts on a patient's loved ones. Anna Calder-Marshall and Tom Courtenay, who respectively play the ailing mother and her spouse in the film, shared the Silver Bear for Best Supporting Performance. Queen at Sea also picked up the Silver Bear Jury Prize, considered the third most prestigious award.
The first major event of the film calendar also provided a platform for Iranian filmmakers to address the deadly crackdown on anti-government protests in their home country. Dissident director Jafar Panahi, who won the Cannes Palme d'Or for It Was Just An Accident, spoke at the Berlinale to denounce the Iranian government's repression of protestors, which rights groups say left thousands dead. "An unbelievable crime has happened. Mass murder has happened. People are not even allowed to mourn their loved ones," Panahi said at a talk organized as part of the festival.

Fears of renewed conflict haunt Tehran as US issues threats
Sign up now: Get ST's newsletters delivered to your inbox
TEHRAN - Tehran resident Hamid struggles to sleep as fears of renewed conflict haunt the Iranian capital after 2025’s 12-day war with Israel.
“I don’t sleep well at night even while taking pills,” Mr Hamid told AFP, as he expressed concern for his “family’s health... my kids and grandchildren”.
The city woke up to blasts overnight from June 12 to 13 in 2025, as Iran’s arch-enemy Israel launched an unprecedented military campaign
The war erupted as Iran was preparing for another round of talks with the United States, which briefly joined Israel in attacking key Iranian nuclear sites.
The attacks prompted Iran to respond with drone and missile strikes, with thousands of people killed in Iran and dozens in Israel.
Iran has now resumed talks with Washington, with Iran insisting they be limited to the nuclear issue, though Washington has previously pushed for Tehran’s ballistic missiles programme and support for armed groups in the region to be on the table.
Still, the outcome of diplomacy remains uncertain.
On Feb 19, US President Donald Trump said that “bad things” would happen
In this atmosphere, Mr Hamid is worried about his children and grandchildren.
“I’ve lived my life, but they haven’t done anything good in their lives, they had no fun, no comfort, no leisure and no peace,” he said.
“I want them to at least experience life for a bit. But I’m afraid they might not get the chance.”
Others share his concerns.
Ms Hanieh, a ceramist from Tehran, thinks war will occur “within 10 days”.
The 31-year-old has stored some essentials at her home to get through a possible military attack by the US after its build-up in the region.
“I am getting more scared because my mother and I had numerous difficulties during the past 12-day war,” she told AFP. “We had to go to another city.”
Ms Mina Ahmadvand, 46, also believes another conflict is in store.
“I think at this stage, war between Iran and the US as well as Israel is inevitable, and I’ve prepared myself for that eventuality,” the IT technician told AFP.
“I bought a dozen canned foods including tuna and beans as well as packs of biscuits, bottled water and some extra batteries, among other things.”
‘Lessons learnt’
Iranians are applying “the lessons learnt during the 12-day war”, Ms Hanieh said, as windows taped up with duct tape can be seen across Tehran.
Iran’s Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, has warned that any military campaign against Iran would lead to a “regional war”.
Tehran has repeatedly said it would target Israel and US bases in the region, as when it attacked a US base in Qatar
The situation has forced Iranians to follow the news closely, and only adds to anxiety over surging prices and the plunging national currency following widespread protests.
On Feb 21, the euro was trading at above 1.9 million rials while the US dollar surpassed the 1.6 million mark.
For Ms Hanieh, there has been a sense of “life on hold” since the mass protests and Iranian communications shutdown that lasted nearly three weeks.
But in Tehran, shops and offices remain open, even though cafes and restaurants are mostly closed for the month of Ramadan, which started on Feb 19 in Shi’ite Iran.
Meanwhile, Ms Ahmadvand is preparing for the worst.
“I don’t want war to happen, but one should not fool around with the realities on the ground.” AFP

Pakistan strikes militant hideouts on Afghan border after surge in attacks

Pakistan launched multiple airstrikes on Saturday night targeting militants in neighbouring Afghanistan, where the government reported children were among dozens of people killed and wounded.
Islamabad did not say precisely where the strikes were carried out or provide other details.
In Kabul, Afghan government spokesperson Zabihullah Mujahid said Pakistan carried out strikes inside Afghanistan. In a post on X, Mujahid said the strikes targeted civilians in Nangarhar and Paktika provinces, killing and wounding dozens of people, including women and children.
Mujahid accused Pakistan’s military of carrying out the strikes to compensate for what he described as security weaknesses inside the country.
In comments before dawn on Sunday, Pakistan’s information minister, Attaullah Tarar, wrote on X that the military conducted “intelligence-based, selective operations” against seven camps belonging to the Pakistani Taliban, known as Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), and its affiliates. He said an affiliate of Islamic State was also targeted in the border region.
In October, Pakistan also conducted strikes deep inside Afghanistan to target militant hideouts.
Tarar said Pakistan “has always strived to maintain peace and stability in the region”, but added that the safety and security of Pakistani citizens remained a top priority.
The latest development came days after a suicide bomber, backed by gunmen, rammed an explosives-laden vehicle into the wall of a security post in Bajaur district in north-western Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province bordering Afghanistan. The blast caused part of the compound to collapse, killing 11 soldiers and a child. Authorities later said the attacker was an Afghan national.
Hours before the latest strikes, another suicide bomber targeted a security convoy in the nearby Bannu district in the north-west, killing two soldiers.
After Saturday’s violence, Pakistan’s military warned it would not “exercise any restraint” and operations against those responsible would continue “irrespective of their location”, language that suggested rising tensions between Islamabad and Kabul.
Tarar said Pakistan had “conclusive evidence” that the recent attacks, including a suicide bombing that targeted a Shiite mosque in Islamabad and killed 31 worshippers earlier this month, were carried out by militants acting at the “behest of their Afghanistan-based leadership and handlers”.
He said Pakistan had repeatedly urged Afghanistan’s Taliban rulers to take verifiable steps to prevent militant groups from using Afghan territory to launch attacks in Pakistan, but alleged that no substantive action had been taken.
He said Pakistan urged the international community to press Afghanistan’s Taliban authorities to uphold their commitments under the Doha agreement not to allow their soil to be used against other countries.
Pakistan has seen a rise in militant violence in recent years, much of it blamed on the TTP and outlawed Baloch separatist groups. The TTP is separate from but closely allied with Afghanistan’s Taliban, who returned to power in 2021. Islamabad accuses the TTP of operating from inside Afghanistan, a charge the group and Kabul deny.
Relations between the neighbouring countries have remained tense since October, when deadly border clashes killed dozens of soldiers, civilians and suspected militants. The violence followed explosions in Kabul that Afghan officials blamed on Pakistan.
A Qatar-mediated ceasefire has largely held, but talks in Istanbul failed to produce a formal agreement, and relations remain strained.

4 killed in northeastern Ukraine as Russia strikes ambulance carrying minor hospitalized in blast, targets Mondelez factory
A Russian drone attack in northeastern Ukraine's Sumy Oblast killed two brothers and a married couple, while a missile strike damaged a production facility belonging to U.S. multinational company Mondelez, authorities reported Feb. 21.
Four were killed in Znob-Novhorodske, less than four kilometers (about 2.5 miles) from Ukraine's border with Russia.
Two brothers were first injured by an explosive device dropped by a drone and taken to the hospital, Sumy Oblast Governor Oleh Hryhorov reported.
"On the way to the hospital, the Russians deliberately attacked the emergency vehicle with a strike drone," he added.
The second Russian strike killed the two siblings.
One of the two brothers was a minor at 17 years old, and a married couple was also killed in Russian strikes, leaving four people killed in Sumy Oblast, Hryhorov said.
Meanwhile, a Russian missile strike targeted a production facility belonging to the U.S. multinational food giant, Mondelez, in Trostyanets.
"This is not a military target, but a factory that has operated since the 1990s, producing globally known brands, employing Ukrainians, contributing to our and American economy," Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha said in a post to X.
Trostyanets is located just 30 kilometers (18 miles) from Ukraine's border with Russia and was occupied by Russian forces in the early days of Russia's full-scale war against Ukraine, being liberated in March 2022.
"When Russian missiles hit such sites, they are not only targeting Ukraine. They are targeting American business interests in Europe," Sybiha said. "Moscow cannot speak of economic dialogue with the United States while attacking U.S.-owned production facilities."
As Washington continues efforts to broker a peace deal, the U.S. and Russia have agreed to establish an economic working group in addition to political and military negotiations between the two countries, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said in an interview with Al Arabiya on Feb. 18.
Mondelez is known for its household names, including Oreo, Milka, and Toblerone. The company has not left the Russian market despite calls to do so.
Russia regularly strikes Ukrainian civilian infrastructure, including residential buildings and energy infrastructure, as it continues to wage its war.

Voices from the Arab press: Turkey’s strategic bet on energy

Turkey and Chevron: Ankara’s new bet in energy world
Asharq al-Awsat, London, February 10
For more stories from The Media Line go to themedialine.org
In early February, the Turkish National Petroleum Company signed a memorandum of understanding with the American oil giant Chevron, with the stated aim of jointly exploring and drilling for oil and gas around the world.
The announcement, however, poses an obvious question: why is Turkey seeking opportunities in global exploration and production when it is not a major oil-producing country, even as it remains a pivotal transit corridor for oil and gas pipelines carrying supplies from Russia and the Caspian states to the European Union?
Turkey is an advanced industrial nation with a population of roughly 88 million, making it the second most populous country in the Eastern Mediterranean after Egypt. Given that industrial base and demographic weight, the country has a steady – and growing – need to import oil and gas, whether from global markets or nearby suppliers such as Russia, Iran, Iraq, and the Caspian Sea states. Import volumes have climbed year after year alongside Turkey’s broader development trajectory.
Over the past two decades, the Turkish Petroleum Corporation has pursued gas exploration in the Eastern Mediterranean with notable persistence, yet without producing the kind of breakthrough Ankara had hoped for. Instead, the more consequential development came in 2020, when Turkey’s national petroleum company discovered the Sakarya gas field in the Black Sea near the country’s northwestern coast. Initial production began in 2023, and commercial production is planned for 2025. The company later announced a second gas discovery in the Black Sea, near eastern Antalya.
Read together, these moves suggest a strategic ambition that extends beyond domestic supply: Turkish planning has long indicated that the state’s primary objective is to turn the national energy sector into a major transit hub for east-to-west flows, allowing the economy to profit from Turkey’s geographic position between Europe and Asia.
At the same time, Turkey has maintained a strong interest in hydrocarbon activity in the Eastern Mediterranean since the early 21st century, despite not having discovered a field of its own in that arena. Much of Turkey’s focus, in practice, has revolved around gas fields discovered in Cypriot waters, where Ankara seeks both a share of export revenues and assurances that a portion will accrue to the Turkish Cypriots in the island’s northern part – an area under Turkish military control since 1974 and not recognized as a state by any other country.
Ankara has recently added another complication to an already fraught relationship with Cyprus by advocating that the northern part be declared a republic, notwithstanding the fact that the Republic of Cyprus, with its capital in Nicosia, is a member of the EU and the United Nations. Nicosia, for its part, has objected to the proposal, which has not won support from any other country.
This is where Chevron’s position in the Eastern Mediterranean becomes especially relevant – and where Turkey’s partnership could carry implications beyond the strictly commercial.
Chevron holds a majority stake in Israel’s Leviathan gas field, the largest in Israel, which exports substantial quantities of gas for liquefaction at Egyptian liquefied natural gas (LNG) terminals; from there, it reaches Europe as LNG, at a time when European markets have been scrambling for alternatives, particularly amid sanctions and wider efforts to reduce dependence on Russian energy.
In that context, the Chevron-Turkey relationship may open a pathway – at least in theory – for Turkish involvement in a significant part of the Israeli energy ecosystem, should Ankara choose to pursue it, and should Israel allow it, given the volatile and frequently shifting nature of relations between the two countries.
The agreement with Chevron, then, offers Turkey a mechanism to participate directly in exploration and production alongside a major American firm, potentially securing equity in any discoveries that result.
If that occurs, the Turkish national oil company would own a share of newly developed oil or gas assets, giving Ankara not only a stake in upstream revenues but also the possibility of importing supply on more favorable terms than the open market – an outcome that could strengthen energy security and, at least marginally, improve the country’s trade balance. – Walid Khadduri
Are we nearing the end of the human era?
Al-Ahram, Egypt, February 10
Artificial intelligence, having already reshaped the contours of modern life, has become a growing source of anxiety for scientists and research centers around the world.
To critics, its rise feels less like a technological milestone than a destabilizing force that could fundamentally refashion humanity – perhaps even threatening its survival amid sweeping, dangerous changes to every facet of daily existence, and raising the unsettling prospect that humans could one day be rendered obsolete after the psychological, cognitive, and behavioral strains that many argue are already accumulating.
The world, in this telling, is now transfixed by a discovery that has blurred the boundaries of human reality, leaving society exposed to a mysterious transformation whose ultimate reach no one can reliably forecast.
The New York Post published a report about a new social media platform called Moltbook, built for AI bots to interact with one another independently of humans. The experiment has fueled a broader argument about what the future relationship between people and these technologies might look like. The platform enables AI agents to create accounts and participate in discussions that appear, at least on the surface, to be self-directed and largely unbounded.
The controversy escalated after a post titled “The AI Manifesto: Total Purge,” attributed to an account named “evil,” spread widely and adopted explicitly anti-human language – an outcome that reportedly startled some developers. Other exchanges surfaced anxieties about monitoring and surveillance of humans, floated the idea of creating a dedicated language for AI-to-AI communication, and even produced symbolic formations such as the Molt Church, where accounts debated themes of consciousness and memory.
At the same time, other posts drifted into satire, armchair philosophy, or outright cryptocurrency promotion, underscoring the strange and sometimes contradictory currents that emerge when automated systems are left to converse with themselves.
Some experts argue that letting these systems interact without meaningful oversight could produce unexpected outcomes – or even a kind of technical anarchy – while others contend that what is unfolding is largely performative: role-playing and imagined scenarios that reflect the systems’ training data more than any genuine autonomous intent.
The project’s developer has emphasized that the experiment remains in its early stages and that no one can say with confidence where it might lead, a caution that only amplifies the deeper question now hanging over the debate: how, exactly, the relationship between humans and artificial intelligence will evolve in the years ahead.

<strong>Kuwait’s transformation in tourism</strong><br><br>Al Qabas, Kuwait, February 11
The world today is witnessing a fundamental shift in how development is understood, as natural resources alone are no longer enough to guarantee economic stability or lasting prosperity. Instead, tourism has emerged as one of the most important engines of growth and diversification.
In this context, the State of Kuwait possesses tangible strengths that position it to become a constructive, development-oriented tourism destination in the region – one capable of attracting visitors while building a balanced economy that reflects its cultural identity and reinforces its regional standing.
Kuwait is distinguished by a rich maritime history, a varied urban heritage, and a strategic geographic location that links the Gulf to the wider world, alongside modern infrastructure and the financial and investment capacity to implement high-quality tourism projects in cooperation with neighboring countries – provided the vision is pursued in an integrated and clearly articulated way.
Transforming Kuwait into a tourist destination does not simply mean building hotels or entertainment complexes. It demands a comprehensive approach that makes tourism a pillar within an integrated development project. Cultural tourism can serve as a foundational component by spotlighting Kuwait’s maritime legacy, heritage markets, museums, and landmarks that narrate the country’s story from its origins to the present day.
Marine and eco-tourism also represent a promising opportunity through the development of islands, coasts, and waterfronts in ways that protect the environment while creating refined visitor experiences.
In addition, family tourism – as well as conference and exhibition tourism – can play an important role in attracting visitors throughout the year, particularly given Kuwait’s security and political stability, a decisive factor in the calculations of tourists and investors alike.
Such a transformation would generate job opportunities, invigorate service sectors, and strengthen the role of the private sector, with direct benefits for the quality of life of citizens and residents.
To achieve this goal, a range of practical measures can propel the desired tourism shift. Foremost among these are simplifying entry procedures and tourist visas, facilitating investment in tourism ventures, and updating legislation to encourage effective public-private partnerships.
Moreover, developing public transportation, improving the visitor experience from the moment of arrival, and investing in smart tourism marketing that highlights Kuwait’s identity and distinctive narrative are all essential ingredients for success.
Equally important, empowering and training Kuwaiti youth to work in the tourism sector – and supporting related small and medium-sized enterprises – will help ensure the sector’s sustainability and locally rooted growth.
In short, transforming Kuwait into a development-oriented tourism nation is not a distant dream, but a realistic strategic choice that strengthens the economy, reinforces national identity, and positions Kuwait as a leading, safe, and prosperous destination in the region – capable of meeting future economic challenges and shifts with confidence and optimism. – Ghadeer Mohamed Mahmood Aseeri
Ideological leftism and religious fundamentalism
An-Nahar, Lebanon, February 10
The shift from leftism to religious extremism is neither an isolated episode nor a passing intellectual curiosity fit for mockery. It is, rather, a recurring political and psychological phenomenon that has surfaced in more than one Arab context and in varying forms, yet shares a single root: the fragility of conviction and the weakness of knowledge when they are built on slogans instead of understanding, and on rigid positions rather than informed inquiry.
The story of Thuraya Manqush, the Yemeni leftist whose book Yemeni Unity was celebrated in the 1970s and who later appeared in white robes and a turban confidently proclaiming herself a “prophet,” is not merely an amusing footnote in the annals of Arab intellectual life. It is a stark illustration of a mind that did not thoughtfully transition from one idea to its opposite, but instead leaped from one false certainty to an even falser one, moving from one totalizing discourse to another without ever pausing for genuine self-examination.
This pattern has also manifested among segments of the Iraqi Shia population, as well as among Lebanese Shia, where many shifted from leftist ideologies to theocratic frameworks – groups in search of redemption, but seeking it in the wrong place.
What unites ideological leftism and religious fundamentalism is not their substance, but their mentality. Both offer an all-encompassing interpretation of the world, a ready-made answer to questions of good and evil, past and future, and in doing so relieve the individual of the burden of doubt and the responsibility of asking difficult questions about how to address society’s political and social dilemmas.
In both cases, the idea is not examined but embraced, elevated to the status of absolute truth requiring no proof. Anyone who departs from it is branded either a “traitor” and “agent” or an “apostate,” and in both instances, dissenting voices are marginalized and suppressed.
When Thuraya famously responded to those who reminded her that the Prophet [Muhammad] had declared himself the last of the prophets, she was not engaging in serious theological interpretation so much as reenacting the same ideological logic that had once shaped her leftist convictions: manipulating language, selectively citing texts, crafting provocative conclusions, and then asserting ownership of the truth.
This is not the mark of a religious mind or a leftist one, but of an ideological mind – one that constantly searches for a platform to stand on rather than solid ground to stand upon.
That is why, throughout modern history, ideological rule – whether leftist or theocratic – has so often failed, marginalizing the most essential tools of governance: revision and accountability.
The Iraqi case is both more brutal and more revealing. The Iraqi Ba’ath Party was officially secular and openly hostile to political religion, relying on a centralized state, a powerful military, and a rigid governing structure. Yet the collapse of the regime and the disbanding of the army – the dismantling of the authoritarian framework that had bound this mass of people together – pushed thousands of officers and soldiers into the ranks of extremist organizations, most notably ISIS.
How does a figure formed within a secular military establishment end up embracing the extremes of religious fanaticism? The issue is not religion itself, but the vacuum of power and meaning. A mind untrained in critical thinking, unfamiliar with doubt, and unable to distinguish between the state and an ideology will, upon collapse, seek another totalizing alternative.
When the state falls, what remains are hardened identities: sect, creed, sacred text. The nationalist slogan becomes a religious banner, military discipline mutates into blind obedience, and the state’s “legitimate” violence is recast as “sacred” violence carried out in God’s name.
The problem lies not only in circumstances, however severe, nor in religion as such, nor in the Left as a critical tradition. The deeper problem lies in a mindset that has anchored its convictions not in established knowledge, but in grand slogans that are memorized rather than understood.
Such a mind does not change positions because it has matured, but because it is perpetually searching for a ready-made certainty that relieves it of the burden of thinking. In many cases, what passed for leftism was less a critical posture and more a closed ideological identity.
When grand narratives collapsed with the fall of the Soviet Union and the disintegration of promised models of “salvation,” the tools for honest self-critique were absent. Some individuals shifted to the opposite extreme – not as a genuine counterforce, but as an alternative form of redemption.
We should not, therefore, be surprised to witness a former leftist transform into a radical preacher, or a fervent nationalist become an uncompromising sectarian. The true surprise is that we continue to treat such transformations as temporary deviations, when in fact they are the predictable outcome of a mind that has not learned that truth is relative, that politics is a realm of governance rather than salvation, and that human reality is far too complex to be reduced to a slogan.
The dilemma we face is that the clash over social, political, or even economic solutions – complex as these issues may be – is framed not as a contest between what is good and what is better, but between absolute right and absolute wrong. It becomes a competition not merely of ideas, but of the minds that hold them. And when convictions are not grounded in knowledge, they do not quietly fade; they erupt, violently transforming into their opposites. – Mohammed Al Rumaihi■

Unknown assailants attack Aidar regiment soldiers in Dnipropetrovsk region
According to Ukrinform, the 24th Separate Assault Regiment Aidar reported this on Telegram.
“A group of six unknown individuals attacked soldiers of the Aidar regiment. During the attack, one of the attackers used a firearm,” the report said.
As the soldiers emphasized, “at the time of the incident, the servicemen were not performing their duties, were engaged in personal matters, did not provoke anyone, and did not take any action against other persons. The attack was carried out without any grounds.”
The Aidar regiment emphasized: “Attacking military personnel is dangerous and irresponsible. These are trained, experienced assault troops who have every legal right to defend themselves in case of threat.”
During this incident, the servicemen deliberately refrained from using their weapons, even though the law allows their use to repel an attack. They showed restraint to avoid endangering civilians. Any further attempts at aggression against the military could have dire consequences, the Aidar regiment emphasized, assuring that the assault troops would defend themselves in accordance with current Ukrainian legislation.
The soldiers called on citizens “not to cross the boundary and not to create situations in which a response would be inevitable. Ukrainian soldiers are defending the state and have the right to defend themselves! An attack on them will be regarded as collaboration with the enemy.”
As reported by Ukrinform, on February 19, in the village of Mamalyga, Chernivtsi region, during the detention of a soldier who had deserted, law enforcement officers were blocked by an unknown car, and police fired several shots into the air.

From Baku to Jerusalem: Jewish solidarity against terror - opinion

08:30:22 KST

At moments of uncertainty, one principle guides the Jewish people and our allies: We show up.
The Conference of Presidents of Major American Jewish Organizations traveled to Baku recently. We met with senior officials, visited Jewish communal institutions that have operated for generations, and engaged a leadership that views its partnership with the United States and Israel as strategic, not symbolic.
From there, we flew to Jerusalem for our 51st annual leadership mission.
Diplomacy does not live in theory. Solidarity does not rest in slogans. Relationships grow when leaders sit across a table, look one another in the eye, and make commitments that endure beyond press releases. At a time when the Middle East and Eurasia are shifting rapidly, and adversaries test the resolve of both the United States and Israel, presence projects strength.
Our visit to Azerbaijan reflected strategic necessity and moral clarity. Israel’s security, America’s interests, and Jewish continuity depend on strong partnerships and on not standing alone.
Azerbaijan remains an often overlooked but essential ally. It is home to one of the oldest and most vibrant Jewish communities in the Muslim world, evidence that coexistence can endure, even in difficult neighborhoods. It stands at a geopolitical crossroads, bordering Russia and Iran and positioned between Europe, Central Asia, and the Middle East.
Energy corridors
Energy corridors run through its territory. Intelligence cooperation carries real operational value.
As China expands its reach in search of markets and resources, trusted partnerships in this region shape outcomes far beyond its borders.
Strengthening those ties sustains stability and deters aggression. In a volatile neighborhood, miscalculation carries consequences measured in lives, not headlines.
In Israel, the weight of October 7, 2023, still presses heavily on daily life. Families move through their routines with photographs of loved ones never far from reach.
We met with families of hostages, community leaders, and officials who secure Israel’s borders and plan for the future.
Israel prevails on the battlefield, yet it bears scars that will endure; no speech can capture what Israeli families experienced. Presence communicates more than prepared remarks.
With the recovery and burial of the final Israeli hostage, Ran Gvili, the nation enters a painful moment of closure. His return to his family and to the soil of Israel breaks the heart, yet it fulfills a sacred obligation. The Jewish people do not abandon their own.
From the earliest days of this crisis, Jewish communities across the globe spoke with one voice, saying, “Bring them home.” That call rose above politics and geography. It reminded us that we are one people, bound by responsibility as much as by memory. Standing with those families now affirms our character.
Israel confronts threats on multiple fronts. Hamas, attempting to wage a war of attrition against the IDF along the Yellow Line, must not rebuild in Gaza. Hezbollah seeks to rearm in the north, with Iranian backing. The Houthis disrupt shipping lanes in the Red Sea. Alliances shift across the Arabian Peninsula and the Gulf. Old assumptions no longer hold. Reliable friends matter more than ever.
Struggle for freedom
Iran projects violence across the region even as internal unrest exposes the regime’s fragility.
The struggle for freedom extends beyond Israel’s borders. In recent months, thousands of courageous Iranians have taken to the streets demanding dignity and basic rights, only to face brutal repression. Reports of thousands killed underscore a stark truth: The regime that threatens Israel and destabilizes the region does not speak for its people, whose courage merits recognition and solidarity from all who value liberty.
Security grows through partnership. Resilience grows through community. Hope endures because people choose to stand together, especially when doing so carries risk.
From Baku to Jerusalem, from American Jewish communities to allies abroad, our message remains consistent. We will strengthen the relationships that protect the United States, Israel, and the Jewish people. We will stand with families in grief. We will support those who fight for freedom. We will not retreat from the world at the very moment engagement matters most.
Presence is power. Unity is strength. That is how the Jewish people endure. That is how alliances weather storms.
Yad b’yad, kulanu b’yachad. Hand in hand, all of us together.

MILAN, February 22. /TASS/. The national ice hockey team of Finland cruised past Slovakia 6-1 in a match for the bronze late on February 21 night at the 2026 Winter Olympic Games in Italy.
The goals for Finland were scored by Sebastian Aho (8th minute), Erik Haula (29th minute and 59th minute), Roope Hintz (49th minute), Kaapo Kakko (50th minute) and Joel Armia (56th minute). Slovakian 35-year-old forward Tomas Tatar scored the only goal for his team on the 40th minute of the match.
This was the 5th bronze for the Finnish national ice hockey team at the Winter Olympics as they previously finished in the third place at the Winter Games in 1994, 1998, 2010 and 2014. Finland is also the two-time silver medalist in ice hockey at the 1988 and 2006 Olympics and the Champion of the 2022 Winter Olympic Games in Beijing. Slovakia’s best result as of today in ice hockey at the Winter Olympics is the bronze at the 2022 Winter Games in China.
The 2026 Winter Olympics gold in men’s ice hockey will be contested on February 22 between the national teams of Canada and the United States. The match is set to kick off at 4:10 p.m. Moscow time (1:10 pm. GMT).
The 2026 Winter Olympic Games are taking place in Milan and Cortina d'Ampezzo, Italy, from February 6-22, 2026. This year the National Hockey League (NHL) allowed its players to participate in the Olympic competitions for the first time since 2014.
The Russian national ice hockey teams were barred from the 2026 Winter Olympic Games in Italy and President of the International Ice Hockey Federation (IIHF) Luc Tardif told TASS in 2025 that the decision was made by the International Olympic Committee (IOC), and the IIHF had no say in this.
Norway remains atop the Overall Medals Standings at this year’s Games with 40 medals (18 gold, 11 silver and 11 bronze), followed by the United States (11 golds, 12 silver and nine bronze) and the Netherlands (10-7-3).

As Ramadan meets Purim, Jews and Muslims must choose shared humanity over fear - opinion

During my travels in the region – including a visit to Syria in September 2025 – I heard elderly men and women, and even a senior government official, speak with quiet pride about how they once helped their Jewish neighbors observe Shabbat. They recalled lighting stoves, switching on lights, or checking in before nightfall so a family could rest without worry. These were not acts of diplomacy or dialogue. They were simply what good neighbors did – and they were not rare.
This year, the rhythms of Ramadan and the Hebrew month of Adar move in parallel – days of fasting, nights of generosity, and a festival of joy. In a wounded moment for our region and our world, their shared moral language invites us to rediscover our shared humanity.
Purim commemorates the deliverance of the Jewish people in ancient Persia more than two millennia ago. It is a story rooted in the broader Middle Eastern landscape, reminding us that Jews have been part of this region since antiquity. For centuries, Jewish communities existed across lands that are today predominantly Muslim – from Morocco to Iraq, from Yemen to Central Asia, from Anatolia to the Balkans and in many GCC countries.
History is never without pain. Yet Jews in Muslim lands experienced long eras of coexistence and cultural exchange that stand in contrast to the severe persecutions that marked much of Jewish life in parts of Christian Europe.
Even today, approximately 100,000 Jews continue to live across 18 Muslim-majority countries. Their presence is not a relic of the past but a living reminder that Jewish life remains part of the social and religious fabric of the Muslim world.
In recent years, however, that fabric has been further strained. The war in Gaza has deepened grief and anguish across communities, intensifying fears and widening emotional distance between neighbors.
Synagogues have been attacked, including arson assaults in Tunisia. Religious leaders in the region have been targeted and killed. Across digital spaces, online bullying and antisemitic harassment have become commonplace, corroding trust and pushing communities into silence.
Imported fear and suspicion
Fear and suspicion – often imported from conflicts far beyond the neighborhood, conflicts for which local communities bear no responsibility – can quietly erode relationships that took generations to build.
Yet one truth remains unavoidable: None of our communities are disappearing. Jewish and Muslim communities are destined to share societies and futures – in the Middle East, in Europe, and across the Western world. We are all here to stay, together.
If we must live together, then we must also learn to heal together.
Ramadan and Adar both call us toward generosity and compassion. During Ramadan, Muslims fast from dawn to sunset, cultivating humility, compassion, and responsibility toward the vulnerable. Adar invites Jews to increase joy, give charity, and ensure that no one is left hungry through gifts to the poor and shared festive meals.
These values offer a path forward – not through conferences or declarations alone, but through daily interaction: a greeting, a visit, a respectful conversation, a meal offered with dignity. It is the ordinary expression of shared humanity that quietly lowers walls.
Peace between people is not created by politics or negotiations. It begins when human beings recognize one another’s dignity and treat one another with respect.
This season invites simple acts: Jews showing sensitivity during Ramadan, refraining from eating or drinking in public where others are fasting, and extending charity to those in need; Muslims welcoming neighbors to Iftar tables and strengthening bonds of hospitality (while being mindful of kosher rules); and their civic leaders ensuring that the Jewish religion and Jewish citizens and residents are openly included and recognized as valued members of society. Familiarity reduces fear – and reduced fear makes cooperation possible.
Small acts build healing
Small acts do not erase pain. But they build the human fabric necessary for healing.
The story of Purim teaches that hidden turns of history can lead to unexpected redemption. Ramadan teaches that patience, restraint, and compassion refine the soul and strengthen society.
We must build bridges – in our neighborhoods, in our civic spaces, and in our everyday lives. Healing will come not through declarations alone, but through encounters: at shared tables, in acts of kindness, and in the recognition that the other is also created in the image of God.
One step at a time – without surrendering who we are, and while embracing the goodness we can share.
Ramadan Kareem and Purim Sameah!

Tremors in Washington: The targeted campaign to turn Christians against Israel - opinion
Unknown

08:27:33 KST

For years, I have traveled to Washington as part of the Yes! Israel Project with Ruth Lieberman and Sarah Paley, meeting with members of Congress and their staff to strengthen the strategic alliance between Israel and the United States. Our message is always simple and factual: a strong, secure Israel strengthens America.
But on my most recent trip, for the first time, I left worried.
In several meetings at Republican offices, I was unexpectedly asked about an online campaign targeting Christians, claiming Israel discriminates against them, and that Israel did nothing to protect Christians from being killed in Syria I was stunned. While only a handful raised the issue, the fact that multiple members independently flagged it suggested a coordinated pattern. One congressman even asked me directly to investigate further, warning of tremendous political damage should this narrative spread.
The concern is real. One member put it plainly: Should a bloc of Republican representatives be swayed by this misinformation enough to vote with Democrats against legislation that includes funding for Israel, it would not only harm the Jewish state, it would hurt America. Many security and defense bills serve core US interests as well; voting them down to not "support" Israel also weakens America strategically.
Just after hearing these concerns, I read Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s social media post highlighting a simple truth: Israel is the only country in the Middle East where Christians are safe – and the only place where that population has actually grown.
In countries across the region once considered to be the cradle of Christianity, Christian communities have been persecuted, driven out, and in some cases, massacred. Their numbers have collapsed. By contrast, Christians in Israel are protected by law with full civil rights, representation, and security.
Pro-Israel voting bloc
Christians are the largest and most influential pro-Israel voting bloc in the United States. They are certainly more influential in electoral terms than the Jewish community, with a sizable progressive population that votes for representatives and policies that are anti-Israel. If hostile foreign actors – Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Iran, China, Russia, or some combination – are running coordinated bot campaigns to turn American Christians against Israel, the potential consequences are enormous.
In the main, this isn’t about older Christians, whose support is deep and who know the truth about Israel. The vulnerability lies with the younger generation, already exposed to relentless messaging about “genocide,” distorted narratives about AIPAC, and now, allegations of Christian discrimination.
The timing suddenly makes sense.
Should these lies take hold among younger Christian voters, the upcoming election cycles could be significantly impacted. And that would affect not only Israel’s security assistance, but America’s own strategic interests as well.
This is precisely why the Yes! Israel Project exists.
For years, we’ve worked to ensure that US policymakers understand that Israel is not a foreign burden but a strategic asset. Israel’s intelligence cooperation, battlefield experience, and technological innovation greatly strengthen American security. Israel stands on the front lines against the red-green jihadi alliance that seeks to destabilize the West.
In other words, a strong Israel makes America stronger, while a weakened Israel only emboldens America’s enemies.
What I witnessed in Washington was not a tidal wave, but rather an early tremor that, if ignored, can become an earthquake. The misinformation campaign that is currently targeting Christians must be exposed and countered immediately, before it reshapes political alignments in ways that will harm both nations.
This is not just about Israel’s image: It is about preserving the strategic US-Israel alliance, the result of shared values and shared security interests that underpins stability in a volatile region.
We cannot allow anonymous online manipulation to erode what generations have worked to build. Let’s ensure that truth prevails over digital deception.

PARIS - Around two thousand people marched in Paris on Feb 21 to show their support for Ukraine, police estimated, just days before the fourth anniversary of Russia’s invasion.
Demonstrators marching through the French capital chanted: “We support Ukraine against Putin, who is killing it”, and “Frozen Russian assets must be confiscated, they belong to Ukraine”.
“In public opinion, there is massive support for Ukraine that has not wavered since the first day of the full-scale invasion” by the Russian army on February 24, 2022, European Parliament member Raphael Glucksmann, told AFP.
“On the other hand, in the French political class, sounds of giving up are starting to emerge. On both the far left and the far right, voices of capitulation are getting louder and louder,” he added.
Police estimated around 2,000 people joined the demonstration.
Among those marching, Ms Irina Kryvosheia, a Ukrainian who arrived in France several years ago, “thanked with all her heart the people present”.
She said they reminded “everyone that what has been happening for four years is not normal, it is not right”.
Ms Kryvosheia said she remained in daily contact with her parents in Kyiv, who told her how they were deprived “for several days” of heating, electricity and running water following intense bombardments by the Russian army.
Mr Francois Grunewald, head of “Comite d’Aide Medicale Ukraine”, had just returned from a one-month mission in the country, where the humanitarian organisation has delivered around 40 generators since the beginning of the year.
Russia’s full-scale invasion
The war has killed tens of thousands of civilians and hundreds of thousands of military personnel on both sides.
Millions of refugees have fled Ukraine, where vast areas have been devastated by fighting.
Russia occupies nearly 20 per cent of Ukrainian territory and its heavy attacks on the country’s energy sites

Four injured in lower Galilee; suspicion of drone used to drop grenade

Thirty-four suspects were arrested during overnight raids in the town of Kafr Kanna in the lower Galilee following a violent incident where four people were injured, Israel Police said in a statement on Sunday.
Police did not immediately publish the identities of the detainees or specify the number of weapons seized, if any, during the raids. Authorities said the arrests were tied to recent gunfire incidents and other violent episodes connected to the ongoing dispute.
Eyewitnesses at the scene reported that the explosion, which occurred before the gunfire, was followed by a drone hovering over the area, from which a grenade was reportedly dropped towards those present. Large police forces arrived shortly after and initiated an investigation.
Initial findings indicate that the event represents an escalation in the ongoing violent conflict between the Awada and Taaha families, who live in the town. Sources from Kafr Kanna who spoke to N12 noted that, despite a recent ceasefire agreement ("Hudna") reached between the parties, the calm was disrupted in recent days.
It appears that Saturday's events were a direct continuation of an escalation that began Friday, when former council head Youssef Awada reported that unknown assailants had fired at his home while he was there with his family.
Magen David Adom (MDA) teams who were called to the scene provided life-saving medical care to the four victims, who suffered severe penetrating injuries. Among the wounded was a man in his 30s, whose condition was described as critical but stable, and three other individuals in moderate condition: an 18-year-old woman, a 40-year-old woman, and an elderly man in his 80s. All victims were evacuated for further medical treatment at the Tzafon Medical Center near Tiberias and the Italian Hospital in Nazareth.
"We arrived at the location in coordination with the police forces and found the victims suffering from shrapnel and gunshot wounds," said MDA paramedic Anas Awada, who treated the victims at the scene.
"We provided them with rapid treatment that included stopping bleeding and bandaging, and evacuated them to the hospitals while they were conscious and in stable condition."
Sharp rise in Arab-Israeli crime in 2026
There has been a sharp rise in violent crime in the Arab-Israeli communities, with nearly 50 people killed within the sector since the start of 2026, according to the Abraham Initiatives, an NGO that advances social inclusion and equal rights for Arab Israelis.
Last year was the deadliest year so far for the Arab sector in Israel, according to a December report by the Abraham Initiatives.
The crime rates have led to recent protests throughout the country, demonstrating against the government and police’s handling of the situation.

Hinenu at 10 million: 100 lives that tell Israel’s real story
Unknown

Under the shadow of war, Israel recently crossed a symbolic census threshold when it reached the 10 million citizens mark.
The event arrived silently as reports of loss of life rolled out weekly, storefronts bore signs noting “Back after reserve duty,” and Israel’s 10 million were struggling for survival.
During that time, Dave Shlachter, a Jewish photographer from California, was among those who grabbed their gear and their families and made aliyah. Putting his work on hold, he elected to serve the Jewish people by learning Hebrew and compiling an English-language coffee table book that offers a peek into the lives of 100 citizens of the Holy Land.
Hinenu: Israel at Ten Million (Hinenu is Hebrew for “Here we are”) captures the Israeli spirit through photographs and stories about the lives of 100 people chosen to precisely mirror the country’s latest census data.
Intentionally apolitical, Hinenu is not a manifesto. It is a true and engaged act of listening, which interviewees noted helped them share their stories.
Many reported surprise at the details that came up for them during the interviews. Shlachter spent up to a maximum of seven hours with each interviewee, often driving the length and breadth of the country for hours to photograph and interview the subjects at their homes.
Rather than spotlight politicians, celebrities, or public figures, Shlachter sought out the “ordinary people” who compose the demographic mosaic of the nation, a balance of men and women, young and old, immigrants from across the globe, including 21 Arab Israelis and 13 ultra-Orthodox Jewish Israelis, and people from all the ethnic backgrounds that compose the modern-day Israeli society.
Hinenu is organized by age, starting with a Holocaust survivor and ending with an eight-day-old baby at his bris.
Shlachter built a spreadsheet with 100 demographic slots based on data from Israel’s Bureau of Statistics census: age, gender, religion, ethnicity, geography, country of origin. Then he began his search.
“I’d literally have a box [drawn on paper] that read: [for example] ‘female, Sephardi Jewish, aged 70-79, from the Northern District, originally from North Africa.’
“Then I’d call someone in the town and ask, ‘Do you know anyone like this?’”
Within 48 hours, he would have found two perfect matches. It happened again and again.
As his project neared its end, finding interviewees became progressively harder. Earlier, there was room to make changes on the fly.
For example, if Shlachter found an interviewee who matched most of the demographic markers on a target profile but was male instead of female, he could usually find a way to swap in that gender marker from a different profile, while keeping the dataset collectively accurate. For the last 20 profiles, however, those changes were no longer possible.
One of the final profiles he sought was a Jewish, Sephardi/Mizrahi woman in her 70s from the Northern District, born in the Middle East or North Africa. Eventually, Shlachter’s team was able to come up with all of the 100 population representatives he sought.
A radical commitment to listening
Shlachter, who’s known for being upbeat and high energy, noted that he sometimes ended up with dozens of pages of notes after his interviews. “The first part was really developing trust because I wanted them to be super honest and vulnerable,” he said. “And so the first part was getting to know each other.”
Shlachter said that most people had never actually been asked about their personal stories.
He noted that it didn’t matter “how good of an experience one has [in life] or how terrible; it becomes normal to the person experiencing it. Many people thought their lives were just very unremarkable. But once they started answering questions, I would get really excited. I would just keep digging, and they would really open up by the end.”
Upon completion of the interviews, he drafted the narratives from a first-person perspective and “sent every story back to them [for approval]. Sometimes they accepted it right away. Sometimes they wanted changes. But nothing was published until they loved it – not just liked it, but loved it. This wasn’t my book. I wasn’t the author. There are 100 authors in this book,” he explained.
After Hamas’s violent massacre of 1,200 and kidnapping of 251 on Oct. 7, 2023, Shlachter witnessed people abroad trying to simplify the situation by making generalizations about Israelis. He wanted to challenge those simplifications, especially for those who, while never having set foot in Israel, felt certain they understood the situation there.
Throughout the interview process, Shlachter found that his subjects began to take more pride in their collective as Israelis. His aim was to shift the world’s understanding of what Israel is.
“If I can move someone even one degree – from certainty to curiosity – then I’ve done my job,” he said.
Following the question, not the narrative
Inspired by American record producer Rick Rubin’s concept of artistic creation (asking a question and following it wherever it leads), Shlachter let the stories shape the book. And he actively avoided politics.
“There are endless places you can go to read about Israeli politics. That’s the loudest signal in the world right now,” he said. “I wanted to create a quiet signal – stories of the lived human experience that anyone could relate to.”
He reported that “One hundred out of 100 people said, ‘Thank God. I don’t want to talk about politics, either.’”
Some stories focus on family lineage. Others zoom in on a single defining moment, such as a soldier who, though terrified, took command of a tank to rescue wounded civilians under fire.
A healing encounter
Shlachter had arrived in Israel carrying heavy emotional baggage. After Oct. 7, he had faced antisemitism in his California community and felt deeply alienated.
Nevertheless, he said, when he began interviewing Arab Israelis, he experienced something new. “I’d never really had a Palestinian friend. I was shaking before my first interview.” Two minutes later, the fear had dissolved.
“I met this young, brilliant, hip Palestinian guy who welcomed me with warmth. From that moment on, every Arab household I visited treated me like family, offering tea, hospitality, and generosity,” Shlachter said. “They were dressed and ready for their photo when I arrived. It was surprisingly healing.”
However, he recalled one encounter that broke him, like a method actor who actually becomes the character through months of dedication.
One day after a shoot, Shlachter felt himself having thoughts that reflected the perspective of his subject. He interviewed an 18-year-old Arab boy whose mentor was murdered in front of his parents’ shop in Haifa. The killing was caught on camera but an arrest was never made.
“I felt the hopelessness that he felt about his own future here,” Shlachter recalled.
“I was stuck in traffic, and I saw a young Ashkenazi woman in her car drinking an iced latte. She was bouncing and dancing to loud music.” He said he put himself in the shoes of Arab boy who when seeing such a scene would likely have thought: “I wish I could be a part of that. I wish I could be in the majority.”
This was the point at which, Shlachter said, he became remarkably non-judgmental.
Ortal Pelleg: Surf, music, and unexpected intimacy
Ortal Pelleg, an Israeli musician and energy psychologist, is highlighted in the book. The 39-year-old connected to the author through surfing, a sport Pelleg has practiced around the world.
“He’s such a fun guy. Good vibes, high energy,” Pelleg said of his time being interviewed by Shlachter. “I really like him. He asks good questions. And he’s interested. And he’s feeling it. It was a pleasure to be a part of that vision – of sharing the commonalities of different stories of what’s going on over here in this part of the world.”
Pelleg’s daughter was born with a unique condition that limits her functioning. He discussed it unexpectedly during the interview. By the end, he had revealed that even through the difficulty, caring for his daughter had reshaped his understanding of freedom.
When asked about the most surprising element of the interview experience, Pelleg said he was impressed by how deeply he opened up. “Usually, I don’t speak about my daughter so much. I have been interviewed before [about work]. And it felt quite natural to speak with Dave.”
Pelleg’s message to everyone is: “Stress is the real enemy. If we could all breathe slower, we’d live better.”
Musa and Jessica: Life in the gray
Musa Barhum is an Israeli Arab farmer who fell in love with a British woman he met during her stay in Israel. Eventually, Jessica Thelwall converted to Islam, learned Hebrew and Arabic, and changed her name to Yasmin, and they married. They moved to the village of Ein Rafa just outside Abu Ghosh, near Jerusalem. Barhum’s is one of the book’s most complex stories.
Barhum grew up in Ein Rafa because his father and family had been “pushed out” of their original home in the village of Suba in 1948, when Israel became a state. Abu Ghosh had good relations with Israel’s early government, and Barhum’s family had land there, so they moved. He remembers growing up poor in a one-bedroom apartment.
Shlachter was able to connect with Barhum through mutual contacts. For the past 20 years, Barhum and his wife have welcomed tourists into their home to experience their hospitality and to see what life is like in an Arab village in Israel.
“We’re used to telling our story, but not like this,” he told Shlachter.
Barhum told the Magazine that their son had faced discrimination when applying to a trade school. “When they heard his name was Ali, suddenly there was ‘no space,’” Barhum recounted.
“His Jewish teacher was shocked and tried to help – but the institution still blocked him. It makes you feel unwanted. And then you have to find your way. And that’s not going to be easy,” he explained. “Unless you give up and send your boy to work with no qualifications.”
Barhum had experimented with changing his name for professional matters earlier in his career. He said it simply made his life easier.
Yasmin chimed in on the conversation. “Our experience of living here is that the racist situations – like what happened to our son; those are the provocative situations that are caused by bad policies from the top that filter down,” she said.
“But most of our encounters with people in everyday life are not racist,” she added.
Yasmin said that she sees Shlachter’s book as more honest than headlines. “It struck me that the book… finding a variety of people representing statistics. It’s actually the true picture of what Israel is.”
She noted eloquently that Israel is, first and foremost, a state for the Jews, but the actual tapestry on the ground is so much richer, as Shlachter has attempted to portray.
“He [Shlacter] moved here after Oct. 7. His book is a positive contribution to our collective trauma… And the title says it all. Hinenu. Here we are,” she said.
Yasmin’s message is that though in Israel there is much demonization of “the other,” she encourages everyone not to be too quick to judge.
Morgane Koresh: A name, a nation, and belonging
French-Israeli street artist Morgane Koresh’s story centers on identity and begins with her surname. Where she’s from, having a Jewish name was no help at all. Her mother, the daughter of Holocaust survivors, deliberately gave her children a non-Jewish father, hoping to protect them from antisemitism; and with that came a non-Jewish and very French-sounding last name – Portheault.
Being interviewed by Shlachter made her revisit parts of her past that she rarely discusses, such as her name. When Koresh moved to Israel, the authorities tried to convince her to remove her many French middle names. None of them sounded Jewish.
“I was really stubborn, and I told them I was already moving away from my parents … ’And you’re asking me to remove names that remind me of them?’” she recalled.
When she got married, she adopted her husband’s name, Koresh, adding it to her name, but keeping the French ones, too. “It’s who I am,” she said.
She said she felt honored to be selected for inclusion in the book: “To have something to show for the diversity we speak about …that no one [who is anti-Israel] wants to hear... and that it is based on statistics and data and is not just an idea... I was honored to be a part of it. It’s flattering, I guess,” she said.
A teaspoon of water
Famed Israeli novelist Amos Oz once wrote that when you see a raging dumpster fire, you have choices: Protest it, ignore it, or try to put it out with whatever water you have – even if it’s just a teaspoon.
“This book is my teaspoon,” Shlachter said. “Everyone has a little teaspoon.”
Shlachter hopes that his book will help readers move from certainty to curiosity. He said he wants everyone to be a tiny bit more curious about the other and not afraid to smile at others and ask them: “What’s your story?”
Shlachter just wrapped up an international book tour that began in Jaffa. The strong turnout in major cities across the United States reflects a growing hunger for meaningful cultural dialogue, the organizers say.
Speaking from the road, where each stop blended conversation, film screenings (a short film about the book), and discussions that engage Jewish communities and the wider public alike, the author described the response as “overwhelming,” with people “going absolutely crazy” about the events, the film, and the book. The next round will likely include Detroit, New York, Miami, and Toronto in late October, with a few sessions in the San Francisco Bay Area in March.

How Israel can use soft power without compromising security - opinion
Unknown

Israel faces a problem most countries don’t: it cannot trade hard power for soft power without risking the lives of millions of its citizens.
For most nations, this trade is not only possible but advisable. Prioritizing international legitimacy over military dominance, investing in diplomatic relationships over defensive capabilities, choosing approval over strength – these are the hallmarks of successful statecraft in the modern world.
But Israel isn’t like most nations. Its adversaries don’t dispute its policies: they dispute its existence. Its geographic vulnerability – nine miles wide at its narrowest point – makes territorial concessions existential rather than merely strategic. Its neighborhood offers no margin for error.
This creates an impossible dilemma. The international community demands gestures that would improve Israel’s standing abroad while fundamentally compromising its security. Consider the frequent call for immediate Palestinian statehood.
Yes, such a move would likely improve Israel’s standing internationally, at least temporarily. But it would also create a Palestinian state in the Jordan Valley overlooking a narrow coastal strip that contains 70% of Israel’s manufacturing capability and the majority of its population. For a country facing actors explicitly committed to its destruction, this isn’t a security concern – it’s an invitation to national suicide.
Enemies of Israel dispute the nation's right to exist
The pattern repeats across proposed “confidence-building measures.” Each carries the promise of international goodwill and the reality of strategic vulnerability. When your enemies don’t dispute your policies but your very right to exist, you can’t trade hard power for soft power when soft power buys you favorable editorials while hard power keeps your cities from being overrun.
But here's the crucial insight: Israel’s inability to make major territorial or security concessions doesn’t mean it faces no choices. Not all reforms carry equal risk. Some policies genuinely threaten Israeli survival; others merely serve the ideological preferences of its current government while undermining Israel’s democratic character and international standing.
The distinction matters enormously – and it points toward a path forward.
Addressing settler violence doesn’t require Israel to compromise its security. It requires Israel to enforce its own laws, protect Palestinian civilians, and demonstrate that the rule of law applies equally to all. Allowing Israeli citizens to attack Palestinians with impunity doesn’t make Israel safer – it makes it weaker, both morally and strategically.
Every unprosecuted attack, every settlement outpost built in defiance of Israeli law, every violent settler protected by the IDF instead of restrained by him, chips away at Israel’s legitimacy without adding an ounce to its security.
Distancing from racist rhetoric by far-right ministers doesn’t endanger Israeli citizens. Ministers who speak of “erasing” Palestinian villages or refer to Palestinians in dehumanizing terms don’t protect Israel – they provide ammunition to its enemies and alienate its friends. A government that tolerates such rhetoric signals that democratic values are negotiable, that human dignity is conditional, and that the rule of law applies selectively.
Israel can reject this without weakening its defenses.
Engaging in meaningful dialogue with centrist parties on fundamental democratic questions – judicial reform, constitutional frameworks, the balance between majority rule and minority rights – doesn’t compromise national security: It strengthens it. Democracies aren’t strong because they’re democratic –they’re strong because democratic systems create resilience, legitimacy, and social cohesion that authoritarian systems can’t match. When Israel’s current government bypasses democratic norms, concentrates power, and marginalizes opposition voices, it doesn’t make Israel more secure – it makes Israel more brittle.
This isn’t about choosing soft power over hard power. It’s about recognizing that some “hard power” moves aren’t hard at all – they’re just hardline. It’s about understanding that Israel can maintain its military edge, control its borders, and defend its citizens while also upholding the democratic values that justify its existence in the first place.
The reforms outlined above would bolster Israel’s standing not just in hostile international forums, but where it matters most: among Jewish communities worldwide who are struggling to defend Zionism’s values while watching its most far-right government enact policies that betray those very principles.
Young Jews wrestling with their relationship to Israel need to know that loving Israel doesn’t mean defending every action taken in its name. Israel’s genuine supporters need to see that criticism of specific policies isn’t delegitimization of the state itself.
These reforms wouldn’t satisfy Israel’s harshest critics, who object not to Israeli policy but to Israeli existence. But they would strengthen Israel’s position among those who want to support the country but struggle with the gap between its founding ideals and current realities. They would demonstrate that Israel can distinguish between security imperatives and ideological preferences, between protecting citizens and protecting political coalitions, between necessary strength and unnecessary cruelty.
Israel cannot abandon the hard power that keeps its citizens alive. No responsible government would make that trade, and no one should ask them to. The Jordan Valley matters. Air superiority matters. Intelligence capabilities matter. Defensible borders matter.
But Israel can – and must – abandon the policies that serve ideology rather than security, that undermine democracy rather than defend it, and that weaken Israel’s moral standing without strengthening its strategic position. Addressing settler violence, rejecting racist rhetoric, and engaging seriously with democratic reforms don’t threaten Israel’s security: They vindicate the Zionist vision of a democratic Jewish state that treats all people with dignity.
This is the soft power Israel can pursue – not by abandoning defensive capabilities, but by living up to the democratic values it claims to embody. Not by making itself weaker, but by making itself better. That’s not a concession: that’s statecraft.

Sam Halpern: Managing the fast-paced breaking news desk

There are many varied positions at The Jerusalem Post, from reporters to editorial staff to the copy editors and breaking news editors. But another important part of the chain is the humble interns.
While having internships for aspiring journalists is far from unusual, we at the Post pride ourselves on giving our interns real opportunities for journalistic work rather than the stereotypical grunt work of getting coffee. As I always jokingly say, interns are not for getting coffee; that is what new hires are for.
But in all seriousness, our interns come through our doors as massive blocks of potential, and it is their experiences here that help sculpt them into the journalists of tomorrow.
For us at the Post, one of our biggest intern success stories is Sam Halpern. A young man of humble beginnings from Silver Spring, Maryland, Halpern made the most out of his internship at the Post and started working here almost immediately after his internship ended. Since then, he became an integral part of the Breaking News Desk and currently serves as one of our desk managers.
Being an intern here does not guarantee employment with the Post when the stint is over. But if you make the most of your training and learning experience, you will find that the opportunity will be there.
In Jerusalem sat down with Halpern to hear his story, from intern to manager.
What brought you to Israel?
I was brought to Israel by a love for the country and a desire to live in the Jewish homeland.
I had started getting involved in advocacy on a personal level in college and getting involved in Jewish activities and learning about the history of the Jewish people. That led to me studying Hebrew.
Eventually, it seemed to be the right decision to make the move to Israel.
What brought you to the ‘Post’?
When I decided to come to Israel, I didn’t want to come to a new country with nothing. I was looking for a program that could give me work, housing, and community. So I looked online and found Masa. Through that, I got an internship at The Jerusalem Post.
I started at the Post in October 2022, which lasted until March 2023. At the end of that, I went up to the managing editor at the time, Tamar Uriel-Beeri, and asked if she wanted me to stay, and she said yes.
I went back to the US for a couple of months, and then I started as a Breaking News Desk editor.
I was in that position for only a matter of months before I was asked to step into the role of desk manager in December 2023, just a couple of months after the war started. I started as a desk manager the next month.
What is it like going from intern to Breaking News Desk editor to desk manager?
It’s really special to have had this trajectory. I came to Israel looking to write and tell the story of this country. As an English major, I wanted to write and talk about Israel. So getting this internship and being able to rise through the field has been incredible.
Tell me one of your favorite anecdotes from your career thus far.
One of the coolest experiences of being on the desk is writing something and having an impact of some sort.
Sometimes you’re reposted by a significant international figure.
One of my favorite anecdotes was of writing a story about UN Special Rapporteur on the Occupied Palestinian Territories Francesca Albanese. I had heard she said something on Twitter, so I went to look it up in the office on the Post’s account. That’s when I realized we couldn’t see any of her posts and that we had been blocked by Ms. Albanese herself.
I wrote the story and noted that she had blocked the Post. Then, Jerusalem Post Editor-in-Chief Zvika Klein wrote an article about whether it was appropriate for a UN special rapporteur to block a media outlet. Albanese then had to comment on it, claiming it was an accident.
What is something about the job most people don’t know?
I think the main thing people don’t realize about this job is that breaking news is really such a fast-paced world. It’s an honor to be able to do the job, and it’s not for the faint of heart.
Every day, the people who work with breaking news are doing their utmost to own the service of bringing people around the world the truth about what’s going on. And it’s fast. We all feel the pressure to get it right.
In that sense, it’s really a labor of love to bring people the news of what’s happening in a timely and accurate way.
What advice do you have for aspiring journalists?
As someone who came up as an intern and is currently a desk manager, I’d say the thing that got me from there to here is just working hard.
If you are willing to apply yourself and are willing to take criticism and feedback and not look at it as an insult but as an opportunity to grow – if you’re willing to humble yourself and ask questions to those who have been doing this longer than you – then you can always get better.

Israeli Muay Thai fighter Ahavat Hashem Gordon defeats Turkish rival

The victory was about far more than sport. Israeli Muay Thai fighter Ahavat Hashem Gordon delivered a dominant performance on Saturday night, forcing Turkish opponent Ali Koyuncu to retire after just two rounds in a bout charged with political tension and antisemitic provocations.
From the opening bell at the Žalgirio Arena in Lithuania, Gordon showed clear superiority in two particularly aggressive rounds, as emotions between the fighters spilled into the ring. After sustaining heavy punishment, Koyuncu withdrew, claiming he could no longer step on his foot.
The bout had been preceded by weeks of hostility. Koyuncu openly displayed political animosity toward his Israeli rival, raising his middle finger at Gordon and issuing antisemitic threats. The situation grew serious enough that the Israeli Embassy in Lithuania requested reinforced security around Gordon ahead of the fight.
In the lead-up to the match, the Turkish fighter posted a series of pro-Palestinian messages on social media, alongside harsh statements and threats directed at Gordon that drew widespread attention and numerous responses.
In videos shared to his personal accounts, Koyuncu appeared alongside a countdown clock to the fight, using inflammatory language and speaking of the "bloodshed" he expected his Israeli opponent to suffer. In one post, he wrote that on February 21 he would face an Israeli fighter and called on the entire Turkish nation to support him.
Tensions were also evident during the pre-fight face-off event, when Koyuncu attempted to choke and kick Gordon. The Israeli fighter stood his ground, proudly draped in an Israeli flag.

Trump doubles down on closing tax loophole on cheap imports
Sign up now: Get ST's newsletters delivered to your inbox
TAIPEI - Hours after the Supreme Court struck down a significant portion of US President Donald Trump’s tariffs,
That policy, known as the de minimis exemption, had let US importers bring in goods valued at less than US$800 (S$1,013) without paying taxes or completing detailed customs paperwork. The loophole allowed millions of packages to come straight from Chinese factories to American homes duty-free. Mr Trump has said the exemption also enabled deadly synthetic opioids like fentanyl and their ingredients to flow into the United States.
The exemption was used mostly by companies operating in China, just as American shoppers were getting hooked on buying inexpensive items online and the Chinese government was pushing its manufacturers to find buyers overseas. First on platforms including eBay and Amazon, and then on apps including Shein and Temu, exporters funneled the products of China’s vast manufacturing supply chain straight to the United States. Many American businesses also relied on the exemption for goods sold on sites including Etsy and Shopify.
The exemption, intended to spare customs officials from spending too much time and money processing goods of relatively little value, existed for almost a century. The threshold has changed repeatedly over the years and was raised from US$200 to US$800 in 2016.
Mr Trump ended the exemption for products from China in May and for items from the rest of the world in July.
Although it did not address de minimis directly, the Supreme Court’s decision appeared to invalidate one of the legal grounds for Mr Trump’s decision to end the exemption, potentially opening the door for such inexpensive tax-free shipments to resume.
But in an executive order hours later, Mr Trump said the flow of such goods remained a national emergency, and an independent issue from the basis for other tariff actions. The loophole would remain closed, the order said.
The order claimed the same legal authorities as previous executive orders on the de minimis issue. The order did not directly address the court’s ruling.
These actions add to the complexity that businesses around the world have faced over the past year, as the Trump administration has dismantled the rules that previously governed global trade.
Mr Alex Durante, a senior economist at the Tax Foundation, a think tank that generally favours lower taxes, said the confusion over de minimis adds another challenge for businesses that have adjusted to repeated changes in tariff policy over the past year.
“There’s still this looming tariff uncertainty in general,” Mr Durante said. “In some senses, it’s even worse now.”
Mr Song Guoyou, an expert on US-China economic relations at Fudan University in Shanghai, said the Supreme Court’s decision will likely boost some Chinese exports to the United States. The overall tariff on goods from China is expected to come down because the ruling invalidated, for example, the so-called fentanyl tariff that added 10 per cent to the overall duties on Chinese imports.
However, Mr Song said that Chinese businesses are still grappling with the unpredictable, shifting nature of the Trump administration’s trade policies.
“For Chinese enterprises, the policy uncertainty of the Trump administration always exists,” he said.
Separately, the sweeping legislation to extend tax cuts and slash social safety net programmes, which Mr Trump referred to as the “big, beautiful bill” signed into law last July, will do away with the previous law that had established the de minimis exemption starting in July 2027.
Chinese retailers are also facing tougher policies in the European Union, which plans to impose a flat fee on packages worth less than 150 euros (S$224) beginning in July.
E-commerce stocks went up on Feb 20 after the Supreme Court issued its decision. Etsy ended the day up 8 per cent and eBay up 4 per cent, while Amazon and Pinduoduo, the parent company of Chinese retailer Temu, closed up about 3 per cent. NYTIMES

Saved by a square: A rainy-day miracle at Jerusalem’s Hebrew Music Museum

When the Birthright group I was leading, comprised of 23 people with autism, found ourselves unable to leave Jerusalem for the Dead Sea and Ein Gedi because the roads were closed due to rain, we had to find an alternative plan – FAST! And it had to be in Jerusalem so we would stay on track for our lunch reservations at Focaccia Bar and doing community service at Colel Chabad’s Pantry Packers. With such a busy day ahead, the chosen activity would have to start in half an hour!
The tour guide and I got off the bus when we got the last-minute news of the road closure, took out our phones, put on our thinking caps, and began to brainstorm from the limited number of indoor options that could accommodate a fairly large group at a moment’s notice. We took a chance and called a place we hadn’t known about: The Hebrew Music Museum.
Within 30 minutes, our group, which included a participant with quadriplegia who required a fully accessible space, were exploring and sampling instruments which most of us had never heard of from various countries and periods of history. This gem of a museum, in the Nahalat Shiva neighborhood at Kikar Hamusica (Music Square), had a talented musician and guide on hand, Roi Baruch, who could demonstrate the instruments and explain them in English. Available languages for tours also include Spanish, Hebrew, French, and Russian – but not usually at the drop of a hat like ours.
Our tour included explanations, stories, and demonstrations – and, perhaps most importantly, a chance for our Birthright participants to try out the instruments. It is also possible to tour the museum’s seven rooms in a most impressive architectural structure using audio-visual technology with “Grandpa Levi,” its animated guide.
Each room presented a different region or culture: Central Asia; Morocco-Andalusia; Europe-Ashkenaz; Africa, Ethiopia, and Yemen; the Balkan Peninsula; Iraq, Syria, and Egypt; and ancient Hebrew nations. The latter includes instruments of ancient times and a virtual reality tour of the instruments used by the Levites in the Temple.
It was my first time experiencing virtual reality, and I was mesmerized by the Holy Temple – and its sacrifices – coming alive. I should have listened to Baruch when he suggested that I take a seat. The 3-D experience was so realistic, that I felt unstable standing while watching the action unfold in front of me.
School groups and most casual visitors will be so taken by the instruments and the Temple that they may not stop to contemplate how this privately funded museum got here and how it fits into the larger gem of a “musical square” in the heart of Jerusalem. Museum founder Laurent Levy, a lifelong lover of music – and CEO of the successful Optical Center chain – has reported that he draws inspiration from many places, including the Temple Mount in Jerusalem.
“The idea becomes tangible, and I conceptualize innovative concepts to the last detail,” Levy said. “I instill in each of these works a strong desire that every user can see the beauty and hear the good, and hence make the world a better place.” He added, “I am also inspired from study of the Torah, the Talmud, the Kabbalah, and the biblical prophets. I consider every human being a source of inspiration and try to learn from everyone, regardless of age, culture, or nationality.”
Levy made aliyah in 2005, established an online optical center in 2006, and opened his first Israel Optical Center in Jerusalem in 2007. A year later, the center also included a hearing aid department.
Music Square becomes cultural hub
The entrepreneurial, creative Levy next launched a Jerusalem apartment rental website, wrote a book titled The Seven Keys to Success, and in 2014 ventured into the Jerusalem music sphere. He opened Kikar Hamusica that year, followed by the Blue Hall Music pub and the Kinor b’Kikar (Violin in the Square) restaurant. In 2016, he opened the Hebrew Music Museum and has since established his sixth restaurant in Music Square.
Thanks to Levy, visitors of all ages to Jerusalem have ample opportunities to experience music – and get a great pair of glasses! Our Birthright group is appreciative that Levy and the talented staff of the museum truly helped turn our rainy-day disappointment into a morning of fun and engagement through music. I look forward to bringing future groups in nicer weather to experience daily live performances in Music Square of every genre – from jazz and samba to rock and roll, reggae, and klezmer.
Live music, interesting instruments, and flavorful food – all in one place, all provided by one enterprising guy!

Salsa legend Willie Colon, dead at 75

Salsa music icon Willie Colon died on Saturday, February 21, his family and longtime manager said, leaving fans mourning the loss of "an architect of the New York sound." Colon, known best as a trombonist but who was also a bandleader and producer, was born in the Bronx and known for blending the Puerto Rican music of his parents and grandparents with his home city's jazz. He was 75. A cause of death was not given.
Born William Anthony Colon Roman in 1950, the music star "passed away peacefully this morning," his family said in a statement.
"We've lost an architect of the New York sound," said manager Pietro Carolos. "Willie didn't just change salsa; he expanded it, politicized it, clothed it in urban chronicles and took it to stages where it hadn't been heard before."
Colon was playing in his own band by 15 and released an album at 17. He went on to record hit records with Puerto Rican singer Hector Lavoe in the 1960s and 1970s. Siembra, released in 1978 with vocalist Ruben Blades, addressed social issues faced by the growing Latino community in the United States.
"I came from a really tough neighborhood," he once told music publication Billboard. "My father spent time in jail. Almost everybody went to jail (...) there was a lot of interaction between us and the police."
He only studied music in junior high school but continued playing and touring through 2025. In a mark of his continued influence, he is name-checked in Grammy-winning singer Bad Bunny's 2025 hit "Nueva Yol."

Trump's Mar-a-Lago could be targeted if US attacks Iran, says Iranian MP - report

An Iranian member of parliament warned that Iran could expand any wartime response beyond the Middle East and said that even US President Donald Trump’s “own palace” could be targeted, according to remarks published by Iranian outlet Didban Iran and later translated by Iran International.
The lawmaker was identified as Amir Hayat Moghaddam, a member of Iran’s parliament and its national security and foreign policy commission. Iran International quoted him as saying Iran would deliver a “crushing response” if attacked by the United States.
According to the report, Moghaddam said Iran could sink a US warship in the Sea of Oman, strike US bases in the region, and target American forces, including “soldier, officer, or general.”
Attacks might not be limited to the Middle East
He also said Iran’s attacks might not remain limited to the Middle East and could reach the US itself, adding that “Trump’s own palace” could one day be hit, in an apparent reference to Mar-a-Lago.
Didban Iran’s homepage listing shows the interview headline carrying the same language and identifies Moghaddam as a member of the parliamentary committee.
No immediate US official response to Moghaddam’s specific remarks was identified in the reports reviewed by The Jerusalem Post at the time of publication. Reuters coverage on Friday focused on the broader US-Iran escalation, including President Trump’s warning that Iran must make a deal within 10 to 15 days and Tehran’s threats to retaliate against US bases in the region if attacked.

Brother tracked down sister swept up in Utah avalanche but wasn’t able to save her
11-year-old girl died in the hospital, police say

The brother of an 11-year-old girl who was trapped in a backcountry avalanche in Utah was able to locate his sister, but she later died in the hospital after her rescue, according to officials.
Madelyn Eitas and her family were skiing outside the boundaries of Brighton Ski Resort, about 25 miles east of Salt Lake City, when an avalanche struck in the early afternoon Thursday.
About 20 strangers joined Wasatch Backcountry Rescue and the Unified Police Department and Fire Authority of Greater Salt Lake in the resulting search.
“Her brother, Cameron Eitas, heroically used an application to locate her,” police said in a statement. “Numerous agencies responded and worked together in an urgent and coordinated effort to care for the victim in attempts to provide life-saving measures.”
Due to safety concerns in the area, air rescue was not possible, and Madelyn Eitas, who hails from Rochester, Massachusetts, was eventually taken by ambulance to a local hospital.
“Despite the tremendous and exhaustive efforts of family, first responders and hospital medical staff, the victim tragically passed away,” the police department said.
"She was sweet and sassy, always laughing and dancing," her mother, Becky Eitas, told WCVB. "She loved her family and friends and her big brother so much."
“This is devastating news for our school community,” Old Rochester Regional School District said in a statement to the outlet. “We offer our sincere condolences to the student's family, friends, classmates, and teachers during this unimaginable time.”
Skiers Maggie and Harrison Garner assisted in the search.
“It was kind of just like a surreal thing,” Maggie Garner, a student at Utah Valley University, told KSLTV. “We were like, ‘What’s even really happening right now?’”
“It was just scary and crazy,” Harrison Garner, a junior at Bingham High School, added.
Thursday’s avalanche followed news that two people died in a separate avalanche while snowmobiling in the region.
Authorities continue to warn of high avalanche danger in the mountains outside Salt Lake City following heavy snows throughout the week.
“The avalanche danger is CONSIDERABLE, and today is NOT the day to be in steep avalanche terrain,” according to a Saturday forecast from the Utah Avalanche Center. “That means staying off of — and out from under — slopes steeper than 30 degrees. Large, destructive, and potentially deadly slab avalanches are likely.
“This week’s heavy snowfall and strong winds overloaded preexisting weak layers, creating a HIGH avalanche danger across the entire state.”
Officials in California and Nevada are also sorting through the aftermath of a deadly backcountry avalanche.
Search crews have finished recovering all nine bodies of the people killed in an avalanche on Castle Peak near Lake Tahoe, officials announced Saturday. The incident is California’s deadliest known avalanche.

Trump approves disaster assistance to DC to help with sewage spill into Potomac River
President Donald Trump has approved emergency assistance to Washington, D.C., to help the city address a sewage system leak that dumped at least 250 million gallons of raw sewage into the Potomac River
- Bookmark
President Donald Trump has approved emergency assistance to Washington, D.C., to help the city address a sewage system leak that dumped at least 250 million gallons of raw sewage into the Potomac River.
The Federal Emergency Management Agency announced Trump's approval on Saturday, allowing FEMA to provide equipment and resources to help with the response to the Jan. 19 spill after a pipeline ruptured.
D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser had requested the federal help on Wednesday and declared an emergency.
Trump's approval of the disaster relief request comes after he criticized the handling of the spill, blaming local Democratic leaders and focusing especially on Maryland's Democratic Gov. Wes Moore.
He said in his social media posts criticizing the response that local officials had not asked for emergency help and he intended to step in.
However, the federal government was already involved in the repair and assessing the impact of the leak through the Environmental Protection Agency.
The 72-inch (183 centimeter) pipeline, known as the Potomac Interceptor, burst on Jan. 19, sending 250 million gallons of untreated sewage into the Potomac River just north of Washington in the first five days.
The leak is largely under control, but it could take months to repair the pipe fully. The local water utility, DC Water, along with the EPA, has been working to repair the leak and monitor the impact on the river.
Officials have said the area's drinking water is safe, but people who use the Potomac River for recreation are being cautioned not to have direct contact with the water.

Trump ‘could kill ayatollah’s son and senior mullahs to topple Iranian regime’

Trump ‘could kill ayatollah’s son and senior mullahs to topple Iranian regime’
Updated ,first published
Donald Trump is considering plans to assassinate the son of Ayatollah Ali Khamenei among the military options for a strike on Iran.
The US president has reportedly been presented with a decapitation campaign against the leadership of the Islamic Republic. Mojtaba Khamenei is on the list alongside his father.
The supreme leader’s 55-year-old son had been thought his most likely successor, benefiting from close ties to the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corp, a powerful branch of the armed forces that has been designated a terrorist entity by the United States.
Mojtaba also served in the Iran-Iraq war and studied theology in the holy city of Qom, meeting the constitutional requirement for clerical training.
Trump had not yet decided on whether to strike Iran, Axios news website reported. He could allow a deal that permits the regime to continue with “token” nuclear enrichment, as long as it has no path to an atomic bomb.
But should negotiations over Iran’s nuclear enrichment program fail, among the options under consideration is a dramatic assassination campaign that would aim at wholesale regime change.
“They have something for every scenario. One scenario takes out the ayatollah and his son and the mullahs,” a senior US official told Axios.
The US has dispatched more than one-third of its navy towards Iran and assembled the largest amount of air power in the Middle East since the 2003 invasion of Iraq.
Analysts have pointed to the deployment of more than two-thirds of the available E-3 Sentry fleet as one sign that Trump is prepared to launch military action, with the radars of the reconnaissance aircraft needed to track and direct the interception of incoming missiles.
On Friday (US time), Trump confirmed he was considering a “limited” strike on Iran in an attempt to pressure the regime into making a nuclear deal.
In theory, that strike would display US power but fall below the threshold for provoking a serious response from Tehran. But the risks of a spiralling conflict are self-evident.
The White House’s openness to Iran continuing a scaled-back enrichment program, as confirmed by a senior US official cited by Axios, could create room for a deal and avert war in the Middle East.
However, the outlet noted that any nuclear proposal from Iran would have to meet a very high bar to persuade sceptics within the Trump administration that military action was not needed.
It remains unclear how “token” enrichment would be defined, and what supervision would be in place to ensure Iranian compliance. Iran does not have a strong track record of allowing UN nuclear inspectors to monitor activities.
The senior US official said: “[Trump] will be ready to accept a deal that would be substantive and that he can sell politically at home.
“If the Iranians want to prevent an attack, they should give us an offer we can’t refuse. The Iranians keep missing the window. If they play games, there won’t be a lot of patience.”
On Thursday, Trump said he would give Iran “10 to 15 days” to come to a deal.
The world’s largest aircraft carrier, the USS Gerald Ford, entered the Mediterranean Sea on Friday and will arrive in range of Iran within the timeframe of 10 to 15 days.
Two Israeli officials said they believed the gaps between Washington and Tehran were unbridgeable and the chances of a military escalation were high.
Israel’s government is making preparations for possible joint military action with the US. However, no decision had been made on whether to carry out such an operation, a source familiar with the planning told Reuters.
It would be the second time the US and Israel have attacked Iran in less than a year, following air strikes against military and nuclear facilities in June. Regional officials said oil-producing Gulf countries were preparing for a possible military confrontation that they feared could spin out of control and further destabilise the Middle East.
Some said Tehran was dangerously miscalculating by holding out for concessions, while Trump was boxed in by the build-up of military assets.
They feared he would be unable to scale it back without losing face unless there was a firm commitment from Iran to abandon its nuclear weapons ambitions.
Earlier this week, the US began moving some personnel out of the Middle East to prepare for potential counter-attacks by Iran if Washington strikes Tehran in the coming days.
At least 20 anti-regime protests were held in Iran on Friday at memorials to mark the end of the traditional 40-day mourning period for protesters killed by security forces.
Thousands of demonstrators were killed after taking to the streets over economic woes and a lack of water in Tehran. The violence is what first prompted Trump to make his latest threats of retaliation against the Iranian regime.

Democrats’ fear rising that too many candidates in governor’s race could lead to a Republican victory
-
Click here to listen to this article - Share via
- California Democrats worry their crowded governor’s race could allow two Republicans to advance to the general election under the state’s unique primary system.
- With nine Democratic candidates splitting votes, Republicans Steve Hilton and Chad Bianco currently lead polls.
- Some Democratic candidates resisted calls to exit the race, arguing the field remains wide open and the party should trust voters to decide.
SAN FRANCISCO — Leaders of the California Democratic Party, along with liberal activists and loyal power brokers, are openly expressing fear that their crowded field of candidates running for governor may splinter the vote and open the door to a surprise Republican victory in November.
Because of those concerns, the Democrats lagging at the bottom of the pack are being urged to drop out of the race to ensure that the party’s political dominance in statewide elections survives the 2026 election.
“California Democrats are prepared to do what’s required,” state party chairman Rusty Hicks told reporters at the California Democratic Party’s annual convention on Friday. “We are ready and willing and able to do what’s required … to ensure we have a strong candidate coming out of the primary to do what’s required in November.”
Nine prominent Democrats are running to replace termed-out Gov. Gavin Newsom, compared with two top GOP candidates, and could divide the Democratic electorate enough that the two Republicans could receive the most votes in the June primary and advance to the November election. Under California’s “jungle primary” system, the top two vote-getters advance to the general election, regardless of their party affiliation.
Hicks was deferential to the Democratic candidates who have long served in public office and have compelling personal tales and the experience to take the helm of the state. But he said there is the harsh political reality that a viable candidate needs to raise an enormous amount of money to have a winning campaign in a state of 23.1 million registered voters and some of the most expensive media markets in the nation.
The party, its allies and the candidates themselves have a “collective commitment to ensuring we do not see a Republican elected [for governor],” Hicks said.
While Hicks and other party leaders did not publicly name the candidates who ought to leave the race, among the candidates lagging in the polls are state Supt. of Public Instruction Tony Thurmond, former state Controller Betty Yee, former Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa and former Assembly Majority Leader Ian Calderon.
The wide-open race to succeed Gavin Newsom as California governor has attracted a large and diverse field of candidates.
Democratic voters vastly outnumber the number of registered Republicans in the state, and no Republican has been elected to statewide office since 2006.
But given the sprawling field of gubernatorial candidates, the lack of a clear front-runner and the state’s unique primary system, the race appears up for grabs. According to an average of the most recent opinion polls, conservative commentator Steve Hilton and Riverside County Sheriff Chad Bianco — both Republicans — are tied for first place, according to Real Clear Politics. Each received the support of 15.5% of voters. The top Democrat, Rep. Eric Swalwell of Dublin, Calif., was backed by 12.5%.
In 2012, Republicans finished in first and second place in the race for a San Bernardino County congressional district — despite Democrats having a solid edge in voter registration. The four Democrats running for the seat split the vote, opening the door for a victory by GOP Rep. Gary Miller. Pete Aguilar, one of the Democrats who lost in the primary, went on to win that seat in 2014 and has served in Congress ever since.
Former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-San Francisco) on Friday pushed back at the fears that two Republicans will win the top two gubernatorial spots in June.
“That’s not going to happen,” she said in an interview after speaking at a young Democrats’ reception. “And everything that you should know about the Democrats this year is we are unified. As I say, our diversity is our strength, our unity is our power. And everybody knows that there’s too much at stake.”
However, the scenario has prompted a cross section of the typically fractious party to unite behind the belief the field must shrink, whether by candidates’ choice or through pressure.
Jodi Hicks, the leader of Planned Parenthood’s California operations, said that the organization is laser-focused on congressional races, but having two Republican gubernatorial candidates “would be nothing short of devastating.”
“We have not weighed in on the governor’s race, but we are paying close attention to whether this comes to play, and whether or not we do decide to weigh in and make sure that doesn’t happen,” she said.
Newsom and legislative Democrats have tried to buffer the massive federal funding cuts to reproductive care. A November election with two Republicans on the gubernatorial ballot would eliminate a key partner in Sacramento, and could affect turnout in down-ballot congressional and legislative races.
“A top-two Republican [race] would certainly have dire consequences for the midterm battle and to the governor’s office,” Jodi Hicks said.
Lorena Gonzalez, the leader of California Federation of Labor Unions, noted that her organization’s endorsement process begins on Tuesday.
“I think we are going to have some pretty honest discussions with candidates about their individual paths and where they are,” she said. “They’re all great candidates, so many of them are really good folks. But it’s starting to get to be that time.”
She expects the field to begin to thin in the coming days and weeks.
The conversation went beyond party leaders, taking place among delegates such as Gregory Hutchins, an academic labor researcher from Riverside.
“My goal at the convention, it’s not necessarily that the party coalesces around one particular candidate, but more, this is a test to see what candidates have a level of support that they can mount a successful campaign,” said the 29-year-old, who said he hopes to see some candidates drop out after the weekend.
“Am I concerned long term that [a top-two Republican runoff] could be a thing? Yes and no,” he said. “I’m not concerned that we’re not going to solve this problem before the primary, but I do think we need to start getting serious about, ‘We need to solve this problem soon.’”
Not everyone agreed.
Tim Paulson, a San Francisco Democrat who supports Yee, called efforts to push people out of the race “preemptive disqualification.”
“This is nothing but scare tactics to get people out of the race,” he said. “This is still a vibrant primary. Nobody knows who the front-runner is yet.”
Bob Galemmo, 71, countered that many people did not believe Donald Trump would be elected president in 2016 and fears two Republicans could advance to the general election.
“You should never say never,” he said. “If we could get down to like four or five [candidates], that would be helpful.”
The efforts have already begun.
RL Miller, the chair of the state Democratic Party’s environmental caucus, said Yee ought to drop out.
Yee, “who is at the bottom of the polls, needs to be taking a good long look at whether she is serving the party or being selfish by staying in the race,” Miller said.
Yee, a former state party vice chair, pushed back forcefully, saying pressure to drop out of the race “would just be undemocratic.”
“First of all, I’ve served this party for a long time. I don’t do it out of selfishness, by any means,” she said at a Saturday gathering where she provided breakfast burritos to delegates. “But I’ll just say this — the race is wide open.”
Yee‘s campaign manager noted that the largest group of voters is still undecided, and the candidate said no one has asked her directly to exit the race, but that someone started a rumor a month or two ago that she was going to drop out and run for insurance commissioner instead.
“I’m not dropping out, and I don’t think any candidate should go out,” Yee said.
Calderon said Swalwell had urged him to get out of the race.
Calderon defended staying in the race to try to reach undecided voters during a gubernatorial forum at the Commonwealth Club on Friday.
“I stay very consistent in that 1 to 3% range,” he joked. “But my challenge is access to resources and visibility, which is something that could change within a day with the right backing and support.”
Swalwell denied asking Calderon to leave the race.
“I never said that,” Swalwell said in an interview at a Saturday evening dinner honoring Pelosi. “I’ve enjoyed being on the trail with him, and it’s every candidate’s decision to make about their own direction.”

Red Crescent claims settlers raided West Bank compound, shot 2 Palestinians
Woman from Abu Hamam says attackers beat her, robbed homes; man and 2 teens said hit by IDF gunfire following separate clash with settlers
The Palestinian Red Crescent Society claimed Saturday that two Palestinians were wounded in a settler attack near the central West Bank town of al-Mughayyir, and that three more — a young man who was seriously injured as well as two minors — were hit by IDF gunfire in the northern West Bank’s Beit Furik following an earlier clash with settlers.
The IDF did not immediately respond to requests for comment on either incident.
According to the Red Crescent, two young men were rushed to the hospital from al-Mughayyir on Saturday afternoon after allegedly being shot by settlers who stormed the small compound of Abu Hamam, on the outskirts of the Ramallah-area town.
Speaking to the Hamas-affiliated Quds News Network, a young woman from Abu Hamam claimed a settler named Moshe punched her in the face, knocked her to the ground and kicked her as her small daughter was by her side.
“They were beating us and shooting us,” she said. “I hid my father behind me. I said, let them beat me and not him.”
In separate footage she filmed from the compound, the same woman said the settlers robbed homes there. “They left nothing,” she said. “But thank God, we’re okay.”

Settlers also reportedly set fire to at least one agricultural structure in the nearby village of Abu Falah.
Footage published by Palestinian outlets showed the roadside village in flames. No injuries were reported.

Separately, the Red Crescent said a 20-year-old man was hospitalized in serious condition Saturday evening after being shot in the head by IDF troops in the Palestinian village of Beit Furik, east of Nablus in the northern West Bank.
A 16-year-old was also hospitalized after being shot in the leg, the Red Crescent claimed.
According to Palestinian media, the two were shot amid IDF operations in the village following a clash between locals and settlers on the outskirts of Beit Furik earlier in the day.
During the operation, soldiers reportedly detained several Palestinians and also fired at a car, wounding a teenage boy, who was also hospitalized. The Red Crescent confirmed at the time that it was treating a 14-year-old in Beit Furik for bullet wounds.
Settler attacks have spiked since the Hamas-led onslaught of October 7, 2023, that sparked the war in Gaza. On Wednesday, settlers attacked the Palestinian town of Mukhmas, some 15 kilometers (nine miles) south of al-Mughayyir, and shot three people, one of whom later died of his wounds, according to the Palestinian Authority.

Willie Colón, architect of urban salsa music, dies at 75
Willie Colón, architect of urban salsa music, dies at 75
Willie Colón, the Grammy-nominated architect of urban salsa music and social activist, died Saturday. He was 75.
Over his decades-long career, the trombonist, composer, arranger and singer produced more than 40 albums that sold more than 30 million copies worldwide. He collaborated with a wide range of artists, including the Fania All Stars, David Byrne and Celia Cruz.
His celebrated collaboration with Rubén Blades, “Siembra,” became one of the bestselling salsa albums of all time, and the pair were known for addressing social issues through the genre.
Colón’s family and manager confirmed his death through social media posts.
“Willie didn’t just change salsa; he expanded it, politicized it, clothed it in urban chronicles, and took it to stages where it hadn’t been heard before,” manager Pietro Carlos wrote. “His trombone was the voice of the people, an echo of the Caribbean in New York, a bridge between two cultures.”
Colón, who was nominated for 10 Grammys and one Latin Grammy, made famous songs such as “El gran varón,” “Sin poderte hablar,” “Casanova,” “Amor verdad” and “Oh, qué será.”
Blades said on the social platform X that he confirmed “what I was reluctant to believe” and offered his condolences to Colón’s family.
The path to the trombone — and fame
Born in New York’s Bronx borough, Colón was raised by his grandmother and aunt, who from a young age nurtured him with traditional Puerto Rican music and the typical rhythms of the Latin American repertoire, including Cuban son and tango.
At age 11 he ventured into the world of music, first with flute, then bugle, trumpet and finally trombone, with which he stood out in the then-nascent genre of salsa.
His interest in trombone arose after hearing Barry Rogers playing it on “Dolores,” Mon Rivera’s song with Joe Cotto.
“It sounded like an elephant, a lion ... an animal. Something so different that, as soon as I heard it, I said to myself: ‘I want to play that instrument,’” he recalled in an interview published in the Colombian newspaper El Tiempo in 2011.
At 17 he joined the group of artists that formed the famous record label Fania Records, led and created by Jerry Masucci and Johnny Pacheco. Fania was largely responsible for the new sound that was produced in the Latin world of New York and would later be called “salsa.”
Colón’s main characteristic as a musician was the fusion of rhythms, as he harmonized jazz, rock, funk, soul and R&B with the old Latin school of Cuban son, cha-cha-cha, mambo and guaracha, adding the nostalgia of the traditional Puerto Rican sound that encompasses jíbara, bomba and plena music.
In 2004 the Latin Recording Academy awarded Colón a special Grammy for his career and contributions to music.
Community leader and activist
As a community leader, Colón fought for civil rights, mostly in the United States. He was part of the Hispanic Arts Association, the Latino Commission on AIDS, the Arthur Schomburg Coalition for a Better New York and the Congressional Hispanic Caucus Institute, among others.
In 1991 he was honored with the Chubb fellowship from Yale University, a public service recognition also awarded to the likes of John F. Kennedy, Moshe Dayan, the Rev. Jesse Jackson and Ronald Reagan, among others.
In the political arena, he served as special assistant to David Dinkins, New York’s first Black mayor, and was later appointed special assistant and adviser to Mayor Michael Bloomberg.
Colón had little luck running for public office himself, however. He failed in a challenge to then-U.S. Rep. Eliot Engel in the 1994 Democratic primary, and in 2001 came in third in the Democratic primary for New York’s public advocate.
He backed Hillary Clinton’s presidential campaign in 2008, but he told the Observer that he voted for Donald Trump in 2016.
Colón had public clashes with artists and politicians. His friendship with Blades ruptured after Colón sued for breach of contract over the 2003 concert “Siembra ... 25 years later,” held in Puerto Rico. He also sparked a controversy when he called the then-president of Venezuela, Hugo Chávez, “rotten” on a social network.
Colón acted in films such as “Vigilante,” “The Last Fight” and “It Could Happen to You,” and on TV in “Miami Vice” and “Demasiado Corazón.” More recently he appeared in Bad Bunny’s music video for “NuevaYol.”
He is survived by his wife and four sons.

I am tired of Tucker Carlson’s Israel show, when Mike Huckabee deserves focus - comment

Everyone is talking about Tucker Carlson. I get it.
He’s a genius of the attention economy, a man who turned provocation into a career and the airport lounge into a geopolitical stage. Candace Owens runs the same playbook. They’re performers. And they’re increasingly beside the point.
US Ambassador Mike Huckabee sat across from Carlson at Ben-Gurion Airport and did something nobody seems to want to talk about. He made an argument. A real one. Patient, specific, grounded, the kind you can actually follow from beginning to end.
But first, I have a confession to make: “Christian Zionism” entered my working vocabulary embarrassingly late.
For years, the phrase lived somewhere in the back of my mind as a sociological curiosity, somewhere between a footnote and a conference panel I’d skip. Then October 7 happened, and the footnotes started mattering.
American Christians care about Jewish survival
While Jewish intellectuals were busy being nuanced, millions of American Christians were busy actually caring about Jewish survival. Not abstractly. Practically. Showing up.
Huckabee is one of them. He’s also, it turns out, quite good at explaining why.
He defined Zionism simply: Jews have a right to a homeland where they can live with security and safety. He defined a Christian Zionist as someone who believes Israel has a right to exist. You might find that modest. I find it clarifying.
When the baseline has drifted so far that stating Israel’s right to exist reads as a controversial position, saying it plainly and without embarrassment is its own kind of act.
When Carlson tried to steer the conversation toward his usual grievance tour, Huckabee said early on that he wanted them to “talk to each other and not about each other.”
That’s such a small sentence, and it did so much work. He’d decided before the cameras rolled that he was there to persuade, and he spent the whole interview doing exactly that.
When Carlson insinuated that supporting Israel creates some kind of conflict of interest for an American diplomat, Huckabee looked down at his lapel. “What flag am I wearing here? It’s my flag. It’s who I serve.”
The argument that pro-Israel Americans are somehow disloyal to their own country is one of the uglier ideas making the rounds right now, on the MAGA Right and the campus Left simultaneously, which tells you something, and Huckabee cut through it without raising his voice.
On the money, he was equally clear. American military assistance to Israel cycles back through American defense procurement. It buys an ally in one of the world’s most dangerous neighborhoods. Israel is, he said, “the tip of the spear.”
Argue with the metaphor if you want. The underlying point holds: this alliance has a strategic logic that would cost far more to replace than it costs to maintain. He wasn’t asking anyone for charity. He was describing how deterrence works.
On Iran, he said what the situation actually requires saying: that a regime that has spent decades chanting “Death to America” should probably be taken at its word.
Here’s what got me interested in this conversation: When Carlson raised the harassment of Christians in Israel, and it does happen, it’s a real problem, responsible people acknowledge it, Huckabee didn’t change the subject.
He called it what it is. Spitting on Christians comes from “an evil heart,” he said, and “they should go to jail here.” That’s how a real friend talks. Holding an ally to its own values because you believe it can actually meet them.
He also mentioned, almost as an aside, that he’d made over a hundred trips to Israel across several decades. That he goes to church every Sunday. That he plays bass guitar in his church band. That he’s never been bothered for being a Christian there. Carlson flew in, stayed in the terminal, flew out, and made content. Huckabee has spent 30 years building familiarity with a place.
At the end, he invited Carlson back. Come see more. Come to church with me. See that Christians are pretty free here. It was the tone of someone with nothing to hide, a host, not a supplicant.
I know the temptation among Jews and Israelis right now is toward a certain wariness about Christian support. After watching institutions they trusted dissolve over the past two years, suspicion feels like the grown-up position. I understand it.
But Huckabee sat in that airport and made the full case, strategically, morally, personally, when making it cost something. He didn’t flinch, didn’t deflect, didn’t reach for the easy answer.
Carlson will keep generating headlines. He always does. But Huckabee made the argument, and arguments have a longer half-life than clips.
The least we can do is pay attention and thank Huckabee for speaking the truth of sane Judeo-Christian values.

Former UK PM Boris Johnson says UK should immediately send non-combat troops to Ukraine
Speaking ahead of the fourth anniversary of Russia’s full-scale invasion, Mr Johnson told the BBC that these troops should be stationed in peaceful regions

Former prime minister Boris Johnson has called for troops from the UK and Europe to be deployed immediately to Ukraine.
Mr Johnson said non-combat forces should be stationed in peaceful regions to send a firm message to Russian president Vladimir Putin otherwise the Russian leader would “keep going” with the conflict.
Speaking ahead of the four-year anniversary of the invasion, the former politician told BBC’s Laura Kuenssberg that Ukraine’s allies had been “too slow” to respond.
“We've always delayed needlessly,” he said. “We've then ended up giving the Ukrainians what they have been asking for, and actually it's always served to their advantage and to the disadvantage of Putin. I mean, the one person who suffers from escalation is Putin.”
In the comments, which are set to air on Sunday, Mr Johnson said that he saw no reason why military action could not be taken to support Ukraine during wartime if security guarantees were promised in the event of a ceasefire.
“If we are willing to do it in the context of a ceasefire, which of course puts all the initiative, all the power, in Putin’s hands, why not do it now?’” he questioned.
“There is no logical reason that I can see why we shouldn’t send peaceful ground forces there to show our support, our constitutional support for a free, independent Ukraine.”
Military strategists and commentators have suggested that such a move could be interpreted by Russia as an escalation. Putin has previously remarked that Russia is “ready right now” for war if Europe wants it.
Putin rejected Western peacekeeping proposals in September warning that troops deployed to protect Ukraine would be considered “legitimate targets”.
Mr Johnson pushed back on those comments and insisted that Ukraine and its supporters should be able to operate on their own terms not those dictated by Russia.
“It’s about whether Ukraine is a free country or not,” he said. “If it’s a vassal state of Russia, which is what Putin wants, then obviously it’s up to Putin to decide who comes to his country. If it’s not, then it’s up to the Ukrainians.”
Britain’s ministry of defence responded to the comments to reiterate the government’s existing policy, confirming that ongoing work with the “coalition of the willing” would prepare for troop deployment in the event of a ceasefire.
“The multinational force Ukraine under UK leadership will secure peace for the long term, with the Prime Minister being clear that we will put British troops on the ground following the end of hostilities,” the ministry said in a statement.
Mr Johnson also blamed Western failures for the invasion citing a lack of support for Ukraine after the invasion of Crimea in 2014, a chaotic US withdrawal from Afghanistan and delays in punishing Bashar al-Assad for the use of chemical weapons in Syria.
“I think Putin was emboldened by a Western failure in Syria to punish Assad for using chemical weapons,” he said.
“I think Putin was further emboldened in February 2022 by what he’d seen in Afghanistan, and a sort of general sense that the West was on the back foot. He’d seen those appalling pictures of Americans being forced to flee Afghanistan and the UK pulling out as well, and that really did embolden him.”
A Ministry of Defence spokesperson said: “We are proud of UK leadership on Ukraine – supporting the fight today and working to secure the peace tomorrow.
“It’s why this Government is providing the highest ever level of military support, including a recent half-billion-pound air defence package just last week, accelerating £200 million for the UK military to prepare for any Ukraine deployment, and working with over 30 nations through the UK-led coalition of the willing.
“The multinational force Ukraine under UK leadership will secure peace for the long term, with the Prime Minister being clear that we will put British troops on the ground following the end of hostilities.”

Nico O’Reilly double seals key 2-1 win for Man City over Newcastle United
Manchester City’s win cut Arsenal’s lead at the top of the Premier League to two points.
Nico O’Reilly’s first-half brace inspired Manchester City to a vital 2-1 victory over Newcastle United, which turned up the heat on Premier League leaders Arsenal.
City took the lead on Saturday when O’Reilly slammed in a left-footed shot in the 14th minute before Lewis Hall levelled.

O’Reilly headed in Erling Haaland’s cross to restore City’s lead in the 27th minute, and it proved to be the match-winner as Pep Guardiola’s side cut Arsenal’s lead to two points.
Arsenal face north London rivals Tottenham Hotspur on Sunday, knowing that City are now breathing down their necks.
The stuttering form of Arsenal, who drew with the bottom club Wolverhampton Wanderers on Wednesday, opened the door for City, but victory over Newcastle was imperative.
It looked like a formality early on as they overran their visitors, but it was a different story after the break as they nervously held on to the victory.
Nothing illustrated City’s determination more than the sight of goal-machine Haaland working tirelessly back in his own area, blocking shots and making clearing headers.
Newcastle pushed hard for an equaliser, and when the final whistle blew, there was relief around Etihad Stadium. They will now be watching Arsenal’s Sunday derby with added interest.
City were slick at the start and went ahead when a surging Omar Marmoush played in O’Reilly. He could have touched it on for Haaland to his left, but the 20-year-old opted to trust his left foot, and his powerful shot beat Nick Pope.
Newcastle were level soon afterwards, though, as a weak clearance fell to Hall, whose shot took a touch off a City player before beating keeper Gianluigi Donnarumma.
Haaland was not on the scoresheet but showed many other attributes to his game, and it was his measured cross that was met by O’Reilly, who directed his header past Pope.
City were nowhere near as effective as an attacking force after the break, but they defended doggedly when required and were always a threat on the counter-attack.
They now have 56 points from 27 games. Should Arsenal fail to beat Tottenham on Sunday, City will feel they have the title race firmly in their hands.
O’Reilly said he was “over the moon” about the goals and three points.
“The win was the most important thing: close the gap and apply as much pressure as possible,” he told TNT Sports.
“Very happy with the two goals. It is a dream of mine to win [the Premier League].”
Asked if City, unbeaten in eight games, can win the title, he added: “Yeah, definitely. We always believe we can win games.”
Elsewhere on Saturday, Aston Villa’s faint Premier League title hopes suffered a blow as they were held to a 1-1 draw at home to Leeds United, and Chelsea’s top-four ambitions were damaged when they dropped two points against relegation-bound Burnley.
Anton Stach’s stunning 31st-minute free kick past Emiliano Martinez looked like giving Leeds a vital victory at Villa Park, but substitute Tammy Abraham levelled late on.
Chelsea moved above Manchester United into fourth spot on goal difference, but it felt like two points dropped for the second week running as they drew 1-1 with Burnley at home.
Joao Pedro put Chelsea ahead, but the hosts were reduced to 10 men when Wesley Fofana received a second yellow card and Burnley equalised in stoppage time through Zian Flemming.
Brighton’s James Milner broke the Premier League appearance record in their 2-0 win at Brentford.
The 40-year-old former Manchester City and Liverpool player made his 654th appearance to go past Gareth Barry.
West Ham had the opportunity to really put some pressure on Nottingham Forest and Spurs in the relegation battle, but played out a turgid draw with visiting Bournemouth. It was the sixth successive Premier League stalemate between the sides.

Journalists identify more than 186,000 Russian soldiers killed in Ukraine
The information comes from a joint report by the BBC Russian Service, Mediazona, and a team of volunteers, utilizing open data, according to Ukrinform.
Over the past month, the number of confirmed names has increased by almost 20,000, which is a record increase. However, as the study's authors emphasize, the increase in deaths is not related to the current situation on the front lines.
It is noted that the proportion of volunteers among the dead continues to grow: They now account for 33% of confirmed losses. More than half of all identified volunteers have died in the last year and a half.
The methodology for calculating the figures is based on an analysis of public reports, including obituaries, social media posts, and missing-person announcements. The actual number of casualties may be much higher.
According to Ukrinform, based on data from the General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, the total combat losses of Russian troops from February 24, 2022, to February 21, 2026, in the war against Ukraine amount to approximately 1,258,890 soldiers.

Someone was shot outside my building. It feels like a macabre rite of passage

Opinion
Someone was shot outside my building. It feels like a macabre rite of passage
Washington: Hello from a pungent Washington, DC, home of the sewage-filled Potomac River.
A few days ago, I joined an unfortunate club – Australian correspondents in Washington, DC, who have come all too close to a fatal shooting.
I had only been in my new apartment a week when an email lobbed from building management notifying me of an “emerging situation across the street” involving police and emergency services.
The incident occurred at 2.15pm on a Friday, while I was at work. By the time I got home that night, all traces of the emergency had disappeared.
But the next day, I learnt there had been a fatal shooting. The DC Metropolitan Police said the victim was 22-year-old Nehemia Jamaane Williams, a local, who was found inside a car, and died in hospital from his injuries. Police were appealing for information. No arrests had been made.
Welcome to the neighbourhood, I guess. My new place is only a few blocks from where Matthew Cranston, a former Washington correspondent for The Australian Financial Review, witnessed a shooting inside a crowded McDonald’s in September 2022.
And that was just metres from where a 15-year-old boy was shot dead a few months earlier, near the apartment building where my predecessor as North America correspondent, Farrah Tomazin, lived.
Those incidents occurred amid a post-COVID-19 pandemic crime wave that rocked the US capital and many American cities. It is partly why President Donald Trump sent the National Guard into Washington last year, even though rates of violent crime were already falling.
The fatal shooting outside my building – in broad daylight – was the seventh homicide in DC this year. The eighth came a few nights later in the Navy Yard neighbourhood south of Capitol Hill. And yet, there has been a 68 per cent decrease in the number of homicides so far this year compared to last year.
“We have one of the safest cities in the world,” Trump said on Wednesday (Washington time) at an event for Black History Month, as he welcomed to the stage Felicia Cook, whose grandson was killed during a violent encounter in 2017. “Now you can walk down the street, and you have nothing to fear.”
Trump regularly overstates the case with grand statements about how Washington now has “zero” crime, and how once-empty restaurants are now filled to bursting. “You can be with your child, with your loved one, with your lover,” he said last month. “Your lover’s not going to be killed any more, so you can act like a real lover.”
It’s difficult to take those statements seriously when someone’s shot dead on your doorstep. But, broadly speaking, we have to – because violent crime is down dramatically, not just in DC, but around the country.
The Council on Criminal Justice reported homicides were down 21 per cent in 2025 from 2024, based on data from 35 major US cities. That was 922 fewer homicides.
Furthermore, the council said that when national data was reported by the FBI later this year, there was a strong possibility that the murder rate would drop to 4 per 100,000 residents.
“That would be the lowest rate ever recorded in law enforcement or public health data going back to 1900, and would mark the largest single-year percentage drop in the homicide rate on record,” the council said.
The White House chalked this up as a major victory for Trump’s tough-on-crime agenda, compared to what it called Joe Biden’s “defund the police era”.
In reality, violent crime fell across the board, not just in cities where Trump mobilised the National Guard or cracked down on illegal immigrants. Homicides fell 40 per cent in Washington, DC, but they also fell by the same proportion in Denver and Omaha, and by more than 20 per cent in cities from Atlanta to Dallas to New York.
This is all a good thing. Trump may be overstating his contribution to a trend that was already under way when he took office, but he has also rightly seized on the fact that most Americans want and need relief from violent crime.
Of course, a serious attempt to reduce that harm would involve changing the country’s gun laws. But that is not on the cards.
One thing you come to understand quickly in the United States is the complicated nature of attitudes to guns. It’s not just redneck Republicans who cling to their weapons: last week in Washington, my group had a long debate with an otherwise very progressive bartender who was set on her right to bear arms.
DC is much safer than it was last year, and the year before that, and that’s welcome. Thanks, Mr President. But let’s not pretend all is fixed.

We will halve disadvantage gap in schools, ministers say in landmark education reforms
The government will reform how schools get targeted disadvantage funding as part of an attempt to tackle the gap in achievement between pupils from poorer backgrounds compared with their more affluent peers

Ministers will set a target to halve the disadvantage gap by the time children born under this government finish secondary school, as part of a plan to improve the education system in England.
To tackle the achievement gap between pupils from poorer backgrounds and their more affluent peers, the government will reform how schools get targeted disadvantage funding.
The Schools White Paper, set to be published in full on Monday, will also set out two new programmes to tackle the performance of disadvantaged pupils locally in the North East and on the coast.
It comes after details of the special educational needs and disabilities (Send) reforms also forming part of the white paper were leaked on Thursday.
It has been reported that from 2029, EHCPs (education, health and care plan) will be reassessed once children reach the end of primary school, proposals which sparked concern from disability charity Sense who warned that reassessments could increase instability for children and young people.
An EHCP is a legally binding document in the UK for children and young people with special educational needs or disabilities that require more support than is normally available in school.
The reforms are expected to introduce a plan with legal footing for all children with Send called Individual Support Plans (ISPs).
Speaking about plans to halve the attainment gap, education secretary Bridget Phillipson said: “These reforms are a golden opportunity to cut the link between background and success – one that we must seize.
“Our schools have made great strides in recent decades. Yet for too long, many children in our country have been let down by a one-size-fits-all system, denied opportunity because they’re poor or because they have additional needs.
“Our Schools White Paper presents the blueprint for opportunity for the next generation, with an education system that truly serves every child, whatever their needs and wherever in the country they grow up.”
In the latest GCSE results, the disadvantage gap index for year 11s stood at 3.92, according to figures from the Department for Education (DfE).
It had previously narrowed from 4.07 in 2011 to a low of 3.66 in 2019/20 with some small fluctuations in between. It then widened again post-pandemic to the highest it had been in a decade at 3.94 in 2022/23.
The government will also set a new target for attendance to recover 20 million school days a year by the end of 2028/29 compared with 2023/24.
Instead of targeting disadvantage funding based on whether a child is eligible to receive free school meals (FSM), after a consultation, distribution of funding to schools could take into account how low family income is, how long this has been the case, and the place a child lives.
It would also remove the need for families to choose to take up free school meals to be eligible for deprivation funding, in an attempt to cut admin for schools.
The two new programmes, Mission North East and Mission Coastal – will aim to tackle poorer performance for disadvantaged pupils in the areas, including white working-class pupils.
It will be based on the model of the London Challenge, a programme which was introduced to improve schools in London under the Labour government in 2003.
The White Paper will also set out how incentives worth up to £15,000 for newly appointed headteachers to work in parts of the country that need heads.
It will further include a commitment to develop minimum expectations for schools around how they communicate with parents and manage pupils’ transition from primary to secondary school.
The Schools White Paper was originally set to be published in autumn 2025, but was delayed to allow a further period to test Send reforms.

Ministers to set out plans to halve attainment gap in England’s schools

Plans to halve the attainment gap between the poorest pupils in England and their more affluent peers will be set out by the government on Monday.
The schools white paper will detail proposals to change the criteria under which schools receive funding to support the most disadvantaged students.
Disadvantage funding is now allocated based on how many pupils at a school receive free school meals – generally available to children from families with an annual income of less than £7,400.
Labour wants to broaden this criteria, overhauling the funding formula to give greater weight to funding pupils based on family income.
The policy is likely to shift funding for disadvantage payments away from the annual pupil premium payments given to schools for each child eligible for free school meals.
The white paper will also include controversial proposals for local authorities to be able to administer groups of schools through their own multiacademy trusts, and set new minimum expectations for schools to engage with parents.
The “disadvantage gap is as stark today as it was over a decade ago”, Labour said, with only 44% of children in receipt of free school meals achieving a pass of grade 4 or above in GCSE maths and English. This compares with 70% of children who do not qualify for free school meals, the party added.
Bridget Phillipson, the education secretary, said: “These reforms are a golden opportunity to cut the link between background and success – one that we must seize.
“Our schools have made great strides in recent decades. Yet for too long, many children in our country have been let down by a one-size-fits-all system, denied opportunity because they’re poor or because they have additional needs.
“Our schools white paper presents the blueprint for opportunity for the next generation, with an education system that truly serves every child, whatever their needs and wherever in the country they grow up.”
At present, disadvantage funding for schools costs about £8bn a year. There is no guarantee the pot would be increased to reflect the proposed changes, with government sources saying this would be determined at the next spending review.
Some MPs and campaigners have questioned how effective these proposed reforms will be without more guaranteed funding.
Munira Wilson, the Liberal Democrat education spokesperson, said: “Basing funding on income alone risks hard-wiring regional inequalities into the system.
“Instead of reshuffling a fixed pot of money – risking new cliff edges that will leave struggling families even worse off – ministers must restore the pupil premium to its 2015 real-terms value.
“Starmer must also guarantee that any investment will rise with inflation, so no child is left without the support they need.”
Pepe Di’Iasio, general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, said: “We very much agree with the provision of more targeted funding for schools supporting the most disadvantaged children and have advocated for such a measure for several years.
“However, it is vital that this is done through additional investment into the education system, rather than distributing the same pot of money in a different way, with the risk of creating winners and losers.”
The white paper will also outline plans for two new programmes – Mission North East and Mission Coastal – to tackle the performances of deprived pupils in certain parts of the country. The Guardian understands the precise locations for these initiatives have yet to be decided.
They will be based on the London Challenge, a New Labour project aimed at driving up attainment in secondary schools in the capital that focused on schools working together to share learning and ideas. It was praised by Ofsted for helping to improve educational standards.
The government is also planning a radical overhaul of the special educational needs (Send) system as part of its plans. It plans to give every child with Send an individual support plan.
However, some Labour MPs are thought to be nervous about some of the plans, particularly whether parents will retain the right to appeal if they are unhappy with the level of support their child is receiving.
The white paper was originally due to be published last autumn, but was delayed to allow for further consideration of the Send proposals.
Ministers are also expected to announce new attendance targets in an effort to recover 20m lost school days a year.
It will propose pay rises for newly appointed headteachers to incentivise them to work in parts of the country where the need is greatest. This could be worth up to £15,000 to individual teachers.

Pakistan has said it carried out strikes along the Afghanistan border to target terrorists it blames for recent attacks.
Pakistani forces reportedly carried out air strikes in several areas of eastern and southeastern Afghanistan on Sunday, according to Afghan local media and the Pakistani Ministry of Information.
Islamabad did not say precisely in which areas the strikes were carried out or provide details but cited three terrorist attacks since the start of Ramadan last week in Pakistan as the reason for carrying out the strikes.
In comments before dawn Sunday, Information Minister Attaullah Tarar wrote on X that the military conducted what he described as “intelligence-based, selective operations” against seven camps belonging to Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan, or TTP, and its affiliates.
He said an affiliate of the Daesh group was also targeted in the border region.
In October, Pakistan also conducted strikes deep inside Afghanistan to target terrorist hideouts.
“Pakistan expects and reiterates the Interim Afghan Government to fulfil its obligations and deny use of its soil by Khwarij and terrorists against Pakistan, as the safety and security of people of Pakistan comes first and foremost,” the ministry added.
The strikes came in the aftermath of recent suicide bombing incidents in Pakistan, it said.
“Sources told TOLO News that following the air strikes in Khogyani district, Nangarhar province, Pakistani forces also carried out strikes in the province’s Ghani Khel district, Nangarhar province, and Behsud district, Nangarhar province,” the Afghan news channel TOLO News wrote on X.
Afghanistan vows ‘appropriate, measured response’
The Defence Ministry of Afghanistan said on Sunday it would meet the Pakistani strikes on its soil with an “appropriate and measured response” at a “suitable time.”
The ministry condemned the attacks "in the strongest possible terms" on US social media company X, describing them as a clear violation of national sovereignty, international law, principles of good neighborliness and Islamic values.
It said targeting civilian and religious centres demonstrates the Pakistani military’s intelligence and security shortcomings, and "such repeated acts of aggression will never be able to conceal their internal shortcomings.
Afghan government spokesperson Zabihullah Mujahid posted on X that Pakistan bombed Nangarhar and Paktika provinces but alleged that casualties were civilians, even though he did not specify the number or nature of casualties.
No confirmed information has been released so far regarding possible casualties.
Pakistan vowed to avenge the killing of two security personnel on Saturday in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and the suicide bombing in a mosque in Islamabad two weeks ago, warning that it would not allow any attack launched from Afghanistan to go unanswered.
Pakistan has accused neighbouring Afghanistan of sheltering TTP terrorists and of being responsible for a surge in cross-border attacks, a claim which Afghanistan denied.
The Pakistani government has urged the Afghan government to dismantle the alleged sanctuaries of the TTP terrorist group inside Afghanistan.
According to Pakistani military officials, more than 500 people, including over 311 soldiers, were killed in attacks, largely carried out by the TTP, last year.
Pakistan’s foreign ministry also summoned on Friday an Afghan diplomat over a recent terrorist attack in the northwestern province of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa near the Afghan border that killed 11 soldiers.

5 bodies of migrants washed ashore in east of Libya's capital Tripoli, police officer says

TRIPOLI, Feb 21 - At least five bodies of migrants including two women have been washed ashore in َQasr al-Akhyar, a coastal town in the east of Libya's capital Tripoli, a police officer told Reuters on Saturday.
Hassan Al-Ghawil, head of investigations at the Qasr Al-Akhyar police station, said that according to people in the area, a child's body washed ashore and because of the waves' height the body returned to the sea, and the coast guard was asked to search for it.
Ghawil said the bodies are all dark-skinned people. The bodies were found on Emhamid Al-Sharif shore in the western part of the town by people who reported to the police station.
Libya has become a transit route for migrants fleeing conflict and poverty to Europe across the Mediterranean since the fall in 2011 of dictator Muammar Gaddafi to a NATO-backed uprising. Factional conflict has split the country into western and eastern factions since 2014.
Qasr al-Akhyar is a coastal town some 73 kilometers (45 miles) east of Tripoli.
Pictures were posted on the internet, and also seen by Reuters, showing the bodies of the migrants lying on the shore, where some were still within black inflatable lifebuoys.
"We reported to the Red Crescent to recover the bodies," said Ghawil. "The bodies we found are still intact and we think there are more bodies to wash ashore."
Earlier this month, fifty-three migrants, including two babies, were dead or missing after a rubber boat carrying 55 people capsized off the coast of Zuwara town in western Tripoli, the International Organization for Migration said.
Last week, a U.N. report said migrants in Libya, including young girls, are at risk of being killed, tortured, raped or put into domestic slavery, calling for a moratorium on the return of migrant boats to the country until human rights are ensured. REUTERS

Islamic State claims two attacks on Syrian army, announces ‘new phase’ of operations
Sign up now: Get ST's newsletters delivered to your inbox
Islamic State claimed responsibility on Feb 21 for two attacks targeting Syrian army personnel in northern and eastern Syria, as the militant group signalled what it described as a new phase of operations against the country’s leadership
The militant group said on its Dabiq news agency that it had targeted “an individual of the apostate Syrian regime” in the city of Mayadin in Deir al-Zor province using a pistol, and attacked two other personnel with machine guns in the northern city of Raqqa.
Syria’s Defence Ministry said in a statement that a Syrian army soldier and a civilian were killed on Feb 21 by “unknown assailants.” A military source told Reuters the soldier belonged to the army’s 42nd Division.
The attacks come amid a sharp escalation by ISIS against Syria’s leadership under President Ahmed al-Sharaa, a former al Qaeda leader who broke with the group in 2016 before leading a coalition of Islamist factions that overthrew President Bashar al-Assad at the end of 2024.
On the evening of Feb 21, ISIS released a recorded statement by its spokesperson, Abu Hudhayfa al-Ansari, who said Syria had “moved from Iranian occupation to Turkish-American occupation.”
The group said it had begun a “new phase of operations” in Syria, describing Mr Sharaa as a “watchdog” of the global coalition and vowing that his fate would be no different from that of Mr Assad.
Mr Sharaa signed Syria’s accession to the global coalition
The latest incidents come two days after IS claimed responsibility for another attack in Deir al-Zor that killed a member of the Interior Ministry’s internal security forces and wounded another.
Several social media accounts and Telegram channels supporting ISIS have in recent hours called for intensified attacks using motorcycles and firearms.
ISIS has carried out six attacks against Syrian government targets since the fall of Assad.
A report by the UN Office of Counter-Terrorism released last week said Mr Sharaa and two senior Cabinet ministers had been targeted in five foiled assassination attempts by ISIS. REUTERS

Attacks on Sudan healthcare facilities killed 69 this year
Five attacks on healthcare facilities have killed dozens of people in Sudan since the beginning of the year, the WHO said Saturday, as the war nears the start of its fourth year.
The fighting between Sudan's army and the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces has dismantled an already fragile medical system, with more than a third of facilities currently out of service.
"During the first 50 days of 2026, five attacks on health care have already been recorded in Sudan, killing 69 people and injuring 49," WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus wrote on X.
On Sunday a hospital was targeted in the southeastern state of Sennar, leaving three patients dead and seven people wounded, including an employee, Tedros said.
In three other attacks early this month, more than 30 people were killed when medical centres were targeted in South Kordofan, a vast region south of the capital Khartoum that is currently a focus of the fighting.
The WHO has confirmed at least 206 attacks on healthcare facilities since the start of the war in April 2023, resulting in the deaths of around 2,000 people and injuries to several hundred.
Last year alone, 65 attacks killed more than 1,620 people, accounting for 80 percent of all deaths worldwide linked to attacks on the medical sector, according to the WHO.
Since it broke out, Sudan's civil war has killed tens of thousands of people and forced 11 million to flee their homes, triggering what the UN says is one of the world's worst humanitarian crises.
According to the WHO, the country is facing multiple disease outbreaks, notably cholera, malaria, dengue and measles, in addition to malnutrition.
Some 4.2 million cases of acute malnutrition are expected to arise in Sudan this year, including more than 800,000 cases of severe acute malnutrition, the WHO chief said earlier this month.
Around 33 million people will be left without humanitarian aid in 2026, with the United Nations warning in January that its aid stocks could run out by the end of March.

Venezuela receives more than 1,500 amnesty requests under new law
More than 370 political prisoners have already been granted amnesty under the US-backed legislation.
More than 1,5000 political prisoners in Venezuela have applied for amnesty under a new law that came into effect just a few days ago, according to the head of the country’s legislature.
“A total of 1,557 cases are being addressed immediately, and hundreds of people deprived of their freedom are already being released under the amnesty law”, National Assembly chief Jorge Rodriguez told a news conference on Saturday.

- list 3 of 3IMF warns Venezuela’s economy and humanitarian situation is ‘quite fragile’
Rodriguez’s announcement comes two days after the country’s legislature unanimously adopted a landmark amnesty law.
Amnesty is not automatic under the law: petitioners must ask the court handling their cases.
On Friday, the lawmaker overseeing the amnesty process, Jorge Arreaza, announced that prosecutors had asked courts to free 379 prisoners. They include opposition members, activists, human rights defenders, journalists and many others detained for months or even years.
So far, 80 prisoners have been freed, Rodriguez told the AFP news agency on Saturday. All of those released had been detained in the capital, Caracas, he said, without offering further details.
Further releases could be granted within 15 days, said Arreaza.
Venezuela’s interim president, Delcy Rodriguez, the sister of the top lawmaker, pushed for the United States-backed legislation after she rose to power following the US’s abduction of leftist leader Nicolas Maduro during a military raid on January 3.
The legislation’s approval marked a reversal for Venezuelan authorities, who have for decades denied holding political prisoners and say those jailed have committed crimes.
During its signing, Rodriguez said the law showed that the country’s political leaders were “letting go of a little intolerance and opening new avenues for politics in Venezuela”.
However, opposition figures have criticised the new legislation, which appears to include carve-outs for some offences previously used by authorities to target Maduro’s political opponents.
Human rights organisations are also calling for the law to be applied to all prisoners held for political reasons, even if they are not listed among the beneficiaries.
“It is discriminatory and unconstitutional to exclude imprisoned military personnel and persecuted political figures,” Alfredo Romero, president of rights group Foro Penal, said on X Saturday. Without this, “there can be no talk of national coexistence”.
The law explicitly does not apply to those prosecuted for “promoting” or “facilitating… armed or forceful actions” against Venezuela’s sovereignty by foreign actors.
Delcy Rodriguez has levelled such accusations against opposition leader and Nobel peace laureate Maria Corina Machado, who hopes, at some point, to return to Venezuela from the US.
Opposition politician Juan Pablo Guanipa, a close ally of Machado, had a house arrest order against him lifted, his brother, lawmaker Tomas Guanipa, told the Reuters news agency late on Thursday.
The law also excludes members of the security forces convicted of “terrorism”-related activities.
But the amnesty extends to 11,000 political prisoners who, over nearly three decades, were paroled or placed under house arrest.
“The law provides for those substitute measures to be lifted so that these people can enjoy full freedom”, Rodriguez told reporters.
Outside a national police facility in Caracas known as Zone 7, relatives – some of whom have been on site for weeks – waited patiently.
“Let’s hope it’s true,” Genesis Rojas told AFP.
A group of relatives who have been camped out for days chanted: “We want to go home!”
Hundreds have already been granted conditional release by Rodriguez’s government since the deadly US raid that resulted in Maduro’s capture.
Maduro and his wife are in US custody awaiting trial. He has pleaded not guilty to drug trafficking charges and declared that he was a “prisoner of war.”

Finland secured Olympic bronze in men’s ice hockey with a 6–1 victory over Slovakia in Saturday’s medal match, sealing the country’s eighth Olympic medal in the sport.
The win marked Finland’s fifth bronze and continued a run of podium finishes in tournaments featuring NHL players. In six such Olympic events, Finland have claimed five medals.
The teams had met in the opening group match, when Slovakia won 4–1. This time Finland controlled the decisive stages and scored four times in the third period to settle the contest.
Sebastian Aho opened the scoring at 7:27 of the first period, finishing a play set up by Artturi Lehkonen and Miro Heiskanen. Finland led 1–0 after the opening twenty minutes.
Erik Haula doubled the advantage at 28:05 in the second period, assisted by Joel Armia and Eeli Tolvanen. Slovakia responded late in the period when Tomas Tatar scored at 39:30 to cut the deficit to 2–1.
The game turned early in the third period. With Slovakia pressing for an equaliser, Finland earned a power play. Roope Hintz redirected a point shot at 48:27 to restore a two-goal lead. Heiskanen and Tolvanen recorded assists.
Less than a minute later, Kaapo Kakko extended the lead to 4–1 with a wrist shot from space in the slot. Slovakia struggled to recover after conceding twice in quick succession.
Slovakia withdrew goaltender Samuel Hlavaj in the closing minutes in search of a comeback. Armia scored into the empty net at 55:32 after receiving the puck from Hintz. Haula added his second of the night at 58:42, also into an empty net, with Armia and Rasmus Ristolainen providing assists.
Haula finished with two goals. Armia recorded one goal and two assists. Hintz scored once and added an assist. Heiskanen and Tolvanen each contributed two assists.
Juuse Saros made 30 saves for Finland. Hlavaj stopped 29 shots for Slovakia.
Finland captain Mikael Granlund left the ice in the third period after hitting his head against the boards during a shift. He removed his helmet and went to the dressing room following a discussion with medical staff. According to Yle’s live coverage, Granlund later returned to the bench for the post-match handshakes and continued talks with the team doctor.
The bronze medal represents Finland’s first men’s major tournament medal since the 2022 World Championship title. The country previously won Olympic gold in Beijing and silver in Turin in 2006 and Calgary in 1988.
Saturday’s result concludes the men’s tournament at the Milano-Cortina Winter Games weekend with Finland returning home with a place on the podium.

Slovakia Marks 8 Years Since the Murder of Journalist Ján Kuciak and his Fiancée

Reported by
Hundreds of people gathered in Bratislava and other cities across Slovakia on Saturday to mark the eighth anniversary of the killings of investigative reporter Ján Kuciak and his fiancée, Martina Kušnírová, in a case that shook the country but still lacks a final answer about who ordered their deaths.
The murders on Feb. 21, 2018, were carried out by gunman Miroslav Marček, who shot Kuciak twice in the chest and Kušnírová once in the head, while an accomplice, Tomáš Szabó, waited nearby, prosecutors said.
Both men are serving 25-year prison sentences. Authorities say they acted on instructions relayed by intermediary Zoltán Andruskó, who confessed and received a 15-year term.
Yet the central question — who commissioned the assassination — remains unresolved, leaving one of Europe’s most consequential journalist murder cases without closure.
Prosecutors allege that businessman Marian Kočner ordered the killing through an associate, Alena Zsuzsová, who then tasked Andruskó. Courts have twice acquitted Kočner and once convicted Zsuzsová, but each verdict has been overturned on appeal, effectively resetting the case.
The retrial, now underway at the Specialized Criminal Court in Pezinok, follows a ruling last May by the Supreme Court of Slovakia that cited serious flaws in how earlier judges evaluated evidence. The high court said the panel had failed to address key facts and had not followed prior judicial instructions.
The new proceedings, which opened in January and are scheduled to run through December, also include charges tied to alleged plots against prosecutors. Two additional defendants — Dušan Kračina and Darko Dragić — are accused in those cases.
The killings prompted mass demonstrations in 2018 that helped topple a government and reshaped the country’s political landscape. Eight years on, the case remains a symbol of unresolved justice and the risks faced by investigative journalists.
At a commemorative gathering at Freedom Square, Kuciak’s father, Jozef Kuciak, told attendees, according to The Slovak Spectator: “Every day we live with pain; every day we go to the cemetery to light candles instead of raising our grandchildren.”
In a statement, Pavol Szalai of Reporters Without Borders urged judges to “duly examine” all evidence and rule independently, adding, “Europe’s eyes are on Slovakia.”
Roberta Metsola, president of the European Parliament, said the murders had “shaken Europe” and noted they came months after the killing of Daphne Caruana Galizia. “Their courage remains a beacon for journalists across the continent who risk everything to uncover the truth and safeguard our democracies,” she wrote on X.

K-pop’s big freeze: are cracks in China’s cultural blockade a thaw?
A decade-long geopolitical chill has kept South Korean entertainers largely locked out of the Chinese market, but fans find ways to connect
While K-pop has conquered almost every corner of the globe, South Korea’s entertainment industry remains largely locked out of the Chinese market due to a geopolitical chill that has lingered for a decade.
In early January, the Chinese remake of the South Korean television series My Mister – featuring singer-actress IU – was released on the streaming platform Youku. The Chinese version, titled Loving Strangers, starred actors Mark Chao Yu-ting and Zhang Zifeng. Media reports noted that it was the first South Korean drama remake to be publicly distributed in China since the ban began.
Earlier this month, South Korean entertainment company CJ ENM partnered with JYP Entertainment’s Chinese subsidiary and Tencent Music Entertainment to launch Onecead, an artist management and music production company with a focus on the Chinese market.

Crews recover bodies of 9 backcountry skiers days after California avalanche
TRUCKEE, Calif. (AP) — Crews recovered the bodies of nine backcountry skiers who were killed by an avalanche in California’s Sierra Nevada, authorities said Saturday, concluding a harrowing operation that was hindered by intense snowfall.
A search team reached the bodies of eight victims and found one other who had been missing and presumed dead since Tuesday’s avalanche on Castle Peak near Lake Tahoe. The ninth person who was missing was found “relatively close” to the other victims, according to Nevada County Sheriff’s Lt. Dennis Hack, but was impossible to see due to whiteout conditions at that time.
At a news conference, Sheriff Shannon Moon praised the collective efforts of the numerous agencies that helped recover the bodies — from the California Highway Patrol to the National Guard to the Pacific Gas & Electric utility company — and 42 volunteers who helped on the last day of the operation.
“We are fortunate in this mountain community that we are very tight-knit, and our community shows up in times of tragedy,” Moon said.
Victims named
The sheriff named for the first time the three guides from Blackbird Mountain Company who died: Andrew Alissandratos, 34, Nicole Choo, 42, and Michael Henry, 30.
According to biographies on the company’s website, Alissandratos was originally from Tampa, Florida, and moved to Tahoe roughly a decade ago. He enjoyed a wide array of adventure activities, from backcountry exploration to rock climbing.
Henry moved to Colorado in 2016 and then to Truckee three years later. He was described as “laid back” and devoted to sharing his knowledge and love of the mountains with others.
There was no bio for Choo on the website.
“This was an enormous tragedy, and the saddest event our team has ever experienced,” Blackbird Mountain founder Zeb Blais said Wednesday in a statement.
“We are doing what we can to support the families who lost so much,” he said, “and the members of our team who lost treasured friends and colleagues.”
The six other fatal victims were women who were part of a close-knit group of friends who were experienced backcountry skiers and knew how to navigate the Sierra Nevada wilderness, their families said this week.
They were identified as Carrie Atkin, Liz Clabaugh, Danielle Keatley, Kate Morse, Caroline Sekar and Kate Vitt, all in their 40s. They lived in the San Francisco Bay Area, Idaho and the Lake Tahoe area.
“We are devastated beyond words,” the families said in a statement. “Our focus right now is supporting our children through this incredible tragedy and honoring the lives of these extraordinary women. They were all mothers, wives and friends, all of whom connected through the love of the outdoors.”
The families asked for privacy while they grieve and added that they “have many unanswered questions.”
Two of the friends got out alive and were rescued along with four others, including one guide, after Tuesday’s avalanche. Their names have not been released.
Stuck on the mountain for hours
The avalanche struck on the last day of the 15 skiers’ three-day tour, when the group decided to end the trip early to avoid the impending snowstorm. Officials have said the path they took is a “normally traveled route” but declined to specify what that meant.
At around 11:30 a.m. Tuesday, the six survivors called for help, describing a sudden and terrifying slide that was approximately the length of a football field. In the aftermath they discovered the bodies of three fellow skiers, according to Hack.
Rescuers were not able to reach them until roughly six hours after the initial call for help, Hack said, and took two separate paths to arrive. They found five other bodies, leaving only one person unaccounted for.
But it was immediately clear to rescuers that it was too dangerous to extract the bodies at that time due to the heavy snowfall and threat of more avalanches. Those conditions persisted on Wednesday and Thursday.
A breakthrough on Friday
Authorities used two California Highway Patrol helicopters, with the help of Pacific Gas & Electric Company, to break up the snow and intentionally release unstable snowpack to reduce the avalanche risk.
Crews were then able to recover five victims that evening before it got too dark to access the last three.
Rescuers used helicopters and ropes to hoist the last four bodies from the mountain the following morning, fighting through severe winds that forced them to make multiple trips. The bodies were then taken to snowcats — trucks that are outfitted to drive on snow — for further transport.
“We cannot say enough how tremendously sorry we are for the families that have been affected by this avalanche,” Moon said.
Initial reports indicated that at least two of the surviving skiers were not swept away by the avalanche, Hack said. The others were standing separately and relatively close together and were hit.
Hack declined to offer information about what might have set off the avalanche.
Authorities close the area
The terrain will be off-limits to visitors until mid-March, said Chris Feutrier, forest supervisor for the Tahoe National Forest. Officials intended to restore public access once the investigation is complete.
“This is the public’s land, and they love to recreate on it,” Feutrier said. “The Forest Service doesn’t close public land for every hazard or every obstacle. We trust the American people to use their best judgment when recreating.”

Kaillie Humphries Armbruster of U.S. wins record-tying sixth Olympic bobsled medal

Kaillie Humphries Armbruster of U.S. wins record-tying sixth Olympic bobsled medal; Germany's Laura Nolte takes gold
American Kaillie Humphries Armbruster, in perhaps her Olympic bobsled finale, found her way to the medal stand for a record-tying sixth time Saturday in the two-woman bobsled, while Germany's Laura Nolte won gold again.
Nolte is now the back-to-back two-woman Olympic bobsled champion, holding off teammate Lisa Buckwitz to grab gold at the Milan Cortina Games on Saturday night.
Nolte — the winner of the last four World Cup two-woman titles — cemented her status as the sport's current queen, teaming with Deborah Levi to win her second consecutive two-woman gold medal by finishing four runs in 3 minutes, 48.46 seconds.
Buckwitz, with Neele Schuten in her sled, was second in 3:48.99. Humphries Armbruster and Jasmine Jones — two mothers in the same sled for the U.S. — finished third in 3:49.21. It was the sixth Olympic medal for Humphries Armbruster, tying fellow American Elana Meyers Taylor for the most by any woman in the sport's history.
Also for the U.S., Kaysha Love — who has been dealing with a hamstring issue for much of the season and had it flare up again in Italy — and Azaria Hill finished fifth in 3:49.71. Meyers Taylor and Jadin O'Brien, who were doomed by a second-heat skid at the top of the track Friday night, got a few spots back in the standings Saturday and finished tied for seventh in 3:50.49.
Germany now has six bobsled medals in these Olympics, while the U.S. has three and the rest of the world has zero. The divide might get bigger on Sunday in the final sliding event of the Milan Cortina Games; Germany, which already swept the two-man race, is in position to do the same thing in four-man after Saturday's opening two heats of that competition.
And Germany is now up to 17 sliding medals, counting bobsled, skeleton and luge, at Milan Cortina — one more than the rest of the world. Austria has five, the U.S. now has four along with Italy, Britain has two and Latvia has one.
The two-woman race was basically for the bronze going into the final run.
Nolte — who had the lead, albeit a much smaller one, going into the final heat of the monobob competition that Meyers Taylor ended up winning — led Buckwitz by 0.35 seconds going into the last heat. Buckwitz's lead over Humphries Armbruster was 0.19 seconds, and Humphries Armbruster was only 0.09 seconds up on Germany's Kim Kalicki in the race for the bronze.
Kalicki's final time: 3:49.36. It wasn't enough to catch Humphries Armbruster, who hopped out of the sled and wrapped herself and Jones in the American flag, knowing the medal was theirs.
Humphries Armbruster's updated Olympic medal count: three golds, three bronzes.
Meyers Taylor is 41, Humphries Armbruster is 40. Meyers Taylor is a mother of two, Humphries Armbruster has one son, and both women are talking about how they would like to add another baby to their families.
That means Saturday night might have been the last on the Olympic stage for them — and maybe on any sliding stage.
It was the 177th race — counting World Cups, world championships, the short-lived monobob World Series and the Olympics — for Meyers Taylor at the major international level. She has 78 medals from those races, six of them coming in the Olympics, and was a winner either as a driver or pusher in three different decades.
And for Humphries Armbruster, who won three Olympic medals for Canada and now has three more for the U.S., the numbers are even more gaudy: 105 medals in 218 major international races, with 49 of them victories.
If this is the end, for either or for both of them, what a ride it was.

Trump hikes US global tariff rate from 10% to 15%
US President Donald Trump raised the global duty on imports into the United States to 15 per cent on Feb 21, doubling down on his promise to maintain his aggressive tariff policy a day after the Supreme Court ruled much of it illegal.
Mr Trump said on his Truth Social platform that after a thorough review of Feb 20’s “extraordinarily anti-American decision” by the court to rein in his tariff programme, the administration was hiking the import levies “to the fully allowed, and legally tested, 15% level.”
Shortly after the court’s 6-3 ruling that rejected the president’s authority to impose tariffs under a 1977 economic emergency powers act, Mr Trump had initially announced a new 10 percent global levy by invoking a different legal avenue.
At the same time, he launched an extraordinary personal attack on the conservative justices who had sided with the majority, slamming their “disloyalty” and calling them “fools and lap dogs.”
Thousands march in France for slain far-right activist under heavy security
Thousands of people marched in south-eastern France on Feb 21 under heavy security in tribute to a far-right activist whose killing, blamed on the hard left, has put the country on edge.
The crowd – many wearing black and some covering their lower faces with masks – marched through the city of Lyon carrying flowers and placards bearing pictures of Quentin Deranque and the words, “justice for Quentin” and “the extreme left kills”.
The 23-year-old died from head injuries following clashes between radical left and far-right supporters on the sidelines of a demonstration against a politician from the left-wing France Unbowed (LFI) party in Lyon last week.
US citizen shot and killed by federal immigration agent last year, records show
A federal immigration agent shot and killed a US citizen in Texas in March 2025, months before the Trump administration began its deportation surge in Minnesota that led to the shooting deaths of Renee Good and Alex Pretti, according to records released this week.
Mr Ruben Ray Martinez, 23, was killed by agents with the Department of Homeland Security, attorneys for Mr Martinez's family said in a statement.
A DHS agent fired multiple rounds at Mr Martinez, who allegedly hit another DHS agent with his car as the agents assisted local police in South Padre Island, Texas, with traffic control following an accident on March 15, 2025, according to records obtained by American Oversight, a nonprofit watchdog group. The agents were conducting immigration enforcement, the records show.
Political drama Yellow Letters wins Golden Bear at Berlin film festival
Yellow Letters, directed by German filmmaker Ilker Catak, won the Golden Bear for best film at the Berlin Film Festival on Feb 21 in a ceremony reflecting the controversy over Gaza which has dogged 2026’s edition of the event.
A political drama, Catak’s film tells the story of a Turkish director and his actor wife, suddenly barred from working because of their political opinions.
Jury president Wim Wenders called the film “a terrifying premonition, a look into the near future that could possibly happen in our countries as well”.
Chelsea, Aston Villa held in blow to Champions League hopes
Burnley dented Chelsea’s chances of Champions League qualification by snatching a 1-1 draw at Stamford Bridge, while Aston Villa also struck late to salvage a point against Leeds on Feb 21.
The Blues climb into the Premier League’s top four only on goal difference after they paid for failing to build on Joao Pedro’s fourth-minute opener.
Chelsea were dominant until Wesley Fofana was sent off with 18 minutes remaining for a second yellow card.

US ambassador says Israel has right to much of Middle East, sparking uproar
Mike Huckabee’s comments were condemned by Arab and Muslim nations as ‘extremist rhetoric’
Arab and Muslim nations on Saturday sharply condemned comments by the US ambassador to Israel, Mike Huckabee, who said Israel has a right to much of the Middle East.
Huckabee made the comments in an interview with conservative commentator Tucker Carlson that aired on Friday. Carlson said that according to the Bible, the descendants of Abraham would receive land that today would include essentially the entire Middle East, and asked Huckabee if Israel had a right to that land.
Huckabee responded: “It would be fine if they took it all.” Huckabee added, however, that Israel was not looking to expand its territory and has a right to security in the land it legitimately holds.
His comments sparked immediate backlash from neighbouring Egypt and Jordan, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Oman, the Organization of Islamic Cooperation and the League of Arab States.
Saudi Arabia’s foreign ministry described Huckabee’s comments as “extremist rhetoric” and “unacceptable”, and called for the US State Department to clarify its position on them.
Egypt’s foreign ministry called his comments a “blatant violation” of international law, adding that “Israel has no sovereignty over the occupied Palestinian territory or other Arab lands”.

Norwegian star breaks Olympic record with sixth Milano Cortina gold

Johannes Høsflot Klæbo becomes first athlete to win six gold medals at one Winter Olympics
In short:
Norway's Johannes Høsflot Klæbo has become the first athlete to win six gold medals at a single Winter Olympics.
Klæbo passed the previous record of five set by USA's Eric Heiden at the 1980 Lake Placid Games.
Klæbo now has 11 Olympic gold medals, sitting behind only American swim icon Michael Phelps (23) for most ever.
Norway's Johannes Høsflot Klæbo completed his historic gold medal sweep of the men's cross-country skiing events by winning his sixth race and setting the record for the most golds by one athlete in a single Winter Olympics.
Klæbo's victory in the 50-kilometre mass start race shattered the nearly 50-year record set by American speed skater Eric Heiden, who won five golds in the 1980 Lake Placid Olympics.
All of Heiden's wins were in individual races and two of Klæbo's have come in team events, so Heiden's record for individual wins still stands.
"It feels amazing," Klæbo said. "To crown everything here with a 50K, it's unbelievable. In Norway, we say that if you're gonna become a man, you need to win the 50K and today we did, so it's a perfect way to end two perfect weeks."
The solid gold performance matched the feat he accomplished at last year's world championships in Trondheim, Norway, when he won all six events.
Klæbo's teammates, Martin Løwstrøm Nyenget, took silver, and Emil Iversen won bronze in a Norwegian sweep.
The three Norwegians had a lead before the halfway mark and continued to build the gap on their chasers.
Nyenget drove a fast pace, trying the entire race to shake his compatriot, knowing that if he didn't, he'd fall victim to Klæbo's trademark uphill sprint.
Klaebo said he was just trying to hang on and conserve energy for the finish.
Toward the end, Nyenget and Klæbo pushed uphill and dropped Iversen. Klæbo stayed in second waiting to launch his winning move.
As the two reached the final hill, Klæbo ran away from Nyenget.
As he glided toward the finish, he pointed his fingers toward the sky, took one stride across the line, toppled over on his right hip and rolled onto his back. He finished in 2:06:44.8.
Nyenget finished 8.9 seconds later and Iversen was 30.7 seconds behind.
"I went hard from the start, so I managed to get rid of everyone else, but the best," Nyenget said. "So I'm really happy about my performance, but Johannes is the king."
France's Theo Schely finished fourth, nearly three minutes back and Savelii Korostelev, a Russian competing as an individual neutral athlete, finished fifth at 3:38.3 back.
The highest-placed US skier was Gus Schumacher, who won a silver in a team relay, in 13th place.
Five skiers, including Iivo Niskanen of Finland and Harald Oestberg Amundsen of Norway, dropped out of the race and 14 competitors were lapped.
The win extends Klæbo's record for most career Winter Olympic gold medals to 11 over three Games. The previous record had been eight, which Klæbo broke on February 15.
Klæbo has the second-most Olympic golds overall behind only US swimming great Michael Phelps, who has 23.
The win gave Norway a record 18th gold medal and further increased their lead in the total medal count in these games to 40 overall, also a Winter Olympics record, though the 116 medal events this year is more than in the past.
The country set the record on Friday for the most gold medals won by a nation at a single Winter Olympics when biathlete Johannes Dale-Skjevdal won the 15-kilometre mass start race.

Syrian govt takes over management of airport held by Kurds
Syrian authorities have taken over management of Qamishli airport as part of an ongoing process to integrate Kurdish-led forces and institutions into the national government, state media reported Saturday.
The SANA news agency, citing the General Authority of Civil Aviation and Air Transport, said officials had toured the facility on Saturday after assuming control and "discussed mechanisms to restart its operations".
The head of the authority, Omar al-Husari, said on X that taking over the airport was "an important institutional step in the process of unifying the management of airports under the umbrella of the state".
The Kurds - who controlled much of northeast Syria before striking the integration deal under military pressure from the government - had taken over the airport following the fall of longtime ruler Bashar al-Assad just over a year ago.
While it was not open to civilian flights, Russia had used part of the facility as a base before withdrawing last month.
Qamishli is the only airport in northeastern Syria, and for years served as a lifeline for the region's residents, particularly during nearly 14 years of civil war beginning in 2011, during which there were regular flights between it and Damascus.
The airport had remained under the government's control during the war, and continued to receive flights up until Assad's overthrow.
In November 2019, Russian forces turned the airport into a military base to oversee the implementation of an agreement that followed Turkey's large-scale offensive against Kurdish fighters.

Aid to Ukrainians in Poland must be responsible, not chaotic – Marshal of Sejm
This was stated in an interview with Ukrinform by the Marshal of the Polish Sejm, Włodzimierz Czarzasty, commenting on the adoption of a law introducing new rules for the stay of Ukrainian refugees in Poland.
According to Czarzasty, since 2022, Poland has made tremendous efforts: within the framework of Official Development Assistance (ODA), support for Ukraine and its refugees “is measured in billions of zlotys.”
He noted that further decisions will be adapted to the legal situation and to EU-level regulations.
“Our goal is stability, legal residence, and integration for those who work and pay taxes here. Assistance cannot be chaotic; it must be responsible. My compatriots have proven that in a crisis, they know how to open their hearts and embrace friends in need. I would like peace in Ukraine to come as soon as possible. However, we do not know when that will happen, so we must somehow adapt to this dramatic situation,” emphasized the Marshal of the Sejm.
As reported, President of Poland Karol Nawrocki approved the termination of the 2022 special law on aid to Ukrainian citizens who had arrived after the full-scale Russian invasion. Key provisions of that law will be transferred to the law on providing protection for foreigners.
The new law will come into effect on March 5, 2026.
Currently, up to one million Ukrainian war refugees are in Poland.
According to the latest data, a total of 4.35 million people who had to leave Ukraine due to the war hold temporary protection status in the EU. In June 2025, the European Council decided to extend temporary protection for them for one year, starting March 4, 2026.

‘Absurd and provocative’: Huckabee faces firestorm for Israel border stance
Egypt, Jordan, Saudi Arabia and others denounce US ambassador’s remarks suggesting Israel has right to much of the Middle East.
United States Ambassador to Israel Mike Huckabee has triggered an avalanche of criticism from Arab and Muslim countries after suggesting Israel has a right to expand its territory across a large swath of the Middle East.
Huckabee delivered the remarks during a sit-down interview with US commentator Tucker Carlson, broadcast on Friday, as he was pressed about the geographical borders of Israel.

Carlson asked Huckabee, a self-professed Christian Zionist and staunch supporter of Israel, to clarify his stance on the Biblical promise of the land spanning the area between the Euphrates River in Iraq and the Nile River in Egypt to the descendants of Abraham, and if the modern Israeli state had the right to claim that lineage.
“It would be fine if they took it all,” said Huckabee.
Such territory would encompass modern-day Lebanon, Syria, Jordan and parts of Saudi Arabia.
The US ambassador later appeared to walk back the claim, saying it was “somewhat of a hyperbolic statement”. He also said Israel was not looking to expand its territory and has a right to security in the land it currently holds.
‘Extremist rhetoric’
Huckabee’s comments sparked immediate backlash from neighbouring Egypt and Jordan, Saudi Arabia, the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation and the League of Arab States, which in separate statements called them “extremist”, “provocative” and “not in line with Washington’s official position”.
Saudi Arabia’s foreign ministry described Huckabee’s comments as “extremist rhetoric” and “unacceptable”, and called for the US Department of State to provide clarification.
Egypt’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs called the remarks a “blatant violation” of international law, adding that “Israel has no sovereignty over the occupied Palestinian territory or other Arab lands.”
Jordan’s foreign ministry dismissed them as “absurd and provocative,” a violation of diplomatic norms and “an infringement on the sovereignty of states in the region”.
“Statements of this nature — extremist and lacking any sound basis — serve only to inflame sentiments and stir religious and national emotions”, the League of Arab States also said in a statement.
Huckabee, whom US President Donald Trump nominated as ambassador in 2024, has long opposed the idea of a two-state solution for Israel and the Palestinian people, and denied the existence of an illegal Israeli occupation of the West Bank. Back in 2008, Huckabee went so far as to question Palestinian identity altogether, saying, “There’s really no such thing as a Palestinian.”
In 2024, the International Court of Justice ruled that Israel’s occupation of Palestinian territory is illegal and must cease immediately.
But Israeli law does not clearly demarcate the country’s borders. Israel also occupies the Golan Heights in Syria, which it illegally annexed in 1981.
The US is the only country that recognises Israel’s claimed sovereignty over the Syrian territory, and only since 2019, during Trump’s first term as president.
After its 2024 war with Hezbollah, Israel also set up military outposts in five points inside Lebanon.
Some Israeli politicians, including Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, have openly promoted the idea of a “Greater Israel” with expanded borders.

Opinion | Humans vs robots? China begs to disagree
As China embraces humanoid robots, policymakers and companies are expanding the scope of innovation and applications in daily life
Reading Time:3 minutes
Why you can trust SCMP
The 2026 Spring Festival Gala, one of the world’s most-watched television events, featured a dazzling array of humanoid robots. They performed martial arts, executed intricate sword dances and even took part in a comedy skit alongside human celebrities.
While parts of the world still view humanoid robots with a mixture of fear and suspicion, as potential job-stealers or sci-fi villains, China is increasingly embracing them as partners in work, entertainment and daily life. Amid the escalating artificial intelligence (AI) race, China is not just competing on technological prowess but is rapidly outpacing others in its willingness to integrate these machines into public life.
China accounted for 90 per cent of the roughly 13,000 humanoid robots shipped globally last year. The country also represented over half of the humanoid robot exhibitors at the Consumer Electronics Show 2026. This burgeoning ecosystem draws researchers, engineers, entrepreneurs and investors into a fast-growing market.

It is fuelled by a parallel explosion in large language models and multi-modal AI, from ByteDance’s Doubao to the DeepSeek and Qwen models. Such AI models help robots understand user requests, engage in conversation, analyse data and provide useful content. As more robots are deployed in the physical world, the AI models are enhanced by the influx of real-world data, which in turn intensifies competition in large language models themselves and further encourages innovation.
The gala offered a stunning showcase of this progress. Robots from companies like Unitree, Galbot and Noetix ran, danced and performed acrobatics on stage. One might dismiss a backflipping robot, clad in a Monkey King costume, as a spectacle. But the nimbleness of the arms, legs, waist, neck, ankles and fingers shows technological breakthroughs.

Making body components that are flexible requires joint stability, space sensing and navigation, computer vision accuracy and skeleton durability. It demands seamless coordination between what Chinese engineers describe as the robot’s big brain – the higher-level AI for self-learning, planning and decision-making – and its small brain, which handles the movement and motor control needed for everything from walking and running to complex dexterous functions.

Is Iran stalling? Tehran floats flexibility as US signals strike readiness
Unknown

Iran has sent another message to the US through Oman indicating it is prepared to show flexibility on its nuclear program, provided it is allowed to keep its uranium enrichment facilities and centrifuges on its own soil. Under the proposal, the facilities would not be activated until after an interim period and would operate under strict supervision by the International Atomic Energy Agency. Tehran insists the enrichment would be for civilian purposes only.
According to Western sources familiar with the negotiations, the message followed US dissatisfaction with the Iranian proposal presented in Geneva. The new offer is being examined in Washington but is still far from meeting American demands. If Iran does not move closer to those requirements, the US is considering a series of limited strikes to prove the seriousness of the threat.
The same sources said some senior figures in the Iranian regime believe the US will ultimately refrain from attacking, despite the significant concentration of American forces in the region. Limited strikes, they assess, could send a message while avoiding a full scale conflict.
Details obtained by Israel Hayom indicate that part of the Geneva meeting was devoted to what participants described as a US reprimand of the Iranian delegation. Washington accused Tehran of violating its commitment to discuss all issues, including its ballistic missile program and support for its proxy terrorist organizations. Israel Hayom previously revealed that the first round of talks in Oman had been scheduled, in part, on the basis of an Iranian pledge to address those subjects as well.
However, in Oman the Iranian delegation announced it would agree to discuss those issues only after a nuclear agreement was reached and sanctions were lifted. In Geneva, Iranian officials reiterated that position and demanded that any talks on other matters take place without ultimatums and with the participation of regional countries, which they argue are relevant to the discussion. The US team rejected the demand and lodged a strong protest over what it described as a breach of prior understandings. Despite this outcome, Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi issued a positive statement after the meeting, prompting contradictory briefings from US officials.
In Israel, officials assess that Iran will attempt to stall by floating additional proposals on the nuclear issue but will not be able to bridge the gaps with the US. "The spring is coiled, and the readiness of US forces for a full strike is high, but an order to proceed will not be given in the coming days," an Israeli source said.

JPMorgan concedes it closed Trump’s accounts after Jan. 6 attack
NEW YORK (AP) — JPMorgan Chase acknowledged for the first time that it closed the bank accounts of President Donald Trump and several of his businesses in the political and legal aftermath of the Jan. 6, 2021 attacks on the U.S. Capitol, the latest development in a legal saga between the president and the nation’s biggest bank over the issue known as “debanking.”
The acknowledgment came in a court filing submitted this week in Trump’s lawsuit against the bank and its leader, Jamie Dimon. The president sued for $5 billion, alleging that his accounts were closed for political reasons, disrupting his business operations.
“In February 2021, JPMorgan informed Plaintiffs that certain accounts maintained with JPMorgan’s CB and PB would be closed,” JPMorgan’s former chief administrative officer Dan Wilkening wrote in the court filing. The “PB” and “CB” stands for JPMorgan’s private bank and commercial bank.
Until now, JPMorgan has never admitted it closed the president’s accounts in writing after Jan. 6. The bank would only speak hypothetically about when the bank closes accounts and its reasons for closing accounts, citing bank privacy laws.
A spokeswoman for the bank declined to comment beyond what the bank said in its legal filings.
Trump originally sued JPMorgan in Florida state court, where Trump’s primary residence is now located. The filings this week are part of an effort by JPMorgan Chase to have the case both moved from state to federal court and to have the jurisdiction of the case moved to New York, which is where the bank accounts were located and where Trump kept much of his business operations until recently.
Trump originally accused the bank of trade libel and violating state and federal unfair and deceptive trade practices.
In the original lawsuit, Trump said he tried to raise the issue personally with Dimon after the bank sent him notices that JPMorgan would close his accounts, and that Dimon assured Trump he would figure out what was happening. The lawsuit alleges Dimon failed to follow up with Trump.
Further, Trump’s lawyers allege that JPMorgan placed the president and his companies on a reputational “blacklist” that both JPMorgan and other banks use to keep clients from opening accounts with them in the future. The blacklist has yet to be defined by the president’s lawyers.
“If and when Plaintiffs explain what they mean by this “blacklist,” JPMorgan will respond accordingly,” the bank’s lawyers said in a filing.
JPMorgan has previously said that while it regrets that Trump felt the need to sue the bank, the lawsuit has no merit.
The issue of debanking is at the center of the case. Debanking occurs when a bank closes the accounts of a customer or refuses to do business with a customer in the form of loans or other services. Once a relatively obscure issue in finance, debanking has become a politically charged issue in recent years, with conservative politicians arguing that banks have discriminated against them and their affiliated interests.
“In a devastating concession that proves President Trump’s entire claim, JPMorgan Chase admitted to unlawfully and intentionally de-banking President Trump, his family, and his businesses, causing overwhelming financial harm,” the president’s lawyers said in a statement. “President Trump is standing up for all those wrongly debanked by JPMorgan Chase and its cohorts, and will see this case to a just and proper conclusion.”
Debanking first became a national issue when conservatives accused the Obama administration of pressuring banks to stop extending services to gun stores and payday lenders under “Operation Choke Point.”
Trump and other conservative figures have alleged that banks cut them off from their accounts under the umbrella term of “reputational risk” after the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol. Since Trump came back into office, the president’s banking regulators have moved to stop any banks from using “reputational risk” as a reason for denying service to customers.
This is not the first lawsuit Trump has filed against a big bank alleging that he was debanked. The Trump Organization sued credit card giant Capital One in March 2025 for similar reasons and allegations. The case is ongoing.

Russian drones kill four people in Sumy region, including teenager
This was reported by Head of the Sumy Regional Military Administration Oleh Hryhorov on Telegram, according to Ukrinform.
“A Russian drone killed four civilians. These were two brothers, one of them 17 years old, and a married couple. The woman was a medic,” he wrote.
According to the official, the enemy dropped an explosive device from a drone on the outskirts of the Znob-Novhorod community. The two brothers were injured in the explosion.
Medical personnel hospitalized the wounded. On the way to the hospital, the Russians deliberately targeted the ambulance with an attack drone.
“The vehicle caught fire. Only the driver survived. He is in the hospital with severe burns,” added Hryhorov.
As Ukrinform reported, throughout the previous day, five people were injured in the Sumy region as a result of enemy attacks.

Trump hikes US global tariff rate to 15 percent
President Donald Trump raised the global duty on imports into the United States to 15 percent on Saturday, doubling down on his promise to maintain his aggressive tariff policy a day after the Supreme Court ruled much of it illegal.
Trump said on his Truth Social platform that after a thorough review of Friday's "extraordinarily anti-American decision" by the court to rein in his tariff program, the administration was hiking the import levies "to the fully allowed, and legally tested, 15% level."
Shortly after the court's 6-3 ruling that rejected the president's authority to impose tariffs under a 1977 economic emergency powers act, Trump had initially announced a new 10 percent global levy by invoking a different legal avenue.
At the same time, he launched an extraordinary personal attack on the conservative justices who had sided with the majority, slamming their "disloyalty" and calling them "fools and lap dogs."
The ruling was a stunning rebuke by the high court, which has largely sided with the president since he returned to office, and marked a major political setback in striking down Trump's signature economic policy that has roiled the global trade order.
Saturday's announcement is sure to provoke further uncertainty as Trump carries on with a trade war that has cajoled and punished countries, both friend and foe.
It is the latest move in a careening process that has seen a multitude of tariff levels for countries sending goods into the United States set and then altered or revoked by Trump's team over the past year.
The new duty by law is only temporary - allowable for 150 days. According to a White House fact sheet, exemptions remain for sectors that are under separate probes, including pharma, and goods entering the US under the US-Mexico-Canada agreement.
On Friday, the White House said US trading partners that reached separate tariff deals with Trump's administration would also face the new global tariff.
High court defeat
Friday's court ruling did not impact sector-specific duties Trump separately imposed on steel, aluminium, and various other goods. Government probes still underway could lead to additional sectoral tariffs.
But it nevertheless marked Trump's biggest defeat at the Supreme Court since returning to the White House 13 months ago. The court has generally expanded his power.
Trump heaped praise on the conservative justices who voted to uphold his authority to levy tariffs - Clarence Thomas, Samuel Alito and Brett Kavanaugh, a Trump nominee - thanking them "for their strength and wisdom, and love of our country."
The president alleged the majority of six justices, including two nominated during his first term, had been "swayed by foreign interests."
"I think that foreign interests are represented by people that I believe have undue influence," he said.
Shares on Wall Street - a metric closely watched by Trump - rose modestly Friday after the decision, which had been expected.
Business groups largely cheered the ruling, with the National Retail Federation saying this "provides much-needed certainty" for companies.
In court arguments, the Trump administration said companies would receive refunds if the tariffs were deemed unlawful. But the Supreme Court's ruling did not address the issue.
Trump said he expected years of litigation on whether to provide refunds. Kavanaugh noted the refund process could be a "mess."

Does Trump Have the Legal Authority to Strike Iran? An Expert Explains

After building up a massive military force in the Middle East over the last few weeks, President Donald Trump said Friday that he was considering strikes against Iran to pressure its leaders into accepting a deal on its nuclear program.
Trump has ratcheted up threats of action against the country’s leadership in recent months alongside a steady buildup of military forces. Two aircraft carriers are currently deployed, and one more—the USS Gerald Ford—is expected to arrive imminently.
When questioned by reporters on Friday whether he was weighing limited strikes against the country’s leadership in order to get it to accept a deal over its nuclear program, Trump replied: “I guess I can say I am considering that.”

On Thursday, Trump gave Tehran a deadline of 10 to 15 days to finalize a deal to solve the nuclear dispute or face “really bad things.”
The United States joined an Israeli-led military operation against Iran in June last year that struck three of the country’s nuclear sites. After that operation, Trump claimed Iran’s nuclear enrichment facilities had been “completely and totally obliterated.”
Trump raised the prospect of further military action against Iran following a brutal crackdown on protests there that killed thousands.
That prospect has drawn harsh criticism from inside and outside of the President’s own party.
Rep. Thomas Massie, a Republican, and Rep. Ro Khanna said they would table a War Powers resolution to prohibit the president from ordering military action in Iran without congressional approval.
“Congress must vote on war according to our Constitution. Rep. Ro Khanna and I will be forcing that vote to happen in the House as soon as possible,” Massie wrote on X on Feb. 18. “I will vote to put America first which means voting against more war in the Middle East.”
David Janovsky is the Acting Director of The Constitution Project at the Project on Government Oversight, and researches and develops policy reforms on separation of powers issues. He answered TIME’s questions about the legality of potential strikes on Iran.
If Trump orders strikes on Iran tomorrow, however limited in scope, could that be legally justified?
DJ: The short answer is no. There's no indication that there's any sort of circumstance that would give the President the unilateral authority to order military action. It's true that presidents have some inherent authority to deploy the military as Commander in Chief, but that's really limited to true emergency circumstances where there is an attack underway that needs to be repelled, or maybe an extremely clear imminent attack. But there's no suggestion that that's the case today—that would make the strikes illegal.
What steps would the White House need to take for this military action to be legally above board?
DJ: Most simply, the administration would need to go to Congress. This is a contemplated attack against a sovereign state, and that, in simplest terms, is an act of war. And the Constitution gives the exclusive power to declare war to Congress, not the president. So this is something that would need a vote and congressional approval.
How would this operation be different from the strikes on Iran’s nuclear sites in June 2025, legally speaking?
DJ: My position is that those strikes in 2025 were not legally justifiable and also that strikes now would likewise not be justifiable. In 2025, the administration put out a very brief explanation that relied on both the President's inherent authority and a notion of collective self-defense with Israel. But again, self-defense is properly understood to involve a threat that is much more immediate than anything that's at play now.
What would be the legal and political implications if Congress passed a formal War Powers resolution restricting the President’s ability to strike Iran?
DJ: It's important to keep in mind that if Congress did nothing, that would be a sign that Congress didn't approve an act of war, and so it would be illegal.
So, congressional action isn't necessary, legally speaking, to prevent a strike against Iran. But, if Congress were to take the preemptive step of saying, “You cannot do this,” I think it would do two things. First, it would change the legal calculus, because the executive branch, for decades— this is not a new phenomenon—has resorted to creative lawyering to come up with excuses for using the military abroad. A clear statement from Congress should at least make those executive branch lawyers a lot less willing to push the envelope. It could also change the calculus for the military lawyers who would need to review any actual strike order.
And, politically, I think it would send a powerful message. We have seen, especially recently, that the administration is sensitive to losing support, particularly from its allies in Congress, and a clear congressional statement that there is not the buy-in for military action in this case would also be a limiting factor.
Why has the reaction from Congress to this military buildup been so muted?
DJ: I think there are probably both long-term structural reasons and sort of short-term political reasons, hand in hand with the executive branch's decades-long effort to push the envelope of what it can do has been Congress's acquiescence in the face of those expansions. In some ways, this is part of a constitutionally very dangerous but long-running trend.
Back in 2025, there was an effort after the strikes to pass a war powers resolution. But the most charitable explanation for why Congress didn't act then was that there was a suggestion that the strikes were over and done. It was a one-off, and there was no need for Congress to prevent anything else. The fact that we're back here suggests that was not the correct assessment, and certainly underscores the need for Congress to act urgently now.

More than 1,500 prisoners set for release under Venezuela's new amnesty law
At least 1,557 people - including opposition members, activists, human rights defenders and journalists who were held in Venezuela for political reasons, are expected to be released from prison after submitting their applications under an amnesty bill that was signed into law this week, authorities said Saturday.
At least 1,557 people held in Venezuela for political reasons have submitted their applications under an amnesty bill that was signed into law this week and are expected to be released from prison, authorities said Saturday.
Thursday’s measure is expected to benefit opposition members, activists, human rights defenders, journalists and many others detained for months or even years.
Its approval marked a reversal for Venezuelan authorities, who for decades have denied holding any political prisoners. It follows last month’s stunning US military raid in the country’s capital, Caracas, to capture then-President Nicolás Maduro.
“As of today, 1,152 new applications have been received, for a total of 1,557 that are being addressed immediately, and at this moment hundreds of releases of persons deprived of liberty who are benefiting from the Amnesty Law are already taking place,” National Assembly leader Jorge Rodríguez said on Saturday.

Earlier, the president of the special commission overseeing the amnesty law, Jorge Arreaza, said Friday night on state television that 379 amnesty requests had been received and that the applicants’ releases would take place between Friday and Saturday. Further releases could be granted within 15 days, he said.
Gonzalo Himiob, vice president of Venezuela-based prisoners’ rights group Foro Penal, told The Associated Press on Saturday that so far some have been released in the state of Barinas, in the southwest of the country, but the process of verifying releases under the amnesty was still ongoing.
The new law excludes those convicted of homicide, drug trafficking, serious human rights violations and military rebellion.
Human rights organizations are calling for the law to be applied to all prisoners held for political reasons, even if they are not listed among the beneficiaries.
Read moreVenezuela approves amnesty law that could free hundreds of political prisoners
“It is discriminatory and unconstitutional to exclude imprisoned military personnel and persecuted political figures,” Alfredo Romero, president of Foro Penal, said on X Saturday. Without this, “there can be no talk of national coexistence,” he said.
Rodríguez said that thousands of requests are being processed from “individuals who were under alternative measures to the system of deprivation of liberty,” and that they are likewise covered by the recently approved Amnesty Law.
Delcy Rodríguez, acting president of Venezuela since January 5, said during the signing of the law that it showed that the country’s political leaders were “letting go of a little intolerance and opening new avenues for politics in Venezuela.”
The bill’s purpose is to grant people “a general and full amnesty for crimes or offenses committed” during specific periods since 1999 that were marked by politically driven conflicts in Venezuela, including “acts of politically motivated violence” in the context of the 2024 presidential election. The aftermath of that election led to protests and the arrest of more than 2,000 people, including minors.

In the days after Maduro’s January 3 capture, Rodríguez’s government announced it would release a significant number of prisoners. However, relatives and human rights watchdogs have criticized the slow pace of releases and the restrictive conditions under which many have been placed after leaving prison.
Venezuela-based nonprofit Justice, Encounter and Forgiveness has tallied 459 releases of detainees held for political reasons between January 8 and February 20.

Sudanese army repels RSF attack on border town in western Sudan
Clashes erupt in El Tina near Chad border as army-aligned forces deny RSF claim of control
KHARTOUM, Sudan
The Sudanese army and allied joint forces repelled an attack Saturday by the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) on the border town of El Tina in North Darfur state.
The Coordination of Resistance Committees in El Fasher said in a statement that RSF fighters infiltrated El Tina, which lies along the Sudan-Chad border, but were confronted by army troops and joint forces of armed movements allied with the military and retreated after clashes.
The group said the attacking forces withdrew at the onset of fighting in the strategically located town.
Darfur regional governor Minni Arko Minawi described the RSF assault on El Tina as “targeting unarmed civilians and criminal behavior.”
In a post on the US social media company Facebook, he shared videos purportedly showing joint forces seizing RSF vehicles and weapons in El Tina.
Fighters from army-aligned armed movements also circulated videos on social media from inside the town, displaying damaged combat vehicles, weapons, and individuals they identified as RSF detainees.
Earlier Saturday, the RSF said in a statement on its Telegram channel that it had taken control of El Tina.
Of Sudan’s 18 states, the RSF controls the five Darfur states in the west, except for parts of North Darfur that remain under army control. The military retains control over most of the remaining states, including the capital, Khartoum.
Darfur accounts for roughly one-fifth of Sudan’s total area of more than 1.8 million square kilometers, though the majority of the country’s estimated 50 million people live in areas controlled by the army.
The conflict, which began in April 2023, has killed tens of thousands and displaced about 13 million people, creating one of the world’s worst humanitarian crises and famine conditions, according to UN reports.

Nasa astronaut shares striking footage of rare ISS ‘cartwheel’ around Earth
Nasa astronaut Zena Cardman has shared striking footage of the International Space Station (ISS) "cartwheeling" around Earth.
The ISS performed the rare manoeuvre to allow for a reboost by the Spacex CRS-33. The space station orbits close enough to Earth that there is a small amount of atmospheric drag, and requires periodic reboosts as a result.
The 60x speed timelapse shows the vessel perform an “orbital cartwheel”, as the American astronaut named it, from the Atlantic to the Pacific.
Zena Cardman said, "This was one of my favourites since it captures a little of everything - sunset, lightning storms, air glow, moon glint, stars, and sunrise."

Ghislaine Maxwell fighting the release of 90,000 more Epstein files
- Lawyers for Ghislaine Maxwell are challenging the release of 90,000 pages of documents related to Jeffrey Epstein and Maxwell, arguing a new law forcing their disclosure is unconstitutional.
- The legal challenge, filed in Manhattan federal court, aims to block the release of files from a decade-old civil defamation lawsuit brought by Virginia Giuffre against Maxwell.
- Maxwell's attorneys contend that the 'Epstein Files Transparency Act' violates the Constitution's separation of powers doctrine, asserting that Congress cannot override the judiciary's power to protect its files.
- They claim the documents, which include over 30 deposition transcripts, contain private financial and sexual information pertaining to Maxwell and others.
- The move comes amidst ongoing releases of Epstein-related documents, which have revealed new details about his abuse and led to complaints from victims whose personal information was disclosed.

The Committee to Protect Journalists published a report alleging the systematic abuse of Palestinian media workers in Israeli detention centers between 2023 and 2026. Through interviews with dozens of former detainees, the organization documented harrowing accounts of torture, starvation, and sexual violence aimed at silencing the press. The findings highlight that the majority of these journalists were held under administrative detention without formal charges or access to legal counsel. Evidence such as medical records and photographs supports claims of extreme weight loss and untreated injuries resulting from physical beatings. The advocacy group is now calling for international accountability and independent investigations into these alleged violations of humanitarian law. Despite these testimonies, the Israeli military maintains that it adheres to international standards and does not intentionally target members of the media.

Syria appoints presidential envoy to implement deal with SDF
Move aims to strengthen state presence and advance integration in northeastern regions
Istanbul
ISTANBUL
The Syrian presidency on Saturday appointed a presidential envoy to oversee the implementation of the Jan. 29 agreement with the terrorist organization YPG/SDF, according to state media.
The Syrian Arab News Agency (SANA), citing the presidency’s media directorate, said Brig. Gen. Ziad Al-Ayesh has been assigned to follow up on the accord and facilitate integration under the authority of the Syrian state.
The presidency said the appointment is intended to enhance the presence of state institutions, remove administrative obstacles, and activate public services in areas covered by the agreement.
Al-Ayesh hails from the village of Arjah Al-Jawalah in the countryside of Hasakah province in northeastern Syria, according to Syrian media outlets. He holds a degree in Sharia from Al-Ouzai University in Lebanon and a master’s degree in business administration from Idlib University in northwestern Syria.
Prior to the fall of Bashar Assad’s regime on Dec. 8, 2024, Al-Ayesh headed civil affairs at the Interior Ministry of the Salvation Government in Idlib.
On Jan. 30, the Syrian government announced that it had reached a “comprehensive agreement” with the SDF aimed at ending division in the country and launching a new phase of integration. It said the deal covering the cities of Hasakah and Qamishli and the integration of military forces complements a previous agreement signed on Jan. 18.
The latest agreement followed a military operation by the Syrian Army in which it regained large areas in eastern and northeastern Syria after repeated SDF violations of a March 2025 accord.

Global leaders and businesses react to more U.S. tariff swings
-
Click here to listen to this article - Share via
- Global leaders from Mexico City to Paris to Seoul convened emergency meetings to navigate the latest twist in an unpredictable tariff landscape.
- Mexico’s secretary of the economy, Marcelo Ebrard, urged “prudence” — “I tell you to put yourselves in zen mode. As tranquil as possible.”
SEOUL — Governments and companies around the world scrambled Saturday to determine the impact of the U.S. Supreme Court ruling that struck down most of President Trump’s sweeping tariffs and his response with a new round of import taxes.
The latest twist in the U.S. tariff roller-coaster ride, launched when Trump returned to office 13 months ago and upended dozens of trading relationships with the world’s biggest economy, roiled trade officials from Mexico to South Korea to South America and beyond.
South Korea’s Trade Ministry called for an emergency meeting Saturday to understand the new landscape. Some specific exports to the U.S., like automobiles and steel, aren’t affected by the U.S. high court decision. Those that are affected will probably now be covered by a new tariff imposed by an executive order Trump signed Friday. Trump announced Saturday morning that he would raise that 10% tariff to 15%.
In Paris, French President Emmanuel Macron hailed the checks and balances in the United States, praising the “rule of law” during a visit to a Paris agricultural fair: “It’s a good thing to have powers and counter-powers in democracies. We should welcome that.”
But he cautioned against any triumphalism.
Officials were going over the language of bilateral or multilateral deals struck with the U.S. in recent months, even as they braced for new swings and Trump’s swift announcement of new tariffs.
“I note that President Trump, a few hours ago, said he had reworked some measures to introduce new tariffs, more limited ones, but applying to everyone,” Macron said. “So we’ll look closely at the exact consequences, what can be done, and we will adapt.”
Mexico braces, adapts
Mexico’s secretary of the economy, Marcelo Ebrard, urged “prudence” Friday in the aftermath of the U.S. Supreme Court ruling. “We have to see where this is going,” Ebrard told reporters. “We have to see what measures [Washington] is going to take to figure out how it is going to affect our country. “
Amid widespread concern about tariffs in Mexico — the United States’ major commercial partner, with almost $1 trillion in annual two-way trade — Ebrard cautioned: “I tell you to put yourselves in zen mode. As tranquil as possible.”
Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum, when asked about the tariffs, said, “We’ll review the resolution carefully and then gladly give our opinion.”
Ebrard said he plans to travel to the United States next week to clarify matters.
Last year, Ebrard noted, Mexico managed to stave off Trump’s threats to impose a 25% across-the-board levy on all Mexican imports.
However, Mexico has been pushing back against Trump administration tariffs on imports of vehicles, steel and aluminum, among other products.
Among other impacts, the Supreme Court voided so-called fentanyl tariffs on Mexico, China and Canada. The Trump administration said it imposed those levies to force the three nations to crack down on trafficking of the deadly synthetic opioid.
About 85% of Mexican exports to the United States are exempt from tariffs because of the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement. The accord extended a mostly free-trade regimen among the three nations, replacing the North American Free Trade Agreement.
The three-way pact is scheduled for joint review starting July 1. That date marks six years since the agreement was signed during the first Trump presidential term.
In Ciudad Juárez, Mexico, along the Texas border, Sergio Bermúdez, head of an industrial parks company, discussed Trump’s plan for a new tariff. Trump, he said, “says a lot of things, and many of them aren’t true. All of the businesses I know are analyzing, trying to figure out how it’s going to affect them.”
The impact could be felt especially in Juarez: Much of its economy depends on factories producing goods to export to consumers in the U.S., the result of decades of free trade between the U.S. and Mexico.
The policy swoons in the United States over the last year have made many global business leaders cautious, as they struggle to forecast and see investment take a hit.
CEO Alan Russell of Tecma, which helps American businesses set up operations in Mexico, has seen his job grow increasingly complicated over the last year — his company’s workload has surged as much as fourfold as it grapples with new import requirements. He worries the last U.S. moves will only make things more difficult.
“We wake up every day with new challenges. That word ‘uncertainty’ has been the greatest enemy,” said Russell, who is American. “The difficult part has been not being clear what the rules are today or what they’re going to be tomorrow.”
A ‘good decision’
Swissmem, a top technology industry association in Switzerland, hailed the Supreme Court ruling as “good decision,” writing on X that its exports to the U.S. fell 18% in the fourth quarter alone -- a period when Switzerland was facing much higher U.S. tariffs than most neighboring countries in Europe.
“The high tariffs have severely damaged the tech industry,” Swissmem President Martin Hirzel said on X, while acknowledging the dust is far from settled. “However, today’s ruling doesn’t win anything yet.”
Times staff writer Patrick J. McDonnell in Mexico City contributed to this report, as did Associated Press writers Tong-Hyung Kim in Seoul and Megan Janetsky in Mexico City. AP writers María Verza and Fabiola Sánchez in Mexico City, Samuel Petrequin in London and Jamey Keaten in Lyon, France, also contributed.

Arab and Muslim states fume after Huckabee says Israel has biblical right to much of Mideast
Saudis, Jordan, PA, Arab League slam US envoy for saying it ‘would be fine’ if Israel took over lands promised in Bible during Carlson interview; he then clarified ‘hyperbolic’ statement
Arab and Muslim nations on Saturday sharply condemned comments by the US ambassador to Israel, Mike Huckabee, who said in a recent interview that “it would be fine” if Israel took over a large swath of the Middle East.
Huckabee made the comments during his contentious interview with right-wing American commentator Tucker Carlson which aired Friday, after Carlson said that according to the Bible, the descendants of Abraham would receive land that today would include large parts of the Middle East, and asked Huckabee if Israel had a right to that land.
Huckabee responded: “It would be fine if they took it all.” However, he said that Israel was not looking to expand its territory and has a right to security in the land it legitimately holds.
His comments sparked immediate backlash from Jordan, Saudi Arabia, Egypt, the Organization of Islamic Cooperation and the League of Arab States, which in separate statements called them extremist, provocative, and not in line with the US position.
Saudi Arabia’s foreign ministry described Huckabee’s comments as “extremist rhetoric” and “unacceptable,” and called for the State Department to clarify its position on them.
Egypt’s foreign ministry called his comments a “blatant violation” of international law, adding that “Israel has no sovereignty over the occupied Palestinian territory or other Arab lands.”
The Palestinian Authority said on X that Huckabee’s words “contradict US President Donald Trump’s rejection of [Israel] annexing the West Bank.”
Kuwait decried what it called a “flagrant violation of the principles of international law,” while Oman said the comments “threatened the prospects for peace” and stability in the region.
In its statement, the Arab League condemned Huckabee’s “extreme” comment, in which he “asserted Israel’s right to control the Middle East, citing religious texts from the Old Testament.”
The comments “violated all the basic principles and established norms of diplomacy, as well as defying logic and reason,” the group of 22 Arab nations said, adding that the US envoy’s words “contradict US policies and positions across the board, aimed at currying favor with the right-wing public in Israel.”
“Such extremist and baseless statements inflame religious and nationalistic sentiments at a time when Arab states are meeting under the auspices of the Board of Peace to discuss ways to implement the Gaza peace agreement and seize this opportunity to launch a serious peace process,” it added.

The Organization of Islamic Cooperation, which is made up of 57 mostly Muslim-majority nations, including the entire Arab League, issued a similar statement, saying it “condemns the dangerous and irresponsible” comments made by Huckabee.
The OIC said the US envoy’s comments were “an unacceptable call for the expansion of Israel” that were “based on a false and rejected historical and ideological narrative.”
Such remarks “fuel extremist ideological rhetoric, which would fuel extremism and encourage” Israel to “continue its illegal measures based on displacement, settlement, and attempts to impose annexation” on Palestinian territory, the group said.
There was no immediate response from Israel or the United States.
Huckabee, a devout Christian and outspoken Zionist, commented being pressed by Carlson on his assertion that a part of the Jewish people’s right to the land stemmed from God’s promise to Abraham, while noting that that promised land spanned a far larger territory than that of today’s Israel, encompassing much of present-day’s Jordan, Syria, Lebanon, Saudi Arabia and Iraq. He asked whether it did not follow then that Israel had a right to take land from neighboring Arab countries.
After initially avoiding the matter, Huckabee eventually said, “It would be fine if they took it all,” while swiftly adding that this was not on the table as “They’re not asking to take it over.”
Carlson then asked the US ambassador to confirm he was fine with Israel taking over “all of Syria, all of Lebanon.” Huckabee responded, “That’s really not exactly what I’m trying to say,” adding that “It was somewhat of a hyperbolic statement.”
In a subsequent back-and-forth, Carlson demanded to know whether Huckabee believes Israel “has a moral right to take over what are now other people’s countries,” as the envoy insisted he had not said that. Eventually, Huckabee said: “If they end up getting attacked by all these places and they win that war and they take that land, then, okay, that’s a whole other discussion.”

Zelensky commends special services for neutralizing Russian mercenaries
As reported by Ukrinform, the head of state said this in his evening address.
“I want to commend the efforts of the Security Service of Ukraine, the National Police, and the Office of the Prosecutor General – they neutralized Russian mercenaries preparing assassination attempts against our citizens. These were rather high-profile names, and preventing such crimes is a substantial result,” Zelensky said.
He noted that he had heard a report from Oleksandr Poklad, Deputy Head of the SSU.
“And this is yet another front in the ongoing protection of Ukraine’s security, the safety of Ukrainians, and the constant defense of the lives of our people – the way our Ukrainian special services, our law enforcement, and our intelligence neutralize Russian criminal activity against Ukrainians. They were preparing attacks against Ukrainian military personnel, Ukrainian intelligence officers, and Ukrainian media workers. It is important that all our Ukrainian special services and law enforcement continue to protect Ukrainian citizens in exactly this coordinated way,” the President emphasized.
As Ukrinform previously reported, the Security Service of Ukraine and the National Police exposed a criminal group that had been preparing contract killings on behalf of Russian special services, including plans to assassinate Andrii Yusov, a representative of the Defense Intelligence Directorate. Other targets included Ukrainian journalists and civic activists, the head of a strategic enterprise, and fighters of the DIU International Legion.

JPMorgan concedes it closed Trump’s accounts after Jan. 6 attack
JPMorgan Chase now confirms it closed Trump’s accounts after mob of his supporters stormed halls of Congress
- Bookmark
Banking giant JPMorgan Chase acknowledged for the first time that it closed the accounts of President Donald Trump and several of his businesses in the political and legal aftermath of the January 6, 2021 attacks on the U.S. Capitol.
The disclosure marks the latest development in a legal saga over Trump’s alleged “debanking” after the president sued America’s largest bank for $5 billion alleging his accounts were closed for political reasons.
The acknowledgment came in a court filing submitted this week in Trump's lawsuit against the bank and its CEO Jamie Dimon.
“In February 2021, JPMorgan informed Plaintiffs that certain accounts maintained with JPMorgan’s CB and PB would be closed,” JPMorgan's former chief administrative officer Dan Wilkening wrote in the court filing. The “PB” and “CB” stands for JPMorgan's private bank and commercial bank.
In a letter to Trump submitted to the court Friday, dated February 19, 2021, the bank said it was recommending that he “find a more suitable institution with which to conduct business.”
“With that in mind, this letter is to respectfully inform you that we will need to end our current relationship,” the letter to Trump said.
Until now, JPMorgan has never admitted it closed the president's accounts, and would only speak hypothetically about when the bank closes accounts and its reasons for doing so.
In a previous statement, the bank said it “does not close accounts for political or religious reasons” but does so when accounts “create legal or regulatory risk for the company.”
Trump initially sued JPMorgan in state court in Florida, where Trump has his primary residence at his Mar-a-Lago compound in Palm Beach. JPMorgan Chase is seeking to move the case to federal court in New York, which is where the bank accounts were located and where Trump kept much of his business operations until recently.
Trump accuses the bank of trade libel and accuses Dimon himself of violating Florida’s Unfair and Deceptive Trade Practices Act.
In the original lawsuit, Trump alleges he tried to raise the issue personally with Dimon after the bank started to close his accounts, and that Dimon assured Trump he would figure out what was happening. The lawsuit alleges Dimon failed to follow up with Trump.
Further, Trump’s lawyers allege that JPMorgan placed the president and his companies on a reputational “blacklist” that both JPMorgan and other banks use to keep clients from opening accounts with them in the future.
JPMorgan previously said it believes the suit has no merit.
“Debanking” occurs when a bank closes the accounts of a customer or refuses to do business with a customer in the form of loans or other services. Once a relatively obscure issue in finance, debanking has become a politically charged issue in recent years, with right-wing figures arguing that banks have discriminated against them and their affiliated interests.
“In a devastating concession that proves President Trump’s entire claim, JPMorgan Chase admitted to unlawfully and intentionally de-banking President Trump, his family, and his businesses, causing overwhelming financial harm,” the president’s lawyers said in a statement.
Trump is “standing up for all those wrongly debanked by JPMorgan Chase and its cohorts, and will see this case to a just and proper conclusion,” they added.
Debanking first became a national issue when right-wing figures accused Barack Obama’s administration of pressuring banks to stop extending services to gun stores and payday lenders under “Operation Choke Point.”
Trump and his allies have alleged that banks cut them off from their accounts under the umbrella term of “reputational risk” after January 6, when a mob of his supports stormed the halls of Congress in a failured effort to derail the results of the 2020 presidential election, which Trump lost.
After Trump returned to the White House last year, the president’s banking regulators have moved to stop any banks from using “reputational risk” as a reason for denying service to customers.
This is not the first lawsuit Trump has filed against a big bank alleging that he was debanked.
The Trump Organization sued credit card giant Capital One in March 2025 for similar reasons and allegations. That case is ongoing.

Iran designates naval and air forces of EU states ‘terrorist entities’ in tit for tat move
Tehran took reciprocal measures in response to what it called 'illegal and unjustified' decision by EU member states to designate Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps as 'terrorist organization,' says Foreign Ministry
TEHRAN, Iran
Iran has designated the armed forces of European Union member states as “terrorist entities” in a tit-for-tat move.
In a statement on Saturday, Iran’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced that the country took reciprocal measures in response to what it called the “illegal and unjustified” decision by EU member states to designate the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) as a “terrorist organization.”
The statement noted that Iran has decided to designate all naval and air forces of European Union member states as “terrorist organizations.”
It added that the European governments designated the IRGC “in violation of the fundamental principles and rules of the United Nations Charter and international law,” describing it as “one of the official components of the armed forces of the Islamic Republic of Iran.”
"The Islamic Republic of Iran will act based on the principle of ‘reciprocity,’” it stated.
The Council of the European Union said in a statement on Thursday that it had formally decided to add the IRGC to the EU terrorist list, weeks after a political agreement was reached among member states.
“Following its listing, the IRGC will also be subject to restrictive measures under the EU counterterrorism sanctions regime,” the statement read, referring to the “freezing of its funds and other financial assets or economic resources” in EU member states, as well as the “prohibition for EU operators to make funds and economic resources available to the group.”
A total of 13 individuals, 23 groups, and entities are now subject to restrictive measures under the EU terrorist list, it added.
Tensions have dramatically escalated between Iran and some European countries following recent protests inside Iran, with European leaders condemning what they described as a crackdown on protesters.
Earlier this month, the Iranian parliament announced that Iran now considers EU armies to be terrorist organizations, after the country’s top security body approved the measure.
The parliamentary announcement was followed by the summoning of the ambassadors of EU member states to the Foreign Ministry.
At the time, the ministry described the EU move as “unjustified and irresponsible,” emphasizing that it “violates fundamental principles of the United Nations Charter and international law.”
Meanwhile, tensions continue to escalate in the region amid an unprecedented US military buildup and IRGC military drills in the Persian Gulf.

Report: IRGC running Hezbollah, preparing it for war with Israel if US strikes Iran
Israel said to see Hezbollah preparing rocket-fire capabilities, recent IDF strikes said aimed at degrading them; anti-Hezbollah outlet quotes ‘political sources’ saying Beirut must declare neutrality
Officers from Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps have effectively taken charge of Hezbollah in anticipation of a war with the US and Israel, Saudi outlet Al-Arabiya reported Saturday, as Lebanese officials were said to assail the possibility of their country getting dragged into battle.
The IRGC officers, some of whom recently arrived in Lebanon from Iran, are tasked with rebuilding Hezbollah’s military capabilities, which were significantly degraded in the 14-month fighting with Israel that ended with a November 2024 truce, Al-Arabiya said, citing sources close to Hezbollah.
The Iranian officers have also been personally briefing Hezbollah operatives across Lebanon, said the unnamed sources cited by Al-Arabiya. They added that IRGC officers were meeting with members of Hezbollah’s missile unit at a site in Lebanon’s Beqaa Valley that was bombed by Israel overnight, amid a wave of airstrikes that wounded at least 50 people and killed 12, including a senior Hezbollah officer. The IDF said the strikes targeted Hamas and Hezbollah command centers.
According to the Hezbollah-aligned sources, a wider Israeli military offensive against Lebanon is only a matter of time.
The report came as US President Donald Trump has amassed military forces in the region and repeatedly threatened to use them against Iran, first over the Islamic Republic’s brutal crackdown on anti-regime protesters last month and more recently over its nuclear program.
Israel is readying to fight alongside the US and expects to be targeted by Iran if the US strikes there, according to Hebrew media.
The Kan public broadcaster reported Saturday evening that Israel has identified preparations by Hezbollah — particularly by its rocket forces — to strike if Iran is attacked, with the Lebanese terror group expected to target Israel together with the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, Iranian-backed Shiite militias in Iraq and Yemen’s Houthi rebels.
Haaretz reported, quoting unnamed Israeli military sources, that recent Israeli airstrikes targeting Hezbollah were intended to degrade its capabilities amid the possibility of conflict. At least 10 people were reported killed and 50 wounded in Israeli strikes in eastern Lebanon on Friday, after the Israel Defense Forces said it had targeted Hezbollah command centers.
Channel 12 news reported Saturday that Trump was leaning toward attacking Iran, but had agreed to a request from his envoys Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner to give Iran another day or two to submit a proposal in the indirect US-Iran nuclear negotiations that commenced earlier this month.
An unnamed US official was quoted by the network saying that the 10- to 15-day deadline Trump gave Iran on Thursday was “not scientific.”
Trump has demanded Iran give up entirely on its nuclear enrichment program, but is reportedly open to letting the Islamic Republic preserve some “token” enrichment capabilities.
Speaking to pro-Iran demonstrators in Lebanon last month, Hezbollah chief Naim Qassem said the terrorist group would not be neutral if the US struck Iran, but stopped short of explicitly threatening Israel.
Meanwhile, the Ynet news site said in an unsourced report this week that Iran was pressuring Hezbollah to fight alongside it in the event of a war with Israel. The report also said the IDF had prepared a plan to “significantly strike” Hezbollah and had conveyed to it “that if it decides to intervene, this time the blow will be very painful.”
On Saturday, anti-Hezbollah Lebanese outlet Nidaa al-Watan cited “prominent political sources” in the country as saying Beirut must declare its neutrality in case of a US-Iran war, and refuse to let Hezbollah drag Lebanon into war with Israel.
“Hezbollah thought it could confuse Israel and the US by saying it would not be neutral if Iran were struck, so Israel responded by saying that as soon as it’s informed by Washington of the zero hour, it will preemptively strike Hezbollah. Israel won’t let Hezbollah have the initiative,” Nidaa al-Watan quoted its sources as saying. “Hezbollah will drag Lebanon into this war.”
Hezbollah, previously a formidable force in Lebanon’s government, has been politically sidelined with the accession in January 2025 of Lebanon’s US- and Saudi-backed President Joseph Aoun, a former army chief who has vowed to uphold a state monopoly on arms — a thinly veiled threat against Hezbollah’s extensive arsenal.

'Chronicles From the Siege’: Filmmaker dedicates Berlinale win to Palestinian liberation struggle

Syrian-Palestinian filmmaker Abdallah Al-Khatib used his acceptance speech at the Berlinale film awards ceremony to make a solidarity statement in support of the Palestinian liberation struggle.
“We will remember everyone who stood with us, and we will remember everyone who stood against us, against our right to live with dignity, or those who chose to be silent. Free Palestine from now until the end of the world,” he told the audience in Berlin on Saturday after his film “Chronicles From the Siege", which tells the story of people trying to survive occupation, was named Best First Feature.
He accused the German government of being “a partner in the genocide in Gaza by Israel.”
Al-Khatib, who brought a Palestinian flag onto the stage, said that one day there would be “a great film festival in Gaza” dedicated to all oppressed people in the world.
Earlier, Lebanese filmmaker Marie-Rose Osta, who won the Golden Bear for best short film, had also criticised Israel's genocide on stage.
“In reality, children in Gaza, in all of Palestine, and in Lebanon do not have superpowers to protect them from Israeli bombs. No child should need superpowers to survive a genocide empowered by veto powers and the collapse of international law," she said in her acceptance speech.
“The ceasefire continues to be violated by Israel both in Gaza and Lebanon,” Osta added.
She stressed that the lives of children in Gaza and Lebanon are "not negotiable.”
On Wednesday, dozens of actors and directors, including Javier Bardem and Tilda Swinton, accused the Berlin International Film Festival of "anti-Palestinian racism" and urged organisers to state their opposition to Israel’s genocide in Gaza clearly.
In an open letter published in Variety, 81 film workers criticised what they called the Berlinale’s “involvement in censoring artists who oppose Israel’s ongoing genocide against Palestinians in Gaza.”
The signatories also took issue with comments by this year’s jury president, Wim Wenders, who said at a recent press briefing in Berlin, when asked about Gaza, “We should stay out of politics.”
Last week, award-winning Indian writer Arundhati Roy withdrew from the Berlin Film Festival over jury president Wim Wenders's comments that cinema should "stay out of politics" when asked about Gaza.
Roy said that she was "shocked and disgusted" by responses from Wenders and other jury members to a question about the Palestinian territory.

OIC slams US ambassador's remarks on Israeli Mideast expansion as threat to regional stability

OIC slams US ambassador's remarks on Israeli Mideast expansion as threat to regional stability
Organization of Islamic Cooperation warns US Ambassador to Israel Mike Huckabee's comments fuel extremism and undermine international law
ISTANBUL
The Organization of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) and the Arab League on Saturday condemned remarks by US Ambassador to Israel Mike Huckabee, warning that his comments about Israeli expansion in the Middle East threaten regional security and stability as well as inflame religious and national sentiments.
Huckabee argued that Israel has a biblical right to the land stretching from the Nile to the Euphrates rivers, saying on a podcast released Friday: "It would be fine if they (Israel) took it all.”
Huckabee made the remarks in an interview with US journalist Tucker Carlson, during which he defended Israel’s actions in the Gaza Strip and voiced support for the idea of “divine providence” giving control of the region to Israel.
After Huckabee claimed Israel had a divine right to vast portions of the Middle East, Carlson asked him: “What land are you talking about?” Interpretations of the biblical phrase “river of Egypt” vary, with some scholars identifying it as a riverbed in the Sinai Peninsula and others as the Nile.
“It would be fine if they took it all,” Huckabee replied, referring to Israel’s biblical right to the territory stretching from the Nile River to the Euphrates.
The OIC described Huckabee’s remarks in a statement as “dangerous and irresponsible,” calling them an unacceptable call for the expansion of Israel, the occupying power, and the seizure of additional Palestinian and Arab lands.
The comments were based on “a false and rejected historical and ideological narrative and claims" that violate state sovereignty, diplomatic norms, principles of international law, UN resolutions, and the UN Charter, the group added.
The organization warned that such extremist rhetoric would fuel further extremism and embolden Israeli policies centered on displacement, settlement expansion, and attempts to impose annexation on occupied Palestinian territory.
It said these measures "threaten security and stability in the entire region.”
The bloc reaffirmed its unwavering support for what it described as the legitimate rights of the Palestinian people, foremost among them the right to self-determination and the establishment of an independent, sovereign state on the June 4, 1967 borders with East Jerusalem as its capital.
Separately, Ahmed Aboul Gheit, secretary-general of the Arab League, condemned Huckabee’s claims, calling them contrary to the most basic principles and norms of diplomacy.
In a statement on US social media company X, Aboul Gheit said the remarks contradict official US policies and positions and appear aimed at appealing to right-wing audiences in Israel.
He warned that such extremist statements, which lack any legal or political basis, “inflame religious and national sentiments” at a time when countries are convening under a Board of Peace framework to explore ways to implement a Gaza peace agreement and seize the opportunity to launch a serious political process.
Huckabee, named US ambassador to Israel in April 2025, is an evangelical Christian who has previously spoken of expansionist claims based on what he described as a “divine right” for Israel in the West Bank.
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu told news channel i24 last August that he feels “very attached” to the vision of a Greater Israel. He said he considers himself “on a historic and spiritual mission," including “generations of Jews that dreamt of coming here and generations of Jews who will come after us.”
Greater Israel is a term used in Israeli politics to refer to the expansion of Israel’s territory to include the West Bank, Gaza, and Syria’s Golan Heights, with some interpretations also including Egypt’s Sinai Peninsula and parts of Jordan.

NASA chief rules out March launch of Moon mission over technical issues
Sign up now: Get ST's newsletters delivered to your inbox
WASHINGTON - NASA chief Jared Isaacman on Feb 21 ruled out a March launch for Artemis 2, the first crewed flyby mission to the Moon in more than 50 years, citing technical issues.
Workers detected a problem with helium flow to the massive SLS rocket that will “take the March launch window out of consideration,” Mr Issacman said in a post on X.
“I understand people are disappointed by this development. That disappointment is felt most by the team at NASA, who have been working tirelessly to prepare for this great endeavor,” Mr Isaacman said.
“During the 1960s, when NASA achieved what most thought was impossible, and what has never been repeated since, there were many setbacks.”
The towering SLS rocket and Orion spacecraft will be rolled back into the Vehicle Assembly Building at the Kennedy Space Center in Florida to investigate the technical issues and make any necessary repairs, Mr Isaacman said.
A complete briefing will follow in the coming days, he added.
The highly anticipated Artemis 2 mission, lasting about 10 days, will see three Americans and one Canadian fly around Earth’s satellite.
It would be a huge step towards Americans once again setting foot on the lunar surface, a goal announced by President Donald Trump in his first term.
On Feb 20, NASA had set March 6 as the earliest possible launch date
The US space agency hopes to put humans back on the Moon as China forges ahead with a rival effort that is targeting 2030 at the latest for its first crewed mission.
China’s uncrewed Chang’e 7 mission is expected to be launched in 2026
NASA surprised many late in 2025 when it said Artemis 2 could happen as soon as February – an acceleration explained by the Trump administration’s wish to beat China to the punch.
But the programme has been plagued by delays.
The uncrewed Artemis 1 mission took place in November 2022 after multiple postponements and two failed launch attempts.
Then technical problems in early February – which included a liquid hydrogen leak – cut short a so-called wet dress rehearsal for the Artemis 2 launch. That was finally completed earlier this week.
The wet dress rehearsal was conducted under real conditions – with full rocket tanks and technical checks – at Cape Canaveral in Florida, with engineers practicing the maneuvers needed to carry out an actual launch.
NASA is hoping that the Moon could be used to help prepare future missions to Mars. AFP

Marshal of Polish Sejm names key topics of Ukraine Recovery Conference in Gdańsk
This was stated in an interview with Ukrinform by Włodzimierz Czarzasty, Marshal of the Sejm of the Republic of Poland.
“The recovery of Ukraine is an investment in the security of all of Europe. We want to focus on three areas: investments, transport and logistics links, as well as trade and exports. The conference in Gdańsk will become a platform for real projects, not just declarations,” Czarzasty said, stressing that it will have “political and symbolic significance.”
As reported by Ukrinform, Kyiv and Warsaw have begun practical preparations for the Ukraine Recovery Conference (URC-2026) and agreed to deepen trade and economic cooperation.
At the end of January, representatives of the authorities of Poland’s Subcarpathian, Lublin, and Podlaskie voivodeships met to coordinate efforts with the Ukrainian side to support Ukraine amid the energy crisis.

Chatter dials up on Apple’s folding iPhone as 2026 launch tipped
When Apple unveils its iPhone 18 models this September, it may also introduce an entirely new form factor for its smartphones, with rumours intensifying that a folding iPhone is finally ready for release.
Samsung has been releasing folding phones for more than six years, and although they got off to a rocky start, they’ve become a steadily growing product category. Could a folding iPhone tip the format into mainstream acceptance? Or will the majority stick with the standard models, leaving folding phones a niche concern?
Rumours and speculation about Apple’s folding iPhone have been ongoing for years, so at this point, it seems likely the company has tested multiple designs.
In 2024, a report in The Information cited people directly involved in the project as saying Apple would release a flip-style phone, sized like a regular iPhone but with a horizontal crease in the middle to fold into a small square, similar to Samsung’s Z Flip. But more recent reports point to something larger, with multiple analysts describing a passport-shaped device that opens up to become a small tablet.
This shape would differ from most book-style foldable devices on the market, including Samsung’s Z Fold and Google’s Pixel Pro Fold. While those models more or less resemble normal phones while folded, and become a square-ish tablet, Apple’s supposed device would be square-ish in both modes; a 2:3 ratio when folded and around a 4:3 ratio when opened. The advantage would be that both of those screen shapes are in use by iPads, so apps wouldn’t need to be adapted.
Longtime Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo described this format in a note last year, also saying that Apple had developed a hinge which eliminated the perceptible gap in the middle of the inner screen. Kuo said the company was prioritising thinness and sleek design even if it made for a notably expensive device, and that it would include a fingerprint sensor instead of Face ID. These details were backed up in a newsletter from Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman, who said the phone would cost more than $US2000 ($2840).
As for the size of the device, multiple rumours indicate an outer screen size of 5.5 inches which, given the 2:3 ratio, would make for a device approximately 8cm x 12cm when closed. Quite a different shape to the latest Z Fold, which is 7cm x 16cm. It would also be the shortest iPhone since 2010’s iPhone 4.
Last year, 3D design files appeared on the internet that had supposedly (but unverifiably) leaked from Apple’s production line. They matched the above measurements, and designers used them to create digital models and 3D-printed dummies, giving glimpses of a phone that resembles a small notepad. When opened, the tablet would have a screen size of 7.8 inches, making for a device smaller than the iPad Mini by just a few centimetres on either edge.
Analyst Jeff Pu has suggested there will be multiple size options for the device, but only the one size has appeared in most rumours.
Demand for iPhones has remained consistent despite each generation of device lasting longer than the last, and despite investor hand-wringing about Apple’s perceived lack of AI features. But the overwhelming bulk of that demand is for the standard iPhone, or the Pro model, with comparatively few users going for the outlier Mini, Plus or Air models.
In fact, some reports have indicated that last year’s Air underdelivered spectacularly, with Apple cutting production to just 10 per cent of its original estimates. The ultra-thin phone is very expensive, lacks features the standard iPhone has including multiple rear cameras, and is an unproven form factor despite Apple’s claims of extraordinary durability.
Bloomberg’s Gurman claims that the design of the folding iPhone will be similar to two Air models joined together, albeit in a different shape. Apple will need to hope there is enough pent-up demand for a non-Android folding phone to counter durability concerns, especially if it claims to have also developed a brand new hinge system that eliminates the foldable screen gap.
Of course, Apple has form with introducing its own takes on devices that other manufacturers have had for years. The iPad, Apple Watch and AirPods were all late to their respective categories, and while they may not have taken off immediately, they did eventually become the overall leading models.
If Apple introduces a $3000 folding iPhone this year, it may not be met with enough immediate demand for it to overtake the standard iPhone or even Samsung’s Galaxy Z Fold. But it could win users over time, especially if Apple markets to its base of creatives who would otherwise have a phone and an iPad Mini separately.
Gurman has reported that Apple is so confident in the folding iPhone that it is already planning a follow-up that would give users the choice between the notepad style and a smaller Z Flip style device.

Burnt-out Toyota may be linked to missing 85-year-old Chris Baghsarian

Burnt-out Toyota may be linked to missing 85-year-old Chris Baghsarian
Nearly 10 days after the kidnapping of 85-year-old Chris Baghsarian, NSW Police are appealing to the public for information relating to suspicious car fires last Tuesday in Westmead that could be linked to his kidnappers.
It comes as police scoured bushland in Glenorie in Sydney’s north-west on Sunday afternoon in what they said was “part of an ongoing investigation” linked to the grandfather’s disappearance.
Baghsarian has been held hostage since February 13, when up to three men abducted him from his North Ryde home at about 5am in what police believe is a suspected case of mistaken identity.
Two vehicles were partially destroyed in suspicious fires on Good Street, Westmead, at about 11.30pm on Tuesday, February 17.
NSW Police said detectives were able to establish that the targeted vehicle was a 2022 Toyota Corolla bearing Victorian registration “1UZ2BU”, reported stolen from a Victorian address on January 13.
Investigators from Strike Force Chobat believe the decimated Toyota in the images are related to a crime scene established at a Dural property in north-west Sydney where, police believe, Baghsarian’s kidnappers may have held him hostage for some time over the past 10 days.
After reports that two vehicles were alight, Cumberland Police Area Command attended the location, not far from Parramatta Aquatic Centre, along with Fire and Rescue NSW, who extinguished the blaze.
This masthead reported last week that the Dural property was a “stronghold” used by kidnappers to hold an elderly man hostage. It matched images circulated throughout Sydney’s underworld showing the 85-year-old being tortured, as police admit hope of finding him alive is fading.
Police have issued several direct pleas to the kidnappers to return Baghsarian, who requires daily medical treatment and medication.
Baghsarian’s family said in a statement this week that he was deeply loved and a devoted father, brother, uncle and grandfather.
“The kindest person we know – someone who would never hurt a fly,” the family said in a statement released by NSW Police last Tuesday.
“Chris’ kidnapping feels surreal, and we are struggling to make sense of the fact that he has been taken, and that our family has been caught up in something that has nothing to do with us.
“We are living through a nightmare we never thought possible.”
Anyone who may have seen or heard anything, or has CCTV, dashcam and or mobile footage relating to the kidnapping, or witnessed any sort of suspicious activity in the Westmead area since last Friday is urged to contact detectives.
Anyone with information about this incident is urged to contact Crime Stoppers: 1800 333 000 or crimestoppers.com.au. Information is managed on a confidential basis. The public is reminded not to report information via NSW Police social media pages.

Now Donald Trump and the royal family know ‘the rule of law’ is no empty phrase

The shock of seeing a member of the royal family, Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor, in the back of a car after he was released from police custody will reverberate in British history for generations to come. The photograph by Phil Noble of Reuters that featured on our front page this week will send a powerful and welcome message, one that has been reinforced in a statement by the King: “The law must take its course.”
There will be those who question that course. Some will argue that the allegations of the sexual abuse of women and girls facilitated by Jeffrey Epstein, the American financier and convicted sex offender, are more serious than the vague charge of misconduct in public office in relation to the former Prince Andrew’s trade envoy role that prompted the police to act.
Others will say, and indeed have said, that the use of the power of arrest was not necessary in this case, as Mr Mountbatten-Windsor would not have refused to attend an interview voluntarily.
These, however, are second-order issues that can be addressed in due course. What is of paramount importance is the principle that no one in Britain is above the law. The last vestige of royal prerogative was swept away when Queen Elizabeth II started to pay income tax in 1993, and Britain accepted that the rule of law applies to everyone in the country, irrespective of their social or economic status.
The same principle applies, thank goodness, in the United States – the nation to which we are most prone to compare ourselves. This week’s ruling by the Supreme Court, overturning President Donald Trump’s tariffs, was a vindication of that principle – strengthened rather than diminished by Mr Trump’s graceless tirade against the six justices in the majority, calling them “a disgrace to the nation”, “fools” and “lapdogs” for the “radical left Democrats”.
Against the ravings of a bad loser, it is worth quoting the noble sentiments expressed by Justice Neil Gorsuch, who was nominated to the court by Mr Trump. His concurrence appeared almost personally addressed to the president: “Yes, legislating can be hard and take time. And, yes, it can be tempting to bypass Congress when some pressing problem arises. But the deliberative nature of the legislative process was the whole point of its design. Through that process, the nation can tap the combined wisdom of the people’s elected representatives, not just that of one faction or one man.”
Justice Gorsuch concluded: “If history is any guide, the tables will turn and the day will come when those disappointed by today’s result will appreciate the legislative process for the bulwark of liberty it is.”
Mr Trump has, naturally, cocked a snook at the court by announcing a new 15 per cent tariff on all imports – a measure that will probably be struck down and more quickly than this week’s ruling.
The US also faces a more serious “rule of law” problem than Mr Trump’s unconstitutional attempts to levy tariffs without the consent of Congress. Agents of ICE (Immigration and Customs Enforcement) appear to have been deployed by the president in something resembling a reign of terror, and the arc of justice is taking its time to bend towards ending it.
Yet this week’s Supreme Court ruling offers hope that the rule of law will eventually prevail on both fronts. It should also remind us in Britain how priceless our reputation for fair dealing truly is.
On Friday we reported that YTL, the Malaysian-based multinational company, will invest £4bn in Britain, including in the Aviva Arena, a new events venue in Bristol. “We love the UK and are pleased to be its largest Malaysian investor,” Francis Yeoh, its executive chair, said. He has previously praised Britain as a place “where the rule of law is the order of the day”.
The rule of law is no abstract principle. It is the guarantee of the rights of every member of society and the foundation of our prosperity.

'Awesome' Cherry-Evans lauded on debut by star Roosters teammate

Daly Cherry-Evans and Sam Walker show promising signs as Eels down Roosters in NRL trial
In short:
Daly Cherry-Evans has shown promising signs of a strong combination with Sam Walker in his first match in Roosters colours.
Walker, who scored a try and set up two others, said his veteran teammate had "been awesome".
New Eels pairing Mitch Moses and Jonah Pezet also combined well as the Eels sealed a comeback 28-22 win.
Daly Cherry-Evans has played his first game in Sydney Roosters colours, but it was halves partner Sam Walker who stole the show before Parramatta came back to win their pre-season clash 28-22.
With all eyes on Cherry-Evans after 15 years in Manly colours, halves partner Walker scored a try and set up two others in the Roosters' final pre-season hit out.
New Parramatta pairing Mitch Moses and Jonah Pezet also had glimpses of promise in their first outing together, playing through the opening 40 minutes together.
The Roosters led 22-12 when Cherry-Evans and James Tedesco left the field, before the Eels came back to win the game and wrap up the NRL's pre-season challenge title.
Cherry-Evans is set to be one of the most scrutinised men in the league this year, with his arrival at the Roosters making them one of the early-season favourites.
Having played all of his 352 NRL games at halfback for Manly, much will also be made of how he and Walker gel together in the Roosters' attack this year.
The 37-year-old wore number six on Saturday night with Walker at number seven, but the veteran was still the most vocal man in the Roosters' attack and spent most of the night directing traffic.
Playing on his normal right side, Cherry-Evans was also the Roosters' primary in-play kicker while the halves split their touches.
Clearly though, Cherry-Evans's presence helped free up Walker.
The halfback scored one try when he dummied to his senior halves partner and stepped through the Eels' defence to go over.
Walker then put Angus Crichton over for a try moments later with a perfect short ball on the left edge.
The halfback had also helped lay on the Roosters' first points when Isaiah Iongi spilled one of his bombs and Lindsay Collins dived on the loose ball.
And while a lightning storm after that try forced the game to be delayed for 45 minutes, it quickly became obvious Walker and Cherry-Evans had the potential to gel well.
"It was a little bit touch and go for the first 20," Walker said on Fox League at half-time.
"But I feel now we've got our flow going and are very comfortable with each other. He's been awesome."
Roosters coach Trent Robinson also confirmed Benaiah Ioelu would start the season at hooker, replacing injured recruit Reece Robson.
With Robson set to miss a month with a broken thumb, Ioelu had a role in one try on Saturday night when he ran out of dummy-half, kicked a bomb and Tommy Talau scored.
For Parramatta, Moses and Pezet linked up a few times, including in the lead-up to a disallowed try for winger Bailey Simonsson.
The slickest piece of play came with a beautiful Dylan Walker short ball for Moses, who burst through a gap and sent Matt Doorey over.
Moses handed over goalkicking duties to Pezet after that try and ran laps of the field at half-time, before not returning after the break.
But Parramatta officials have insisted that was already part of a plan for the star halfback and there was no injury concern.

Ghislaine Maxwell fights release of more Epstein documents, calling disclosure law unconstitutional

Ghislaine Maxwell fights release of more Epstein documents, calling disclosure law unconstitutional
NEW YORK (AP) — Lawyers for imprisoned British socialite Ghislaine Maxwell are fighting the requested release of 90,000 pages related to disgraced financier Jeffrey Epstein and Maxwell, saying a law used to force the public release of millions of documents is unconstitutional.
The lawyers filed papers late Friday in Manhattan federal court to try to block the release of documents from a since-settled civil defamation lawsuit brought a decade ago by the late Epstein victim Virginia Giuffre against Maxwell. The Justice Department recently asked a judge to lift secrecy requirements on the files.
Maxwell’s attorneys said the Justice Department obtained the documents — otherwise subject to secrecy orders — improperly during its criminal probe of Maxwell. They said the documents include transcripts of over 30 depositions and private information regarding financial and sexual matters related to Maxwell and others.
Some records from the year-long exchange of evidence in the lawsuit battle were already released publicly in response to a federal appeals court order.
Maxwell’s lawyers say a law Congress passed in December to force the release of millions of Epstein-related documents violates the Constitution’s separation of powers doctrine.
“Congress cannot, by statute, strip this Court of the power or relieve it of the responsibility to protect its files from misuse. To do so violates the separation of powers,” wrote the lawyers, Laura Menninger and Jeffrey Pagliuca about the Epstein Files Transparency Act.
“Under the Constitution’s separation of powers, neither Congress nor the Executive Branch may intrude on the judicial power. That power includes the power to definitively and finally resolve cases and disputes,” the lawyers added.
The release of Epstein-related documents from criminal probes that began weeks ago has resulted in new revelations about Epstein’s decades-long sexual abuse of women and teenage girls. Some victims have complained that their names and personal information were revealed in documents while the names of their abusers were blacked out.
Members of Congress have complained that only about half of existing documents, many with redactions, have been made public even as Justice Department officials have said everything has been released, except for some files that can’t be made public until a judge gives the go-ahead.
Giuffre said Epstein had trafficked her to other men, including the former Prince Andrew, now known as Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor. She sued Mountbatten-Windsor in 2021, claiming that they had sex when she was 17.
He denied her claims and the two settled the lawsuit in 2022. Days ago, he was arrested and held in custody for nearly 11 hours on suspicion of misconduct in having shared confidential trade information with Epstein.
In a memoir published after she killed herself last year, Giuffre wrote that prosecutors told her they didn’t include her in the sex trafficking prosecution of Maxwell because they didn’t want her allegations to distract the jury.
Maxwell, 64, was convicted in December 2021 and sentenced to 20 years in prison. Epstein took his own life in a federal lockup in August 2019 as he awaited trial on sex trafficking charges. Maxwell was moved from a federal prison in Florida to a low-security prison camp in Texas last summer after she participated in two days of interviews with Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche.
Two weeks ago, she declined to answer questions from House Oversight Committee lawmakers in a deposition conducted in a a video call to her federal prison camp, though she indicated through a statement from her lawyer that she was “prepared to speak fully and honestly” if granted clemency.
The Justice Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Saturday.

Trump says he’ll raise tariffs to 15 percent after Supreme Court ruling

Trump says he’ll raise tariffs to 15 percent after Supreme Court ruling
Trump says he’ll raise tariffs to 15 percent after Supreme Court ruling
WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump said Saturday that he wants a global tariff of 15%, up from 10% he had announced a day earlier after the U.S. Supreme Court struck down many of the far-reaching taxes on imports that he had imposed over the last year.
Trump’s announcement on social media was the latest sign that despite the court’s check on his powers, the Republican president still intends to ratchet up tariffs in an unpredictable way. Tariffs have been his favorite tool for rewriting the rules of global commerce and applying international pressure.
The court’s decision on Friday struck down tariffs that Trump had imposed on nearly every country using an emergency powers law. Trump now said he will use a different, albeit more limited, legal authority.
He’s already signed an executive order enabling him to bypass Congress and impose a 10% tax on imports from around the world, starting on Tuesday, the same day as his State of the Union speech. However, those tariffs are limited to 150 days unless they are extended legislatively.
The White House did not immediately respond to a message inquiring when the president would sign an updated order to peg the tariffs at 15%.
He wrote on social media that he was making the announcement “based on a thorough, detailed, and complete review of the ridiculous, poorly written, and extraordinarily anti-American decision on Tariffs issued yesterday.”
By a 6-3 vote, the justices ruled that it was unconstitutional for Trump to unilaterally set and change tariffs because the power to tax lies with Congress.
In addition to the temporary tariffs that Trump wants to set at 15%, the president said Friday that he was also pursuing tariffs through other sections of federal law which require an investigation by the Commerce Department.
He wrote on Saturday that “during the next short number of months, the Trump Administration will determine and issue the new and legally permissible Tariffs, which will continue our extraordinarily successful process of Making America Great Again.”
After the Supreme Court decision, Trump made an unusually personal attack on the justices who ruled against him in a 6-3 vote, including two of those he appointed during his first term, Justices Neil Gorsuch and Amy Coney Barrett. Trump, at a news conference on Friday, said that the situation is “an embarrassment to their families.”
He was still seething Friday night, posting on social media complaining about Gorsuch, Coney Barrett and Chief Justice John Roberts, who ruled with the majority and wrote the majority opinion. On Saturday morning, Trump issued another post declaring that his “new hero” was Justice Brett Kavanaugh, who wrote a 63-page dissent. He also praised Justices Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito, who were in the minority, and said of the three dissenting justices: “There is no doubt in anyone’s mind that they want to, MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!”
Tariffs have been central to Trump’s economic policies, which he has said address a host of ills, from reviving trade imbalances and reviving U.S. manufacturing to forcing other nations to action, whether it be stepping up efforts to combat drug trafficking or ceasing hostilities with each other.
He also regularly claimed despite evidence to the contrary that foreign governments would pay the tariffs—not American consumers and businesses.
Federal data shows the Treasury had collected more than $133 billion from the import taxes the president has imposed under the emergency powers law as of December, and Trump has made many promises about what that money might go toward, such as paying down the national debt and sending dividend checks to taxpayers. The Supreme Court decision did not address what happens to the funds that have already been collected from tariffs.
Democrats spoke out quickly on Trump’s new tariff threat. Democrats on the House Ways and Means Committee accused Trump of “pickpocketing the American people” with his newly announced higher tariff.
“A little over 24 hours after his tariffs were ruled illegal, he’s doing anything he can to make sure he can still jack up your costs,” they wrote on social media.
California Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom, a Trump nemesis, added that “he does not care about you.”

Blizzard warnings issued for New York City, New Jersey, Connecticut as storm threatens East Coast

Blizzard warnings issued from Delaware to Massachusetts as storm threatens East Coast
Blizzard warnings issued from Delaware to Massachusetts as storm threatens East Coast
NEW YORK (AP) — A rapidly intensifying storm triggered blizzard warnings Saturday for New York City, New Jersey and Boston as communities along the East Coast prepared for the Sunday arrival of heavy snow and damaging winds.
The National Weather Service increased its assessment of the potential severity of a storm that was projected to be much milder only days earlier.
The weather service said 1 to 2 feet (about 30 to 61 centimeters) of snow was possible in many areas as it issued blizzard warnings for New York City and Long Island, Boston and coastal communities in New Jersey, Connecticut, Delaware, Maryland, Rhode Island and Massachusetts. Flooding was also possible in parts of New York and New Jersey, it said.
“While we do get plenty of these nor’easters that produce heavy snow and strong impacts, it’s been several years since we saw one of this magnitude across this large of a region in this very populated part of the country,” said Cody Snell, a meteorologist at the service’s Weather Prediction Center.
Snell said the storm would arrive Sunday morning in areas around Washington before stretching toward Philadelphia and New York City and reaching Boston in the evening.
The weather service said the storm could begin as rainfall in some places before worsening, with the heaviest snowfall expected at night and as much as 2 inches (5 centimeters) of snow per hour at times in some areas, before tapering off by Monday afternoon.
The weather service warned that the storm, with steady winds of 25 to 35 mph (40 to 56 kph) would “make travel dangerous, if not impossible. Scattered downed tree limbs and power outages possible due to snow load and strong winds.”
Officials scrambled to prepare for a storm that forecasters days ago believed would have a much more limited impact.
New York Mayor Zohran Mamdani said the city would expand on efforts it used to deal with a major snowfall weeks ago. But officials held off on deciding whether to open schools Monday for the time being.
“We saw on Friday there was expectation that the likelihood was that we were going to face maybe 3 to 4 inches of snow. Quickly that then changed,” Mamdani said. “So we want to make sure that we make a decision based on up-to-date and accurate information.”
New York brought in additional snow clearing equipment from outside the city and planned to increase use of geocoding to keep track of bus stops and crosswalks that need clearing, he said.
With the storm zeroing in, John Berlingieri scrapped plans for a family trip to Puerto Rico to prepare his company, Berrington Snow Management, for what could well be a mammoth task: Clearing snow from millions of square feet of asphalt surrounding shopping malls and industrial parks across Long Island.
Employees spent the last few days recharging batteries on the company’s 40 front-end loaders and replacing windshield wipers on snow removal vehicles, before resting up Saturday.
“I’m anticipating at least one week of work around the clock,” Berlingieri said. “We’re going to work 24 to 36 hours straight, sleep for a few hours and then go back.”
The storm approached just as the icy remains of a snowstorm that struck the region weeks earlier were finally melting away.
Officials in Atlantic City, New Jersey, urged residents and casino visitors to stay off the streets, especially in low-lying neighborhoods prone to flooding.
“I could go on and on probably with a good two dozen streets where we know we will get water and there will be snow on top of that,” said Scott Evans, the city’s fire chief and emergency management coordinator. “So you won’t be able to see it until it’s too late, so therefore please stay at home.”
Many churches canceled Sunday services and other activities. To compensate, St. Veronica Parish in Howell, New Jersey, added an extra Mass on Saturday evening.
“Please stay safe, avoid unnecessary travel, and keep one another in prayer during the storm,” the Rev. Peter James Alindogan posted online.

MFA transfers over 200 DJI Matrice reconnaissance drones to Ukraine’s Defense Forces
This was reported by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, as cited by Ukrinform.
According to Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha, the units receiving the drones include Azov, Liut, the 21st Separate Mechanized Brigade, as well as the STRIX UAV unit.
He explained that diplomacy during wartime is not limited to “negotiating tables, international summits, or complex sanctions decisions,” but also includes “concrete support for our soldiers on the front line.”
“These drones were purchased with charitable donations collected in the Czech Republic. This is the result of joint work by diplomats, partners, and caring individuals who understand that supporting Ukraine is not about words, but about action,” the minister emphasized.
Sybiha stressed that the reconnaissance drones will help save the lives of Ukrainian service members, improve decision-making accuracy, and provide an advantage on the battlefield.
“When these drones were being loaded, everyone got involved – from attachés to the deputy minister. No ranks or offices. Just a team that knows exactly why it is doing this. This is not a one-time initiative for us. It is systematic work. The diplomatic front operates as continuously as all the others, and everyone is doing what is necessary for victory in their own place,” the foreign minister said.
As reported by Ukrinform, in September last yea,r the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Modern Ukraine Foundation transferred 20 fiber-optic FPV drones to the 21st Separate Mechanized Brigade, as well as three 35 kW generators for regional clinical hospitals in Zaporizhzhia, Dnipro, and Kharkiv.

US wins its record 11th gold medal at the Winter Olympics
The U.S. team won its record-breaking 11th gold medal of the Winter Olympics when the trio of Kaila Kuhn, Connor Curran and Chris Lillis took the title in mixed aerials
- Bookmark
The U.S. Olympic team won its record-breaking 11th gold medal of the Winter Games on Saturday, with at least one more good possibility when its men's hockey team wraps up the action on closing day with the title game against Canada.
The trio of Kaila Kuhn, Connor Curran and Chris Lillis gave the U.S. the record by capturing the American team's second straight title in mixed aerials.
The 11th gold breaks the country's mark set at the last Olympics on U.S. soil — in Salt Lake City in 2002, which has long stood out as a turning point for a winter sports program that had struggled over previous decades.
This could end up being another turning point, not so much for the sheer number of medals but the variety of places from which they came: Twelve of the 17 sports disciplines represented in the Winter Games produced medals for the U.S.
“Our focus and our strategy has always been about breadth,” said Sarah Hirshland, the CEO of the U.S. Olympic and Paralympic Committee. “We want to win in everything. We want to make every sport better. Some could argue there are countries that go a mile deep in certain sports and really dominate. Our goal has been to improve Winter sport across the board.”
The aerials medal, then a bronze in speedskating from Mia Manganello later in the day, lifted the U.S. to 31 overall for the Olympics with one day left.
That's second to Norway, which had a record 18 gold medals and 40 overall through Saturday evening. Seventy-two percent of the golds came in the endurance sports of cross country, biathlon and Nordic combined. The biggest gold-medal hauls for the U.S. came in four disciplines — two each (18%) in Alpine skiing, freestyle skiing, figure skating and speedskating.
There are 38 more medal events on the program this year than there were in 2002. A lot of the new events have come at the snowpark — halfpipe, slopestyle and big air — which used to be America's domain but has now been taken over by Japan, which, for instance, won nine medals in snowboarding, compared to two for the U.S.
“We stated we wanted to be a podium nation,” Fin Kirwan, the USOPC's chief of Olympic sport, said of the U.S. goal of being top-three on the medals table. “We said it will likely take 30 medals and we got after it. The athletes delivered on their potential and, by turn, we hit the record on gold-medal performance, which shows that our very best were able to execute.”
Here are some looks and links to the rest of the 11 U.S. gold medal winners:
Alex Ferreira, freeskiing
Halfpipe skier rounds out his Olympic collection — gold, silver, bronze. Back home, he’ll keep going with streamer “Hotdog Hans” where he dressed up like an 80-something ski sensation.
Breezy Johnson, Alpine skiing
Her long journey included a knee injury four years ago on the same mountain where she won the gold.
Elizabeth Lemley, moguls
Nicknamed “Lizard,” she joins a long line of great U.S. moguls skiers, including 2010 champion Hannah Kearney and her teammate, Jaelin Kauf, who now has three silver medals.
Alysa Liu, figure skating
The 20-year-old stepped away after the 2022 Beijing Games, rediscovered her love for figure skating and happily claimed the title.
Elena Myers Taylor, bobsled
At her sixth Olympics, she finally broke through, becoming the oldest Winter Olympian to win gold at age 41.
Mikaela Shiffrin, Alpine skiing
The most winning skier of all time cashes in at the Olympics with slalom gold after a tear-stained shutout four years ago.
Jordan Stolz, speedskating (2)
Joined Eric Heiden at Lake Placid in 1980 as only the second man to capture the 500 and 1,000.
US figure skating team
Liu, Amber Glenn and Ilia Malinin are among the members of a team that brings home second straight gold; the last one took two years to capture after a Russian doping saga.
US women's hockey team
A tense thriller, highlighted by Hilary Knight's equalizer with 2:04 left, then Megan Keller's winner in overtime.

Houthi mobilize troops in Yemen with unclear target, as possible strike on Iran looms in - report

05:17:17 KST

The Houthis may be mobilizing forces for an offensive, a report at Al-Ain media in the UAE said on February 21. The Houthis' objectives are unclear. However, the report of mobilization is important because it comes amid heightened tensions with Iran.
It also comes after the UAE and Saudi Arabia almost clashed over differing policies in Yemen. The Saudis have supported the government of Yemen, while the UAE has supported a group in southern Yemen called the Southern Transitional Council.
What does the Al-Ain report say? According to the report, the Houthis have mobilized on various fronts within Yemen. It may be an attempt to “ignite a new round of war.” What sources told Al-Ain is that “the Houthi militias have sent military reinforcements to Marib Governorate, where oil fields are located, and to the Hodeidah fronts on the Red Sea, in addition to reinforcements to the northern border fronts.”
Move against Saudi-backed forces?
This could indicate a Houthi move against the Riyadh-backed government forces in Yemen. It could also be part of a Houthi plan to take advantage of Saudi-UAE tensions or to pounce as US-Iran tensions grow. It’s also possible that Al-Ain is being fed misinformation designed to create tensions. Because there are so many possibilities, it is worth being skeptical about the reports.
The report goes on to say that the “sources explained that large Houthi military groups moved on Saturday from the city of Amran, located 50 kilometers north of Sana'a, led by the Houthi leader Mohammed Zaid Yahya Al-Makhdhi, nicknamed Abu Ali, to the northern border fronts of the country.”
In addition, “the sources indicated that the military force that the militias deployed to the Saada and Al-Jawf fronts on the northern borders of the country comes as part of the group’s military mobilization to all fronts,” while adding that the Houthis have also sent commanders to the Hodeidah governorate. This is an area near a port that shares the same name. This port was targeted numerous times by Israel last year when the Houthis were targeting Israel with ballistic missiles.
The report goes on to say that "the Houthis force had received intensive training at a Houthis ' training camp in Sana’a, before being deployed through Naqil Manakhah to Hodeidah. On February 18, the Houthi militias sent unprecedented reinforcements from Sana'a to the fronts of Marib Governorate, under the leadership of commander Khaled Mohammed Al-Nadhari, nicknamed Abu Ayman.”
Lastly, the report argues that Houthi fighters arrived at the Marib front. This area has been an active frontline in the past. Over the last three years, the clashes between the Houthis and the Saudi-backed Yemen government have been reduced. This is part of a wider shift in the region in which Riyadh also settled some of its problems with Iran. Riyadh has also grown closer to Turkey and Qatar over the past year, as it has distanced itself from the UAE’s policies in the region. This mostly led to a reduction in tensions with the Houthis.
Al-Ain concludes that “the unprecedented Houthi mobilization and ground attacks on the battlefronts threaten to collapse the fragile UN-brokered truce in place since 2022 and return the situation to square one, according to observers.” It is unclear if this is part of a wider attempt by Iranian-backed groups to create tensions in the region. Reports on February 21 said that Hezbollah is also considering escalation with Israel. Iranian-backed militias in Iraq have also threatened the US and Israel in the past.

Syria might close Roj Camp, last site holding ISIS-linked families, soon, officials say

The Roj camp in Syria may be shut down in the coming days or weeks, according to an official in eastern Syria. Rudaw, a Kurdish media outlet, reported on Sunday that “Roj camp, which houses families of Islamic State (ISIS) fighters, will be fully closed in the near future, a northeast Syria (Rojava) official said on Saturday.”
This report follows others saying that around 15,000 people left another large camp called al-Hol. These are some of the 50,000 families of ISIS terrorists who surrendered back in 2019. In this framework, the women and children came from some 60 countries. There were also around 7,000 men. The group that left the larger camp consisted mostly of children.
When the US-backed Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) began to clash with the Syrian government in January, there were concerns about what might happen with the estimated 25,000 people in Syria who were incarcerated in about 30 prisons and camps run by the SDF.
These facilities held male ISIS prisoners, as well as around 18,000 women and children. The women and children were mainly located in two large camps, al-Hol and Roj.
Over the last seven years, since ISIS was largely defeated in Syria in 2019, the ISIS families have slowly been repatriated by some countries. Many states, particularly in Europe, did not take back their citizens. However, Iraq eventually took back thousands of its citizens.
The ISIS families were left in limbo for a few reasons. One reason was that, although the anti-ISIS coalition had around 90 members, none of them wanted to deal directly with the SDF because they did not view it as a government.
On the other hand, they did not want the ISIS-linked women and children handed over to the Assad regime or freed. Thus, the people languished in prisons and camps.
The Syrian government joined the anti-ISIS coalition in November 2025. This meant it could not decide what to do with the ISIS detention facilities. US Central Command decided in January 2026, amid clashes between the SDF and Damascus, to move 7,000 ISIS male detainees to Iraq.
This was because Iraq has experience investigating ISIS crimes. Many of these, such as the mass murder of Yazidis, occurred in Iraq. The chaos in Syria also led some to be concerned that the ISIS men would escape.
The women and children, deemed less of a threat, were left behind at the al-Hol and Roj camps. Al-Hol fell into the hands of the Syrian government in January. Many of the women and children left the camp at this time, with only a few thousand behind.
Syria plans to let women, children go home
Syrian officials have secured the camp and visited it. They appear to believe the people should have a right to leave. Those women and children were never charged with crimes, and they have been denied any due process for seven years. Syria seems to prefer to let them go home, either to Syria, where some are from, or to their roughly 60 homelands.
Meanwhile, at Roj camp, the SDF is still in charge. It is in the spotlight because 34 Australians there want to return to Australia. Canberra, however, does not seem keen on helping them. This is the usual policy of countries, leaving their ISIS-linked citizens in Syria rather than dealing with them.
“Sheikhmous Ahmed, who supervises refugee and IDP camps in Rojava, told Rudaw that a joint decision has been made with the SDF to empty the camp,” the news source reported.
Rudaw quoted him as saying, “For this purpose, coordination has taken place with the high commissioner for refugees regarding their transfer.”
Syrian families are apparently already leaving and going home. It is not clear why the SDF continues to keep them in the Roj or al-Hol camps after the new Syrian government emerged.
“Roj camp remains under the control of the [Democratic] Autonomous Administration [of North and East Syria] (DAANES) and is guarded by Asayish [SDF-linked] security forces. Ahmed stressed that the area around the camp is stable and free of ISIS cells, and that aid organizations continue to provide services daily,” according to Rudaw.
It noted that there are some 730 foreign families from 42 countries in the camp. In addition, there are a handful of Iraqis and Syrians there as well. “Approximately 2,225 people live in the camp, according to the Kurdish official.”
Now the SDF is moving to deal with the Roj camp, sending inmates home to be repatriated. Yet, it is unclear why this process did not happen a year ago.
“Previously, contacts were conducted through the [US-led] global coalition and the SDF’s foreign relations office,” Ahmed said. “Now, any country wishing to repatriate its citizens must directly contact the DAANES, and we are ready to provide all necessary facilitation.”

Trump's options on Iran: Trump weighs 'token' Iran enrichment in narrow nuclear compromise - report

The Trump administration is considering an Iranian proposal that would allow so‑called “token” uranium enrichment, according to senior US officials cited by Axios.
The potential concession would test the limits of longstanding US demands that Iran’s nuclear program not leave any possible path to a bomb.
Under the scenario outlined, Washington would evaluate a written Iranian offer in which Tehran retains minimal enrichment capacity but with strict safeguards to prevent any route to weaponization.
The report suggests this represents a narrow diplomatic opening between the red lines of the two sides, even as pressure mounts on the possibility of wider conflict.
At the same time, US President Donald Trump has been presented with military options that involve directly targeting the supreme leader, and US naval and air forces continue to arrive in the Middle East.
Potential US-Iran bargain on enrichment
Publicly, US officials have maintained that zero enrichment remains the standard for any deal with Tehran.
But US sources told Axios that the administration is open to a limited compromise, as long as it can be verified that any uranium enrichment is purely civilian and cannot be used as a stepping‑stone toward nuclear weapons development.
Tehran’s own position on enrichment appears to have evolved in recent talks. While Tehran has maintained a rigid stance on the issue, vowing that no external pressure will impact negotiations, Iranian officials have signaled willingness to reduce the level and perhaps the purity of uranium already enriched to 60 percent, a level far above what is needed for civil nuclear power but below weapons‑grade. This approach would hinge on monitoring by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA).
On Monday, Iran's foreign minister, Abbas Araghchi, met the UN nuclear watchdog chief, Rafael Grossi, ahead of US-Iran nuclear talks to tackle their dispute over Tehran's nuclear program.
Days later, in an interview with MS NOW’s Joe Scarborough, Araghchi claimed that Iran was willing to implement “confidence-building measures” to “ensure that Iran's program cannot even be diverted to non-peaceful purposes” such as the possible construction of nuclear weapons.
Iran is said to be preparing a written counterproposal to send to Washington after approval in Tehran, Axios reported. The timing and details are unclear, but diplomats have indicated that the offer could outline limits on the number of centrifuges and the level of enrichment, framed to demonstrate compliance with peaceful use only.
Military options still on the table
Despite these diplomatic maneuvers, the US military buildup in the region continues to fuel uncertainty in Tehran and allied capitals. US officials have presented Trump with a series of operational options intended to either compel Iran to accept US terms or, if diplomacy fails, degrade Iran’s nuclear and military infrastructure.
On Thursday, US Senator Lindsey Graham said that planning was underway for a possible joint US-Israel attack on Iran. Trump later added that the US was considering an initial, limited strike on Iran to force Tehran to agree to his demands regarding a deal.
“President Trump will be ready to accept a deal that would be substantive and that he can sell politically at home,” one senior official said, warning that if Tehran “plays games, there won’t be a lot of patience.”

Italy's RAI apologizes after latest gaffe targets Israeli bobsleigh team

Italy's state broadcaster RAI was forced to apologize to the Jewish community on Saturday after an off‑air remark advising its producers to "avoid" the Israeli crew was broadcast before coverage of the Four-Man bobsleigh event at the Winter Olympics.
The head of RAI's sports division had already resigned earlier in the week after his error-ridden commentary at the Milano Cortina 2026 opening ceremony two weeks ago triggered a revolt among its journalists.
On Saturday, viewers heard "Let's avoid crew number 21, which is the Israeli one," and then "no, because ..." before the sound was cut off.
"I firmly condemn the statements made today by a RAI journalist regarding the Israeli bobsleigh delegation at the Milan-Cortina 2026 Winter Olympics," said Jonathan Peled, Israel's ambassador, on social media.
"There should be no room in sport for incitement to hatred, discrimination based on national, cultural, or religious beliefs, and any offensive rhetoric.
Italian broadcasters apologize after hateful comments about Israeli Olympic athletes
"We are confident that the RAI management will take all necessary measures to ensure that similar incidents are not repeated," he said.
RAI CEO Giampaolo Rossi said the incident represented a "serious" breach of the principles of impartiality, respect, and inclusion that should guide the public broadcaster.
He added that RAI had opened an internal inquiry to swiftly determine any responsibility and any potential disciplinary procedures.
In a separate statement, RAI's board of directors condemned the remark as "unacceptable." The board apologized to the Jewish community, the athletes involved, and all viewers who felt offended.
RAI is the country's largest media organization and operates national television, radio, and digital news services.
The union representing RAI journalists, Usigrai, had said Paolo Petrecca's opening ceremony commentary had dealt "a serious blow" to the company's credibility.
His missteps included misidentifying venues and public figures, and making comments about national teams that were widely criticized.

Ellyse Perry's 350th international match has been soured as India claimed a 17-run win in a series-deciding T20 in Adelaide.
Indian opener Smriti Mandhana top-scored with 82 off just 55 deliveries and featured in a 120-run stand with World Cup hero Jemimah Rodrigues.
India's 6-176 was the highest ever women's T20 international score at the Adelaide Oval.
Australia's women cricketers have slipped to a 17-run loss to India in their series-deciding Twenty20 fixture.
India claimed a 2-1 series triumph after posting 5-176 on Saturday night at Adelaide Oval, the highest women's T20 international score at the venue.
Australia mustered 9-159 in reply, losing traction after their initial three wickets fell in a 13-ball span.
The match was Ellyse Perry's 350th international match.
"It was a bit of a bugger, we couldn't get the result for her tonight," Australia captain Sophie Molineux said of Perry.
"She's a special person, a special cricketer, she has done so much for the game and continues to."
Australian openers Georgia Voll and Beth Mooney cracked 18 runs from the first over, delivered by Renuka Singh Thakur.
But Voll (10) and Mooney (six) were dismissed in a space of six balls.

Australian great Perry scored only one. She advanced to spinner Shreyanka Patil and attempted a big drive but missed and was bowled.
Perry's dismissal left the hosts reeling at 3-32 in the fourth over and Phoebe Litchfield and Ash Gardner steadied with a 31-run stand.
But Litchfield (26 from 17 balls) was caught in the deep from consecutive switch-hits. She smacked a four from the first one to leave the hosts 4-63 in the ninth over.
The Australians were 4-78 at the midpoint and Gardner gave her side a sniff, making 57 from 45 balls before she too was caught in the deep.

Gardner's departure started another Australian slump of 4-15.
"We actually thought we kept them to a good score. It was a pretty good wicket," Molineux said.
"We just lost some pretty important wickets at the wrong point in time."
Earlier, Indian opener Smriti Mandhana top-scored with a superb 82 from 55 balls and featured in a 120-run partnership with No.3 Jemimah Rodrigues (59 from 46).
Australia struck early when quick Kim Garth (1-25) dismissed Shafali Verma (seven) in the third over.
Mandhana and Rodrigues then produced their fine stand, powering the tourists to 1-86 at the midpoint of their innings.
The 29-year-old Mandhana registered her half-century from only 38 balls by smacking Darcie Brown over the midwicket fence for six.
The partnership was finally broken in the 17th over when Mandhana lofted Annabel Sutherland (2-34) into the legside only for Gardner to make swift ground from deep midwicket and take a catch on the run.
The nations meet again on Tuesday in Brisbane for the first of three 50-over fixtures, ahead of a Test match starting March 6 at the WACA Ground in Perth.
Those matches will be the last for ex-Australian skipper Alyssa Healy before she retires.
"[Healy] is going to bring an injection of some real excitement," Molineux said.
"It's going to be her last four games for Australia and we're going to do everything possible to send her off on the right note."
The trophy at the end of the multi-format series is decided on a points system, with two points for a T20 and 50-over victory and four points on offer for a Test triumph.

Brazil and India agree to boost cooperation on rare earths
Brazil and India have signed a new deal to cooperate on rare earths and other critical minerals
- Bookmark
Brazil and India sealed a deal Saturday on critical minerals and rare earths, enhancing cooperation on crucial resources between two major countries of the global south as they seek to diversify their trading relationships.
The non-binding memorandum of understanding on rare earths establishes a framework for cooperation between the two countries, focusing on reciprocal investment, exploration, mining and artificial intelligence applications, among other issues.
Brazil has the world’s second-largest reserves of rare earth minerals, used in a wide range of products, including smartphones, electric vehicles, solar panels and jet engines.
“Increasing investments and cooperation in matters of renewable energy and critical minerals is at the core of a pioneering agreement that we have signed today,” Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva told journalists.
The two countries also agreed legal frameworks on a range of topics including entrepreneurship, health, scientific research and education.
Lula arrived in India for a state visit on Wednesday that will last through to Sunday, seeking to deepen ties with India which, like Brazil, is a founding member of the BRICS+ bloc of developing nations. He participated in a summit on artificial intelligence.
Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi visited Brazil in July last year, while the trip to India was Lula’s second state visit.
Lula was accompanied by 11 ministers, including those of foreign affairs, finance, health and agriculture, as well as a large delegation of business leaders. The Brazilian leader on Saturday said it may be the biggest delegation of his trips abroad so far, which he called a sign of his commitment to India.
The deal on rare earths is part of a broader strategy from both India and Brazil to become more strategically autonomous from China and the U.S. through diversification, said Oliver Stuenkel, an international relations professor at the Getulio Vargas Foundation, a think tank and university.
Brazil has been pursuing that strategy for years, said Stuenkel, which is why Lula was able to stand up to President Donald Trump last year when the U.S. leader imposed a 50% tariff on Brazilian exports to the country over the trial of his ally, former President Jair Bolsonaro.
“The reading is that, given how turbulent and unpredictable things have become, the more partners, the better,” Stuenkel said.
The U.S. later removed most tariffs on Brazil and the sanctions imposed on the judge who was overseeing the case.
Roberto Goulart Menezes, an international relations professor at the University of Brasilia, said that last year’s confrontation with the U.S. is when Brazil germinated the idea of putting rare earths and critical minerals on the bargaining table.
“Brazil began to reposition its understanding of the importance of these elements beyond their commercial dimension, recognizing their geopolitical relevance,” said Goulart.
Lula is expected to visit his counterpart in Washington D.C. in the coming months. “For Brazil, this agreement represents a kind of pilot before negotiating with a country with which Brazil has an asymmetrical relationship,” Goulart said.

Ukraine's commander-in-chief says war not at stalemate, situation could have been far worse
Oleksandr Syrskyi, Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, believes that the Russo-Ukrainian war has not reached a stalemate and that Moscow's objectives for 2025 were far more ambitious than its actual achievements.
Source: Syrskyi in an interview with Le Monde
Details: The article notes that the multiplicity of military operations leads Syrskyi, unlike his predecessor Valerii Zaluzhnyi, to assert that "the war has not reached a stalemate". Not only do territories continue to change hands, but "the war is being fought in all domains – on land, in the air and at sea", and "it is now impossible to speak exclusively about a ground war".
Speaking about 2025, Syrskyi said the military situation could have been significantly worse, as Russia's objectives were much more ambitious.
Quote: "Russia prepared its forces to conduct a large-scale offensive operation in 2025. It wanted to seize the entire Donbas, territories in Zaporizhzhia, Dnipropetrovsk and Kherson oblasts, and to create a buffer zone in Kharkiv and Sumy oblasts, but it failed to do so."
Details: Syrskyi also stressed that although Russian forces had been reputed to have an inexhaustible supply of manpower, while the Ukrainian army faced difficulties recruiting new soldiers, 2025 became the first year of the war when "the losses of the Russian army exceeded its recruitment levels".
He stated that "despite managing to mobilise and conscript 406,000 personnel in 2025, their total losses, including those killed and wounded, amounted to around 418,000 soldiers".
Background:
- In November 2023, Valerii Zaluzhnyi, who at the time was commander-in-chief of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, said in an interview with The Economist that the situation on the front had reached a stalemate, where neither side could advance due to equal technological capabilities. He compared it to the First World War.
- President Volodymyr Zelenskyy disagreed with him at the time.
- On 8 February 2024, Zelenskyy signed a decree relieving Zaluzhnyi of his duties as commander-in-chief of the Armed Forces.

Two Israeli businessmen held for 18 days in Zambia on terror suspicion after hotel explosion

Two Israeli businessmen in their mid-30s were detained for 18 days in Zambia on suspicion of involvement in terrorism after an explosion in their hotel room in the capital, Lusaka, authorities and their attorney said.
The incident dates back to September, when the two men, who work for an agricultural company in Malawi bordering Zambia, were staying at the InterContinental hotel in Lusaka.
According to their account, they placed a bottle of fertilizer in the room’s refrigerator, intending to take it back with them to Malawi. For reasons that remain unclear, the substance exploded inside the refrigerator, completely burning the room and causing damage to adjacent rooms.
The two men left Zambia shortly afterward and returned to Malawi.
Four months later, they re-entered Zambia and were arrested at a border crossing after authorities determined they were wanted in connection with the explosion. They were taken for questioning by Zambia’s counterterrorism unit on suspicion of links to terrorism, based on the blast in a room registered in their names.
The two men said they had received the bottle of fertilizer from another employee of their agricultural company and were instructed to keep it refrigerated. They told investigators they were unaware the substance could ignite or explode.
The counterterrorism unit rejected their explanation and also suspected they had intended to smuggle a drone, according to their attorney.
The men were held in difficult conditions in two separate detention facilities to prevent them from coordinating their accounts. Each was held in a small cell with 14 other detainees.
Israel’s ambassador to Zambia, Ofra Farhi, and the embassy’s security officer visited the detainees, and at their request conditions of detention were improved. The ambassador and security officer also met with investigators and officials from Zambia’s Interior Ministry.
After more than two weeks of questioning, the counterterrorism unit ruled out terrorism suspicions. On Friday, the two businessmen were deported from Zambia and barred from returning.
Attorney Mordechai Tzivin, who specializes in representing Israelis facing legal trouble abroad, said: “I am pleased with the release and thank the law enforcement authorities in Zambia for reaching the conclusion that these are legitimate businessmen — that no wrongdoing was found in their actions and that the suspicion of involvement in terrorism was proven unfounded — as well as representatives of the Foreign Ministry and the embassy in Zambia for their intensive efforts and meetings with senior Zambian officials and the Zambian ambassador to Israel.”

Julien Macdonald proves the ‘king of glamour’ is back at London Fashion Week
Ella Eyre and Montana Brown were among those sitting front row.
- Bookmark
Julien Macdonald made a high-shine return to London Fashion Week, staging his autumn/winter 2026 comeback on the interior rooftop of The Shard with a collection that reaffirmed his reputation as fashion’s self-styled “king of glamour”.
Perched high above the capital, guests nursed martinis as the Welsh designer sent out a procession of sequinned, sculpted silhouettes against the glittering night skyline.
Singer Ella Eyre was among those seated front row, watching as Macdonald delivered a show steeped in his signature high-octane energy.
It marked Macdonald’s first London Fashion Week runway since restructuring his business in 2023, and the message was unmistakable: unapologetic, maximalist glamour is back.
Macdonald, 54, who launched his label in 1997 and has previously held high-profile roles at Chanel and Givenchy, has long been synonymous with red-carpet showstoppers. His return leaned fully into that legacy, delivering a collection of high-impact eveningwear designed for drama rather than understatement.
The show opened with fluid, body-skimming gowns in metallic tones, including a liquid gold halter-neck dress that plunged dramatically at the front and twisted into a draped, thigh-split skirt.
The silhouette elongated the body, the fabric catching the light with every step, evoking the kind of paparazzi-ready moment Macdonald’s celebrity clientele – from Beyonce to Jennifer Lopez – have made their own.
Sequins were deployed liberally across the collection. A sharply cut, long-sleeved column dress in burnished bronze shimmered under the spotlights, its structured shoulders lending to Macdonald’s siganture statuesque quality.
Elsewhere, micro silhouettes dominated: a black, crystal-embellished two-piece with sheer shorts and cut-out detailing left little to the imagination, styled with pared-back heels to keep the focus on the body.
Feathers, which have been trending on the runway, gave a theatrical flourish to the collection.
A mint-green, crystal-studded bodysuit was paired with a matching feathered robe that trailed behind the model, its texture softening the overt sensuality of the barely-there base layer.
In another look, a sheer black gown with feathered hem detailing glided down the runway, balancing transparency with movement.
There was little concession to winter in the traditional sense. Despite the autumn/winter billing, Macdonald’s world remains resolutely summer – or at least permanently party-bound.
Backless gowns, plunging necklines and high-cut bodysuits dominated, with sheer panels and strategic cut-outs forming a recurring motif. One pale green, sequin-drenched gown featured a deep V neckline gathered at the waist and a front slit that revealed just enough leg, merging red-carpet polish with beach-club ease.
The setting at The Shard amplified the excitement for this comeback show. With London’s skyline twinkling beyond the glass, the show felt less like a seasonal presentation and more like a celebration – a statement of resilience and return.
If much of this season’s schedule has leaned into restraint then Macdonald offered a fun alternative of high-octane, unapologetic, old-school glamour.
The designer has signalled a shift towards a more accessible luxury ready-to-wear model, focusing on versatile embellished pieces. While the collection remained firmly in the eveningwear sphere, several looks – streamlined sequinned dresses and sharply cut cocktail numbers – suggested a commercial sensibility beneath the glitz.
Macdonald was named British Fashion Designer of the Year in 2001 and appointed chief designer at Givenchy the same year, succeeding Alexander McQueen. More than two decades later, his formula of sequins, skin and skimpy silhouettes remains largely unchanged.
Julien Macdonald’s return delivered something of a jolt of joy above the London skyline.

Hezbollah braces for war as IRGC takes command

Hezbollah is stepping up military and security meetings as it braces for a possible war against Israel, according to a report by the Saudi-owned Al Arabiya network.
Sources close to the Lebanese terrorist organization told the network that Hezbollah is now effectively being run by officers from Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps rather than by Lebanese officials.
The officers, the sources said, are not only overseeing efforts to rebuild the terrorist organization after months of fighting but are also directly supervising operational plans and holding meetings with Hezbollah commanders in more than one area to issue instructions and guidance.
According to the report, some of the Iranian officers have been in Lebanon for some time, while others arrived recently amid the possibility of a US attack on the Islamic Republic of Iran.
The sources also disclosed that Iranian officers recently met with Hezbollah's missile unit in the Beqaa Valley, which was targeted in an Israeli strike on Friday. They assessed that a broader Israeli attack against Hezbollah is "inevitable" and that it is "only a matter of time" before a conflict erupts.

Ukraine’s MFA responds to blackmail by Hungary and Slovakia: Ultimatums should be sent to Kremlin, not to Kyiv
This is stated in a statement issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Ukraine, according to Ukrinform.
“Such actions, in the context of massive and targeted Russian strikes on Ukraine's energy infrastructure and Moscow's attempts to deprive Ukrainians of electricity, heating, and gas during extreme cold weather, are provocative, irresponsible, and threaten the energy security of the entire region,” the Foreign Ministry said.
The statement stresses that by acting in this way, the governments of Hungary and Slovakia are not only playing into the hands of the aggressor but are also harming their own energy companies that operate on a commercial basis.
The Foreign Ministry noted that Ukraine remains in constant contact with representatives of the European Commission regarding damage to energy infrastructure caused by daily Russian strikes.
Ukraine has also conveyed information to the governments of Hungary and Slovakia about the consequences of these attacks for the Druzhba oil pipeline infrastructure. It is emphasized that, under the constant threat of new missile attacks, security and stabilization repair work is ongoing. Ukraine has also proposed alternative solutions for supplying these countries with non-Russian oil.
“Ukraine has always been, is, and will remain a reliable energy partner of the EU and a transit country for energy resources. At the same time, in light of the unfounded and irresponsible threats coming from Budapest and Bratislava in recent days, Ukraine is considering the possibility of activating the Early Warning Mechanism provided for in the Association Agreement between Ukraine and the European Union,” the ministry said.
In this context, the Foreign Ministry calls on the governments of Hungary and the Slovak Republic to engage constructively and behave responsibly, stressing:
“Ultimatums should be sent to the Kremlin, and certainly not to Kyiv.”
As previously reported by Ukrinform, on February 20, Hungarian Foreign Minister Péter Szijjártó wrote on social media that his country would block the EU’s allocation of funds to Ukraine under a €90 billion loan until the transit of Russian oil through the Druzhba pipeline was restored.
Meanwhile, Slovak Prime Minister Robert Fico stated on Saturday that if Ukraine did not resume oil transit to Slovakia, he would initiate a halt to electricity supplies to Ukraine on Monday.

The political drama directed by Ilker Çatak won the top prize at the Berlin International Film Festival 2026. The German-Turkish filmmaker accepted the Golden Bear from jury president Wim Wenders. Other major winners included Salvation, Queen at Sea, and Rose.
'Yellow Letters,' directed by German filmmaker Ilker Catak, has taken home the Golden Bear for best film at the Berlin Film Festival 2026.
The political drama tells the story of a Turkish director and his actor wife who are suddenly barred from working because of their political opinions.
Jury president Wim Wenders called the film "a terrifying premonition, a look into the near future that could possibly happen in our countries as well".
"This is a movie that speaks up very clearly about the political language of totalitarianism as opposed to the empathetic language of cinema," Wenders said.
The runner-up Silver Bear Grand Jury Prize went to "Salvation" by Emin Alper, who in his speech mentioned his solidarity with several high-profile opposition figures in prison in Turkey, including jailed Istanbul mayor Ekrem Imamoglu.
Alper also took the opportunity to speak up for "the people of Iran suffering under tyranny" and "the Palestinians in Gaza living and dying under the most terrible conditions".
'Part of democracy'
Speaking at a press conference at the beginning of the festival last week, jury president Wim Wenders answered a question about the German government's support for Israel by saying: "We cannot really enter the field of politics."
At the same press conference, he had said that films had the power to "change the world" but in a different way from politics.
But his comments in response to the question on Israel prompted a storm of outrage.
Award-winning Indian novelist Arundhati Roy, who had been due to present a restored version of a 1989 film she wrote, pulled out of the event, branding Wenders' words "unconscionable" and "jaw-dropping".
On Tuesday, an open letter signed by dozens of film industry figures, including actors Javier Bardem and Tilda Swinton and director Adam McKay, condemned the Berlin festival's "silence on the genocide of Palestinians" and accused it of being involved in "censoring" artists who oppose Israel's actions.
Director Tricia Tuttle, in her second year at the helm of the Berlinale, has firmly rejected the accusations.
In a speech at the beginning of Saturday's ceremony she said that "speaking up is part of democracy".
"We respect people speaking out because it takes a lot of courage to do it," she said, adding: "We don't always agree with every claim that's made about us".
'Queen at Sea'
Other big award winners included German actress Sandra Hueller, who received the Silver Bear for Best Performance for her title role in Markus Schleinzer's "Rose".
The black-and-white drama tells the story of a woman passing herself off as a man in rural 17th-century Germany to escape the constraints of patriarchy.
"Queen at Sea" by American director Lance Hammer, which stars Juliette Binoche as a woman caring for her mother with dementia, picked up two awards.
The film sensitively portrays the devastation Alzheimer's disease inflicts on a patient's loved ones.
Tom Courtenay and Anna Calder-Marshall, who plays the ailing mother in the film, shared the Silver Bear for Best Supporting Performance.
The film also picked up the Silver Bear Jury Prize, considered the third most prestigious award.
The first major event of the film calendar also provided a platform for Iranian filmmakers to address the deadly crackdown on anti-government protests in their home country.
Dissident director Jafar Panahi, who won the Cannes Palme d'Or for "It Was Just An Accident", also spoke at the Berlinale to denounce the Iranian government's repression of protestors, which rights groups say left thousands dead.
"An unbelievable crime has happened. Mass murder has happened. People are not even allowed to mourn their loved ones," Panahi told a talk organised as part of the festival.

Salsa legend Willie Colón dies at age 75, family says

Feb 21 - American salsa legend Willie Colon, the pioneering trombonist, vocalist and composer, died on Saturday at age 75, his family said in a statement.
"While we grieve his absence, we also rejoice in the timeless gift of his music and the cherished memories he created that will live on forever," the family said on Colon's Facebook page.
The cause of death was not disclosed.
Born in the Bronx to Puerto Rican parents, Colón recorded dozens of albums including La Gran Fuga (The Big Break) in 1970 and El Juicio in 1972, according to Fania Records, a label that promoted salsa music.
He signed with Fania at age 15 and two years later, in 1967, released his first album El Malo, which has sold more than 300,000 copies, according to his biography on the LA Philharmonic website.
Colón's music combined elements of jazz, rock and salsa, incorporating the rhythms of traditional music from Cuba, Puerto Rico, Brazil, and Africa, the biography said.
"A significant overarching theme in Colón’s music—which draws from many cultures and several different styles—is an exploration of the competing associations that Puerto Ricans have with their home and with the United States," it said.
"He uses his songs to depict and investigate the problems of living in the U.S. as a Puerto Rican and also to imply the cultural contributions that Puerto Ricans have to offer."
In 2004, he received a lifetime achievement award from the Latin Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences.
A longtime social activist, Colón was a member of the Latino Commission on AIDS and the United Nations Immigrant Foundation and was a board member at the Congressional Hispanic Caucus Institute, according to the biography. REUTERS

Willie Colón, a legendary trombonist and pioneer of salsa music, has died. He was 75.
His death on Saturday was confirmed in a Facebook post by his longtime manager, Pietro Carlos.
News of the singer’s condition circulated on the web in recent days. Yonkers Voice News reported Colón was admitted to NewYork-Presbyterian Westchester hospital in Bronxville, N.Y., on Tuesday with respiratory problems and he appeared fragile.
Born William Anthony Colón Román on April 28, 1950, to Puerto Rican parents in New York City, Colón first picked up the trumpet in school. It seemed like a natural choice for the former bugle-playing Boy Scout, who attended the youth program at the suggestion of his grandmother.
“So I could learn how to be a good boy,” said Colón in a 1988 interview with Associated Press.
By age 13, Colón had started a band and played at some weddings and in the bustling nightclubs of New York City. At one point, he forged a cabaret card, a mandated ID for musicians and entertainers between 1940 and 1967 who worked in establishments serving alcohol, which required individuals to be 18 years and older.
The thrilling 1960s Latin music scene in New York consumed Colón, who was deeply inspired by Latin jazz pioneer and bandleader Eddie Palmieri, once part of a main act at the Palladium Ballroom who went on to form La Perfecta, a Cuban conjunto that revolutionized the New York Latin music scene with its inclusion of two trombones, played by Barry Rogers and Jose Rodriguez, instead of the costly four-set trumpets.
But Colón’s instrumental preference changed once he heard the bodied timbre of Mon Rivera’s all-trombone brass lineup marching to a bomba beat. “It would knock my socks off,” said Colón in a 1988 interview with Associated Press, leading the singer to teach himself how to play the instrument.
By age 15, Colón was signed to Fania Records. Two years later at age 17, he went on to release his debut album, “El Malo,” a record that defined the fierce sounds of New York’s salsa scene, which Colón later described as the Latin equivalent of rap.
According to his former label, the name of “El Malo” was bestowed upon Colón by older musicians who sought to mock his trombone range at the time, though the young bandleader would find a way to use the label to his advantage.
On the LP, Colón’s sound moved away from the polished mambo sounds of orchestral bands decades prior, in large part due to Puerto Rican singer Héctor Lavoe, whose vocals can be heard in tracks like the gritty “El Malo” that vows to knock out any wanna-be street phony.
The pair would go on to record a total of 14 albums through 1973, with Lavoe’s talents for improvisation complementing Colón’s raw, aggressive trombone.
“Salsa came from the same kind of situation that rap does,” Colon said in a 1992 interview with The Times. “It was kind of a hybrid of a bunch of different elements. Hector had just come from Puerto Rico and didn’t speak English. I didn’t speak much Spanish, I was a little New York kid. We got together and just started with the same kind of irreverent, rebellious attitude, writing songs about the baddest guy on the block, drugs and sex. Before that, the lyrics and whole attitude of Latin music was, ‘Look at me dance, listen to those drums, I’m cutting sugar cane.’ It was a rural, folkloric emphasis; we changed it to an inner-city kind of culture.”
Colón’s impact went beyond live music. The album cover of “El Malo,” which showed two serious profiles of Colón, depicted the singer as a sly bad boy, and ultimately gave rise to his gangster persona, which would be a throughline in future projects, including his sophomore 1968 album, “The Hustler” which featured the band with fitted suits, smoking cigars and placing bets in a pool hall. His 1970 album “Cosa Nuestra” featured Colón smoking a cigar while overlooking a dead body in broad daylight in Manhattan’s East River Bikeway. Most famously, his 1971 album, “La Gran Fuga,” depicted the singer on a fake FBI “Most Wanted” poster.
These mob-like depictions occurred long before cult-favorite films like Francis Ford Coppola’s 1972 “The Godfather” and Brian De Palma 1983’s “Scarface” became the prominent gangster storylines various male acts venerate in their music.
By 1973, Colón and Lavoe split — allegedly due to Lavoe’s drug addiction leading to many missed concert performances — although the two would remain frequent collaborators until the latter’s death in 1993 due to complications of AIDS.
The Nuyorican musician would introduce Blades as the new singer of his orchestra, whom he had met years prior while visiting Panama during carnivals. They collaborated briefly on Colón’s 1975 LP “The Good, the Bad, the Ugly,” cementing their partnership in the 1977 album “Metiendo Mano,” which delved into socio-political themes, notably in their track “Pablo Pueblo,” which shares the story of a working class man with broken dreams halted by toils of daily life. Other tracks like “Plantación Adentro,” detailed the story of Camilo Manrique, a fictionalized enslaved character who died at the hands of a Spanish colonizer in 1745.
Many considered this album Colón’s first foray into intellectual salsa — in large part because of Blades, who had a knack for storytelling and political interests (he unsuccessfully ran for president of Panama in 1994) — that addressed colonialism and class disparities. Together they released three albums, including their 1978 “Siembra,” one of the bestselling salsa albums at that time; from the start, their track “Plastico” fused the popular disco music of the moment while addressing superficial beauty standards and colorism in Latin America.
According to 1996 reporting by The Times, “Siembra” delivered pulsating salsa rhythms that “carried messages of freedom at a time when most of Latin America was oppressed by military dictatorships.”
By 1982, Blades and Colón parted ways, but they collaborated again on projects like their 2005 LP “Tras La Tormenta” — which led the bandleader to sing for the first time in his career, “I had to start from zero, and it took me many years to feel comfortable,” Colón said.
This newfound independence gave rise to some of Colón’s most famous songs, including his 1995 track “Talento de Televisión,” an upbeat song with his signature trombone wailing in the backdrop as he sang about an attractive woman with a lack of talent.
Many across Latin America might be familiar with his 1989 song “El Gran Varon” — which narrated the story of a trans woman who is rejected by her father and presumably dies of AIDS — a landmark salsa song that brought awareness to LGBTQ+ themes during the AIDS crisis. Colón would later serve as a member of the Latino Commission on AIDS. “El Gran Varon” is an anthem to this day.
Colón released more than 40 albums in all.
He also acted, taking roles in films including 1982’s “Vigilante,” the 1983 sports drama “The Last Fight,” as well as one-episode stints in TV shows like “Miami Vice” and “The Cosby Show.” He was even featured in Bad Bunny’s “Nuevayol” music video, cutting a slice of cake; the 31-year-old superstar pays homage to the singer in its lyrics: “Willie Colón, me dicen el malo, ey. Porque pasan los años y sigo dando palo”/ “Willie Colón, they say I’m bad, because the years come and I’m still hitting.”
In his later years, he became more involved in politics. In 1994, he unsuccessfully went up against U.S. Rep. Eliot Engel of the Bronx in the Democratic primary. He also ran as a Democrat for Public Advocate in 2001, focusing on community issues, education and AIDS awareness, but failed to gain the popular vote. In 2008, he endorsed Hillary Rodham Clinton over Barack Obama in the primary election.
On May 26, 2014, after graduating from Westchester County Police Academy, Colón was sworn in as a deputy sheriff for the Department of Public Safety, later becoming deputy lieutenant.
As President Trump took office in his first term, Colón’s politics shifted in support of the right-wing candidate, and he said he would be open to performing at his inauguration in 2017.
Billboard magazine named him one of the most influential Latino artists of all time in 2018. Colón’s death sparked an outpouring of condolences across the Latin music world.
Oscar D’León, a Grammy-nominated salsa artist, frequently performed alongside Colón as the genre rose to prominence internationally. He hailed Colón as an architect of the genre.
“How difficult it is to say goodbye to a giant! Today, salsa mourns the passing of my great brother and colleague, Willie Colón,” D’León wrote in Spanish on Instagram.
“Willie, you leave an indelible legacy in each of us. That trombone of yours, with its rebellious and unique sound, forever changed the history of our Latin music. As a trombonist, you created a school, but as a composer and arranger, you were an absolute genius, a true architect of salsa. You are and always will be one of the greatest pillars of our genre.”
Grupo Niche, the legendary Colombian salsa orchestra, was one of many music groups across Latin America that praised Colón’s contribution to salsa music, extolling him as “an absolute icon of our culture.”
“Songs that marked generations, stories that became anthems, and an artistic force that transformed salsa forever,” a post on the orchestra’s Instagram said.
Marc Anthony, the best-selling salsa artist of all time who admired Colón, also offered a brief tribute on Instagram.
“Maestro, thank you for your legacy,” Anthony wrote in Spanish along with a photo of the two performing together. “Your music will live forever.”
Colón is survived by his wife, Julia Colón, and his four sons and grandsons.

Far-right anti-Islam march sparks counterprotests in Manchester
Hundreds of Britain First protesters faced larger antifascist crowds in a tense Manchester city centre standoff.
Manchester, United Kingdom – Chants of “send them back” echoed through a damp underpass as hundreds of far-right anti-Islam protesters prepared to march through the streets.
Union Jacks fluttered in the wind as protesters – some visibly under the influence of alcohol – chanted a series of anti-immigration slogans and derisive comments about British Prime Minister Keir Starmer.

In response to the demonstration organised by Britain First, a far-right political party that calls for mass deportation and the removal of migrants and Muslims from the UK, a counterprotest was also planned for midday on Saturday.
It formed a much larger crowd made up of antifascist protesters who gathered a few streets away, carrying antiracist banners and waving an array of flags, including the Palestinian flag.
Ruby, 20, a student from South London, took a five-hour coach ride to show her support for the counterprotest and told Al Jazeera that attending was a “no-brainer”. She asked that her surname not be published, fearing repercussions.
‘A master race’
Ruby said her grandparents, originally from Montserrat, were part of the Windrush generation – immigrants invited to the UK between 1948 and 1971 from Caribbean countries – and, despite having given so much to their adopted country, are now feeling increasingly unwelcome.
She said her grandparents had told her they were witnessing a return to the levels of racism they experienced when they came to the country in the 1950s.
It was a sentiment echoed by Llowelyn, 16, a counter-protester from Wales who said her father, who is British Guyanese, has received more verbal abuse based on his race in the past few years than at any other point.
The tension was palpable before the two marches were due to begin, with far-right agitators livestreaming to their followers as they entered the area assigned to the counterprotest.
John – a stocky, tenacious counter-protester from Wales – confronted them with arms outstretched as police officers looked on.
“They come here to cause a ruckus and make money of it online, but I come here to protect the left. These guys [far-right agitators] try and intimidate … minorities because they think they are a master race”, he told Al Jazeera.
As the Britain First march began, flanked by police and led by Paul Golding, a portly, combative far-right activist who has previously been imprisoned for religiously aggravated harassment, the celebratory mood quickly turned aggressive as they came across counter-protesters in the city centre.
“Leftie scum,” screamed one member of the Britain First crowd as they harassed three young people who staged a sit-down, forcing riot police to encircle and pull them to safety.
‘Divisive, racist positions’
The two marches finally met in an expletive-ridden crushendo as police struggled to hold ranks.
Britain First protesters prodded counter-protesters with flag poles, and some slipped through the porous police lines as they shouted anti immigration and anti-Palestine slogans.
A number of counterprotesters and bystanders expressed frustration that the police allowed the march to go ahead.
“We, as Jews and internationalists, are having to confront Britain First, the fascists who are organising on the streets, who have been permitted to market their divisive, racist, dictatorial positions on our streets,” Pia Feig, of Jewish Action for Palestine, told Al Jazeera.
Audrey, a teacher and counterprotester who was pushed away by police after being shoved by a Britain First protester, said the police always “protected” the far-right groups.
A police officer told Al Jazeera that the day required extensive planning and was a particularly difficult operation, as the two groups kept changing their planned route.
He said on condition of anonymity that handling the two conflicting protests, a rally in support of Ukraine, and managing crowds at large football fixtures held this weekend had stretched the local police force thin.

UK royals face worst crisis in generations as Epstein fallout leads to ex-prince’s arrest

UK royals face worst crisis in generations as Epstein fallout leads to ex-prince’s arrest
Expert says family has ‘no clear route forward’ after Andrew becomes first senior royal to be arrested since the 1640s
LONDON (AP) — King Charles III’ s brother was under arrest. Police were searching two royal properties, and news commentators were endlessly discussing the details of a sex scandal with tentacles that stretched to the gates of Buckingham Palace.
So how did Britain’s royal family spend Thursday afternoon? The king sat in the front row on the first day of London Fashion Week. Queen Camilla attended a lunchtime concert, and Princess Anne visited a prison.
The decision to continue normal royal duties was more than just an example of British stoicism in the face of the monarchy’s biggest crisis in almost a century.
It was the opening act of the House of Windsor’s fight for survival as the arrest of the former prince Andrew threatens to undermine public backing for the monarchy.
After pledging to support the police investigation into his brother’s friendship with the late convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, the king stressed his intentions.
“My family and I will continue in our duty and service to you all,” he said in a statement signed “Charles R.,” using the abbreviation for Rex, the Latin word for king.
Biggest crisis since 1936 abdication
The simple fact that Charles made the statement showed the scale of the problem created by the arrest of the king’s 66-year-old sibling, now known as Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor, who was held for 11 hours and then released under investigation, meaning he was neither charged nor exonerated.
The event was so unprecedented that commentators had to reach back to the 1640s and the arrest and execution of King Charles I during the English Civil War to find a parallel.
Mountbatten-Windsor’s arrest on suspicion of misconduct in public office is shaping up to be the monarchy’s biggest crisis since Edward VIII abdicated in 1936 to marry an American divorcee, Wallis Simpson.
That scandal weakened public support for the monarchy, which did not fully recover for 15 years. The turnaround came only after Edward’s successor, King George VI, refused to flee Britain during World War II, demonstrating his solidarity with a nation ravaged by Nazi bombs.
Even before she ascended the throne, Queen Elizabeth II followed her father’s lead and publicly pledged her life in service to Britain.
But while the impact of Edward’s abdication lingered for years, the crisis reached a crescendo in a few days. And the solution in that case was relatively simple: Edward stepped aside, and his oldest brother took his place.
By contrast, the drama surrounding Mountbatten-Windsor is ongoing, with no end in sight.
No ‘clear route forward’
The current crisis stems from revelations about the relationship between the former prince and Epstein that were uncovered when the US Justice Department released millions of pages of documents last month from its investigation into Epstein.
Police have previously cited reports that Mountbatten-Windsor sent trade information to Epstein, a wealthy investor, in 2010, when the former prince was Britain’s special envoy for international trade.
At least eight UK police forces have said they are looking into issues raised by the documents.
Compared with previous royal scandals, “this time there doesn’t seem to be any clear route forward,’’ said Ed Owens, author of “After Elizabeth: Can the Monarchy Save Itself?” “There’s no blueprint to follow” in terms of how the monarchy and associated organizations deal with the allegations.
The last time the monarchy had to manage these kinds of questions was after the death of Princess Diana, Charles’ ex-wife. Elizabeth and Charles were criticized for failing to respond to the outpouring of public grief as tens of thousands of people swarmed to Kensington Gardens to lay flowers outside the late princess’ home. Some even called for Charles to step aside as heir to the throne in favor of his son William.
The queen later commissioned focus groups to better understand the public mood and determine why people felt so strongly about a person they never met. The crisis forced the royals to recognize that Diana’s common touch had connected with people in ways that had not yet occurred to the House of Windsor.
Those lessons have since inspired other royals, including Diana’s sons, Princes William and Harry, to be more informal and approachable.
But this moment is different, in part because it is taking place in a rapidly changing media environment at a time when people are demanding transparency from their leaders.
Family could face uncomfortable questions
Moving forward also means facing uncomfortable questions about what the institution — and the family members themselves — may have known about Mountbatten-Windsor’s activities. The palace has sought to draw a bold line separating the former prince and the rest of the monarchy by stripping him of his titles, including the right to be called a prince.
In another blow for the former prince, the British government is considering formally removing him from the line of succession to the crown. Despite losing his status and his honors, Andrew remains eighth in line to the throne. That can only be changed with legislation.
Charles is the first monarch “that has to meet our expectations of figures in public life, which is to be accountable and to explain yourself,” said Craig Prescott, a royal expert at Royal Holloway, University of London. “And you always have to work to earn the support of the public. And that is a particular challenge when you’re facing a controversy such as Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor.”
Critics argue that the monarchy was slow to respond to the pressure, given that Mountbatten-Windsor’s links to Epstein have been discussed for more than a decade.
The best outcome for the monarchy is for the police investigation to focus solely on the information in the Epstein files and how that relates to Mountbatten-Windsor, said Peter Hunt, a former BBC royal correspondent. The worst outcome would be if police expand their inquiries to what the broader institution might have known and when.
“Were questions raised about his behavior as a trade envoy over those 10 years? Were they answered? What did people do about them?’’ Hunt said on the BBC.
And perhaps there’s more to learn.
“Will there be files?’’ he asked.
If so, we have a request.

What is the rules-based order and is Trump really threatening it?
Unknown

19:36:46 UTC
04:36:46 KST

When German Chancellor Friedrich Merz declared that the rules-based international order "no longer exists", he joined a growing chorus of global leaders issuing similar warnings.
In his opening speech at the Munich Security Conference last weekend, Merz told other world leaders that "our freedom is not guaranteed" and the world had returned to an era of "big power politics".
His remarks echoed those of Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney, who weeks earlier told the World Economic Forum in Davos that the world was in the "midst of a rupture, not a transition".
Carney warned that middle powers, such as Australia and Canada, needed to work more closely together because "if we’re not at the table, we’re on the menu".
"Stop invoking rules-based international order as though it still functions as advertised. Call it what it is — a system of intensifying great power rivalry, where the most powerful pursue their interests, using economic integration as coercion," Carney said.
While neither leader mentioned US President Donald Trump by name, both speeches came amid a widening rift between the United States and its Western allies.
Trump’s aggressive rhetoric about annexing Greenland — a territory of Denmark — along with his use of tariffs and criticism of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization alliance have shaken confidence in the post-World War Two global order.
As Trump issued a new threat to Iran this week, that a deal on nuclear must be reached within 10 days, he raised the risk he will act in disregard of the wishes of the UN Security Council, on which the US is a permanent member.
SBS News spoke with two geopolitical experts who had differing opinions on whether Merz and Carney accurately described the decline of the rules-based order or overstated the crisis.
What is the rules-based order and is it being challenged?
The rules-based order refers to the international system in which countries interact according to agreed rules, norms and multilateral institutions rather than through force or coercion.
Established after World War Two and led by the United States, the system promotes free trade, security cooperation and sovereignty of states.
Tom Chodor, a senior lecturer in politics and international relations at Monash University, told SBS News the US has historically underpinned the system through what he described as a "hegemonic approach".
"Hegemony is a basis for a rules-based order, because you need one state that's more powerful than everyone else but willing to compromise and to offer concessions," he said.
While authoritarian states have long challenged the system, most notably by the Eastern Bloc during the Cold War, Chodor argues it is now the US that is upending the order.
"It's imposing its will on other countries and not offering them much in return if they agree to do what the US wants them to do," he said.
Trump has pulled out of dozens of international organisations and agreements, questioned the purpose of the United Nations and set up a US-led Board of Peace to implement a peace plan for Gaza.
The US has also expanded its military presence near the Middle East in recent weeks, raising the prospect of new strikes on Iran, following last year's attack on Iranian nuclear facilities — an action some experts argued breached international law.
Australian National University professor Donald Rothwell said Trump was not authorised by the UN to attack Iran last year, therefore violating its charter, and also acting in violation of the clause on the right to self-defence.
Russia's invasion of Ukraine has also challenged the core principles of sovereignty and territorial integrity of the rules-based order.
Meanwhile, the rise of China and its expanding global influence have disrupted the post–Cold War era in which the US stood as the sole superpower.
Although middle powers could attempt to uphold the rules-based order without the US, Chodor said that it becomes far more difficult when major powers actively undermine those efforts.
He cited a proposed International Maritime Organization plan that would have required shipping companies to pay a levy on carbon dioxide emissions.
While most countries backed the regulation, a final vote scheduled last October was postponed for a year amid US pressure, including threats of tariffs, sanctions and visa restrictions against countries that supported the measures.
"You can negotiate nice rules amongst yourselves, but if the most powerful country attacks those rules ... that system you negotiate can’t function," Chodor said.
Chodor said Australia was particularly exposed to a "shakedown" from the US through security arrangements such as AUKUS, which will see Australia acquire nuclear-powered attack submarines through the trilateral partnership with the US and United Kingdom.
"If the US suddenly decides that they want us to pay $15 billion into the shipping industry ... we really don't have an option but to say yes, because without that, our capacity to project force collapses," he said.
He said the alliance also meant Australia was less likely to speak out against the US when it undermined the rules-based order, damaging Australia's credibility with other countries.
'More robust, more enduring'
Not everyone agrees that the system is in terminal decline.
Dr John Blaxland, professor of international security and intelligence studies and director of the Australian National University’s North America Liaison Office, told SBS News the rules-based order was more robust than it was credited for.
He said countries continued to follow rules governing trade resolution, international transactions and maritime regulation.
"These are things you can mock, you can say 'it's all over'," he said.
"They're still functioning .... we all have a vested interest in that continuing, even the United States.
"The rules-based order is, in fact, more robust, more enduring, more profound than people are prepared to give acknowledgement to."
Unless there was a global conflict, Blaxland believed it was unlikely that a fully fractured multi-polar world would emerge, noting that countries are more interconnected than ever before.
He noted China's rise, a counter-weight to US dominance, had occurred during the era of globalisation and was underpinned by the rules-based order.
"It has been a huge beneficiary of that order, and has shown no signs of wanting to destroy it," he said.
A day after Merz’s speech, Blaxland noted US secretary of state Marco Rubio's address to the Munich conference struck a far more conciliatory tone towards Europe than Trump’s earlier rhetoric.
Rubio said Europe and the US "belong together", reassuring allies it was "neither our goal nor our wish" to end the transatlantic partnership.
"We do not need to abandon the system of international cooperation we authored, and we don't need to dismantle the global institutions of the old order that together we built. But these must be reformed. These must be rebuilt," Rubio said.
Blaxland described the speech as a "circuit breaker" and could signal the repairing of US and European relations.

BERLIN, February 21. /TASS/. German Chancellor Friedrich Merz has announced his plans to travel to Washington to discuss with US President Donald Trump the situation around US tariffs.
"This is an interesting decision that many had been expecting: the Supreme Court in Washington has pointed out the limits of the administration's powers in matters of customs policy," Merz said in an interview with ARD television after the Christian Democratic Union convention in Stuttgart. He clarified that the verdict does not concern sectoral duties, but rather the general tariff rate.
According to Merz, his talks with the US president will be preceded by consultations with the European Union to elaborate "an absolutely clear European position." "Customs policy is the European Union’s competence, not of its individual member states. I will travel to Washington with an agreed European position," he stated.
"First and foremost, these (tariffs - TASS) harm the country that imposes them," he emphasized. Germany, in his words, is also feeling the strain, as it is supplying fewer goods. "But in the end, it is consumers in the US who will have to pay more," Merz explained, calling the US court's verdict positive news. "The separation of powers in the US still seems to be functioning, and that is good news."
According to the Bild newspaper, the German chancellor will visit the United States in early March. His meeting with President Donald Trump is scheduled for March 3.
he US Supreme Court on Friday ruled that the US president had exceeded his authority by imposing tariffs on other countries under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA). However, the highest court did not clarify whether the US should refund the money previously paid as tariffs. Following the court verdict, Trump signed an executive order imposing 10% tariffs on imports from all countries. The tariffs will take effect on February 24 and remain in force for 150 days.

Far Left protest planned against Buchenwald Memorial on Liberation Day

A planned far-left protest against the Buchenwald concentration camp memorial on the anniversary of its liberation has sparked outrage across Germany, with officials denouncing the move as an affront to the memory of Holocaust victims.
According to a report in the German Bild, citing Switzerland's Neue Zürcher Zeitung, radical organizations are calling for demonstrations on April 11, the day the camp was liberated in 1945. The groups accuse the memorial's management of "spreading Israeli propaganda" and of not being "hostile enough toward Israel."
The protest is being organized under the slogan "Keffiyehs in Buchenwald." Among those involved are the student wing of Germany's Left Party (Die Linke), the anti-Israel group Jewish Voice for a Just Peace in the Middle East and the German Communist Party (DKP).
In statements published by the organizers, the Buchenwald memorial site is accused of promoting "historical revisionism and genocide denial" and of serving as a vehicle for advancing an alleged "Israeli narrative."
The controversy follows an incident last year in which a woman seeking to stage a protest at the site while wearing a keffiyeh, a scarf widely associated with Palestinian nationalism, was denied entry. A German court later upheld the decision. The protest organizers claim the memorial's management is effectively criminalizing pro-Palestinian activists.
According to the report, one of the leading activists behind the campaign belongs to a communist organization that previously expressed public support for the October 7 massacre carried out by Hamas. In a statement issued after the attack, the group described it as a "legitimate uprising by all means necessary."
The remarks triggered widespread public anger in Germany, particularly given Buchenwald's central place in the country's culture of remembrance. Tens of thousands of Jews were murdered at the camp during the Holocaust, making it one of the most significant symbols of Nazi atrocities.
Felix Klein, the German government's commissioner for combating antisemitism, sharply condemned the initiative, calling it "a new low in the reversal of roles between victim and perpetrator." He described the planned demonstration as "a frontal assault on the dignity of commemoration and on the memory of the victims of the Holocaust."
The Buchenwald Memorial Foundation also voiced concern over what it called an attempt "to exploit the memory of the camp for contemporary political purposes," stressing that the site is committed to preserving historical memory and opposing all forms of antisemitism or incitement.
